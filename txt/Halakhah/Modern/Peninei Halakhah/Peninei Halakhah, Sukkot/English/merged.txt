Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot

Introduction

<b>1</b> I am grateful to God for helping me complete this book on Sukkot, thus completing the unit of Shabbat and the Pilgrimage Festivals (<i>Mo’adim</i>). This follows <i>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</i> on Rosh Ḥodesh and the Rabbinic holidays. All that remains is to complete a book on the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i>, the Days of Awe, and all the holidays will be covered. Originally, I thought I would deal with all the Tishrei holidays in one volume. However, when it became clear that I would not finish the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i> material this year (2013), I made particular efforts to at least publish a book on Sukkot. I hope that with the approach of next Rosh Ha-shana, I will have the privilege of publishing the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i> volume. Having an entire book devoted to them should allow me to discuss the laws of repentance in depth, covering both principles and details.
In the current book, I have written at some length about the laws pertaining to Temple commemorations. This is particularly fitting for Sukkot, as it is replete with such commemorations. They include taking the <i>lulav</i> beyond the first day of the festival (5:1), holding a <i>Simhat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (1:10-12), circling the <i>bima</i> with the <i>lulav</i> (5:9-10), and beating the <i>aravot</i> on Hoshana Rabba (6:2-3). Continuing this theme, I included a chapter on the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> (ch. 8), another Temple practice, which in recent times has also been commemorated.
In addition to <i>halakha</i>, I address matters of faith. This focus is appropriate for Sukkot, about which the Torah states: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (Vayikra 23:43). Furthermore, belief is linked with joy, which is a special emphasis of Sukkot. In this book, I write extensively about joy and how to achieve it.
<b>2</b> As I did in earlier books, I start with general principles and go on to explain details. For example, after defining a <i>sukka</i> as a temporary residence (1:6), I spend the second chapter detailing the <i>sukka</i>’s laws. Starting from the general principle that we should reside in the <i>sukka</i> the way that we normally reside in our home (3:1), I go on to detail all the laws pertaining to sitting in the <i>sukka</i> (3:2-14). After establishing the five general disqualifications pertaining to the four species (4:4), I interpret the laws in light of the general principle that to be kosher, each of the species must retain its natural form.
<b>3</b> This volume, like the earlier ones, has a supplemental volume (<i>Harḥavot</i>) with additional source material and halakhic explanations, particularly relating to anything novel. Earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> volumes were written reactively, in response to questions asked by Torah scholars who were studying <i>Peninei Halakha</i> in depth and requested more information about the sources and rationales presented. Therefore, the earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> were not methodical. Sometimes they contained extensive, in-depth explanations, and sometimes just short lists of sources on a subject. Sometimes philosophical elaborations were included as well.
<b>4</b> In contrast, the <i>Harḥavot</i> volume for <i>Peninei Halakha: Sukkot</i> has a wonderful new feature. We were honored to have most of the supplemental material methodically written by a team of serious Torah scholars. With great care and precision, they deftly derive correct halakhic decisions from the raw source material. And, with God’s help, they are home-grown, products of our holy yeshiva in Har Bracha. I am referring primarily to Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Oren Dachbash, and Rav Bar’el Shevach. In earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> volumes, I needed to apologize for the supplemental material being less smooth than the main text; but this is no longer the case, thanks to the division of labor (cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7b). Each writer takes responsibility for his own contribution, while Rav Maor Cayam serves as the overall editor for the supplemental material. This enables various subjects to be treated at length without delaying the next volumes of <i>Peninei Halakha</i>. The result is the glorification of the Torah.
<b>5</b> Instead of beginning with my usual thanks, this time I will reprint the speech I gave in 2013 at the ceremony where I was awarded the Prize for a Torah Work (in memory of R. Zvi Yehuda Kook) by the Cathedra for Torah and Wisdom in Givat Shmuel:
“I wish to express my gratitude . . . (to the Cathedra for granting me the prize). This prize does not truly belong to me. It belongs to my parents – my father and teacher, my mother and teacher – and to Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav and its Rosh Yeshiva when I was there, R. Zvi Yehuda HaKohen Kook zt”l. I do my best to follow in their ways.
“It also belongs to the residents of the settlement where I have served as rabbi for twenty-five years. They have the privilege of guarding our nation and land in a front-line settlement at the top of Har Bracha. Their idealism-infused actions inspire me, while their questions challenge me. It is thanks to them that I have the opportunity to delve into the Torah in order to illuminate and provide guidance for life. The <i>Peninei Halakha</i> series is the fruit of our interactions.
“The prize belongs to all the students and teachers at the yeshiva as well. Studying with them regularly has allowed me to explore in breadth and depth the topics dealt with in <i>Peninei Halakha</i>. Therefore, with God’s help, I will donate the prize money to the yeshiva.
“I would like to mention those who have especially helped me: Rav Yonadav Zar, Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Eyal Moshe, Rav Oren Matza, Rav Oren Dachbash, Rav Bar’el Shevach, Rav Shlomi Badash, R. David Witzner, R. Maor Horowitz, R. Netanel Rosenstein, and all the other kollel and yeshiva students who provided helpful comments. I would like to thank my old friend Rav Ze’ev Sultanovitch, with whom I have had the honor to study and clarify complicated topics for the last thirty-five years. My thanks to all the rabbis of the yeshiva, who look after the yeshiva and its students, allowing me to devote myself to writing books.
“It is also a great privilege to thank the talented and industrious people who facilitate all of the yeshiva’s holy initiatives, not least of which is bringing these books to publication. They include: the yeshiva’s first administrator, former MK Yaakov Katz (Ketzaleh); the notable administrator, Dudu Sa’ada (who went on to run the Basheva newspaper); and the current administrator, Yaakov Weinberger. I would also like to thank board members Yechezkel Amber and Yoni Hayisraeli, as well as those responsible for publishing the books over the years: Shmuel Avital, Alon Ba’al Tzedaka, Yisrael Sa’adia, Shalev Cayam, Yogev Cohen, Yisrael Baum, and Keren Fogel.
“A special thanks to my in-laws R. Tuvia and Penina Katz, and to my dear wife Inbal. She encourages and helps me with my work in every possible way. This includes helping me clarify some fundamental topics, especially those that involve applying spiritual concepts to everyday life.
“I would also like to thank the readers of my books. In a certain sense, they are with me in my room when I learn Torah. They make comments and ask questions. They wrinkle their foreheads when the explanation is not clear enough, and their faces light up when issues are clarified. Often, they appear as specific friends, students, or acquaintances, who I know would definitely be bothered by a given topic. I try to discuss it with them and work it out for them. I do not always succeed, and sometimes the readers I conjure up remain unsatisfied. Yet I have no choice but to write the truth as I understand it.
“That little room is filled with the images of many people. There are ordinary people, who wake up early to face a full day of work, and who would like to know what their mission is in life. There are movers and shakers, who are engaged in developing the world, and who want the Torah to illuminate and elevate their lives. There are children and teens, who have open minds, and who want a clear understanding of the <i>halakha</i>, without complications. There are Torah scholars, who are looking for a central idea that they can trace, in a straight line, from the original sources through the later commentaries, right down to the <i>halakha</i> in practice. There are academics, some who are close to the Torah and some who are far, who want to understand the logic and harmony of the Torah. There are students in pre-army academies, who are searching for the ideals of the <i>halakha</i> and the reasons informing them. There are soldiers and others who are pressed for time, and who just want to know what is obligatory, what is optional, and what is the minimum required in pressing circumstances.
“Women who are trying to understand how <i>halakha</i> applies to them are also partners in these books. Most Torah books are directed at men, so women who study them are left wondering whether the laws apply to them or not. Sometimes I compose a paragraph and realize that women might find it offensive. So, I dig deeper, and often I discover that with a deeper understanding and a more precise formulation, the objections fade away. Sometimes, though, I do not have a good explanation. I imagine myself apologizing shamefacedly and adding, ‘I have no choice. This is what <i>halakha</i> says. We must strengthen our faith that the Torah’s ways are good and correct. What we do not currently understand, we hope to understand at some future point.’
“I also have in mind those truth-seekers among the nations of the world. This is especially relevant now that the books are being translated into many languages and are available to all on the internet. I try to ensure that I do not use formulations that will hurt them, while simultaneously making certain not to change any of the Torah’s truths. When I present the unique mission of the Jews, whom God chose as His special nation, I explain that this is not at the expense of non-Jews, but rather for their benefit.
“I will conclude with a personal note. It is natural that someone writing halakhic works is likely to feel pressure. On the one hand, some wish me to be lenient in order to make <i>halakha</i> fit better with the spirit of the times and the prevailing culture. On the other hand, others wish me to be stringent in accordance with every opinion mentioned in halakhic literature, even one held by only a single Torah scholar.
“There is pressure from those who want me to keep things very brief and deal only with generalities, and pressure from those who wish me to present endless details, as is often done in halakhic works. In my humble opinion, to withstand all this pressure and find the correct balance, it is necessary to have a safe space. Thank God, the residents of Har Bracha and my family members have provided me this safe space and given me maximal support. I do not know if I could have managed without it.
“May it be God’s will that we have the privilege to study His holy Torah in depth, and through it to continue building up the Land of Israel and Jerusalem. May we have the privilege of rebuilding the Temple and seeing the arrival of the redeemer, speedily in our days. May Torah go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”
<b>6</b> I would like to take this opportunity to single out those who helped with this volume: Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Bar’el Shevach, and Rav Yonadav Zar. They are also credited in the <i>Harḥavot</i>, each one for the material he contributed. Thanks to R. Maor Horowitz for his help with editing and preparing the book for publication, and to R. Netanel Rosenstein for writing the index.

Chapter 1



Section 1

<b>1. The Names and Foundations of the Festival</b>
There are three names for the festival which begins on the fifteenth of Tishrei: 1) <i>Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>, the Festival of Booths, after its primary mitzva; 2) The Festival of Ingathering (<i>Ḥag Ha-asif</i>), as it falls during the time of year when the gathering in of the harvested grain and fruit is finished; 3) The Festival (<i>He-ḥag</i>), as it is the festival par excellence. It is sometimes referred to this way without any further elaboration, as we read, “At that time Shlomo kept the Festival (<i>He-ḥag</i>) for seven days” (2 Divrei Ha-yamim 7:8). This is because it is the most joyous and festive of the festivals; it has the added joy of dancing at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> celebration (<i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i> to <i>m. Rosh Ha-shana</i> 1:2; below, section 10), and Israel would offer more sacrifices on Sukkot than on the other festivals (<i>Ha’amek Davar</i> to Devarim 16:13). The special joy of Sukkot will be explained below (section 8).
There are three fundamental and interrelated elements of the festival of Sukkot: 1) The intrinsic holiness of the days (including Shemini Atzeret), which conclude the annual cycle of festivals, and during which we rejoice and give thanks to God for the year’s crops. This sanctity is expressed in the mitzva to refrain from <i>melekhet avoda</i> (occupational work; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 11:1) on the first and eighth days, which are holidays, and in the partial abstention on the intermediate days of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. The sanctity of these days is also expressed in the extra sacrifices that we are commanded to offer on this festival, as described in Bamidbar (29:12-34). 2) The mitzva of the <i>arba’at ha-minim</i> (four species), which adds to the joy of gathering in the year’s produce and of the repentance and atonement achieved during the Days of Awe. 3) The mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, which gives the festival its name, so that every generation knows that God redeemed Israel from Egypt and watches over His people. The <i>sukka</i> also alludes to a time in the future, when God will spread His <i>sukka</i> of peace over us, over all of Israel, and over the entire world.
These three elements are introduced in the section of the Torah that deals with the holidays (Vayikra 23:33-44). In contrast to other festivals, which are each described as a single unit, Sukkot is described in three stages. First: The Lord spoke to Moshe saying: Say to the Israelites: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month there shall be the Lord’s seven-day festival of Sukkot. The first day shall be a sacred occasion: you shall not work at your occupations; seven days you shall bring offerings by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall observe a sacred occasion and bring an offering by fire to the Lord; it is a solemn gathering; you shall not work at your occupations. (33-38)
Second: Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the yield of your land, you shall observe the seven-day festival of the Lord; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day. On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. (39-40)
Third: You shall observe it as a festival of the Lord for seven days in the year; you shall observe it in the seventh month as a law for all time, throughout the ages. You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> seven days; all citizens in Israel shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i>, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God. (<i>Ibid</i>. 41-43)

Section 2

<b>2. The Festival of Ingathering</b>
Sukkot is also called the Festival of Ingathering – “the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year” (Shemot 34:22) – because it occurs when the grain and other crops are gathered in from the fields and brought into homes and storehouses. Thus, the verse states: “Hold a seven-day festival of Sukkot when you gather in from your threshing floor and your winery” (Devarim 16:13, and similarly Vayikra 23:39).
The three pilgrimage festivals are connected to the agricultural seasons during which they occur, as the Torah states: Three times a year you shall hold a festival for Me: the Festival of Unleavened Bread…at the ordained time of the month of Aviv…. The Festival of the Harvest of the first fruits of your work, of what you sow in the field; and the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your handiwork in from the field. (Shemot 23:14-16) Pesaḥ is in <i>aviv</i> (spring), when everything is beginning to bloom; Shavu’ot is at the end of the grain harvest and the beginning of the fruit harvest; and Sukkot is at the completion of the ingathering of the year’s yield. The mitzva of each festival is to rejoice and thank God for the bounty with which He has blessed us. Sukkot, when we finish gathering in the produce of the whole year, is therefore the most joyful of all (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:2; 13:4-5).
These natural processes of this world reflect the spiritual processes that occur in the supernal worlds. Pesaḥ is a time of beginning and renewal, so we left Egypt then and became a nation. Shavu’ot is a time when the growth process reaches maturity, so we received the Torah then. Sukkot is when we finish gathering the grain and fruit into the house, so spiritually, it is a time to collect the spiritual fruits that Israel gained during the Egyptian bondage and the wanderings in the desert – and bring them into the home, that is, into Eretz Yisrael, Israel’s home. As Abarbanel wrote (Devarim 16:13), the primary joy of Sukkot is inheriting the land of Israel. Thus, Pesaḥ celebrates the uniqueness of Israel revealed at the time of the Exodus; Shavu’ot celebrates the giving of the Torah; and Sukkot celebrates inheriting Eretz Yisrael.
Two cycles culminate with Sukkot. The longer cycle is that of the three pilgrimage festivals, which correspond to the agricultural cycles and seasons, and which will begin anew with the winter planting.
The second cycle is the repentance and atonement that we experience during the months of Elul and Tishrei. We do many wonderful things in the course of the year, but by our very nature, we are also prone to sin. In order to complete the year on the most positive note possible, we must repent, cleanse, and purify ourselves from any evil still clinging to us. This is our spiritual undertaking during Elul, Rosh Ha-shana, the Ten Days of Repentance, and Yom Kippur. By virtue of this repentance, atonement, and purification, the good we have absorbed during the course of the year is further refined, cleansed of the evil that has clung to it. This enables us to multiply our joy on Sukkot.
Rav Kook explains that although repentance is tremendously important, as it cleanses hearts and purifies disgraceful actions, it is also accompanied by pain, which causes the dulling of good will and saps vitality. Therefore, the season of repentance culminates with the joy of Sukkot, which restores our will to do good and our bold vitality (<i>Orot Ha-teshuva</i> 9:10).

Section 3

<b>3. The Four Species</b>
The mitzva of the four species is connected to the joy of Sukkot, as we read, “On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:40). The Sages explain that the joy in taking the <i>lulav</i> (which represents all four species) is related to both aspects of the Ingathering Festival – the material and the spiritual.
The material milestone celebrated is the end of the ingathering of all the year’s produce, when people experience abundant joy. To sanctify and connect this joy to recognizing the One Who created and sustains the world, we are commanded to take the four species as a symbol of our gratitude to God (Ramban on Vayikra 23:39; <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §324). The Sages ordained the shaking or waving of the four species upward, downward, and in all four directions, to express our faith in the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything in all four directions. It also conveys an implicit prayer for the upcoming year: May our crops flourish, and may God save us from harmful weather (<i>Sukka</i> 37b; below, 5:4).
The spiritual aspect of the celebration relates to our completion of the process of repentance for the past year’s sins. Waving the <i>lulav</i> is waving a banner to signify victory, for the success of our repentance and our drawing closer to God. The Sages compare this to two litigants who presented their cases in court. At the conclusion of the trial, no one knew who had won. Only after one of the litigants waved his sword did everyone know that he had won. Similarly, each year during the Days of Awe, the wicked of the world accuse Israel, claiming that they have not been fulfilling their mission, do not deserve to represent God in this world, and are not even worthy of preserving. The deliberations are tense, and no one knows whose claims prevailed – until Israel emerges holding their <i>lulavim</i> and <i>etrogim</i>, signifying that they prevailed, that they are God’s children and people. The nations of the world even celebrate with them, which is why we offered sacrifices on their behalf on Sukkot. This is why we were commanded, “On the first day you shall take” (based on <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:2; <i>Zohar</i> I 221a).
The Sages also said that the four species tied together allude to the four types of Jews who must unite in serving God. Their unification sanctifies God’s name in the world (as elaborated in 4:2-3 below) and also leads to great joy. Thus, by taking the four species, we can rejoice before God for seven days.

Section 4

<b>4. The <i>Sukka</i> as Commemoration of the Booths in the Wilderness and the Clouds of Glory</b>
The Torah explains the mitzva to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> for seven days: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God” (Vayikra 23:43). There is a disagreement in the Mishna as to what is meant by “<i>sukkot</i>.” According to R. Eliezer, they refer to the clouds of glory (“<i>ananei ha-kavod</i>”) that sheltered Israel in the wilderness; according to R. Akiva, they refer to the actual booths in which the Israelites dwelt when they left Egypt (<i>Sukka</i> 11b). Both positions can be supported by the verses: Now when Pharaoh let the people go…they set out from Sukkot [i.e., they had built <i>sukkot</i>] and encamped at Etam, at the edge of the wilderness. The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, to guide them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, that they might travel day and night. The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people [i.e., they were protected by the clouds of glory]. (Shemot 13:17, 20-22)
In the opinion of R. Akiva, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> commemorates the booths that Israel built to shelter themselves from sun and rain, reminding us of our humble beginnings, when God took us out of Egypt and led us from slavery to freedom, and when we wandered in the wilderness for forty years, sheltering in temporary booths to protect us from the sun and rain, without houses or inherited estates. By commemorating this, we will thank God for bringing us to the good and spacious land, a land where we could build homes and plant trees. Remembering our humble accommodations in booths helps ensure that the bounty of the good land will not cause us to become arrogant and forget God. Rather, we will recall that all is in His hands; He gave us the strength to conquer and settle the land, to eat its fruits and be satisfied by its bounty (Rashbam, Vayikra 23:43). This commemoration also redounds to the credit of Israel, who followed God into the uncultivated wilderness (Rabbeinu Baḥya <i>ad loc.</i>).
In the opinion of R. Eliezer, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> commemorates the great miracle that God performed for Israel by providing clouds of glory to protect and guide them in the wilderness, as we read, “The Lord’s cloud kept above them by day, as they moved on from the camp” (Bamidbar 10:34). The clouds of glory expressed God’s love for us. Not only did He provide us with all our needs in the wilderness for forty years, with manna, quail, and the well, but His <i>Shekhina</i> also dwelt in our midst, and He covered us with clouds of glory, sheltering and protecting us (Ramban, Vayikra 23:43). The Sages state, “There were seven clouds of glory with Israel…one in each of the four directions, one above, one below, and one in front, clearing the way for them” (<i>Mekhilta De-Rashbi</i>, Shemot 13:21; <i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Be-ha’alotekha</i> 83). They further state that due to the merit accrued by Israel in following God into the wilderness, He enveloped them in clouds of glory (<i>Zohar</i> III 103b).
A cloud both reveals and conceals. On one hand, it is an expression of the <i>Shekhina</i>, but at the same time it conceals the intense divine illumination so that we can absorb it gradually. This is how God reveals Himself to us. First, He radiates a powerful illumination upon us, but since it is too powerful for us to comprehend, He masks it, so the light reaches us in accordance with our ability to absorb it. It is like the sun, which provides the world with energy, but since we cannot withstand its intensity, God created the atmosphere to protect us from its rays. This idea is alluded to in the verse (Tehilim 84:12), “For the Lord God is sun and shield.” (See <i>Tanya</i>, <i>Sha’ar Ha-yiḥud Ve-ha’emuna</i>, ch. 4.)
The <i>sukka</i>’s <i>sekhakh</i> also alludes to this. Physically, it protects us from most of the sun’s light, but it is not completely impenetrable, so that we can enjoy the light. Spiritually as well, the <i>sekhakh</i> protects us from most of the “enveloping light” (<i>or makif</i>) revealed on Sukkot, allowing us to absorb it according to our abilities (below, section 7).

Section 5

<b>5. The Reason for the Mitzva of <i>Sukka</i> – Practical Ramifications</b>
In addition to the reasons for <i>sukka</i> given above – commemorating the booths in the wilderness according to R. Akiva, and the clouds of glory according to R. Eliezer – residing in a <i>sukka</i> also reminds us of the Exodus from Egypt, as the verse states: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (Vayikra 23:43). Not only Sukkot, but every Shabbat and holiday commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, as we acknowledge in <i>kiddush</i> and in our prayers. The Exodus is so important because the uniqueness of Israel, whom God chose as His treasured people and took out of Egypt, from bondage to freedom, was revealed through it. On a deeper level, He liberated our spirits from enslavement to materialism, for Egypt was a materialistic civilization. When we went free from Egypt, our spirits were freed from enslavement to the material, and we were free to accept the Torah (see <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 1:3).
It would seem that, if the <i>sukka</i> commemorates the Exodus, it should be built in the spring, the season when the Exodus took place. However, were we to build a <i>sukka</i> then, it would not be clear that it was to fulfill a mitzva, as during the spring there are people who sleep in booths or tents because they enjoy it. Therefore, we are commanded to reside in the <i>sukka</i> in the fall, to make it clear that we are doing so in order to fulfill a mitzva (<i>Tur</i>, OḤ 625).
Let us return to the debate between R. Eliezer and R. Akiva. The <i>halakha</i> follows R. Eliezer, which means that when we fulfill the mitzva, we must remember that the <i>sukka</i> is to commemorate the clouds of glory (SA 625:1). The Aḥaronim add that we must also keep in mind that the <i>sukka</i> is to commemorate the Exodus (MA; SAH; <i>Pri Megadim</i>; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 1). Some suggest that this is actually what R. Akiva meant – that we must remember the booths that Israel made when they left Egypt (Rabbeinu Ḥananel; <i>Taz</i>). Thus, if we recall both the clouds of glory and the Exodus, in practice we are following both opinions.
Although the reason for this mitzva is explicit in the Torah, as it states, “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (Vayikra 23:43), nevertheless, if one forgot to have in mind that the <i>sukka</i> commemorates the clouds of glory and the Exodus, he has fulfilled his obligation, as long as he intended to fulfill God’s commandment (<i>Pri Megadim</i>; MB 625:1; below, 3:3, we explain that this law pertains to the first night as well).

Section 6

<b>6. A Temporary Residence</b>
God wanted to bestow good upon us, so He chose us from among all the nations, brought us out of slavery, and gave us the Holy Land – a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So that we uphold the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> in this land, we plant trees and build homes in it, eat of its fruit, and are satisfied by its bounty. In the land, we live our entire lives in holiness, thus fully revealing the divine, through body and soul, in all areas of life.
This is why we are commanded specifically during the festival of ingathering, when we celebrate all the produce that grew in our fields, to dwell in a <i>sukka</i>, a temporary residence. We are thus reminded of the fleeting nature of human life, of being slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and of the forty years we wandered in the wilderness and resided in makeshift booths (based on Rashbam to Vayikra 23:43).
Let us elaborate further. Comfortably living at home is likely to mislead a person to believe that the walls of his home can protect him from all trials and tribulations. However, in truth, one’s life in this world is temporary, and even the strongest and best homes cannot protect one from disease, natural disaster, and war. And even if someone survives all these and lives to a ripe old age, eventually his time runs out; it becomes clear that his stay in this world was temporary. And even during all the years when he was privileged to reside tranquilly in his secure home, the tranquility and protection were from God. One who does not live with this awareness is living a lie; he thinks that the more he invests in the frivolities of this world, the more stable and the better his life will be. The truth is that the more he connects his activities in this world to the Source of life and to eternal values, the more meaningful, good, and truly happy his life will be. (See section 9, below, about Kohelet.)
Leaving our secure homes and entering the <i>sukka</i> on Sukkot allows us to absorb all these foundational lessons. It is for this reason that the <i>sukka</i> is referred to as “the shade of faith” (<i>tzila di-mehemnuta</i>). The timing of Sukkot is precise. Just before the winter arrives, and just as we are about to return to our homes for protection from the cold, wind, and rain, we are commanded to sit in the <i>sukka</i> and remember that God is our true guard and protector. “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it; unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain” (Tehilim 127:1).
In the merit of our living in temporary residences which connect us to faith, God will allow His <i>Shekhina</i> to dwell in our midst. He will spread His canopy of peace over us and rebuild for all time the fallen <i>sukka</i> of David (the Davidic dynasty) and the Temple. We will live securely in permanent homes in the good land that God promised to our ancestors and to us, as we read: On that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David, I will mend its breaches and set up its ruins anew. I will build it firm as in the days of old…when the mountains shall drip wine and all the hills shall wave [with grain]. I will restore My people Israel. They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine; they shall till gardens and eat their fruits. And I will plant them upon their soil, nevermore to be uprooted from the soil I have given them – said the Lord your God. (Amos 9:11-15)

<b>7. The <i>Sukka</i> – an Enveloping Light</b>
The mitzva to dwell in a <i>sukka</i> is special in that it sanctifies routine life. When one eats and drinks, converses and sleeps in a <i>sukka</i>, it exalts and sanctifies these mundane acts, turning them into a mitzva. The kabbalists allude to this when they explain that the light of the <i>sukka</i> is an “enveloping” or “surrounding” light (“<i>or makif</i>”), as contrasted with the light of most <i>mitzvot</i> (including the four species), which is an “inner light.” Let us explain further:
The light that radiates from God is above and beyond our capacity to absorb and contain. We can thus speak of two parts: inner light (“<i>or penimi</i>”) and enveloping light. Inner light is the less powerful part, which we can absorb through thought and emotion. The more powerful part, which is beyond our ability to absorb, becomes a light that envelops us; although we cannot contain it, it surrounds us and gives us inspiration that deeply affects our lives.
The inner light allows us to exalt and sanctify the more obviously spiritual aspects of our lives. It is revealed by means of Torah study, prayer, and primarily <i>mitzvot</i> between one and God, which connect people to that which is beyond the mundane; their sanctity is more apparent. From the perspective of the inner light, the more spiritual something is, the higher a level it is on, and in contrast, the more practical and routine something is, the lower a level it is on. The four species allude to this, as we take them solely to fulfill a mitzva (below, 4:2-3).
Through the much greater <i>or makif</i>, on the other hand, we can repair and elevate the material and routine parts of life as well. This great light is revealed when faith and Torah illuminate mundane life: eating, drinking, sleeping, family life, interpersonal relationships, work, commerce, and scientific research. This is the primary mission of the Jewish people: to reveal to the world that God is one, in heaven and on earth, and that even mundane matters are connected to holiness. The mitzva of <i>sukka</i> alludes to this, as everything we do inside the <i>sukka</i> is sanctified and transformed into a mitzva, thus revealing a profound secret of faith (<i>Zohar</i> II 186b).
In this way, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is similar to the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael. Both of these <i>mitzvot</i> envelop us. When we enter into their holy atmosphere, our mundane activities are sanctified. The Vilna Gaon (<i>Kol Ha-tor</i> 1:7) says that there is an allusion to this connection in the verse, “Salem became His abode (<i>sukko</i>); Zion, His den” (Tehilim 76:3). Similarly, as we said above (section 2), the primary joy of Sukkot is celebrating our inheriting the land (Abarbanel to Devarim 16:13). These two <i>mitzvot</i> in particular reveal the special qualities of Israel, for the unique aspect of Israel is revealing sanctity on earth (see <i>Avoda Zara</i> 3b).
These two <i>mitzvot</i> complement one another. The <i>sukka</i> commemorates the clouds of glory, through which the <i>Shekhina</i> was revealed in the wilderness, as we read, “They turned toward the wilderness, and there, in a cloud, appeared the glory of the Lord” (Shemot 16:10). Similarly, we read that at Mount Sinai there was “a dense cloud upon the mountain” (<i>ibid</i>. 19:16), and that when God revealed Himself to Moshe, “The Lord came down in a cloud; He stood with him there” (<i>ibid</i>. 34:5). The reason the <i>Shekhina</i> revealed itself in the wilderness in the thick of the cloud is because we had not yet merited entering the Holy Land, where everything is linked to holiness. After we entered the land, our job became revealing the <i>Shekhina</i> in the land, such that everything we do is infused with the Divine Presence. However, there is a risk that when we busy ourselves with the practicalities of daily life in Eretz Yisrael, we will forget to focus on the holy. God gave us Sukkot as a constant reminder of the clouds of glory, the presence of the <i>Shekhina</i>, and the sacred mission of the Jewish people to reveal holiness within the world of action.
Revealing the holiness of Sukkot and Eretz Yisrael will bring the world to its complete perfection, as it is written: “In all of My sacred mount nothing evil or vile shall be done; for the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord as water covers the sea” (Yeshayahu 11:9). This will also lead to world peace, as we read, “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard lie down with the kid” (<i>ibid</i>. 11:6). A similar sentiment is expressed in the chapter of Zechariah dealing with redemption and Sukkot: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day there shall be one Lord with one name” (Zechariah 14:9). The nations of the world will ascend to Jerusalem and celebrate Sukkot with us. Even items which seem distant from holiness, like the bells of horses, will be designated “holy to God” (<i>ibid.</i> 14:20).

Section 8

<b>8. The Joy of Sukkot – Unity and Peace</b>
There is a mitzva to rejoice on all the festivals, as the Torah says, “You shall rejoice in your festival” (Devarim 16:14). On Sukkot, though, we are to be extra joyful. Therefore, the mitzva to rejoice on all the festivals was stated in context of Sukkot: After the ingathering from your threshing floor and your vat, you shall hold the seven-day festival of Sukkot. You shall <b>rejoice</b> in your festival, with your son and daughter, your male and female slave, the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow in your communities. For seven days you shall hold a festival for the Lord your God, in the place that the Lord will choose; for the Lord your God will bless all your crops and all your undertakings, and you shall have nothing but <b>joy</b>. (Devarim 16:13-15) Similarly we read, “Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the yield of your land, you shall observe the seven-day festival of the Lord…and you shall <b>rejoice</b> before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:39-40).
Joy is not explicitly mentioned in context of Pesaḥ. The Sages explain that this is because Pesaḥ is the time of judgment for the grain for the upcoming year. Additionally, since many Egyptians died then, our joy is incomplete. In reference to the festival of Shavu’ot, joy is mentioned once: “Then you shall observe the Festival of Weeks…and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God” (Devarim 16:10-11). By this point of the year, we already know that the grain has grown, and we are happy about it, but we are still worried about the rest of the produce. The word “joy” is not used in reference to Rosh Ha-shana, because it is a time of judgment for the entire world. But on Sukkot, after all the grain and fruits have been gathered in, and after we have repented and been atoned, we can truly and completely rejoice. This is why the verses speaking of Sukkot mention rejoicing three times (<i>Pesikta De-Rav Kahana</i>, Sukkot; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, OḤ 490:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 7).
The extra joy of Sukkot, then, is an end-of-year celebration, marking the ingathering of all the year’s produce – a material and spiritual ingathering of grain and fruits as well as of everything we learned and all the good things we did during the year. This ingathering is especially pure since it follows the season of repentance and atonement (as explained in section 2 above). The mitzva of taking the <i>lulav</i> also expresses the joy of the material and spiritual ingathering (section 3 above). Thus, we are elevated toward the Source of Life in ecstasy, and we gather to celebrate before the Lord our God. The <i>sukka</i>, surrounding us on all sides, symbolizes the ingathering of all the good things we did during the year. They all come together perfectly and envelop us, bathing us in divine light.
When we gather together every aspect and degree of goodness, even those which seem at first glance to be incompatible with one another, God spreads His canopy of peace over us, and Israel becomes cohesive and unified. For as long as each element stands on its own, there is no unity. But on the ingathering festival, all elements come together, revealing their unity. This is the meaning of the Sages’ statement: “All Jews can sit in one <i>sukka</i>” (<i>Sukka</i> 27b). Similarly, the four species hint at the different types of Jews who come together on Sukkot (below, 4:2-3).
Through the relative perfection that we attain on Sukkot in this world, we will reach the greater perfection in the messianic future, as the Sages said: “Of one who fulfills the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in this world, the Holy One says, ‘He fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in this world; I will shelter him from the intense heat of the days to come’” (<i>Pesikta De-Rav Kahana</i>, Sukkot). This echoes a statement from the Gemara: There will be no Gehinnom in the future. Rather, God will remove the sun from its sheath and intensify its heat. The wicked will be brought to justice by it, and the righteous will be healed by it. The wicked will be brought to justice by it, as it is written: “For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven. All the arrogant and all the doers of evil shall be straw, and the day that is coming – said the Lord of Hosts – shall burn them to ashes…” (Malakhi 3:19-20). The righteous will be healed by it, as it is written: “But for you who revere My name, a sun of victory shall rise to bring healing” (<i>ibid</i>.). Moreover, they will delight in it, as it is written: “You shall go forth and stamp like stall-fed calves” (<i>ibid</i>.). (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 3b)
The Sages tell us that the <i>mitzvot</i> which we perform in this world become garments that will allow us to absorb the great light in the future (<i>Zohar</i> II 210a). The <i>sukka</i> expresses this in our world, as it is the mitzva and shield that allows us to absorb the great light in a manner that is appropriate for us. (See the end of section 4.)

Section 9

<b>9. The Book of Kohelet</b>
Many communities read the Book of Kohelet on Sukkot (<i>Sofrim</i> 14:1), as it teaches us how to celebrate truly. This is very important for people to learn, as we are naturally predisposed to find happiness in the trivialities and vanities of this world, thinking that the richer we are, the larger our homes, the fancier our clothes, the finer our food, the more expensive our drinks, the more exotic our gardens, and the more numerous our staff of servants, the happier we will be. In truth, all these things are merely instrumental; they can help us toward the ultimate objective, which is our spiritual stature, faith, and good character. But when material possessions become primary, it makes us forget our inner wellbeing and values, detaches us from the Source of Life, and leaves us hollowed out, empty, and joyless.
The idea of Sukkot is to experience true joy with all the produce that we gathered throughout the year. We achieve this by reinforcing our awareness that everything that we gathered was due to God’s kindness, and that its main purpose is to help us grow stronger in our faith and moral fiber and to give us the means and desire to help others and repair the world. We leave our secure, permanent homes for the temporary <i>sukka</i>, a place of mitzva and sanctity, and thus return to the foundations of the Jewish faith. We learn that our homes and possessions are tools to realize divine ideals.
This idea is expressed in Kohelet, which clarifies for us that wisdom, wealth, beauty, and other worldly virtues are trivial, “<i>hevel</i>.” Only one thing is important: “The sum of the matter, when all is said and done: Revere God and observe His <i>mitzvot</i>, for this is the entirety of humanity” (Kohelet 12:13). I heard a nice explanation of this from my uncle. “<i>Hevel</i>” means “nothing” or “zero,” while reverence of God is “one” – it is the first among virtues like one is the first number (<i>Shabbat</i> 31b). If reverence of God comes first and it is joined by wisdom, the 1 joined to the 0 makes 10. If wealth, which is also a 0, is added, we reach 100. If beauty, which is also a 0, is added, we reach 1000. And so on. However, if reverence for God does not lead off, then all the other virtues are meaningless, a big fat zero (R. Avraham Remer <i>zt”l</i>).
Kohelet teaches us that joy which is not connected to a mitzva or moral value is unworthy. About this, it is written, “Of merriment [I said], ‘What good is that?’” (Kohelet 2:2). But about the joy of a mitzva, it is written, “I therefore praised enjoyment. For the only good a man can have under the sun is to eat and drink and enjoy himself” (<i>ibid</i>. 8:15). The Sages expound: “The <i>Shekhina</i> does not dwell with someone who is feeling sad, lazy, frivolous, or silly, or who is speaking nonsense. Rather, it dwells with one who is feeling happy on account of a mitzva” (<i>Shabbat</i> 30b).
Some Ashkenazic communities follow the practice of reading Kohelet from a parchment and reciting the <i>berakhot</i> of “<i>al mikra megilla</i>” and <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> beforehand. This is the practice of the students of the Vilna Gaon. Most Ashkenazic communities, however, do not recite <i>berakhot</i> before reading Kohelet, nor are they meticulous about reading it from a parchment (Rema 490:9; MB 490:19; <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 2:10).
Ashkenazic custom is to read the <i>megilla</i> at <i>Shaḥarit</i> of Shabbat <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, before the Torah reading. Most Sephardic communities do not read Kohelet on Sukkot. Yemenites read part of Kohelet before <i>Minḥa</i> on Shabbat <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, and the rest on the last day of Yom Tov. (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 2:10.)

Section 10

<b>10. <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i></b>
When the Temple stood, a huge celebration, complete with music and dancing, was held in the Temple courtyard every night of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> Sukkot. This celebration was known as <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>. The Sages report: “Anyone who never witnessed the <i>Simḥat Beit ha-sho’eva</i> has never in his life witnessed <i>simḥa</i>” (<i>m. Sukka</i> 5:1). The celebration began after the afternoon <i>tamid</i> offering and continued all night long. As dawn approached, an official would make a declaration, and two <i>kohanim</i> standing at the upper gate would blow <i>teki’a-teru’a-teki’a</i> blasts on trumpets. They would lead everyone in a procession descending from the upper gate of the Temple. When the <i>kohanim</i> reached the tenth step, they blew <i>teki’a-teru’a-teki’a</i> blasts again. When they reached the women’s courtyard, they blew yet again. They continued blowing the trumpets until they arrived at the gate which exited the courtyard to the east. From there, the procession continued down to the Shilo’aḥ spring. There they drew water to be used for the libation that would accompany the morning <i>tamid</i> offering (<i>Sukka</i> 51b). When they ascended back to the Temple, they entered via the Water Gate, and the <i>kohanim</i> blew the trumpets once again. All of these blasts were celebratory, as we read (Yeshayahu 12:3), “Joyfully shall you draw water from the fountains of salvation” (<i>Sukka</i> 48a-b). The entire event was called the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (lit. “the Celebration of the Water-Drawing Place”) on account of this water-drawing procession. The Sages further report that the joy of this mitzva imbued Israel’s leaders with divine inspiration. This was an additional reason for the name – “for they ‘drew’ divine inspiration from there” (<i>y. Sukka</i> 5:1).
This joy rested on two foundations: the joy that typifies Sukkot, and the special mitzva of the water libation that took place only on Sukkot. During the year, all offerings, both individual and communal, were accompanied by a wine libation, which was poured on the altar. Only on Sukkot, at the morning <i>tamid</i>, was there a special mitzva of pouring water, in addition to wine, on the altar. They would fill two receptacles – one with wine and the other with the water brought from the Shilo’aḥ – and pour them out simultaneously into the Shitin, a natural hollow space under the Temple floor, through two adjacent holes in the surface of the altar. During the construction of the Temple, they built the altar above the Shitin and left a narrow opening between the altar and its ramp, so that the water libations could be poured into the Shitin (<i>Sukka</i> 49a). The Shitin was in place from the moment of creation, designated for use in this mitzva, to ensure that the water libations reach the very foundations of the earth; all other wine libations could simply be poured onto the altar (Maharsha, <i>Sukka</i> 3b).
The water libations express the uniqueness of Sukkot, in which the sanctity of natural life and existence is revealed – just as the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> transforms natural activities like sleeping and eating into <i>mitzvot</i>. All year long, only wine libations accompanied the offerings, because normally, only the special elevation to which wine alludes can reveal sanctity. But on Sukkot, after the observance of all the festivals and days of repentance, and after the gathering in all the year’s produce, sanctity is manifest in routine life as well, which is sustained by water. This is the greatest, most complete joy, as it incorporates all facets of life.
The Sages tell us that on Sukkot we are judged concerning water and that through the water libations, the incoming year’s rainfall is blessed (RH 16a). We must note that water alludes to God’s great kindness, which sustains everything, without exception: grass and trees, fruits and vegetables, fish and fowl, wild and domesticated animals, Israel and the nations of the world. Usually we are not worthy of ascending to the level of this great kindness, but on Sukkot, after we have completed the entire cycle of festivals and repentance, we become worthy of pouring water on the altar, thus connecting with the very foundations of the world’s existence and thereby opening the gates of blessing to all creatures. The joy that accompanies the drawing of the water is therefore very great indeed.

Section 11

<b>11. The Proceedings of the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i></b>
Large golden candelabra, atop poles fifty <i>amot</i> high, were erected in the Temple courtyard. Each candelabrum had four lamps, and four young <i>kohanim</i> were charged with lighting each candelabrum by climbing ladders to fill the lamps with enough oil to last all night and to kindle them. The wicks for the lamps were made from worn-out pants of <i>kohanim</i>. These lamps produced enough light to illuminate all the courtyards in Jerusalem (<i>m. Sukka</i> 5:3).
The celebration itself took place in the women’s courtyard, which was the outer courtyard of the Temple. Musicians stood on the fifteen steps that descended from the men’s courtyard to the women’s and played a variety of instruments: flutes, harps, trumpets, and cymbals (<i>m. Sukka</i> 5:4). Most of the musicians were Levites, but Israelites who knew how to play would join the orchestra.
The pious and virtuous would dance while juggling torches. Some could juggle four torches, and some could manage eight. They did not worry about their dignity. Rather, they danced, skipped, and jumped at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>, like King David, who danced and whirled with all his might before the Ark of God (2 Samuel 6:16). The Sages recount that when R. Shimon ben Gamliel (the <i>Nasi</i>) rejoiced at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>, he took eight torches in golden holders. He threw one and grabbed another, and they never collided with each other. He also bowed down, planting his thumbs in the earth and kissing the floor of the courtyard, then immediately straightening up. Those present sang songs and praises to God. The pious and virtuous would say, “Fortunate is our youth, which does not embarrass our old age,” while penitents would say, “Fortunate is our old age, which atones for our youth.” Both would say, “Fortunate is one who did not sin, and one who sinned can repent and be forgiven.” The joy of the sages led them to experience divine inspiration. It is said of the prophet Yona that he was inspired by the divine spirit and achieved prophecy as a result of his rejoicing at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 53a; <i>y. Sukka</i> 5:1, 4).
Not everyone who wanted was allowed to dance in the presence of the people. Rather, the greatest sages, yeshiva heads, the members of the Sanhedrin, the pious, the elders, and the virtuous danced and rejoiced in front of the people. Everyone else, men and women, came to watch them dance and hear the marvelous singing (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 8:14). Presumably they could sing and dance in place a little bit.
Originally, the women would stand in the women’s courtyard, and the men stood further away, on the open area of the Temple Mount. When the Sages saw that this led to frivolity and mixing, they instructed that a balcony be built for the women to stand on, with the men standing below them. The dancing then took place in the middle of the courtyard (<i>Sukka</i> 51b).
R. Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was a Levite who was among those who sang while the sacrifices were being offered. He testified that during all of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, the Levites did not sleep in their beds. They sang in the morning, while the morning <i>tamid</i> was offered, then they prayed <i>Shaḥarit</i>, then sang again during the <i>musaf</i> offering, and then prayed the <i>Musaf</i> prayer. From there they went to the <i>beit midrash</i> to study Torah until after noon, whereupon they ate a festive meal, prayed <i>Minḥa</i>, and sang in accompaniment of the afternoon <i>tamid</i>. Right after that, the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> began and continued until dawn. When they grew tired, they would nod off a bit while resting their heads on their colleagues’ shoulders (<i>Sukka</i> 53a).

Section 12

<b>12. The <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> Nowadays</b>
It is customary to hold celebrations on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, in commemoration of the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> held in the Temple. Every celebration held during the festival is a mitzva, as we read, “You shall rejoice in your festival” (Devarim 16:14). These commemorative celebrations, also called “<i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>,” fulfill an additional mitzva by invoking the Temple celebrations and thus hasten the Temple’s rebuilding (<i>Sukka</i> 41a).
This custom has become stronger in recent centuries, as Jews from all over the world began to gather in Eretz Yisrael, and the light of salvation began to glimmer. Originally, these celebrations were held only in Eretz Yisrael, but they spread to the Diaspora as well. As R. Ḥayim ibn Attar (the “Or Ha-Ḥayim”) wrote in a letter from Jerusalem in 5503 (1742): “On <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> we had a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>. I was the one who lit [the torches] one night, and we held a great celebration.” Elsewhere it is recounted that people would dance in circles, holding torches. Similarly, Ḥasidim who immigrated to Israel from Europe reported that a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> with drums, dancing, and torches was held in Tzefat.
R. Yehosef Schwartz (d. 5625/1864) wrote a letter to his brother about the special celebrations that took place in Jerusalem. He described how in the Kahal Tziyon Synagogue they set up a special device that shot water upward during the celebration. R. Yehuda Leibish Orenstein (head of the Ḥasidei Yerushalayim rabbinical court) wrote (in 5633/1872) that the Sadigora Ḥasidim who immigrated to Jerusalem hired non-Jewish musicians to play every night of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> at their <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (<i>Responsa Moharil</i>, p. 8). However, the general Ashkenazic custom was not to light torches (<i>Ir Ha-kodesh Ve-hamikdash</i> 3:25:8-9).
R. Ḥayim Abulafia instituted a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> in the synagogue in Izmir, Turkey, to commemorate the Temple, in which they lit many candles in the synagogue and played hymns for about two hours, with dancing by elders and notables (<i>Ḥayim Va-ḥesed</i> 497:11). Similarly, the Rabbi of Tripoli in 5570/1810, R. Avraham Ḥayim Adadi, wrote that they customarily celebrated on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> nights, following the practice instituted by an emissary from Jerusalem. They sang and danced for two or three hours, with the sexton handing out candles to the dancers. Each dancer began by bowing in front of the holy ark (<i>Vayikra Avraham, Kuntres Makom She-nahagu</i>, p. 123). Some even permitted a mourner to play music at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>, since its joy is that of a mitzva and it commemorates the Temple (<i>Zera Emet</i> 2:157). Some sang selected liturgical poems of the Days of Awe during the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (<i>Yesod Ve-shoresh Ha-avoda</i> 11:14).
Even though there is no obligation to hold a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>, having one is a mitzva. It is especially important to encourage those who are not studying Torah to participate in the celebration, rather than to waste their time (R. Yaakov Ettlinger, <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 661:3).
At the beginning of the celebration, some have a custom to recite the fifteen “Songs of Ascent” (“<i>Shir Ha-ma’alot</i>”; Tehilim 120-134), which have special power to increase water and blessing. The custom is based upon the story that when King David opened the Shitin, the waters of the deep threatened to rise and flood the earth. David wrote the Tetragrammaton on a potsherd and placed it upon the water. The water sank 16,000 <i>amot</i>, and the world became very dry. Then King David recited the fifteen “<i>Shir Ha-ma’alot</i>” psalms, and with each psalm, the water rose 1,000 <i>amot</i>, and the world was once again hydrated (<i>Sukka</i> 53a-b).

Section 13

<b>13. The Jews and the Nations of the World</b>
Sukkot is special in that the nations of the world also have a part in it. The Sages say that the seventy bulls that we are commanded to sacrifice during the seven days of Sukkot correspond to the seventy nations of the world (<i>Sukka</i> 55b). As we have already learned (section 7 above), on Sukkot it is revealed that nothing is not connected to sanctity, so the positive value of the world’s nations is illuminated as well. The order in which the sacrifices are offered is unusual. On the first day we offer thirteen bulls, on the second day twelve. The numbers continue to descend each day, until on the seventh day we offer seven bulls (Bamidbar 29:12-34). The idea is that on the inside, deep down, the root of every nation in the world is good, though sometimes their actions manifest terrible evil. It is therefore necessary to separate the good from the bad. By gradually decreasing the number of sacrificial bulls, the negative forces dissipate until, on the seventh day, we offer only seven, the number that is most suitable for revealing sanctity in this world, which was created in seven days (<i>Ein Ayah</i> on <i>Shabbat</i> 2:7).
The prophet Zechariah teaches us that in the future, Sukkot will serve as a litmus test for the nations of the world. Those who ascend to Jerusalem to worship God and to celebrate with the Jewish people will merit great blessing, as we read: All who survive of all those nations that came up against Jerusalem shall make a pilgrimage year by year to bow low to the King, Lord of Hosts, and to observe the festival of Sukkot. Any of the earth’s peoples that do not make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem to bow low to the King, Lord of Hosts, shall receive no rain. If the Egyptian people do not go up…the Lord will bring on them the plague He inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the festival of Sukkot. Such shall be the punishment of Egypt and of all other nations that do not come up to observe the festival of Sukkot…. (Zechariah 14:16-19)
Our relationship with non-Jews is complicated. Over the course of our long history, they have often treated us very badly; nevertheless, our basic attitude toward them is positive. The Sages tell us, “Woe to the non-Jews, who sustained a loss that they are not even aware of. During Temple times, the altar atoned for them. Now, what atones for them?” (<i>Sukka</i> 55b). A <i>midrash</i> makes a similar point. “Israel said: ‘Master of the world, we sacrifice seventy bulls on their behalf. By rights they should love us. Yet they hate us!’ The verse (Tehilim 109:4) attests to this, stating, ‘They repay my love with accusations, but I continue to pray’” (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 21:24).
<i>Zohar</i> explains in many places that we offer seventy bulls for the seventy nations out of love, in order to increase abundance and blessing for them (<i>Zohar</i> I 221a; III 256a). Even if they hate us, by offering the bulls on their behalf, we ensure that they are too preoccupied with their bounty to torment us (<i>ibid.</i> I 64a; II 187a). Ultimately, though, if they are ingrates and still hate us out of wickedness, the abundance they receive will become a stumbling block for them. Mishlei (25:21-22) attests to this: “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. You will be heaping live coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you” (<i>Zohar</i> III 259a and 24a-b).
The responsibility that we show for the entire world reveals more of Israel’s special qualities. These qualities find expression on Shemini Atzeret, when we experience the special love between God and Israel. For this reason, we offer only one bull then. In the words of our Sages (<i>Sukka</i> 55b), “Why do we offer only a single bull on Shemini Atzeret? It corresponds to a singular nation. This can be compared to a king of flesh and blood who told his servants, ‘Make me a big feast.’ Then on the last day of the celebration he said to his favorite, ‘Make me a small banquet, so that I can enjoy your company alone.’” (See 7:2 below.)

As we have seen (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:11), the Torah commands us to include the poor and lonely in the festivities and to invite them to share our meals, as we read, “You shall rejoice in your festival, with your son and daughter, your male and female slave, the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow in your communities” (Devarim 16:14). These are the guests (<i>ushpizin</i>) whom it is a mitzva to invite into the <i>sukka</i>. According to <i>Zohar</i>, it is also appropriate to invite “supernal guests” (“<i>ushpizin ila’in</i>”) into the <i>sukka</i>. These are the souls of seven righteous people, Avraham, Yitzḥak, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, Aharon, and David, whose light shines on Sukkot. On each day of the festival, the light of one of them shines brightest, and he enters the <i>sukka</i> first, accompanied by the other six.
<i>Zohar</i> on <i>Parashat Emor</i> tells of the practice of R. Hamnuna Saba. Entering the <i>sukka</i> made him happy, so he would stand in its doorway and say: “Sit down, supernal guests, sit down. Sit down, guests of faith, sit down.” He would then joyously raise his hands and exclaim: “Happy is our lot, happy is the lot of Israel, who sits in the <i>sukka</i>!” For everyone who has a share in the holy nation and the holy land is sitting in the shelter of faith and receiving the light of the seven righteous visitors. He will rejoice in this world and the next.
Nevertheless, one must make sure to bring joy to the poor, since the share of the seven righteous whom he invited to the <i>sukka</i> belongs to them. If one sits in the shelter of faith and invites supernal guests of faith but does not give their share to the poor, these righteous guests get up to leave. They are not interested in being hosted by a miser, as Scripture states: “Do not eat of a stingy man’s food; do not crave his dainties” (Mishlei 23:6-7). The table he set for the meal is his own table, not God’s table, and of him it is written: “I will strew dung upon your faces, the dung of your festival sacrifices” (Malakhi 2:3). Woe to this host when the supernal guests desert his table. When our patriarch Avraham – who spent his whole life standing at the crossroads inviting guests and setting the table for them – sees that this person has set his table without including the poor, he gets up and announces, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men” (Bamidbar 16:26). All the rest of the supernal guests then file out after him. On their way out, Yitzḥak says, “The belly of the wicked will be empty” (Mishlei 13:25), and Yaakov says, “The morsel you eat you will vomit” (<i>ibid</i>. 23:8). The rest of the righteous say, “For all tables are covered with vomit and filth without the Omnipresent” (Yeshayahu 28:8).
<i>Zohar</i> further states that one should not say, “First I will eat and drink to satiety, and then I will give what is left to the poor.” Rather, he should first give to the poor. If he acts properly, bringing joy to the poor and filling them to satiety, God delights in him. Avraham says of him, “Then you can seek the favor of the Lord. I will set you astride the heights of the earth” (Yeshayahu 58:14), and the rest of the righteous apply various positive verses to him. Happy is the person who merits this (<i>Zohar</i> III 103b-104a).
We must add that if someone gives charity to the poor before the festival in accordance with his means, he is also fulfilling the mitzva by making sure that they are included in the festival joy. Nevertheless, hosting them in his <i>sukka</i> is a greater mitzva. Nowadays it is particularly important to make a point of inviting people, as there are very few people today who are actually starving, but there are many people who are sad and lonely. It is a great mitzva to make efforts to invite them to join in the celebration.
Many <i>siddurim</i> include a formula for inviting the <i>ushpizin ila’in</i> each day. The traditional order is: Avraham, Yitzḥak, Yaakov, Moshe, Aharon, Yosef, David. This is the custom of Sephardim and Ḥasidim (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 639:8). In Ashkenazic custom, the order is Avraham, Yitzḥak, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, Aharon, David (<i>Siddur Ha-Shlah</i>). Some people make a point of having Torah discussions each day about that day’s guest. Some people, who share a name with one of the <i>ushpizin</i>, make a party in their <i>sukka</i> on the night of “their” supernal guest, setting out refreshments and wine for their human guests, and inviting Torah scholars to speak.

Chapter 2



Section 1

<b>1. A Temporary Residence</b>
There is a mitzva to reside in a <i>sukka</i> throughout the seven days of the Sukkot festival, as the Torah says, “You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> seven days; all citizens in Israel shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i>, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God” (Vayikra 23:42-43). Similarly, it states, “After the ingathering from your threshing floor and your vat, you shall hold the seven-day festival of Sukkot” (Devarim 16:13).
The <i>sukka</i> that we are commanded to live in during the festival is defined as a “<i>dirat ara’i</i>” – a “temporary residence” (<i>Sukka</i> 2a). Thus, a <i>sukka</i> must meet these two basic conditions: 1) it must be temporary; 2) it must be habitable. 
Therefore, if a <i>sukka</i> is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 80 cm) tall or less than 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 56 cm) wide, it is invalid, because it is too cramped even for one person to sit in it and eat. Even if a <i>sukka</i> is very long, if it is less than 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, it is invalid (<i>Sukka</i> 2a; MB 634:1).
Since a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, it does not need four walls. It is sufficient for it to have two walls plus a <i>tefaḥ</i> of a third. This partial third wall must be within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the other walls (as we explain below in section 6).
If a <i>sukka</i> is more than 20 <i>amot</i> (c. 9 meters) tall, it is invalid, because a <i>sukka</i> must be a temporary residence, while <i>sekhakh</i> placed at such a height needs the support of a permanent structure. Note, however, that the main expression of the <i>sukka</i>’s impermanence is the <i>sekhakh</i>; the walls may be permanent, as long as this is not necessary to support the <i>sekhakh</i>. Thus, one may retract the roof in the home and place <i>sekhakh</i> instead of a ceiling; since the <i>sekhakh</i> is less than 20 <i>amot</i> high, it does not need the support of a permanent structure.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Ḥayim Naeh (based on Rambam and other Rishonim), a <i>tefaḥ</i> is 8 cm (3.15 inches), so 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> is 56 cm (22.05 inches), 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> is 80 cm (31.5 inches), an <i>ama</i> is 48 cm (18.9 inches), and 20 <i>amot</i> is 9.6 meters (31.5 feet). (According to <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i> and Ḥazon Ish, a <i>tefaḥ</i> is 9.6 cm and an <i>ama</i> is 57.6 cm.) More recent measurements showed that the <i>tefaḥ</i> of Rambam and other Rishonim is 7.6 cm and an <i>ama</i> is 45.6 cm, as explained in the <i>Harḥavot</i>. The <i>halakha</i> follows this latter measurement, as we explain in <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> ch. 29 n. 1 and the <i>Harḥavot</i> there. Nevertheless, in the text above I use R. Naeh’s measurements, for several reasons: 1) for two generations or so, this was the accepted measure; 2) to avoid any uncertainty, one should measure a <i>tefaḥ</i> generously (<i>Sukka</i> 7a; MB 633:2). According to most <i>poskim</i>, this “generosity” means adding c. 2% (SHT 363:60), which already brings us halfway to R. Naeh’s measurements. Some maintain that the addition should be more than 2% (as explained in the <i>Harḥavot</i>); 3) the main reason to use R. Naeh’s measurements is his <i>tefaḥ</i> is a round number in the metric system: 8 cm. The more precise measurement of 7.6 is unwieldy. In order to make things easier for the reader, it is proper to use round numbers. Indeed, this is why the Sages themselves used round measurements like <i>tefaḥim</i> (handbreadths) and <i>amot</i> (arm-lengths). However, when pertinent, the more precise measurement remains primary. Thus, when following R. Naeh’s position results in a leniency, such as when calculating 20 <i>amot</i> and <i>lavud</i> (section 7 below), I use the more precise (smaller) measurements. Even then, I round down. For example, I write that 20 <i>amot</i> are c. 9 meters when the exact measurement is 9.12 meters (9.6 meters according to R. Naeh), and I write that <i>lavud</i> applies up to 22 cm, when the exact figure is 22.8 cm.</i>
A house with a wooden ceiling is invalid for use as a <i>sukka</i>, because <i>sekhakh</i> must be impermanent, whereas a ceiling is permanent. To make sure that people do not mistakenly permit wooden ceilings, the Sages ruled that lumber commonly used to make ceilings may not be used as <i>sekhakh</i> (as we will explain below in section 4).
Since a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, it may be built on a wagon, motor vehicle, or boat, and it remains valid even during travel, as long as its walls and <i>sekhakh</i> can withstand an ordinary wind (SA 628:2; SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 11). As a temporary residence, a <i>sukka</i> does not require a <i>mezuza</i> (SA YD 286:11).
A <i>sukka</i> is invalid if its walls are unable to withstand an ordinary wind or if its <i>sekhakh</i> is made of leaves or greenery that will wither and fall during the course of the festival. In both of these cases, it is not even considered a temporary residence (SA 628:2; 629:12).

Section 2

<b>2. What Materials May Be Used for <i>Sekhakh</i>?</b>
The <i>sekhakh</i> is the primary component of the <i>sukka</i>; after all, it gives the <i>sukka</i> its name. <i>Sekhakh</i> must meet the following three requirements: 1) It must be made from plant matter. 2) It must be detached from its source. 3) It must not have been processed in a way that renders it susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. Let us explain further.
The first requirement is that the <i>sekhakh</i> must be made from something that grew from the ground, that is, plant matter, like trees and shrubs. Metal, dirt, and plastic, though they originate in the ground, are invalid, as they do not grow. Animal skins are not considered to have grown from the ground, even though they are from animals that were nourished by the earth.
The second requirement is that the <i>sekhakh</i> be detached from its source. Therefore, climbing plants and tree branches are invalid.
The third requirement is that the <i>sekhakh</i> not be susceptible to<i> tum’a</i> (ritual impurity). As a rule, anything in its raw, natural state is not susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, but after it has been processed and manufactured for human use, it is susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. For instance, tree trunks, branches, and even straight wooden beams used in building cannot become <i>tamei</i>. But if they are made into articles (<i>kelim</i>) like chairs or beds, they can become <i>tamei</i> and are invalid for use as <i>sekhakh</i>. When an object goes from being raw material to being a significant article, it becomes susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. Then, if it comes into contact with a dead body or something else that conducts <i>tum’a</i>, it becomes <i>tamei</i>. Once plant material has been processed and become susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, it is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i>, even if it has not actually become <i>tamei</i>.
Fruits and vegetables that are fit for human consumption are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and invalid as <i>sekhakh</i>. However, if they are fit only for animal consumption, they are not susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and may be used as <i>sekhakh</i> (SA 629:9-11).
A straw or reed mat that was made for sitting or sleeping is susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i>. However, if it is made to be used as <i>sekhakh</i> or as an awning, it is not susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and may be used as <i>sekhakh</i>. In a locale where mats are generally made only for sitting or sleeping, then even if one is made for <i>sekhakh</i> it may not be used, because of how it would be perceived (SA and Rema 629:6).
Even though broken parts of beds or other furniture are not susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, the Sages forbid using them as <i>sekhakh</i>, out of concern that people might mistakenly think that these items can be used for <i>sekhakh</i> even when they are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> (SA <i>ibid</i>. 1-2).<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reason offered by Rambam. Rashi (<i>Sukka</i> 15b-16a) explains that the Sages decreed that since the broken pieces came from an article, the prohibition remains. If an item that is rabbinically deemed susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, like a table with no concavity to contain something, a hoe, or a rake, breaks, its fragments may be used as <i>sekhakh</i>, as even when whole they are only rabbinically prohibited, and there is a principle that we do not enact a rabbinic safeguard around a rabbinic safeguard. This is the position of <i>Pri Megadim</i>, while <i>Magen Avraham</i> is stringent. MB 629:10 follows <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> in concluding that one may be lenient under pressing circumstances. AHS 629:5 states that if one’s purpose in breaking the article was to make it valid as <i>sekhakh</i>, it is indeed acceptable. Some cast doubt on this based on SA 629:6, which rules that a mat with a hem was made for sleeping and thus invalid as <i>sekhakh</i>, even if one removed the hem. (See <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i>, <i>Sukkot</i> 1:14 and <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 3:95). <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 13:66 addresses this issue and states the view of R. Shmuel Salant that broken pieces of articles are invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> as long as their prior identity is discernible, but if they were completely altered, they may be used. Thus, <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> permits using boards sawed from crates, whose origins cannot be discerned. <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, pp. 17-18, is stringent. If the original crates hold at least 40 <i>se’ah</i>, the boards may certainly be used.</i>
The Sages forbid using flax as <i>sekhakh</i> once the process of making it into thread has begun, since its natural shape has been altered. Therefore, one may not use paper or cardboard made from wood pulp, since they underwent processing that altered their natural shape. Likewise, cotton wool may not be used as <i>sekhakh</i> (<i>Yerushalmi</i>; Rambam; MB 629:13).

Section 3

<b>3. The Shade Must Exceed the Sun</b>
The <i>sekhakh</i> must provide protection from the sun. As long as the <i>sekhakh</i> blocks most of the sun’s rays, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher, as the halakhic principle that “most is tantamount to all (<i>rubo ke-khulo</i>)” is invoked (<i>Sukka</i> 2a). This is measured at the level of the <i>sekhakh</i>, so even if at the floor of the <i>sukka</i> it seems that there is more sun than shade, as long as the shade exceeds the sun at the level of the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher. This is because, as the sun’s rays descend, they become broader but also weaken, so in truth there is more shade than sun.
<i>Le-khatḥila</i>, the <i>sekhakh</i> should provide plenty of shade, so that it is pleasant to sit in the <i>sukka</i>. At the same time, it should not be so thick that it is like a permanent home. That is, ideally it is preferable that stars be visible through the <i>sekhakh</i> at night, or at least sunlight should be visible during the day. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, however, even if no ray of sun can penetrate the <i>sekhakh</i>, it is still kosher (SA 631:3). If the <i>sekhakh</i> is so thick that even rain cannot penetrate, some maintain that the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, because it is like a permanent home (Rabbeinu Tam). One should defer to this view. However, under pressing circumstances, when it is impossible to thin the <i>sekhakh</i>, such as on Shabbat and Yom Tov, one may sit in such a <i>sukka</i> and even recite the <i>berakha</i> upon doing so.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">According to many <i>poskim</i>, <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is sufficient for the sun’s rays to be visible through the <i>sekhakh</i> (Rashi, Ran, Me’iri, and others). Rambam says that <i>le-khatḥila</i> one must be able to see at night the larger stars that are visible even during the day. Others say that at night, <i>le-khatḥila</i> one must be able to see even regular stars through the <i>sekhakh</i> (<i>Baḥ</i>; <i>Korban Netanel</i>). In cold climates, there are grounds to permit thickening the <i>sekhakh</i> to the point that only the sun’s rays during the day remain visible (Maharil; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i>; MB 631:5). Sometimes people unsuccessfully try to see stars through the <i>sekhakh</i> at night, and they feel bad that they are not fulfilling the mitzva in the optimal way. In truth, however, as long as there are openings in the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is <i>mehudar</i>; the stars are not visible because the area is lit up or because one’s pupils have not yet adjusted to the dark.<br>According to Rabbeinu Tam, if rain cannot penetrate the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, while according to Rosh, Rashi, and <i>Yere’im</i>, it is kosher. The lenient ruling is also implicit in all the Rishonim who do not mention this new requirement. Nevertheless, several Rishonim and Aḥaronim write that it is proper to follow the stringency of Rabbeinu Tam, though under pressing circumstances one may be lenient (<i>Birkei Yosef</i> 631:2; MB 631:6). The implication is that one may even recite the <i>berakha</i>, following Radbaz’s view (2:229) that once a <i>sukka</i> has been deemed kosher, one recites the <i>berakha</i> in it, and we do not apply the rule that “when uncertain about <i>berakhot</i> we are lenient.” This is also the opinion of <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> (7:60) and <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 37. See <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>
If the shade exceeds the sun for most of the <i>sekhakh</i>’s coverage, but the sun exceeds the shade in a small part, the entire <i>sukka</i> is kosher, and even those sitting beneath the sparse <i>sekhakh</i> may recite the <i>berakha</i> over sitting in a <i>sukka</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The shade must be greater than the sun in two different senses: 1) the shade must exceed the sun for most of the area of the <i>sekhakh</i>’s coverage; 2) there must be an outright majority of shaded areas. Some say that one must ensure that there is no area of 7x7 <i>tefaḥim</i> (53.2 cm x 53.2 cm) with more sun than shade, as that large an area is significant and therefore disqualified (Rema 631:2; <i>Levush</i>; SAH). Others are lenient even in such a case (Me’iri; the implication of SA). To uphold both views, one should ensure that the <i>sukka</i> contains no 7x7 <i>tefaḥim</i> area where the sun exceeds the shade, but <i>be-di’avad</i> one may recite the <i>berakha</i> even while sitting there.</i>
Sometimes <i>sekhakh</i> is not laid out flat, so at certain times of the day the sunny areas are larger, and at other times the shady areas are larger. In practice, we determine the status of the <i>sukka</i> based on the situation at noon. If it is mostly shaded, it is kosher; if not, it is invalid. (In some instances, even when there is more sun, we consider the <i>sekhakh</i> as though it were laid flat, and if that would make it so that it has more shade than sun, it is kosher; see SA 631:5.)

Section 4

<b>4. Planks and Mats</b>
A structure whose ceiling is made out of beams and planks is not a kosher <i>sukka</i>. Although the beams and planks themselves could be acceptable as <i>sekhakh</i>, as they are from plant matter and are not susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, nevertheless, since the <i>sukka</i> must be a temporary residence, the ceiling of a permanent residence renders it invalid as a <i>sukka</i>.
So that people do not mistakenly sit under a ceiling of beams or planks, the Sages decreed against using planks that are at least 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 30 cm) wide, as they resemble ceiling beams (<i>Sukka</i> 14a). Nowadays we follow the stricter view and avoid using even planks that are less than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide (SA 629:18; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 49), as it is common to build ceilings out of planks that are narrower than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> (<i>Kol Bo</i> and <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot</i>). However, beams that are less than a <i>tefaḥ</i> (c. 7.5 cm) wide are not used to build ceilings, so they are acceptable according to all opinions – as long as they are not attached with nails or glue. In times of need, one may use beams more than a <i>tefaḥ</i> but less than 2 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide. Certainly, then, one may use a beam wider than a <i>tefaḥ</i> on which to place the <i>sekhakh</i>. One who wants to paint these planks may do so, as paint does not invalidate the <i>sekhakh</i>.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">MB 629:3 states that under pressing circumstances, when the only material available for <i>sekhakh</i> is planks that are 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, one should use them, since they are kosher as <i>sekhakh</i> at the Torah level, and according to the vast majority of <i>poskim</i>, rabbinic enactments apply to normal circumstances, but under pressing circumstances, they do not invalidate the <i>sukka</i> and one may make a <i>berakha</i> upon sitting in the <i>sukka</i>. In times of need, one may use beams up to 2 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide; since they are not too wide, one need not worry that they resemble a permanent roof. This is certainly true when there are only a few beams on which the rest of the <i>sekhakh</i> is placed. (See <i>Harḥavot</i> 4:3-4.)</i>
If one wishes to use a ceiling in the home that is made of planks as a <i>sukka</i>, he must disjoin the planks from their fixed connection and re-place them. Once he has done something to the planks so that they are not a permanent ceiling, they are kosher as <i>sekhakh</i>. However, if the planks were more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, then even this action does not make them kosher <i>sekhakh</i> (Rambam; second view in SA 631:9).
Many people use “<i>sekhakh la-netzaḥ</i>,” which is slats or narrow planks connected to one another with string, forming a type of mat. Some say that this <i>sekhakh</i> is invalid, as linking the slats and planks with string causes them to be considered planks that are more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, which are invalid due to the decree against ceiling material. However, common practice is not to be concerned for this, as the slats and narrow planks are loosely connected and flexible, and do not resemble the sort of planks used to build ceilings.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Many <i>poskim</i> are lenient, including my master and teacher R. Avraham Shapira; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 8:5; <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 6:74; <i>Az Nidberu</i> 2:66. It is also claimed that the string that holds the mats together is susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, and one should not support <i>sekhakh</i> with things that are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. However, the accepted halakhic view is that even if <i>sekhakh</i> is supported by something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, it is still kosher, as is explained in the next section. In addition, as a rule, string is only invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> rabbinically, and many permit supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with something that is rabbinically invalid as <i>sekhakh</i>. Some books erroneously state that R. Mordechai Eliyahu and R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv were categorically opposed to the use of mats. However, in <i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 50:39, R. Eliyahu writes that <i>be-di’avad</i> one may rely on those who are lenient. And at the end of <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i>, the author says that he showed this type of <i>sekhakh</i> mat to R. Elyashiv and he unhesitatingly permitted it. See <i>Harḥavot</i> 2:4; 5:3.</i>

Section 5

<b>5. Supporting the <i>Sekhakh</i> with Invalid <i>Sekhakh</i></b>
Some maintain that just as something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> may not be used as <i>sekhakh</i>, so too, the <i>sekhakh</i> may not be supported directly by something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, so that no one mistakenly uses as <i>sekhakh</i> things susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> or other invalid material. Accordingly, the <i>sekhakh</i> may not be supported directly by iron poles, beams that are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, or other materials that are invalid for <i>sekhakh</i>, such as plastic, which does not grow from the ground. However, even according to this view, it is permissible for the <i>sekhakh</i> to be supported directly by a stone wall, as there is no concern that people will mistakenly conclude that stones may be used as <i>sekhakh</i>.
Although the decisive majority of <i>poskim</i> maintain that the <i>sekhakh</i> can be supported by things susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is good to show concern for the stringent view and not support the <i>sekhakh</i> with things susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. Therefore, one who uses a metal frame for the walls of the <i>sukka</i> should not, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, lay the <i>sekhakh</i> directly on the metal, but rather should lay wooden beams across the metal and then place the <i>sekhakh</i> on the wooden beams. However, one who wants to be lenient may place the <i>sekhakh</i> directly on the metal, and the <i>sukka</i> is still kosher, and he may recite the <i>berakha</i> in it.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">The basis of this disagreement is in <i>Sukka</i> 21b. The Sages permit supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with the posts of a bed, while R. Yehuda forbids. The Amora’im disagree as to R. Yehuda’s rationale. Some maintain that it is because a <i>sukka</i> may not lean on something impermanent like a bed, while others maintain that it is because the <i>sekhakh</i> may not be supported by something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. If we rule in accordance with R. Yehuda and also accept the second interpretation of his reasoning, then it would be prohibited to support <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. This is the ruling of Ramban, Ran, and Ritva. However, according to the vast majority of Rishonim, it is not prohibited. Firstly, many Rishonim maintain that the <i>halakha</i> follows the Sages (R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at, Rambam in <i>Peirush Ha-mishnayot</i>, <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, and Rid), in which case there is no reason for concern about using something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> as a support. Many other Rishonim maintain that the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Yehuda, since the Gemara discusses his position, but they maintain that the first rationale is the primary one. <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> states that according to Rif and Rosh, R. Yehuda prohibits this <i>sukka</i> because of its impermanence; there is no prohibition on supporting <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. <i>Le</i>-<i>khatḥila</i>, it is proper to show concern for the view of Ramban and those who follow him (see SA 629:7), but the <i>halakha</i> is that one may support the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and recite the <i>berakha</i> in such a <i>sukka</i>, as this is the position of the decisive majority of <i>poskim</i>. This is the ruling of SA 630:13. Furthermore, even according to Ramban and those who follow him, the prohibition is rabbinic (SHT 630:60), and we rule leniently when there is uncertainty about a rabbinic law.<br><i>Ḥazon Ish</i> (OḤ 143:2) has a unique explanation of the view that prohibits supporting <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. In the author’s reading, even if the supports of the supports are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, since the <i>sukka</i> could not stand without those indirect supports. Accordingly, one may not reinforce the walls with nails or screws if the <i>sukka</i> would collapse upon their removal. However, even according to <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, this stringency applies only to items which are not kosher as <i>sekhakh</i> on the Torah level. Therefore, planks more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide may still be used as support for the <i>sekhakh</i>, even though they may not be used as <i>sekhakh</i> due to the decree against ceiling material. In practice, the rest of the Aḥaronim do not follow this novel view (MA 629:9; <i>Pri Megadim</i>,<i> Eshel Avraham</i>,<i> ad loc</i>. 9; <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 11; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 25, all based on Ritva, Ramban, and others), nor does common practice. (See <i>Harḥavot</i>.)</i>
If one wishes to be strict and not support the <i>sekhakh</i> with material susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, but he is concerned that an ordinary wind might blow the <i>sekhakh</i> off, he may place heavy wooden beams which are kosher for <i>sekhakh</i> atop the <i>sekhakh</i>. If necessary, he may attach the beams to the <i>sukka</i> even with material that is invalid for <i>sekhakh</i>, such as rope, nails, or plastic zip ties, because these materials are only “supports of the support,” while the supports themselves, the beams, are kosher as <i>sekhakh</i>.
If the concern is that only an unusually strong wind might blow off the <i>sekhakh</i>, then even according to the stringent view, one may tie the <i>sekhakh</i> down using ropes or zip ties, because under normal conditions, the <i>sekhakh</i> will stay put even without them. Their whole purpose is simply to protect the <i>sekhakh</i> from an unusual wind, so they are not considered to be supporting the <i>sekhakh</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>sekhakh</i> will withstand a normal wind without any reinforcements, the reinforcements are not considered to be supporting the <i>sekhakh</i>. Therefore, it is not a problem even if they are made of something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> or that is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> (Rashi and <i>Mikhtam</i>, <i>Sukka</i> 21b; Ritva, <i>Sukka</i> 19a; <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 6:74; <i>Be-tzel Ha-ḥokhma</i> 5:44). If there is concern that a normal wind would blow the <i>sekhakh</i> off, one should place beams that are kosher as <i>sekhakh</i> on it. If there is still concern that the wind will blow off the beams, he should tie them down or nail them to the walls. In this way, only the supports of the supports are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, and this is permitted even according to those Rishonim who forbid supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, as explained in the previous note. Only according to Ḥazon Ish is this forbidden for the Rishonim who adopt the stringent view, and even Ḥazon Ish agrees that, when necessary, one may rely on the majority view of Rishonim that one may support the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. This is proper practice to avoid a situation where an unusually strong wind might blow off the <i>sekhakh</i> on Shabbat or Yom Tov (when it would be forbidden to replace it because of the prohibition of <i>Boneh</i>). If the ropes are only helpful in a case of an unusual wind, they are not considered supports at all.<br>We should add that the decree against ceiling material is not grounds to forbid driving nails into large beams whose purpose is to prevent the <i>sekhakh</i> from flying off (see MA 627:2, based on <i>Tosafot</i>), because only when the nails are used to reinforce the planks that are the primary <i>sekhakh</i> is this a concern, as explained in AHS 629:32 and SHT 633:6. However, when the nails are only in the beams holding down the <i>sekhakh</i>, there is no reason for concern. (This goes against the stringent ruling in <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 629:11 and nn. 26 and 62, that the nails may not pass from the beam to the walls through the mat or slats; see <i>Ha-sukka Ha-shalem</i> pp. 290 and 335, which states that some say that even nailing down the <i>sekhakh</i> itself does not invalidate it.<br>When tying down the <i>sekhakh</i> is necessary so that a normal wind does not blow it off, rope is preferable to plastic zip ties, because rope is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> only rabbinically, and most <i>poskim</i> (even those who are stringent) allow supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with something invalid only rabbinically. See <i>Harḥavot</i> 5:3.</i>

Section 6

<b>6. The <i>Sukka</i> Walls</b>
Any material may be used for the walls of a <i>sukka</i>, as long as it can withstand a normal wind. The walls need not be airtight or offer protection from the sun and wind. Therefore, one may use plastic, glass, or mesh netting (SA 630:1). Stone walls are also kosher, as only the <i>sekhakh</i> must be characteristic of a temporary residence; the walls can be permanent. Indeed, in some places, the common practice is to open the ceiling and roof of a room in the home and place kosher <i>sekhakh</i> there, resulting in a beautiful <i>sukka</i>, pleasant to sit in even in the cold.
<i>Le-khatḥila</i> it is better to build a <i>sukka</i> with four full walls and a door that can be closed, so the <i>sukka</i> is comfortable and provides shelter from the sun and wind (see Rema 630:5.) Technically, however, since a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, it is not required to have four walls; three suffice. Moreover, the third wall need not be full; technically, one <i>tefaḥ</i> suffices. The Sages said that this <i>tefaḥ</i> must be within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the other walls, and the one-<i>tefaḥ</i> wall must extend by means of a doorway (<i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>, explained in the note). Since this law is complicated, someone who wants to save on <i>sukka</i> walls should be advised to put up two complete walls, and a third one which is 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> long (about 56 centimeters). Then, even if his <i>sukka</i> is large, and even if the two walls aren’t connected to one another but rather face each other, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher (Rema 630:3).<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Torah law requires that a <i>sukka</i> has three walls, and there is a tradition received from Moshe at Sinai that one <i>tefaḥ</i> is sufficient for the third wall (<i>Sukka</i> 6b). The Sages tell us that this <i>tefaḥ</i> must be “generous” (slightly more than a <i>tefaḥ</i>) and within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the perpendicular walls, as any gap of less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> is considered connected (this is the law of <i>lavud</i>, explained in the next section). Thus, the third wall is considered to have 4 full <i>tefaḥim</i>, which is the majority of the minimum length of a <i>sukka</i> wall (7 <i>tefaḥim</i>). To extend the wall to the full 7 <i>tefaḥim</i>, one must create a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> – an opening that has two doorposts (<i>leḥayayim</i>) and a lintel (<i>kora</i>), the basic elements of a doorway – that is at least 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide. Some say that the <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> must be at least 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, as this is the minimum size of a doorway. In this view, the third wall, together with the <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>, comes to eight <i>tefaḥim</i> (SA 630:2; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 9-10).<br>If the two walls are parallel, since the <i>sukka</i> that they form is open-ended and flush, the Sages require that the third wall be a little more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> long and placed within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the parallel walls. The <i>poskim</i> disagree as to whether there is an additional requirement to make a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> until the end of that side of the <i>sukka</i> (SA 630:3). Rema writes that if one makes a third wall of 7 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the <i>sukka</i> will be kosher in any case, with no need for <i>lavud</i> or a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>. However, if the third wall has a gap of 10 <i>amot</i> or more, it requires a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> (MB 630:18).</i>

Section 7

<b>7. The Height of the Walls and the Principle of <i>Lavud</i></b>
As we have seen (section 1), the minimum height of the walls is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 80 cm). They must be close to the ground; if there is a gap of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the ground and the walls, the wall is invalid. However, there is no maximum gap between the top of the wall and the <i>sekhakh</i>, as we view the wall as if it continues up to the <i>sekhakh</i> (SA 630:9).<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">There are three principles handed to Moshe at Sinai that relate to the validity of <i>sukka</i> walls:<br><b><i>Lavud</i></b>, lit. “joined,” discussed above, means that we view gaps of less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> to be solid and filled in.<br><b><i>Gud asik meḥitzta</i></b>, lit. “extend the wall upward,” means that once a wall reaches the minimum height of 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> we treat it as though it extends upward in a straight line, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Thus, it is not necessary for the wall to reach the height of the <i>sekhakh</i>; rather, as long as the wall is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high, it is kosher, and we view it as if it continues straight up to the <i>sekhakh</i>. The straight line is measured from the top of the wall. That is, even if the wall is at an angle, the principle of <i>gud asik meḥitzta</i> means that we view it as continuing perfectly vertically. (See <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 71:6.)<br><b><i>Dofen akuma</i></b>, lit. “bent wall,” means that if less than 4 <i>amot</i> of <i>sekhakh</i> at the side of the <i>sukka</i> (next to the wall) is invalid, we view the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> as a horizontal continuation of the adjacent wall – i.e., we view it as part of a “bent wall.” If the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> extends 4 <i>amot</i> (c. 1.8 meters) or more away from the wall, that wall is invalid, as <i>dofen akuma</i> does not apply to <i>sekhakh</i> that is 4 <i>amot</i> or more from the wall. In this case, the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> constitutes a barrier between the wall and the kosher <i>sekhakh</i>. Thus, for instance, in a home where the roof caved in and <i>sekhakh</i> was placed over the resulting hole, if there is less than 4 <i>amot</i> of residual roofing between the hole and the walls of the house, the walls of the house can be considered walls of a <i>sukka</i>. But if 4 <i>amot</i> or more of roof and ceiling remains around the hole, they cannot be considered <i>dofen akuma</i>, and it is necessary to erect walls directly under the hole in order to validate the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 17a; SA 632:1).<br>Can these three principles be applied in combination? When it comes to <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> and <i>dofen akuma</i>, that is, if the wall does not reach all the way up to the <i>sekhakh</i>, and the <i>sekhakh</i> directly over the top of the wall is invalid, the <i>poskim</i> disagree (MB 632:4).<br>There is agreement, however, that <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> and <i>lavud</i> can be applied in combination. If the <i>sekhakh</i> does not go directly over the top of the wall but reaches within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of the wall’s vertical extension, it is valid. In this case, <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> is applied to treat the wall as though it extends vertically to the level of the <i>sekhakh</i>, and <i>lavud</i> is then applied to close the horizontal gap between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the “wall” – the plane extending vertically from the top of the physical wall. However, if there are more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the plane extending vertically from the top of the wall, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, because the <i>sekhakh</i> and the walls are disconnected (SA 630:9).</i>
One can erect walls by setting up poles or stretching lengths of rope within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one another, because in such a case the law of <i>lavud</i> applies: since there is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the components, we treat the entire area between them as being solid. Even though the sun and wind enter through the gaps in the wall, the poles or strings are still considered a wall. It makes no difference whether the string or poles are arranged horizontally or vertically; as long as there is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> between one pole or string and the next, <i>lavud</i> applies. However, some maintain that since <i>lavud</i> walls are inferior, they must surround the <i>sukka</i> on all four sides (MA; of course, a doorway does not invalidate this <i>sukka</i>). If the wall is made from crisscrossing components, like from mesh netting or chain link fence material, it is not considered inferior, and two walls plus a <i>tefaḥ</i> suffice (as explained in the previous section). In any case, the <i>sukka</i> must be fit for eating and sleeping in painlessly, as explained below (section 14).

Section 8

<b>8. <i>Sukkot</i> with Cloth Walls</b>
In recent times, people have begun to make <i>sukkot</i> with metal frames and walls made out of various types of thick cloth and fabric, like canvas, polyester, and plastics (often with brand names like Pe’er Lanetzach and Ease-Lock Supreme). These <i>sukkot</i> are popular because they are cheap to make, easy to market, simple to put up and take down, and convenient to store. However, some contemporary <i>poskim</i> question their validity because <i>sukka</i> walls must be stable. If they can be blown back and forth by the wind, they are invalid.
Nevertheless, in practice, these <i>sukkot</i> are kosher. The Rishonim objected to fabric walls that were not fastened at the bottom, so when wind blows, the walls rose more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> from the ground, invalidating them as walls. There was also the possibility that the wind would blow them away entirely. However, neither of these concerns applies to contemporary <i>sukkot</i>, since the fabric is fastened well all the way around. Therefore, these <i>sukkot</i> are kosher and the <i>berakha</i> may be recited in them. Those who are fastidious may add poles to create <i>lavud</i> walls.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukka</i> 24b states that walls made of tree branches that sway in the wind are invalid, so they must be fastened so they do not sway. Rambam and <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> codify this ruling (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 4:5; SA 630:10). Based on this, some wish to claim that any movement of a <i>sukka</i> wall invalidates the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Mishkenot Yaakov</i>, OḤ 123; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:46). However, this is a very difficult position to defend, as it is impossible to fasten tree branches so that they do not sway at all. Indeed, all of the Rishonim who comment on this passage imply that the walls are invalid only when a normal wind causes a gap of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> between the wall and the ground. In such a case, the wall is invalid even when there is no wind. However, a bit of motion that does not create such a gap does not invalidate the wall. See <i>Harḥavot</i>, which explains that this view emerges from the words of R. Sa’adia Gaon, Me’iri, Rashba, <i>Hagahot Asheri</i>, and R. Yonatan of Lunel. Rabbeinu Peretz (cited in <i>Tur</i> and SA 630:10) states explicitly that only when there is concern that the fabric will become completely detached from the frame is it proper not to use it for walls. Mabit, <i>Tosefet Shabbat</i>, <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Ḥazon Ish</i> (OḤ 77:6), and <i>Melumdei Milḥama</i> (§96) write accordingly.<br>Those who wish to show concern for the stringent view should place horizontal bars no more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (22.8 cm) from one another, up to a height of 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 80 cm). The gaps of under 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> are considered <i>lavud</i>, and so the bars constitute a wall even without the fabric. However, many make a mistake when they implement this stringency, relying on R. Ḥayim Naeh’s view that 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> is 24 cm, whereas it is actually only 22.8 cm. If the distance between the bars is greater than that, <i>lavud</i> no longer applies to them (as we explained in note 1). Nevertheless, the <i>sukka</i> is unquestionably kosher, as the <i>halakha</i> here follows the lenient view.</i>

Section 9

<b>9. The <i>Sukka</i> Must Be Under the Open Sky</b>
The <i>sukka</i> must be built under the open sky so that the <i>sekhakh</i> and nothing else covers those sitting inside. Thus, if one builds a <i>sukka</i> under a roof or a tree, it is invalid (<i>Sukka</i> 9b). 
However, a <i>sukka</i> may be built next to a tall building that prevents sunlight from reaching the <i>sukka</i>. Only a roof or branches that separate between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the sky invalidate the <i>sukka</i>. Anything off to the side, not directly over the <i>sekhakh</i>, does not invalidate the <i>sukka</i>.
If there are very thin tree branches above the <i>sekhakh</i>, while the <i>sekhakh</i> is thick enough that even if the <i>sekhakh</i> directly under the branches would be removed, the remaining <i>sekhakh</i> would provide more shade than sun in the <i>sukka</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher (SA OḤ 626:1).<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Tosafot</i> and Rosh, as long as the <i>sukka</i> is shady enough that it is kosher on its own, without the tree’s shade, and the tree’s sun exceeds its shade, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher. According to Raavya and Ran, however, all the <i>sekhakh</i> underneath the tree branches is negated, and then, if the shade provided by the remaining <i>sekhakh</i> exceeds the sunlight it lets through, the <i>sekhakh</i> is kosher. SA 626:1 cites both positions with the introductory phrase, “some say,” and according to the principles of determining the <i>halakha</i> based on formulations of <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>, we follow the second position, which in our case is the stringent one. Indeed, BHL (s.v. “ve-yesh omrim”) rules accordingly but adds that according to Aḥaronim, in pressing circumstances one may rely on the lenient view (<i>Eliya Rabba</i> 626:5; <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> <i>ad loc.</i> 4; SAH <i>ad loc.</i> 10).<br>If a <i>sukka</i> is adjacent to a tree whose branches sway over the <i>sukka</i> when wind blows, it is kosher, even if the shade provided by the branches above the <i>sukka</i> when the wind blows exceeds the sunlight they let through, since the branches are not permanently above the <i>sukka</i> (Maharsham, <i>Da’at Torah</i> 626:3). R. Zvi Pesaḥ Frank (<i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> 1:23) is uncertain about this. Therefore, <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is preferable to cut off these branches; see the <i>Harḥavot</i>. In contrast, while a helicopter or hot air balloon is hovering over a <i>sukka</i>, it is invalidated, because they do not sway randomly with the wind but are intentionally guided there by people (<i>Da’at Torah</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>). Once they fly away, the <i>sukka</i> is once again kosher, in line with what Rema writes (626:3).</i>
One may build a <i>sukka</i> underneath clotheslines or electric wires. Since they are very thin, provide very little shade, and are not meant to provide shade, they do not invalidate the <i>sekhakh</i> beneath them.

Section 10

<b>10. Sitting in the Shade of the <i>Sekhakh</i> (the Status of Decorations and Canopies)</b>
To fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, one must sit in the shade of kosher <i>sekhakh</i>. Therefore, one who spreads a sheet under the <i>sekhakh</i> to provide additional shade has invalidated the <i>sukka</i> (SA 629:19). However, one may sit in the <i>sukka</i> wearing a wide-brimmed hat, since the hat is secondary to his body and therefore not considered a barrier between him and the <i>sekhakh</i>.
One may hang fruits and paper decorations from the <i>sekhakh</i>, because they are secondary to the <i>sekhakh</i> and thus are not considered a barrier between the people sitting in the <i>sukka</i> and the <i>sekhakh</i>. This is on condition that the decorations are within 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 30 cm) of the <i>sekhakh</i>. Even if decorations cover all the <i>sekhakh</i>, as long as they are within 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> of it, they are secondary to it and do not invalidate it. If one mistakenly put up a decoration that hangs more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> from the <i>sekhakh</i>, he has not invalidated the <i>sekhakh</i> as long as the decoration is less than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide. Nevertheless, if it is between 3 and 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, it is better not to sit under it. If it is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide (d. 22 cm), one may even sit under it (MB 632:3). Nevertheless, <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should hang all decorations within 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> of the <i>sekhakh</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">If the decorations are more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> away from the <i>sekhakh</i>, according to most Amora’im they constitute a barrier between the people and the <i>sekhakh</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 10b)<i>,</i> and this is the ruling in SA 629:19 and 627:4. However, Rishonim disagree as to why this invalidates the <i>sekhakh</i>. <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, Raavya, and Me’iri say it is because this a shelter under a shelter, or <i>sekhakh</i> under <i>sekhakh</i>. Accordingly, only decorations more than 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide and that provide more shade than sun invalidate the <i>sekhakh</i>. In contrast, Ramban, Raavad, and Rosh explain that low-hanging decorations invalidate the <i>sekhakh</i> because they are considered invalid <i>sekhakh.</i> (As we will see in section 11, one may not sit beneath 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> of invalid <i>sekhakh</i>.) There is a further subdivision within this approach. According to Ran, even if the shade provided by the decorations is not greater than the sunny area, decorations which hang down more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> invalidate the space beneath them. In contrast, Ra’ah maintains that they invalidate it only if the shade they provide is greater than the sunny area. (See MB 627:11 and <i>Birur Halakha</i> on<i> Sukka</i> 10b.)<br>Based on this, any decoration less than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide certainly does not invalidate the <i>sekhakh</i>, and technically it is not prohibited (MB 627:15). However, <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should not sit underneath it. If it is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, then one may sit under it even <i>le-khatḥila</i> (MB 632:3). But ideally one should make sure all the decorations hang within 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> of the <i>sekhakh</i> (Rema 627:4). See <i>Harḥavot</i> 10:4-5.</i>
If one sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> in a bed with a fixed canopy, he has not fulfilled the mitzva. If the canopy is temporary, then if it is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high, it is not deemed significant and is negated by the <i>sukka</i>, so one who sleeps under it fulfills the mitzva. But if it is higher than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> it is deemed significant, and one who sleeps under it does not fulfill the mitzva.
The same rule applies to one who sleeps under a bed or table in the <i>sukka</i>. Since the space beneath them is incidental to the purpose of the bed or table, it is considered impermanent, so if that space is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (76 cm) high, one who sleeps there fulfills the mitzva; if the space is higher than that, he does not.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">See SA 627:1-3 and MB <i>ad loc</i>. 7. In sum, there are three relevant conditions for determining what is considered an <i>ohel</i> (tent) such that one sitting in it is not considered to be sitting in the <i>sukka</i>: It is 1) permanent; 2) 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high; and 3) has a “roof” of at least one <i>tefaḥ</i> square. (The third condition is almost always met, because even if the top is sloped, as long as it is not so steeply sloped that it tapers 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> vertically before it reaches a width of one <i>tefaḥ</i> square, it is considered a roof of one square <i>tefaḥ</i>.)<br>Any <i>ohel</i> that meets two of these criteria constitutes a barrier to sitting in a <i>sukka</i>. For instance, if one sleeps under a bed in the <i>sukka</i>, since the bed is not meant to provide space underneath it, this space is deemed impermanent. Nevertheless, if it is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high, it meets two criteria: a <i>tefaḥ</i>-square roof and a height of 10 <i>tefaḥim</i>. Thus, it is a barrier to sitting in the <i>sukka</i>. However, if it is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high, then only one criterion is met, and one may sleep under this bed.</i> 
This also applies to a bunk bed: If the space between the two beds is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the person sleeping in the lower bed does not fulfill the mitzva. If the space is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i>, he does.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">The 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> are measured from the surface above which the <i>ohel</i> stands. Thus, if a tent is positioned on the floor of the <i>sukka</i>, then even if there are less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> between a bed brought into the tent and the roof of the tent, one who sleeps there does not fulfill the mitzva. (See MB 627:5; SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 11.) If one sleeps on a mattress under a table, the measurement is done from the floor to the underside of the table. The mattress is not considered to be the floor of the <i>sukka</i>.<br><b>A bunk bed</b>: If the two beds are separated by less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the person sleeping in the bottom bunk fulfills the mitzva; the person sleeping on the top bunk is not considered a barrier between him and the <i>sekhakh</i> (R. Mordechai Eliyahu; <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 7:36, 10:87:2; <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 627:3 n. 6; contra <i>Kinyan Torah</i> 5:1). Further study is required to decide whether this 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> is measured from the bottom mattress or from the board on which it rests. It seems more plausible to say that one measures from the mattress, because it is an integral part of the bed. The possibility has also been raised of measuring from the floor (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach). However, this is surprising, since the legs of the upper bunk rest upon those of the lower, not on the floor. In any case, it is clear that those who permit sleeping on the lower bunk do not measure from the floor, as the distance between the floor and the upper bunk would certainly be more than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i>.</i>

Section 11

<b>11. Invalid <i>Sekhakh</i> and Gaps in the <i>Sekhakh</i></b>
If there is a patch of invalid <i>sekhakh</i>, made of plastic, for example, in the middle of kosher <i>sekhakh</i>, or if there is a concrete beam that invalidates the <i>sekhakh</i> underneath it, then if the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> is wider than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 30 cm), one may not sit underneath it. If the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> is less than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> but more than 3 (c. 22 cm), <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should not sit or sleep underneath it, but in a time of need one may do so (MB 632:3). If the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, one may eat or sleep there even <i>le-khatḥila</i>, because it is rendered null vis-à-vis the <i>sukka</i>.
If there is an empty gap in the <i>sekhakh</i>, the laws pertaining to it are more stringent, since this is more discernible than invalid <i>sekhakh</i>. If the width of the gap is 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm), the area beneath it is not kosher, and one may not sit there. If it is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, it is rendered null vis-à-vis the <i>sukka</i>, and one may sit and sleep there (SA 632:2) as long as neither most of his head nor most of his body are underneath the gap.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbeinu Ḥananel, R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at, <i>Tosafot</i>, and Ra’ah, even <i>le-khatḥila</i> one may sit underneath a gap of less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>. According to Ritva and Ran, one may not have the majority of his head or body under the gap. According to Rosh and Rabbeinu Yeruḥam, the prohibition applies only when the gap extends the length of the <i>sukka</i>; this is the ruling of <i>Beit Zevul</i> 3:14 and <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 68. I write above to be stringent, but one who wishes to be lenient and follow the Rosh may do so. See <i>Harḥavot</i>.<br>If a gap of 3 or 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> of invalid <i>sekhakh</i> extends across the <i>sukka</i>, effectively dividing it into two <i>sukkas</i>, one must make sure that each <i>sukka</i> has the requisite three walls (Rema 632:2).<br>Four <i>tefaḥim</i> of invalid <i>sekhakh</i> invalidates a large <i>sukka</i>, but if a <i>sukka</i> is less than 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, even 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of invalid <i>sekhakh</i> invalidates it. Less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> does not invalidate it (SA 632:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 8).</i>
Let us say that one has a large porch, most of which is roofed, but with a small area, 5 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, under open sky. At first glance, it would seem that there is no way to build a <i>sukka</i> there, as a kosher <i>sukka</i> must be at least 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide. However, we have seen that invalid <i>sekhakh</i> that is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide is considered part of the <i>sukka</i>, and a person may sit underneath it. A <i>sukka</i> can therefore be built on such a porch, as follows: A <i>sukka</i> 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide should be set up at the end of the porch. Since 5 <i>tefaḥim</i> of <i>sekhakh</i> are under open sky and less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> are under the roof and invalid, then even those 2 <i>tefaḥim</i> are deemed part of the <i>sukka</i>, and one may sit and sleep beneath them. This is on condition that he puts up a wall separating the 2 <i>tefaḥim</i> of the roofed porch that will be part of the <i>sukka</i> from the rest of the porch that will not. This wall must be 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> long and preferably should reach the <i>sekhakh</i>. One should make a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> along the rest of the border between the <i>sukka</i> and the porch. (See <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 12;<i> Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 6:60:20; <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 10:99.)

Section 12

<b>12. Intention When Building a <i>Sukka</i></b>
It is a mitzva to engage in building a <i>sukka</i>. According to the Sages of the Yerushalmi, one even recites a <i>berakha</i> upon doing so: “Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to make a <i>sukka</i>” (“<i>la’asot sukka</i>” – <i>y. Berakhot</i> 9:3; <i>y. Sukka</i> 1:2). However, in practice we follow the ruling of the Bavli and recite a <i>berakha</i> on the mitzva when we fulfill it, namely, when we sit in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 42a; SA 641:1).
Nevertheless, putting up a <i>sukka</i> clearly involves a mitzva element. The pious and virtuous would hurry to begin building the <i>sukka</i> right after Yom Kippur, so as to go directly from one mitzva to the next. They try to finish it by the next day, for when one has an opportunity to do a mitzva, he should make sure not to miss out (Maharil; Rema 624:5, 625:1).
According to Beit Shammai, one must build a <i>sukka</i> with the intention to fulfill the mitzva of the festival with it, as we read, “You shall hold (<i>ta’aseh</i>, lit. ‘make’) the seven-day festival of Sukkot” (Devarim 16:13). Without such intent, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid. However, the <i>halakha</i> follows Beit Hillel’s view that one need not put up the <i>sukka</i> specifically for the mitzva of the festival. Rather, as long as he built it to provide shade, it is kosher. Therefore, a <i>sukka</i> built by shepherds or guards to protect themselves from the sun is kosher, as is a <i>sukka</i> made by a non-Jew to provide himself with shade (<i>Sukka</i> 8a-b; SA 635:1). However, the Sages say that if a <i>sukka</i> was not built for the mitzva of the festival, <i>le-khatḥila</i> something should be added to it before the festival. For example, one could add a square <i>tefaḥ</i> of <i>sekhakh</i> or a strip of <i>sekhakh</i> that extends the length of the <i>sukka</i> (Yerushalmi; MB 636:4). The same applies to an “old <i>sukka</i>” – a <i>sukka</i> from a previous year that was never taken down. Technically it is kosher, but since it was put up for a previous year, it does not count as having been put up for this year’s mitzva. Therefore, <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should add either a square <i>tefaḥ</i> or a strip of <i>sekhakh</i> along its length (SA 636:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 7).<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Yerushalmi, there is a mitzva to build a <i>sukka</i>, as one must recite the <i>berakha</i>: “Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to build a <i>sukka</i>” (“<i>la’asot sukka</i>”). Indeed, <i>She’iltot</i>, <i>Ve-zot Ha-berakha</i> §189 concurs (as is explained in the <i>She’iltot</i> commentary <i>Ha’amek She’ala</i>). However, many maintain that building a <i>sukka</i> is only a preparation for performing the mitzva. This is implied by the Bavli, which maintains that no <i>berakha</i> is recited upon putting it up. It is also implied by Beit Hillel, who do not require intention when building it. (See BHL 656, end of s.v. “afilu”; <i>Responsa Rashbash</i> §334.) The Yerushalmi also states that if a <i>sukka</i> was not built for the purpose of the mitzva, there is a mitzva to add something to it. <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> 1:43 explains that the Yerushalmi’s reason is that it is a mitzva to put up a <i>sukka,</i> and by adding something he participates in the mitzva of putting up the <i>sukka</i>. This is the practical ruling, as we state above. It thus emerges that all agree that there is an element of mitzva in building a <i>sukka</i>.<br>The halakha is that a <i>sukka</i> put up by a non-Jew or a woman is kosher (<i>Sukka</i> 8a-b; SA 14:1, 635:1). Despite this, some say that <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should be fastidious and have it built by a male Jew over the age of 13 (deferring to Rabbeinu Tam, who maintains that only one who is obligated in the mitzva may put up the <i>sukka</i>). This is the position of <i>Magen Avraham</i> 14:3, <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 635:2, and <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> 1:43. However, the widely accepted position is that a <i>sukka</i> put up by a non-Jew or a woman is kosher even <i>le-khatḥila</i>.</i>
If a <i>sukka</i> was put up to provide privacy, it is invalid since it was not intended for shade. Similarly, if one put up a <i>sukka</i> to serve as his permanent home, it is invalid even if the roof is made of kosher <i>sekhakh</i>, since it is not a temporary residence. One who wants to use such a <i>sukka</i> for the mitzva would have to remove all of the <i>sekhakh</i> and replace it while having the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in mind.

Section 13

<b>13. Building Directly and a Stolen or Borrowed <i>Sukka</i></b>
If one hollows out a haystack to make a <i>sukka</i>, even though the hay is kosher <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid because of the principle of “‘<i>ta’aseh</i>’ – <i>ve-lo min he-asui</i>” (“‘you shall make’ – not something ready-made”). That is, one must make the <i>sukka</i> by laying the <i>sekhakh</i>, and it cannot be made indirectly by hollowing out the area under the kosher <i>sekhakh</i>.
The principle of “‘<i>ta’aseh</i>’ – <i>ve-lo min he-asui</i>” dictates the procedure for building the <i>sukka</i>: One must build the walls first and only then lay the <i>sekhakh</i>. If he reversed the sequence and put up the <i>sekhakh</i> first, according to many <i>poskim</i> the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, because the <i>sukka</i> must be “made,” i.e., completed, by putting up <i>sekhakh</i>, and if one put up the <i>sekhakh</i> first, it is the building of the walls that completes the <i>sukka</i>.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">If one put up the <i>sekhakh</i> before the walls, some consider the <i>sukka</i> invalid (Maharil; Rema 635:1; <i>Levush</i>; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 10; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 2, Ha’azinu). Others rule it kosher (<i>Baḥ</i>; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>; <i>Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>; AHS <i>ad loc.</i> 5; <i>Ḥazon</i> <i>Ovadia</i>, p. 38). One should be strict due to this uncertainty. If one first put up small, <i>tefaḥ</i>-high walls close to the <i>sekhakh</i> and reaching the minimum requisite length of three kosher walls, and then put up the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher, since he started building the walls before putting up the <i>sekhakh</i>. A height of one <i>tefaḥ</i> is the smallest size that qualifies as an <i>ohel</i>, as we derive from the discussion of the haystack in <i>Sukka</i> 16a.</i>
An awning or tarp may be placed above the <i>sukka</i> such that it can be spread over the <i>sukka</i> when it rains and removed when it stops raining, so that all can enter a dry <i>sukka</i>. While the tarp is spread, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, as the tarp constitutes a barrier between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the sky. Once the tarp is removed, though, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher again. However, if the <i>sukka</i> was built while the tarp or awning was spread above it, many maintain that the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, because a <i>sukka</i> must be made kosher by placing <i>sekhakh</i>, not by removing a tarp or awning (<i>Baḥ</i>; MB 626:18; Rema 626:3 is lenient).
One may fulfill the mitzva with a borrowed <i>sukka</i>, which one has permission to use (<i>Sukka</i> 27b; SA 637:2). If the owner of a <i>sukka</i> is away, and there is no way to obtain his permission to use his <i>sukka</i>, one may nevertheless sit in this <i>sukka</i>, because the Sages assume that a Jew is pleased when his property is used to perform a mitzva. However, if it is known that the owner is careful about who he allows in his <i>sukka</i>, or if there is concern that the owner will return, be too embarrassed to enter the <i>sukka</i> when he sees strangers sitting there, and be upset that they are in his <i>sukka</i>, then one may not use the <i>sukka</i> without explicit permission (<i>Taz ad loc.</i> 4; <i>Bikurei Yaakov ad loc.</i> 4; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 9).
One may not build a <i>sukka</i> on private property without the owner’s permission, nor may one build it on public property if the public or its representatives oppose it. If one nevertheless builds a <i>sukka</i> in such a place and sits in it, he may not recite the <i>berakha</i>, for this is not a blessing, but blasphemy, as the <i>sukka</i> was built through transgression.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">If one builds a <i>sukka</i> on another’s or on public property (such that it is a nuisance to passersby, and the public and its representatives would certainly forbid building a <i>sukka</i> there), he has fulfilled his obligation <i>be-di’avad</i>, since he has not actually stolen anything; the space remains in the possession of its owner or the public. However, since building and staying in the <i>sukka</i> are prohibited, he may not recite the <i>berakha</i> (SA 637:3; MA <i>ad loc.</i> 1; SAH <i>ad loc.</i> 11). In the margins of public property or in a place where a <i>sukka</i> barely bothers passersby, once may build a <i>sukka</i> (as is the accepted practice in many places), because as long as no one objects, we presume that they accept what he has done (BHL 637:3 s.v. “ve-khen”).<br>If one steals a <i>sukka</i> that had been put up in a wagon, and he sits in it, he has not fulfilled his obligation; since the <i>sukka</i> is not attached to the ground, it can be halakhically "stolen", and one does not fulfill his obligation in a stolen <i>sukka</i>. One who stole wood and used it to build a <i>sukka</i> can fulfill the mitzva in it and recite the <i>berakha</i>, even though he has violated a prohibition. This is because of the Sages’ enactment (to ease the path of those who seek to make restitution) that one who steals wood and builds it into a house must repay its value but need not demolish his home to return the original wood. That is, the Sages deem the wood to be the thief’s property, with no connection to the original owner. Consequently, one fulfills the mitzva with, and may even recite the <i>berakha</i> on, a <i>sukka</i> of stolen wood (<i>Sukka</i> 31a; SA 637:3; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 15).</i>

Section 14

<b>14. How Much Effort to Invest in a <i>Sukka</i></b>
Since the <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, living in it will naturally not be as comfortable as living at home. Indeed, this is the mitzva – to reside in a temporary residence for the week of Sukkot. Therefore, we are not commanded to build impermeable, insulated, thick walls and <i>sekhakh</i> to protect its residents from cold, heat, and rain (as we would do in our normal homes). As a result, sometimes being in the <i>sukka</i> entails discomfort, in which case one is exempt, for one who is experiencing discomfort (a “<i>mitzta’er</i>”) is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (3:8-10 below). Thus, when it is very hot, or during very cold nights, or when it is raining, one is exempt from sitting in the <i>sukka</i>. A sick person for whom sitting in the <i>sukka</i> causes discomfort is exempt from sitting in the <i>sukka</i> and has no obligation to build a spacious, robust <i>sukka</i> so that he can remain there while experiencing the comforts of home (<i>Maharaḥ Or Zaru’a</i> §194).
However, one who was lax about building his <i>sukka</i>, so that he experiences discomfort in it even in normal weather, has not fulfilled the mitzva; it has become clear in hindsight that he failed to build a <i>sukka</i> that is worthy as a temporary residence, for even under normal conditions he experiences discomfort in it. One who knows that he can stay in a small, rickety <i>sukka</i> without experiencing discomfort may build such a <i>sukka</i> and fulfill the mitzva, as long as he resolves not to claim in the middle of Sukkot that he is <i>mitzta’er</i> because the <i>sukka</i> is too small or rickety. (See <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 640:13; MB 640:24.)
According to many, if one built a <i>sukka</i> that is not fit to sleep in – for instance, if it is in a windy place, and he built walls made of screens, so the wind and cold penetrate – then the <i>sukka</i> is invalid for eating as well. Likewise, if he built the <i>sukka</i> in a bad neighborhood where criminals roam around at night, making it dangerous to sleep there, then the <i>sukka</i> is invalid for eating as well. This is because the mitzva is to build a <i>sukka</i> that will serve as a temporary residence, for eating and sleeping, and since his <i>sukka</i> is not fit for sleeping, it is not considered a residence, so it is invalid for eating as well (<i>Yere’im</i>; Rema 640:4). Others say that even a <i>sukka</i> unfit for sleeping is kosher for eating; even though he sinned by building a <i>sukka</i> unfit for sleeping, since it is fit for eating in, it can be used to fulfill the mitzva of eating in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Ḥakham Tzvi</i>). If one builds a normal <i>sukka</i> that is fit for sleeping in Eretz Yisrael, but he cannot sleep there because he lives in a cold climate, all agree that it is kosher, as the Torah does not obligate us to build a permanent structure as a <i>sukka</i>. (See MB 640:18.)
If one lives in a place where building a <i>sukka</i> would require his investing major efforts or a great deal of money, he must invest in the <i>sukka</i> to a degree comparable with what he would spend to arrange nice living quarters for a week. That is, he should think to himself: “If I had to leave home for a week, how much trouble would I go to, and how much money would I spend, to arrange comfortable lodgings?” That is how much he must invest in building a <i>sukka</i> or getting to somewhere he can build a <i>sukka</i>. One who periodically takes vacations must invest, in building a <i>sukka</i> or renting a place where he can access or build one, the amount he would pay for a week’s vacation, each person in accordance with his financial situation.
When one buys a home, he should make sure that it has a place to build a <i>sukka</i>. He should spend on this however much one who has to leave his house for one week a year would spend to ensure he could live in comfort for that week each year. A wealthy person must spend whatever he would be prepared to spend on a week’s vacation every year over many years.<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">The underlying principle is “‘<i>teshvu</i>’ – <i>ke’ein taduru</i>,” that one must reside in the <i>sukka</i> as he would reside at home (below, 3:1). Consequently, whatever one would pay in order to live comfortably for a week is what he must pay in order to keep the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> 640:15; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 640:25; <i>Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:32; and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 640:77 all rule accordingly.</i>

Section 15

<b>15. Beautifying the<i> Sukka</i></b>
It is a mitzva to put up a nice, decorated, aesthetically pleasing <i>sukka</i>, at it is written, “This is my God, and I will glorify Him (<i>ve-anvehu</i>)” (Shemot 15:2), which the Sages expound to mean: “Beautify (<i>hitna’eh</i>) yourself before Him through <i>mitzvot</i>: Make a beautiful (<i>na’ah</i>) <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful (<i>na’eh</i>) <i>lulav</i>…” (<i>Shabbat</i> 133b). The idea of beautifying <i>mitzvot</i> – “<i>hidur mitzva</i>” – applies to all the <i>mitzvot</i>.
In the times of the Sages, they customarily decorated the <i>sukka</i> with colorful tapestries and wall-hangings. They would also hang fruits and nuts – walnuts, peaches, almonds, clusters of grapes, pomegranates, wreaths made of stalks, and glass containers full of wine, oil, and fine flour (<i>Shabbat</i> 22a). Eating from them was forbidden during the festival, since they had been set aside for the mitzva of decorating the <i>sukka</i>. Only one who stipulated before the festival that he could eat them as he wished was permitted to do so (as will be explained in the next section). Nowadays, it is less common to decorate the <i>sukka</i> with food. Rather, we decorate the <i>sukka</i> with paper and plastic chains, paper flowers, pretty pictures, and decorative lights. We also make a point of using nice tablecloths, dishes, and silverware in the <i>sukka</i>.
The <i>poskim</i> disagree about the permissibility of decorating the <i>sukka</i> with verses from Scripture (Vayikra 23:42, for example), since they permitted writing down parts of the Torah only for the great need of studying it (<i>Taz</i>; MB 638:24). Others permit, maintaining that these decorations serve an educational purpose (<i>Shakh</i>; <i>Bnei Yona</i>). In practice, one may be lenient, as long as the verses are not written in a way that would be fit for a Torah scroll (based on Rabbeinu Yeruḥam and <i>Tashbetz</i>).
The beautification of the mitzva includes building a spacious <i>sukka</i>, well-protected from wind and sun, that is pleasant to sit in.
One must make sure not to leave dirty dishes in the <i>sukka</i> and not to undertake demeaning activities in it, like changing diapers and doing laundry. (See 3:2 below.)
Branches that smell foul or whose leaves fall off may not be used for <i>sekhakh</i>, as we are concerned that the smell or the nuisance of falling leaves will cause people to leave the <i>sukka</i> for home (<i>Sukka</i> 12b-13a). However, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if one did use these for <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher. However, if the smell is intolerable, then the <i>sukka</i> is invalid on a Torah level, as it is unfit for human habitation (SA 629:14; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 38).
One must take precautions against fire hazards in the <i>sukka</i>: not leaving burning candles or unsafe electrical circuits unsupervised and keeping electric lights far away from the <i>sekhakh</i>. (See SA 639:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 8.)

Section 16

<b>16. The Holiness of the <i>Sukka</i> and Its Decorations</b>
The <i>sukka</i> is sanctified for the purpose of the mitzva, for it is written: “There shall be the seven-day festival of Sukkot to the Lord” (Vayikra 23:34). Thus, throughout the festival, one may not use any part of the <i>sukka</i>, whether from the <i>sekhakh</i> or from the walls (<i>Sukka</i> 9a). The Sages further prohibited using any of the <i>sukka</i> decorations designated for beautifying the <i>sukka</i>, for since decorating is also a mitzva, the decorations are set aside for that mitzva. Even if the <i>sukka</i> collapses, it is forbidden to use its broken parts and decorations until after the festival. Moreover, since the prohibition persists until the end of the seventh day of Sukkot, including <i>bein ha-shmashot</i>, which is also the beginning of Shemini Atzeret, it consequently remains prohibited until the end of Simḥat Torah (<i>Beitza</i> 30b; SA 638:1-2).<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition is from the Torah during the week of the festival, and on Shemini Atzeret it is rabbinic, in accordance with the principle that anything <i>muktzeh</i> during <i>bein ha-shmashot</i> remains <i>muktzeh</i> throughout the next day (Ramban; Ran; SA 638:1). [By the same logic, the prohibition extends until the end of Simḥat Torah outside of Eretz Yisrael.] The prohibition applies even to a fallen <i>sukka</i>, but only on the rabbinic level (<i>Tosafot</i>; Rosh; Rema 638:1). All agree that using the <i>sekhakh</i> is a Torah prohibition. Regarding the walls, according to Rosh there is no prohibition. However, we rule in accordance with those who prohibit it. According to Ran, the prohibition of the walls is from the Torah, while there is a disagreement as to Rambam’s position. Some say that he views it as a Torah prohibition, while others say that he views it as a rabbinic prohibition.<br>The <i>sukka</i> and its decorations become <i>muktzeh</i> from the moment one begins to use the <i>sukka</i> (Rema 638:1). In practice, however, even if the <i>sukka</i> has not yet been used, they may not be moved on Shabbat and Yom Tov and are <i>muktzeh</i> due to the prohibition of <i>Soter</i> (<i>Mor U-Ketzi’a</i>; BHL 638:1 s.v. “lo”).</i>
However, since the <i>sukka</i> is a residence, one may use the walls and <i>sekhakh</i> in the way that one would normally use the walls and ceiling of his home. Thus, one may lean against the wall of the <i>sukka</i> and hang items on it, and one may hang a garment to dry from the <i>sekhakh</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 10b). The prohibition applies only to taking something from the <i>sukka</i> and using it, for example taking a beam from the <i>sukka</i> to build something else or even pulling off a splinter to use as a toothpick (Rema 638:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 4). It is also forbidden to remove the wall hangings, the decorations, or the fruit hung from the <i>sekhakh</i> in order to use them for some other purpose. One may not even move them without cause, as doing so detracts from the <i>sukka</i> and its decor. Carpets and floor tiles have the same status as decorations, as they have been set aside for the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (<i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 1:181).
If a decoration or part of the <i>sukka</i> becomes bothersome, for instance, if a beam is loose and creaky, or a decoration has fallen apart and is making the <i>sukka</i> ugly, one may remove and dispose of it respectfully, but it may not be used for something else.
If rainfall threatens to ruin the decorations, one may take them down to rehang them later. If one obtained nicer decorations during the festival, he may remove the old ones to replace them with the nicer ones, as long as he does not use the old decorations for another purpose, as they were set aside for mitzva use.
If one wants to be able to derive benefit from his <i>sukka</i> decorations during the festival, he should make the following declaration before the festival begins: “I hereby stipulate that I may remove and enjoy these decorations whenever I want, and that they do not become sanctified.” One cannot make such a stipulation about the <i>sukka</i> itself (<i>Beitza</i> 30b; SA 638:2).
A<i> sukka</i> may be taken down to be rebuilt elsewhere. The prohibition of <i>muktzeh</i> forbids using the <i>sukka</i> beams for a different purpose, but using them in another <i>sukka</i> is permissible.
With the end of the festival, the sanctity of the decorations, walls, and <i>sekhakh</i> expires. One may use them for any mundane purpose, but one may not degrade them, for instance, by using the paper as toilet paper or stepping disrespectfully on the <i>sukka</i> beams (SA 664:8; MB 638:24).

Section 17

<b>17. Pergolas</b>
A pergola is a permanent wooden structure built in yards and gardens to provide a shady place to sit. The question is: Is the wood of the pergola’s roof considered kosher <i>sekhakh</i>?
Some are permissive based on the rationale that since the pergola is not meant for residence and is not fit for residence, since rain penetrates, its wood is acceptable <i>sekhakh</i>. Nevertheless, it is proper to add a little <i>sekhakh</i> in honor of the festival and so that the pergola is not considered an “old” <i>sukka</i> (as explained above in section 12). If it is more sunny than shady under the pergola, enough <i>sekhakh</i> must be added to change that.
Others are stringent and say that since the pergola is a sturdy, permanent structure, its wooden roof is akin to the wooden roof of a house, which is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> on the Torah level. The basic principle of <i>sekhakh</i> for a <i>sukka</i> is that it must be impermanent, and a pergola is permanent. In practice, since this uncertainty pertains to Torah law, we must be stringent.
Therefore, if one wants to turn a pergola into an acceptable <i>sukka</i>, this is what he should do: If the majority of the pergola’s roof is made of fixed beams, some should be removed, so that most of the roof is open and there is more sun than shade. Kosher <i>sekhakh</i> can then be placed over the entire surface of the roof, such that even without the beams attached to the pergola, the shade provided by the kosher <i>sekhakh</i> will be greater than the sun it lets through. This makes the pergola into a kosher <i>sukka</i>.
Another way to make a pergola into a kosher <i>sukka</i> whose shade is greater than its sun is to take out the fixed beams and put them back without attaching them or nailing them down. Every re-placed beam is kosher <i>sekhakh</i> (SA 631:9).
As we have seen (section 13), one must make sure to put up the walls before the <i>sekhakh</i>. This is not usually a problem with a pergola, though. As long as “walls” are at least a <i>tefaḥ</i> high and near the <i>sekhakh</i>, they are considered rudimentary walls; if <i>sekhakh</i> is put on them, it is kosher (as explained in note 18). Many pergolas have horizontal beams that support the roofing, and which are more than a <i>tefaḥ</i> high. Thus, it is not necessary to add anything new to the “walls” before putting on the <i>sekhakh</i>.<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Among those who are permissive: R. Naḥum Rabinovitch (<i>Si’aḥ Naḥum</i> §39, on condition that one not paint the planks); R. Yaakov Ariel (<i>Be-ohalah shel Torah</i> 2:85, although <i>le-khatḥila</i> he is stringent); R. Yisrael Meir Lau (<i>Yaḥel Yisrael</i> §35); Rabbi Dr. Daniel Hershkowitz (<i>Teḥumin</i> 19). Among those who are stringent: R. Mordechai Eliyahu (<i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 50:42-43); R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (cited in <i>Shvut Yitzḥak</i>, p. 68); R. Eliyahu Schlesinger (<i>Eleh Hem Mo’adai</i> 1:38). As written in <i>Harḥavot</i>, the logic of those who are stringent is persuasive. Additionally, since we are speaking of uncertainty pertaining to Torah law, stringency is called for.</i>

Chapter 3



Section 1

<b>1. General Parameters</b>
The mitzva is for one to reside in his <i>sukka</i> during the seven days of the festival in the manner that he normally resides in his home, as we read, “You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> seven days” (Vayikra 23:42). In <i>Sukka</i> 28b, the Sages expound: “‘You shall dwell (<i>teshvu</i>)’ – akin to how you reside (<i>taduru</i>).” Thus, one should have his bed, linens, and utensils in the <i>sukka</i>. But what is not normally done in the home need not be done in the <i>sukka</i> (SA 639:1-2).
There are four parts of the mitzva do dwell in the <i>sukka</i>: a) things that must be done in the <i>sukka</i>; b) things it is a mitzva to do in the <i>sukka</i>; c) things there is no mitzva to do in the <i>sukka</i>; d) things it is forbidden to do in the <i>sukka</i>.
(1) <b>Things that must be done in the <i>sukka</i>:</b> Anything one generally does at home, he must do in the <i>sukka</i>. Thus, one must eat all proper meals (<i>se’udot keva</i>) and sleep in the <i>sukka</i>, as a home’s primary function is as a place to eat and sleep.
(2) <b>Things it is a mitzva to do in the <i>sukka</i>:</b> It is a mitzva to engage in activities that one sometimes does at home and sometimes elsewhere, like studying Torah, reading books, and chatting with friends, in the <i>sukka</i>, but doing them outside the <i>sukka</i> is not sinful. Nevertheless, since doing them is a mitzva, one should try to do them in the <i>sukka</i>. One who leaves the <i>sukka</i> without a good reason and does these things at home shows contempt for the mitzva. This category also includes impromptu eating (<i>akhilat ara’i</i>). Technically, there is no obligation to eat fixed meals on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, so it is possible for one to eat only snacks and irregular meals outside the <i>sukka</i> throughout <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. But if he can eat in the <i>sukka</i> without difficulty, then eating at home shows contempt for the mitzva. If it is difficult for him to eat in the <i>sukka</i> (for example, because it is a little cold), snacking at home does not show contempt for the mitzva. Nevertheless, since eating in the <i>sukka</i> fulfills a mitzva, it is proper to be fastidious and eat there. Some even say that there is a mitzva to eat two <i>se’udot keva</i> with bread in the <i>sukka</i> each day.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>mishna</i> in <i>Sukka</i> 27a, the Sages maintain that the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> requires one to reside in his <i>sukka</i> in the manner he resides at home. Since people sometimes eat <i>akhilat ara’i</i> outside the home, if one wishes, he can always eat <i>akhilat ara’i</i> outside the <i>sukka</i>. The <i>halakha</i> follows this view (SA 639:3). Nevertheless, one who eats <i>akhilat ara’i</i> in the <i>sukka</i> fulfills a mitzva, as is evident from the fact that we recite a <i>berakha</i> on it. (See section 5 below.) Some suggest (MB 639:24) that although there is no obligation to eat two meals with bread each day, there is nevertheless a mitzva to try two eat two meal each day, with bread, in the <i>Sukka</i>. This is similar to the opinion of Rosh, the Vilna Gaon, and other <i>poskim</i> with regard to eating matza throughout Pesaḥ (<i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 12:1). See <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>
(3) <b>Things there is no mitzva to do in the <i>sukka</i>:</b> Activities that are always done outside the home, like praying with a <i>minyan</i> and attending Torah classes, need not be moved to the <i>sukka</i> and may be done <i>le-khatḥila</i> in the synagogue or <i>beit midrash</i>.
(4) <b>Things it is forbidden to do in the <i>sukka</i>:</b> Demeaning things, like changing a baby’s diaper, may not be done in the <i>sukka</i>. (See note 2 below.)
Women are not obligated in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, because it is a time-bound positive commandment. Nevertheless, women fulfill a mitzva by dwelling in the <i>sukka</i>, and the custom of Ashkenazic women and some Sephardic women is to recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev Ba-sukka</i> if they eat in the <i>sukka</i>. The custom of most Sephardic women is not to recite the <i>berakha</i> since they have no obligation (SA 589:6; <i>Peninei Halakha: Women’s Prayer</i> 2:8 n. 9).

Section 2

<b>2. Treating the <i>Sukka</i> Respectfully</b>
All seven days of the festival, one must make the <i>sukka</i> his permanent residence, and the home temporary, as it is written: “You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> seven days” (Vayikra 23:42). Therefore, one must bring his good table and chairs into the <i>sukka</i>, and a good bed and sheets, so that he can reside in the <i>sukka</i> as he resides at home all year round. That is, it is not enough to eat and sleep in the <i>sukka</i>; the <i>sukka</i> must be his primary residence. The house should serve only as the kitchen and storage area, helping to meet <i>sukka</i> needs (<i>Sukka</i> 28b).
The Sages tell us that regular Torah study should take place in the <i>sukka</i>. However, if one is studying particularly difficult material, it is preferable for him to do that at home or in the <i>beit midrash</i>, because it is easier to concentrate there (<i>Sukka</i> 28b; SA 639:4). If one finds it difficult to concentrate in the <i>sukka</i> due to heat or noise, even ordinary study material may be taken inside, as Torah study is not something normally limited to the home. Similarly, if one who is learning Torah needs many different books and it would be difficult to lug them to the <i>sukka</i>, he may study in the <i>beit midrash</i> or in his library even <i>le-khatḥila</i>.
Even though one must treat his <i>sukka</i> like his home, there is a difference between them. In a home one does everything necessary, whether dignified or undignified. But we show respect for the <i>sukka</i> by not doing demeaning things there. The <i>sukka</i> must be treated like the nicest and most respectable room in the home. Thus, one may not leave workaday things there, like a bucket or dishpan or anything else one would not leave in the nicest room of the house. One may not wash dishes in the <i>sukka</i> nor change diapers there (<i>Sukka</i> 28b; SA 639:1; AHS <i>ad loc.</i> 4).
After finishing a meal, one must clear away all the dishes as quickly as possible, because it is not respectful to leave dirty dishes sitting in the <i>sukka</i>. However, cups may be left, because they do not look as dirty, and someone may want to drink even after the meal is over. People who normally bring pots to the table may do so on Sukkot as well; but in places where this is considered disrespectful, they should not be brought into the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 29a; SA 639:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 3-6). A garbage can may not be left in the <i>sukka</i>, but a paper recycling bin may be, as one would leave this even in an elegant room in the home.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbeinu Mano’aḥ, Raavad, and Rabbeinu Yehonatan, if there are dirty dishes in a <i>sukka</i> it is rabbinically invalid. Thus, one who eats in it may not recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i>. However, most <i>poskim</i> maintain that even if one demeans the <i>sukka</i>, it remains kosher and the <i>berakha</i> may be recited there (Rabbeinu Tam; <i>Ha-ma’or</i>; Ramban; Ran; <i>Baḥ</i>; MA; <i>Pri Megadim</i>; and others). Nevertheless, <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should show concern for the stringent position (<i>Ḥayei Adam</i>; MB 639:6; SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 13).</i>
One should not leave dirty clothes in the <i>sukka</i>. However, someone sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> may take off his clothes and leave them on a chair in the <i>sukka</i>, and take off his socks and shoes there, as he would do at home.
There is no problem with speaking about mundane matters in the <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, if one wants to talk with his friend (in person or on the phone), he should converse in the <i>sukka</i> as he would at home, for whenever he is in the <i>sukka</i>, he fulfills a mitzva (SA 639:1). Similarly, people who want to play chess or Monopoly or other games should play in the <i>sukka</i>. (See <i>Responsa Mahari Weil</i> §191; <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> 639:1.) Some are careful not to engage in mundane matters in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Shlah</i>; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 639:5-6; see MB <i>ad loc</i>. 2). However, if this leads one to spend less time in the <i>sukka</i>, it is not an enhancement of the mitzva; one who wants to engage in mundane matters should do so in the <i>sukka</i> and thus fulfill a mitzva.

Section 3

<b>3. The Obligation to Eat in the <i>Sukka</i> on the First Night</b>
There is an important difference between the first night of Sukkot and the rest of the festival. During most of the festival, if one wants to eat a <i>se’udat keva</i>, he must eat it in the <i>sukka</i>, but one who wants to eat an <i>akhilat ara’i</i> may do so outside of the <i>sukka</i>. However, on the first night of Sukkot, there is an obligation to eat bread in the <i>sukka</i>. This obligation is based on a <i>gezera shava</i> from the identical language used by the Torah to describe the first night of Sukkot and Pesaḥ, from which the Sages derive that just as there is an obligation to eat matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, so too there is an obligation to eat bread in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night of Sukkot (<i>Sukka</i> 27a; SA 639:3). This also teaches us the importance of the first night of Sukkot, which lays the foundation for the entire festival.
To ensure that people fulfill the mitzva with appetite, one must avoid filling foods for the three hours before <i>shki’at ha-ḥama</i> on the eve of the festival (MB 639:27).
The obligation can be fulfilled from <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i> onward. Since this mitzva is derived from the mitzva of eating matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, one should eat the bread before midnight. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, one who did not manage to eat by midnight may do so until dawn (MB <i>ad loc</i>. 25-26; <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 16:31).
Before beginning to eat bread on the first night, one should have intent that this eating is to fulfill God’s commandment to us to eat in the <i>sukka</i> as a commemoration of the Exodus and of the clouds of glory with which He sheltered us in the wilderness. <i>Le-khatḥila</i> one should have this intention throughout the festival, but, <i>be-di’avad</i>, even on the first night one discharges his obligation as long as he knows he fulfills a mitzva by eating in the <i>sukka</i> (MB 625:1; see above, 1:4-5).
Just as we make sure to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of matza according to all opinions on the first night of Pesaḥ, so too we make certain to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread according to all opinions on the first night of Sukkot. Thus, one should eat at least half an egg’s bulk (<i>keveitza</i>) of bread, and some are stringent and eat more than a <i>keveitza</i>; this is an admirable practice. It is not necessary to squash the challah when calculating the volume of an egg; one may estimate based on the normal state of the challah. One should eat the necessary quantity of bread unhurriedly but steadily. If one stopped eating in the middle for longer than <i>shi’ur akhilat pras</i> (6-7 minutes), he must start again.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Sukka</i> 27a, the obligation to eat bread in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night of Sukkot is derived from the obligation to eat matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, based on a <i>gezera shava</i>. The implication is that the minimum quantity required is a <i>kezayit</i>. This is found in <i>y.</i> <i>Sukka</i> 2:7 as well as in Rambam, Rosh, and other Rishonim, and is the ruling of SA 639:3. The <i>poskim</i> disagree as to the parameters of a <i>kezayit</i>. Many Ge’onim and Rishonim maintain that it is the size of a present-day olive. According to Rambam it is almost 1/3 the size of an egg, and according to <i>Tosafot</i> it is about half the size of an egg. Out of uncertainty, SA (OḤ 486:1) rules in accordance with <i>Tosafot</i>. Thus, someone who eats the volume of half an egg has fulfilled his obligation according to the vast majority of <i>poskim</i>.<br>Nevertheless, there are three reasons to be stringent and eat a bit more than a <i>keveitza</i> on the first night: <b>1)</b> According to Ran, it is a mitzva to eat more than a <i>keveitza</i> of bread, because this is the quantity that obligates one to eat in the <i>sukka</i>. MB 639:22 states that <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is proper to follow this opinion. <b>2)</b> According to <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i>, eggs nowadays are only half the size of the eggs in the time of the Sages, so the equivalent of eating half of a <i>keveitza</i> is eating the volume of an entire modern egg. Ashkenazim generally follow this position when it comes to Torah obligations. <b>3)</b> Even though Sephardim do not generally give weight to the opinion of <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i>, they end up requiring a similar amount, because most Sephardim base their measurements on weight rather than volume, and it emerges that this quantity is more than an egg’s volume of bread. According to some, the reason for calculating based on weight rather than volume is that to calculate the volume of the bread properly, one would have to squash it (<i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:5-6, and <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 16:23-24.) We see that <i>le-khatḥila</i>, there are three good reasons to eat a little more than a <i>keveitza</i> of bread or challah, approximately the size of a normal slice. Anyone who eats calmly but steadily will certainly be able to finish eating this amount of bread within the required amount of time (<i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:7).</i>
If it rains on the first night, some say there is no mitzva to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread in the <i>sukka</i>, as a <i>mitzta’er</i> (one who experiences discomfort) is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (Rashba; <i>Smag</i>). Others say that on the first night, even a <i>mitzta’er</i> must eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread in the <i>sukka</i> (Rosh; Ran). In practice, it is proper to wait an hour or two in hopes that the rain will let up and it will be possible to fulfill the mitzva according to all. If the rain continues, or if the rain stopped but the water dripping from the waterlogged <i>sekhakh</i> makes it unpleasant to sit in the <i>sukka</i>, one should recite<i> kiddush</i> and <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> (on the festival itself) in the <i>sukka</i> and eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread to fulfill the mitzva according to those who maintain that a <i>mitzta’er</i> is obligated to eat in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night. However, one should not recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i>, since some maintain that even on the first night, a <i>mitzta’er</i> has no mitzva to eat in the <i>sukka</i> (Rema 629:5; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 35). If the rain stopped before midnight, and one would still get some enjoyment from eating bread, he should go to the <i>sukka</i>, recite “<i>ha-motzi</i>” and <i>Leishev</i>, and eat bread, thus fulfilling the mitzva according to those who maintain that the mitzva is to eat without discomfort.

Section 4

<b>4. Eating in the <i>Sukka</i></b>
As we have learned, it is a mitzva to reside in the <i>sukka</i> as one resides at home, and since proper meals (<i>se’udot keva</i>) are usually done at home, such meals must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. However, people sometimes eat light meals and snacks (<i>akhilat ara’i</i>) when not at home. Therefore, one may eat an <i>akhilat ara’i</i> outside the <i>sukka</i>. Those who are meticulous make sure to eat even an <i>akhilat ara’i</i> in the <i>sukka</i>; they also do not drink anything, even water, outside the <i>sukka</i>. However, this is not obligatory, and even Torah scholars may eat <i>akhilat ara’i</i> outside the <i>sukka</i> (<i>m. Sukka</i> 26b; Ran <i>ad loc.</i>; BHL 639:2 s.v. “aval”).
As a rule, <i>se’udat</i> (or <i>akhilat</i>)<i> keva</i> refers to a significant meal that one eats to become satiated. <i>Akhilat ara’i</i> refers to eating to enjoy the taste or to stave off hunger, but not really to become satiated.
Since grain is the staple food of humanity, from which bread, pastries, and filling dishes like pasta and porridge are made, one who eats more than a <i>keveitza</i> of grain-based food is considered to be eating <i>se’udat keva</i> and must eat in the <i>sukka</i>. Even if this quantity does not fill him up entirely, since we normally satiate ourselves with grains, and since a quantity greater than a <i>keveitza</i> is somewhat satisfying, this is defined as <i>se’udat keva</i>. However, a <i>keveitza</i> or less is considered <i>akhilat ara’i</i>, which may be eaten outside of the <i>sukka</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 26a) states that eating bread as a snack is permitted outside the <i>sukka</i>. Abaye illustrates: a student grabbing something to eat as he rushes out to the <i>beit midrash</i>. The reason for this exemption is that all year long one would eat an <i>akhila ara’i</i> outside the home (Ran and Ritva). Rashi explains that <i>akhilat ara’i</i> is any quantity up to a mouthful, which is a <i>keveitza</i>. Thus, more than a <i>keveitza</i> is considered a proper meal. This is the view of <i>Tosafot</i>, Rosh, and Ran as well. In contrast, Rambam and R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at maintain that even a bit more than a <i>keveitza</i> can be considered <i>akhila ara’i</i> and eaten outside the <i>sukka</i>; only an amount significantly larger than a <i>keveitza</i> requires a <i>sukka</i>. SA 639:2 rules that a bit more than a <i>keveitza</i> must be eaten in a <i>sukka</i>.<br>Presumably, the same applies to pastries and other grain-based baked goods on which one recites the <i>berakha</i> of <i>mezonot</i>. True, there is a disagreement as to whether to recite <i>Leishev</i> before eating a <i>keveitza</i> of such foods, but all agree that they must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i> (Ḥida; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 639:33). As for grain-based dishes, Rosh, Tur, and SA 639:2 maintain that these must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i> only if eaten in significant quantity, i.e., what one would eat for a meal, or if they are being eaten with a group. In contrast, according to <i>Magen Avraham</i> and <i>Shulḥan Arukh Ha-Rav</i>, if one is eating more than a <i>keveitza</i>, it must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:65 states this as well, and this is what I write above. However, in times of need, one may be lenient about grain-based dishes and eat even more than a <i>keveitza</i> outside the <i>sukka</i>, as long as he is not making a meal out of them.</i>
Since it is not normal to fill oneself up with fruit, water, and juice, one may eat and drink them outside the <i>sukka</i> without limit.
One may eat small amounts of meat, fish, or cheese outside the <i>sukka</i>, but if one intends to eat them in an amount that constitutes a regular, filling meal, he must eat in the <i>sukka</i> (MB <i>ad loc.</i> 15).<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">According to Maharam of Rothenburg and Ramban, one who eats fruit as an <i>akhilat keva</i> must eat in a <i>sukka</i>. According to Rabbeinu Peretz, Me’iri, <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, and, by implication, Rambam (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 6:6), he is exempt, but one who eats meat or cheese or the like as an <i>akhilat keva</i> must eat in a <i>sukka</i>. According to Rosh, <i>Tur</i>, and SA 639:2, only grain constitutes a <i>se’udat keva</i>, so one who eats them must eat in a <i>sukka</i>, but those eating meat or cheese, even in quantities that would constitute <i>akhilat keva</i>, are exempt from eating in the <i>sukka</i>. It is possible that there is no disagreement; rather, each discussed what is considered <i>akhilat keva</i> in his milieu. In practice, some say that one who eats a proper meal of meat and the like must eat in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Ginat Veradim</i>, Ḥida, and <i>Derekh Ha-ḥayim</i>). Others maintain that <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should be stringent (<i>Baḥ</i>; <i>Eliya Rabba; Bikurei Yaakov</i>; MB 639:15; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc.</i> 15). Still others are lenient <i>le-khatḥila</i> (SAH; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:65). It seems to me that nowadays, all would agree that someone whose main meal consists of meat or cheese must eat in a <i>sukka</i>, as the reason <i>poskim</i> were lenient was because these did not serve as a <i>se’udat keva</i> (AHS 639:9). However, nowadays, many regularly eat entire meals without bread, satiating themselves with vegetables, meat, rice, and the like, so everyone views this as <i>akhilat keva</i>, so it must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. The law pertaining to reciting the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> will be explained in the next section.</i>
The <i>poskim</i> disagree about wine and strong drink. Some say that since they are not filling, they need not be drunk in the <i>sukka</i> (Rosh; Rema). Others maintain that because of the significance of wine, one who drinks a <i>revi’it</i> thereof must do so in the <i>sukka</i> (Ritva). Some are stringent and extend this to all strong drink, saying that if people are getting together to drink, they must do so in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Or Zar’ua</i>; MA). <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, it is correct to follow this practice (MB 639:3 and BHL s.v. “ve-yayin”).
It is important to note that during a meal, all components of the meal are part of the <i>akhilat keva</i> that must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>, so one must make sure not to eat anything outside the <i>sukka</i>. Thus, one who leaves the <i>sukka</i> during the meal in order to bring something into the <i>sukka</i> must not eat or drink anything in the home, nor even swallow in the home what he began eating in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Binyan Shlomo</i> 1:41; <i>Sho’el U-meshiv</i> 4:3:11; R. Zvi Pesaḥ Frank, <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> 1:31).

Section 5

<b>5. Reciting the <i>Berakha</i> of <i>Leishev Ba-sukka</i></b>
The Sages ordained that before fulfilling the mitzva of dwelling in the <i>sukka</i>, one recites the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev Ba-sukka</i>: “Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the <i>sukka</i>.” There are different customs as to when one recites this <i>berakha</i>.
According to many Rishonim, including Rif and Rambam, whenever one enters the <i>sukka</i> to spend time there, even if he intends only to sit without doing anything, he recites <i>Leishev</i> before sitting down, since he is fulfilling a mitzva. This is the practice of Yemenites; they recite the <i>berakha</i> while standing, immediately upon entering the <i>sukka</i>, and then sit.
All other communities follow Rabbeinu Tam’s view, namely, that the <i>berakha</i> is recited on eating, as it is more central. The <i>berakha</i> on eating then covers everything else that one does in fulfillment of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. Even though sleeping is also important, we do not make a <i>berakha</i> over it, since one might recite the <i>berakha</i> before going to sleep, and then not fall asleep. Eating, however, is in one’s control, so it is proper to recite the <i>berakha</i> over it. The question is: What type of eating mandates a <i>berakha</i>?
According to Ashkenazic custom, one who plans to eat an amount of food that makes eating in the <i>sukka</i> obligatory makes a <i>Leishev</i>. One who does not plan to eat that much while he is in the <i>sukka</i> should still make a <i>Leishev</i> even if tasting a minimal amount of food or wine. If one has no intention to eat at all, many have the custom not to recite the <i>berakha</i>, but some have the custom to recite the <i>berakha</i> even when just spending time in the <i>sukka</i>; this is the proper practice.
According to Sephardic custom, one recites <i>Leishev</i> on a significant amount of food that generally constitutes a proper meal. In this respect, there is a difference between bread and other types of <i>mezonot</i>. For bread, even when one will eat only a bit more than a <i>keveitza</i>, he recites <i>Leishev</i>. On other <i>mezonot</i>, be it baked goods, pasta, or porridge, only if one eats an amount that will satiate him at a regular meal – approximately the volume of 4 eggs – recites a <i>Leishev</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Most Rishonim, including <i>Behag</i>, R. Hai Gaon, Rif, Rambam, and Rashi, maintain that any time one enters the <i>sukka</i> for the sake of the mitzva, even if only to sit down there, he recites the <i>berakha</i>. This is the Yemenite custom and the ruling of the Vilna Gaon in practice. In contrast, Rabbeinu Tam, <i>Itur</i>, R. Yehudai Gaon, and other Ge’onim maintain that one recites <i>Leishev</i> only if he eats. This is the widespread custom (SA 639:8 and MB). The Aḥaronim disagree as to what the <i>berakha</i> hinges on. Some say that one recites a <i>Leishev</i> over any food that must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Ginat Veradim</i>). This is the Ashkenazic custom (MB 639:16 and 46). Sephardic custom is to recite the <i>berakha</i> only over a <i>se’udat keva</i>, as will be explained in the next note.<br>According to <i>Taz</i>, <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, MB 639:48, and <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, the practice of reciting <i>Leishev</i> before eating applies when one plans to eat. However, if one enters a <i>sukka</i> and knows that he will not eat, no matter how long he stays in the <i>sukka</i>, should recite the <i>berakha</i> anyway, on spending time in the <i>sukka</i>. According to <i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> (8), one recites the <i>berakha</i> only when eating something that must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. Many Ashkenazim recite <i>Leishev</i> if they have any amount of <i>mezonot</i>, wine, or another significant food, as the primary position follows the view that the <i>berakha</i> is recited on spending time in the <i>sukka</i>, but since the custom is to recite the <i>berakha</i> when eating, they eat something and thus recite both <i>berakhot</i>. See <i>Harḥavot</i> 5:9-10.</i>
It would seem that nowadays, even according to Sephardic custom, one must recite the <i>berakha</i> if they are eating a full meal (such as soup, meat, rice, and potatoes), even if it does not include bread or <i>mezonot</i>. Even though in the past the ruling was not to recite <i>Leishev</i> on a meal without bread, nowadays, when many people eat an entire significant meal without grain, it is also considered a <i>se’udat keva</i>, and one must recite the <i>berakha</i>. Nevertheless, one who knows that his parents do not recite <i>Leishev</i> on this type of meal may follow their practice. In order to remove any doubt, however, it is preferable that he take care to eat bread with such meals and recite the <i>berakha</i>.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">See n. 5 above, where we explain that one who makes a <i>se’udat keva</i> of meat or cheese and side dishes must eat in a <i>sukka</i>. However, R. Ovadia Yosef writes that he should not recite the <i>berakha</i> (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:65), as Sephardim recite the <i>berakha</i> only over a meal containing enough bread or <i>mezonot</i> to be considered a <i>se’udat keva</i> (<i>Sho’el Ve-nishal</i> 3:95 and 165; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 136). <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> limits the recitation of <i>Leishev</i> to meals with bread. However, it seems to me that their views apply to previous generations, when every <i>se’udat keva</i> had bread, or at least <i>mezonot</i>. Nowadays, though, when many people have <i>se’udot keva</i> based on other foods, these are considered significant meals, and <i>Leishev</i> should be recited. To this we can add the view of most Rishonim that one recites <i>Leishev</i> whenever one sits in the <i>sukka</i>, as well as the view of those (cited in the previous note) who maintain that if one does not intend to eat, he should recite a <i>berakha</i> on spending time in the <i>sukka</i>. This is also the ruling of <i>Responsa Devar Ḥevron</i> OḤ 586.</i>

Section 6

<b>6. Laws Relating to the <i>Berakha</i> of <i>Leishev Ba-sukka</i></b>
Since the custom is to recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> before eating, the question arises as to which <i>berakha</i> to recite first – the <i>berakha</i> on the food or <i>Leishev</i>? According to Ashkenazim and some Sephardim, one recites the <i>berakha</i> over the food first, followed by <i>Leishev</i>. Since it is the eating that obligates us to sit in the <i>sukka</i>, the <i>berakha</i> on the food comes before the <i>berakha</i> on the <i>sukka</i>. One need not stand when reciting the <i>berakha</i>. The custom of some Sephardim is first to recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> while standing, and then sit down and recite the <i>berakha</i> over the food. People should continue their family’s tradition.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> is the subject of a passage in the Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 45b-46a). There are two parts to the discussion: 1) According to Rambam, one should stand when reciting <i>Leishev</i> because the mitzva is formulated as “<i>teshvu</i>,” which he takes to mean “sit.” Since <i>berakhot</i> are generally recited right before the action, one should recite the <i>berakha</i> while standing and immediately sit down. This is the Yemenite custom. According to Raavad and Rosh, “<i>teshvu</i>” means “dwell” and refers to spending time in the <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, one who stands in the <i>sukka</i> also fulfills the mitzva. Since the custom is to recite <i>Leishev</i> before eating, one recites it while sitting down, right before eating. 2) According to Maharam of Rothenburg, one should recite <i>Leishev</i> before reciting the <i>berakha</i> over food, because one becomes obligated to recite <i>Leishev</i> immediately upon entering the <i>sukka</i>. Nevertheless, Rosh writes that the custom is to recite the <i>berakha</i> on bread first, because according to the custom of reciting <i>Leishev</i> only when one eats, the food triggers <i>berakha</i> on the <i>sukka</i>. <i>Taz</i> 643:2 suggests that “<i>ha-motzi</i>” (or “<i>mezonot</i>”) should be recited first, as <i>birkhot ha-nehenin</i> (blessings when deriving physical benefit) take precedence over <i>birkhot ha-mitzvot</i> (blessings over commandments). In practice, those from Morocco, Tunisia, most Sephardic countries, and all Ashkenazic countries recite the <i>berakha</i> on the food before <i>Leishev</i> (Rema 643:2-3; <i>Alei Hadas: Minhagei Tunis</i> 11:3). In contrast SA 643:3 rules that the <i>halakha</i> follows Rambam and Maharam, that one recites <i>Leishev</i> first, followed by the <i>berakha</i> on the food. This is also the view of <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> (Ha’azinu §5); <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 643:9, 16; and <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 5:47. Even though they write that this is the preferable way to behave, they do not negate the other custom.</i>
If one forgot to recite <i>Leishev</i> before eating, he should recite it in the middle and continue to eat. If he remembered only after he was basically finished eating, then if he can eat or drink a bit more before reciting <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, he should recite <i>Leishev</i> and then eat or drink something. If he remembered after the meal was over, according to most <i>poskim</i> he should recite the <i>berakha</i> even though he does not intend to continue eating (MB 639:48); Sephardic practice is not to recite the <i>berakha</i> (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 5:48).
As long as one remains in the <i>sukka</i>, the <i>berakha</i> he recited at the beginning of his time there covers him. Even if he eats an additional meal, he does not recite an additional <i>Leishev</i>. If he left temporarily – for example, to go to the bathroom, to bring something to the <i>sukka</i>, or to chat with friends – he does not repeat the <i>berakha</i> on his return, as the original <i>berakha</i> is still in force (MB 639:47). However, if he left for something significant – for example, to go to the synagogue or to take care of his business – when he returns, he must recite <i>Leishev</i> again. Even if he left for a trivial reason, if he was gone for more than an hour, he should recite the <i>berakha</i> again (SAH 639:13).<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Baḥ</i> and <i>Taz</i> (639:20), if someone recites <i>Leishev</i> before a meal and then remains in the <i>sukka</i> continuously until his next <i>se’udat keva</i>, he recites a <i>Leishev</i> again, as we assume that he intended his first <i>berakha</i> to cover only until the next meal. However, according to <i>Levush</i>, <i>Shlah</i>, and <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>ad loc.</i> 17), he does not repeat the <i>berakha</i>, since the <i>sukka</i> never left his consciousness. This is also the position of SAH, <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, MB (<i>ad loc.</i> 47), and SHT (<i>ad loc.</i> 86). The <i>halakha</i> follows this latter position, as we are lenient when it comes to uncertainty about reciting a <i>berakha</i>. If someone enters the <i>sukka</i> and needs to recite <i>Leishev</i> for himself, he should be asked to have in mind the person who was still there from the previous meal. Some say that if one left the <i>sukka</i> briefly, even though his short absence is not considered an interruption, he must recite <i>Leishev</i> again when he is about to start an additional <i>se’udat keva</i> (<i>Ya’avetz</i>; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i>). Others say that even in this case, he does not recite the <i>berakha</i> again (<i>Derekh Ha-ḥayim</i>; SAH; and others). Since the requirement of reciting a <i>berakha</i> here is uncertain, we do not recite it (SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 86).</i>
If one began a meal in his <i>sukka</i> and planned to continue with the meal in his friend’s <i>sukka</i>, then if his intention when reciting “<i>ha-motzi</i>” was to cover what he would eat at his friend’s, he also exempted himself from reciting <i>Leishev</i> in his friend’s <i>sukka</i>. If he did not have this in mind, before leaving his <i>sukka</i> he must recite <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, and afterward he must recite all the <i>berakhot</i> again in his friend’s <i>sukka</i>.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Magen Avraham</i> and <i>Shulḥan Arukh Ha-Rav</i>, if one went to his friend’s <i>sukka</i> in the middle of a meal, he must recite <i>Leishev</i> again there. However, according to <i>Taz</i> and <i>Levushei Serad</i>, if he intended to go when he recited <i>Leishev</i>, he need not recite it again. MB 639:48 and SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 93-94 conclude that he should not recite the <i>berakha</i>. If one left his <i>sukka</i> after having finished his meal and having recited <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, then presumably he did not intend for his <i>Leishev</i> to cover a visit to his friend’s <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, should he wish to eat there, he recites <i>Leishev</i>. See <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 3:11 regarding one who wishes to continue his meal at his friend’s home.</i>

Section 7

<b>7. Sleeping and Dozing Off in the <i>Sukka</i></b>
Sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> is obligatory, whether one is going to sleep for the night (<i>sheinat keva</i>) or taking a nap (<i>sheinat ara’i</i>). In this, sleeping differs from eating; <i>akhilat ara’i</i> is permitted outside the <i>sukka</i> because people snack outside the home all year long (explained above, section 4). Sleeping is stricter because even <i>sheinat ara’i</i> is significant, as even a short nap can be refreshing, and people generally do not nap outside the home. Therefore, even <i>sheinat ara’i</i> must be in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 26a; SA 639:2).
Some people tend to doze off unintentionally while traveling or during lectures. This type of involuntary dozing off is not considered <i>sheinat ara’i</i> and is not prohibited outside the <i>sukka</i>. The difference between the cases is clear: In the case of <i>sheinat ara’i</i>, one puts his head down on a desk or some other support in order to sleep for a little while, and many people are careful not to sleep like this in public. In contrast, one who is dozing off actually wishes to remain awake but dozes off involuntarily and jolts awake periodically.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">If someone is dozing off during the Torah reading, <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> (<i>Haazinu</i> §8) states that he should be woken up. Others maintain that one is not required to wake up someone who dozed off involuntarily in the <i>sukka</i>, since one who is asleep is exempt from performing <i>mitzvot</i> (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:17). Others say that the reason one should not wake him up is because he has the status of <i>mitzta’er</i> (Maharil Diskin; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 201). Some maintain if the dozing off is brief (less than the amount of time it takes to walk 100 <i>amot</i>, which some estimate at 54 seconds), there is no prohibition involved. (See MB 639:11, which states that this is implied by R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at.) It would seem the primary distinction in practice is between one who intends to take a nap and puts his head down, who should be woken up since he is neglecting a Torah commandment, and one who dozes off involuntarily while sitting up; his sleep is not considered <i>sheinat ara’i</i> because he does not intend to sleep.<br>If one is traveling to perform a mitzva or to avoid a financial loss, he may lie down on a bench to sleep a little if this is his usual practice, because his travel is for a permissible purpose, the status of the <i>sukka</i> is the same as the status of the home all year long, and some people regularly nap while traveling. However, if one is on a trip or traveling for another non-mitzva reason, he may not sleep a <i>sheinat ara’i</i> outside of a <i>sukka</i> (as explained below, section 14), though involuntary dozing is not forbidden. See Rema 640:3 and <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>
There are additional issues when it comes to sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. For a variety of reasons, some people find it hard to sleep in a <i>sukka</i>. The question is: At what point are they considered <i>mitzta’arim</i> who are exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>? To clarify this basic law, we must first explain the status of a <i>mitzta’er</i>.

Section 8

<b>8. The Exemption of One Who Is Sick or <i>Mitzta’er</i></b>
Sick people and their attendants are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. This exemption is not limited to the dangerously ill; even someone who is in no danger – for instance, someone who has a headache and finds sitting in the <i>sukka</i> difficult – is exempt. If a sick person needs help, his aide is exempt as well (<i>Sukka</i> 26a; SA 640:3).
Likewise, a <i>mitzta’er</i> (one who experiences pain or discomfort in the <i>sukka</i>) is exempt, because the mitzva is to reside in the <i>sukka</i> as one resides at home during the year. Just as one would not reside in a place that causes him pain and discomfort, so too on Sukkot, he is not obligated to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> if it causes him discomfort. True, a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence and therefore, by its nature, is not as comfortable as a house. This lesser comfort does not exempt someone from <i>sukka</i>, for this is precisely the mitzva. But when an additional factor causes staying in the <i>sukka</i> to entail pain and actual discomfort, one is exempt. The most common case of <i>mitzta’er</i> is rain.
The level of discomfort that warrants exemption from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> must be significant, of the type that would lead one to move out of his home to a considerably less comfortable place nearby. For example, if one has a very minor leak in his roof, he would prefer to remain at home. Similarly, if there is a minimal amount of rain, one must remain in his <i>sukka</i>. If the rain persists, so the point that it would ruin his food and disturb his sleep, he would move elsewhere, despite the bother of moving, and even if his new quarters were smaller and shabbier. In such a situation, one is considered <i>mitzta’er</i> and is exempt from the <i>sukka</i>. He remains exempt as long as the <i>sekhakh</i> continues dripping enough to ruin his food (SA 639:5; <i>Eshel Avraham</i> [Buczacz] 640:4). If he is <i>mitzta’er</i> with respect to sleeping but not eating, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> but obligated to eat there (MB 640:16).<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 2:9) states: “At what point is one permitted to leave the <i>sukka</i>? At the point when the <i>mikpa</i> is ruined.” The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 29a) explains that <i>mikpa</i> was a dish made of groats, and Rashi explains that it easily spoils with a bit of rain. SA 639:5 rules accordingly. This level of spoilage applies to the average person, but one who is particularly delicate has a lower threshold of becoming <i>mitztza’er</i>. When it comes to sleeping, though, even the average person is bothered by a minimal amount of rain, so he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> even if there is not enough rain to ruin the food (Rema 639:7). Certainly, optional activities such as studying and chatting may be moved inside on account of minimal rain (<i>Eshel Avraham</i> [Buczacz] 639:7). The comparison to the home found above is mentioned in Rema 639:5, citing several Rishonim. <i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz) 640:4 defines the threshold as follows: “The threshold is such that if one has a small place near his home, even though his home is larger and more comfortable, he would move to the smaller one to avoid the discomfort. The threshold is determined by what most people would do given the situation. If the person is elderly – by what other elderly people would do.” This is cited in <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:18. It would seem that if the meteorologists are predicting that it will definitely rain at night, and this causes someone worry and stress, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. (See <i>Harḥavot</i>.)</i>
If one left the <i>sukka</i> on account of rain, started eating inside, and then the rain stopped, he need not return to the <i>sukka</i>. Rather, he may finish eating in the house. Similarly, if he went to sleep in the house because it was raining, and then the rain stopped, he is not required to return to the <i>sukka</i>. He may sleep at home until morning (SA 639:6-7).<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">The basis of this <i>halakha</i> is in <i>Sukka</i> 29a. Also see <i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 639:6-7, which state that the exemption applies only until he wakes up and dawn breaks. However, if he wakes up after dawn and wants to continue sleeping, he must move to the <i>sukka</i>. Some rule this way in practice. But it seems more reasonable to assume that this is limited to one who regularly wakes up close to dawn. However, one who generally sleeps for another hour or two is not required to move into the <i>sukka</i> before the time he normally wakes up. (See <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 16; <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> ch. 17 n. 42.) This is certainly true for someone who is worried that if he moves into the <i>sukka</i> he will not be able to fall back asleep, in which case he would have the status of <i>mitzta’er</i> and need not relocate to the <i>sukka</i>. On the other hand, if moving to the <i>sukka</i> is only a minor inconvenience for someone, it would seem that even if he wakes up in the middle of the night, it is proper for him to move into the <i>sukka</i> to sleep. This is in line with MB <i>ad loc</i>. 41.</i>

Section 9

<b>9. More on the Status of <i>Mitzta’er</i></b>
If a large number of flies or mosquitoes are in one’s <i>sukka</i>, he has no way of getting rid of them, and they are causing him pain or discomfort; or if there is a bad smell in the <i>sukka</i>; or if it is extremely hot in the afternoon, cold at night, or windy, and clothes are not enough to alleviate the discomfort – if his discomfort is severe enough that if it were to happen in his home, he would move into a significantly less comfortable place he has nearby, he is exempt from <i>sukka</i>. This is on condition that his leaving the <i>sukka</i> will alleviate his discomfort. However, if he would suffer from the mosquitoes or the bad smell even in his home, then he must remain in the <i>sukka</i> (SA and Rema 640:4).
In a situation where particularly sensitive people suffer discomfort, while most people do not – for example, when a wind blows some leaves from the <i>sekhakh</i> onto the table – the people in the majority must remain in the <i>sukka</i>, while those who are sensitive are exempt. However, one cannot maintain that he suffers from something that even sensitive people normally do not mind. When someone is at such an extreme, we say that his personal disposition is disregarded in light of the norm, and he must eat and sleep in the <i>sukka</i> (Rema 640:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 28-29).
If someone was derelict and built a particularly rickety <i>sukka</i>, he may not then claim during the festival that he suffers from being in it, even though it does not adequately protect him from the vagaries of the weather. Since he put up this rickety <i>sukka</i>, he obligated himself to live in it during Sukkot without complaint. If he nevertheless complains and claims that he is suffering, it becomes clear retroactively that he sinned and abrogated the mitzva by putting up an inadequate <i>sukka</i>. He must immediately make efforts to reinforce his <i>sukka</i> so it does not cause him discomfort. (See above, 2:14, and below, end of section 13.)
If the lights went out in the <i>sukka</i> on Friday night but there is light in the home, one may eat at home, since eating in the dark is a discomfort. If it would not be too much trouble to eat in a neighbor’s <i>sukka</i>, he should do so, but if it would be very unpleasant or difficult, then he is considered <i>mitzta’er</i> and exempt from <i>sukka</i> (Rema 640:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 22-23).
If one is exempt from <i>sukka</i> because of the discomfort entailed by eating there – for example when it is raining – but he nevertheless insists upon eating there while being rained on, he is not performing a mitzva. Rather, he is doing something foolish. There is even a sinful aspect to it, for one must honor the festival, and it is forbidden to cause oneself suffering on it. However, it is different if one began his meal in the house because it was raining, and then the rain stopped. While he is not required to return to the <i>sukka</i>, if he does so he is rewarded for it, since his sitting in the <i>sukka</i> does not entail discomfort (BHL 639:7 s.v. “hedyotot”).

Section 10

<b>10. <i>Mitzta’er</i> and Exemption from Sleeping</b>
As we have seen, it is obligatory to sleep in the <i>sukka</i>, both <i>sheinat keva</i> and <i>sheinat ara’i</i>, yet many are lenient and do not sleep in the <i>sukka</i>. Do they have a basis for their practice? The <i>poskim</i> mention two primary reasons for exemption from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. One relates to <i>mitzta’er</i>, and one to married men.
In cold European countries, sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> entailed pain and discomfort because of the cold nights, and people who slept in the <i>sukka</i> would sometimes get sick. Therefore, <i>poskim</i> ruled that if one is <i>mitzta’er</i> vis-à-vis sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> because of the cold, and he has no way to keep warm properly, whether because he does not have enough blankets or because he is <i>mitzta’er</i> even with the blankets, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. In Eretz Yisrael it is not that cold, but nowadays there are more spoiled and sensitive people who catch colds easily on chilly nights in the <i>sukka</i> even when they sleep with a heavy blanket. They, too, are deemed <i>mitzta’arim</i> and exempt. However, on nights that they know they will not catch a cold, or when napping in the afternoon, they must sleep in the <i>sukka</i>.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>poskim</i> of Europe, living in climates much colder than Eretz Yisrael’s, concur that when it is very cold, one is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. However, they disagree about their places of residence. According to <i>Mordekhai</i>, whose author lived in Germany, one is exempt on account of the cold, while according to Rema, from Poland, one is obligated. It would seem that in Eretz Yisrael, where the climate is much warmer, one is always obligated. In fact, though, on cold nights in the highlands, quite a few people can catch a cold sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. Perhaps this is because we are more spoiled. Nevertheless, in practice, one who is concerned about catching a cold should cover himself with heavy blankets. If experience shows him that this is still not enough, then he is considered <i>mitzta’er</i> and is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> on such nights. If one fears catching a cold in the afternoon as well, he should sleep in the house then, too.</i>
Some people simply cannot fall asleep in a <i>sukka</i>. Even though nothing in the <i>sukka</i> should bother them, they are tense from the different environment. Since, in fact, they cannot fall asleep, they are <i>mitzta’arim</i> and thus exempt. They are not obligated to build a <i>sukka</i> with brick walls so they will feel more comfortable and be able to sleep at night, for the Torah did not command us to build permanent walls to fulfill the mitzva. However, those who do so are commendable, for they will be able to fulfill the mitzva. In addition, one who is unable to sleep in the <i>sukka</i> at night must still sleep in the <i>sukka</i> by day if he wants to take a nap and is able to fall asleep in the <i>sukka</i> during the day.
If one wants to take an afternoon nap, but there are children playing noisily and disturbing him, and they will not manage to keep quiet even if he asks, he is considered <i>mitzta’er</i>. Thus, if he is tired, he may go inside to sleep.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">It is obvious that one who cannot fall asleep in the <i>sukka</i> is exempt because he is considered <i>mitzta’er</i>, although this exemption is limited to situations that would bring most people discomfort. If one is known to be delicate, and all delicate people would be <i>mitzta’er</i>, then he is exempt (Rema 640:5; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 28-29).<br>If there are guests in the <i>sukka</i> and it would be unpleasant to ask them to leave, one who needs to sleep has the status of <i>mitzta’er</i> and may sleep in the house (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:19). Some are lenient in this case only if it would be difficult for him to sleep in a neighbor’s <i>sukka</i> (R. Elyashiv, quoted in <i>Sukkat Ḥayim</i>, p. 435).</i>

Section 11

<b>11. Exemption from Sleeping – Married Men</b>
<i>Le-khatḥila</i>, a married man must build a <i>sukka</i> where he and his wife can both sleep. Even though women are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, a woman who sleeps in the <i>sukka</i> fulfills a mitzva. Moreover, if the spouses sleep separately, it diminishes their festival joy. Thus, it is proper to build a <i>sukka</i> in which both spouses can sleep (above, 2:14; <i>Harḥavot</i> 2:14:5).
If it is impossible to prepare a place for the wife to sleep in the <i>sukka</i> – for instance, if the <i>sukka</i> is too small, or there are other men who need to sleep there, and they cannot build another <i>sukka</i> just for the couple – and the couple is <i>mitzta’er</i> when they sleep apart, some say the man may sleep in their bedroom at home. This is because the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is for a man to sleep in the <i>sukka</i> in the way that he normally sleeps in his home, which is with his wife. If they cannot both sleep in the <i>sukka</i>, he is exempt (Rema 639:2). Others say that the man is exempt only if the couple are truly <i>mitzta’er</i> when they cannot sleep in their bedroom (MA <i>ad loc</i>. 8). Still others say that a married man has the same obligation to sleep in the <i>sukka</i> as a single man, and even if he is <i>mitzta’er</i> from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>, apart from his wife, he is still obligated to sleep in the <i>sukka</i>. Only on special nights (such as when he and his wife will fulfill the mitzva of having marital relations with the regularity to which they are accustomed) is he exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> (Vilna Gaon; MB 639:18).
In practice, if one is truly <i>mitzta’er</i> when he sleeps apart from his wife he must invest effort and money into building a <i>sukka</i> where they can be together. If it is very difficult for him to do so, he may, if he wants, rely on those who are lenient and sleep inside.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rema (<i>Darkhei Moshe</i> 639:3), a mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (which obligates only men) is to sleep there along with one’s wife. Indeed, many people put up a <i>sukka</i> which enables this. If it is very difficult to build such a <i>sukka</i>, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>, because being apart takes away from their joy and causes sorrow to one or both of them. This leniency applies even when the woman is a <i>nidda</i>, all the more so when she is not and being apart would cause them to neglect the mitzva of having marital relations (<i>ona</i>). <i>Taz</i> (639:9) similarly states that if a man wants to make his wife happy by sleeping in the same room as her even when she is a <i>nidda</i>, he is considered to be engaged in one mitzva (<i>ona</i>), and thus exempt from another (sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>). SAH <i>ad loc</i>. 9 concurs. However, MA <i>ad loc</i>. 8, based on <i>Shlah</i>, says that the man is exempt only if he is <i>mitzta’er</i> when he sleeps apart from his wife. <i>Levush</i> concurs. It seems that they would apply this even when the wife is a <i>nidda</i>. Vilna Gaon and <i>Sha’ar Ephraim</i> maintain that the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> does not entail sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> along with his wife. Similarly, <i>Nishmat Adam</i> (147:1) states that the mitzva to make one’s wife happy on Yom Tov is fulfilled by buying her clothing, not by sleeping in the same room as her. This is also the position of <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> (639:18) and MB (<i>ad loc.</i> 18). They add that on any night that the couple fulfills the mitzva of <i>ona</i> with their regular frequency, the husband is exempt from <i>sukka</i> for the entire night.<br>Rema in <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> writes that one who trembles at God’s word will try to build a <i>sukka</i> where he and his wife can sleep, and thus serve God with joy, and that this is the custom of those who are meticulous. This is also the view of <i>Derekh Ha-ḥayim</i>; SAH; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>; and others. Nevertheless, it would seem from the <i>poskim</i> that there is no obligation to spend a lot of money to build an extra <i>sukka</i> where he and his wife can sleep. The reason seems to be that since the <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, one needs to invest in it only what he would invest in renting an apartment for a week. It should be noted that, privacy permitting, it is permissible to have marital relations in a <i>sukka</i> (BHL 639:1 s.v. “ve-al”).</i>

Section 12

<b>12. Children, Grooms, and Mourners</b>
A child who has reached the age of <i>ḥinukh</i> (education) is obligated in <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, adults are admonished not to feed him a <i>se’udat keva</i> or put him to bed outside the <i>sukka</i>. The age of <i>ḥinukh</i> is the age at which a child understands the general parameters of the mitzva, i.e., the obligation to eat and sleep in the <i>sukka</i>. Most children reach this stage around the age of five or six (SA 640:2). However, sometimes young children are <i>mitzta’arim</i> when it comes to sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>, because they are more sensitive to the cold or because they are afraid. In such cases, they are considered <i>mitzta’er</i> and are exempt. Additionally, if the adults are sitting and studying Torah or chatting in the <i>sukka</i>, making it difficult for the child to fall asleep there, he may be put to bed in the house and later moved to the <i>sukka</i>.
It is forbidden to hold a wedding on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, because we do not mix together two joyous occasions (<i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 8a). However, those who marry before Sukkot continue the week of <i>Sheva Berakhot</i> into the festival. The Sages tell us that a groom is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>, because it lacks the privacy of a home, and the bride and groom will feel inhibited there. The Sages also tell us that the groom’s entourage and all those who came to celebrate with him are exempt from eating in the <i>sukka</i>, because <i>sukkot</i> were usually small and could not accommodate all the celebrant. Therefore, <i>Sheva Berakhot</i> meals were held outside the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 25b; SA 640:6). However, other <i>se’udot mitzva</i>, including a <i>brit</i>, <i>pidyon ha-ben</i>, bar mitzva, and <i>siyum</i>, must be held in the <i>sukka</i>, because these meals are not important enough to override the mitzva of sitting in the <i>sukka</i> (Vilna Gaon; BHL 640:6). Nowadays, we have <i>Sheva Berakhot</i> in the <i>sukka</i> as well, even though this limits the number of participants.
A mourner is obligated in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. Even if he would prefer to sit alone in his grief, he must marshal his resources and keep the <i>mitzvot</i> of the festival (<i>Sukka</i> 25a; SA 640:5). In fact, there is no mourning on Sukkot; if someone began sitting <i>shiva</i> before the festival, the arrival of the festival cancels the remainder of <i>shiva</i>, and if someone loses a close relative on Sukkot, he does not sit <i>shiva</i> on the festival. Rather, after the funeral, he continues sitting in the <i>sukka</i>, and the <i>shiva</i> begins only after the festival.
An <i>onen</i>, one whose close relative died but has not yet been buried, is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as he is preoccupied with the mitzva of burying the dead, and therefore exempt from engaging in other <i>mitzvot</i> (MB 640:31; SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 48).

Section 13

<b>13. Travelers and Those Engaged in <i>Mitzvot</i></b>
One who leaves his home to perform a mitzva, such as attending to a patient in the hospital, is exempt from <i>sukka</i>. There is a general principle that “one who is engaged in one mitzva is exempt from another mitzva” (“<i>Osek be-mitzva patur min ha-mitzva</i>”). The bother of seeking or walking to a <i>sukka</i> may impair his fulfillment of the mitzva he is already engaged in (<i>Sukka</i> 25a). Even if there is a <i>sukka</i> nearby, if there is concern that he will not sleep well there, he should sleep where he will sleep best. However, if he can fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> with no trouble, and it will not impair his fulfillment of the mitzva he is already engaged in – for example, there is a comfortable <i>sukka</i> nearby – then when the patient does not need him close by, he should eat and sleep in the <i>sukka</i> (SA 640:7; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 37-38).
Soldiers who are on guard duty and have no free time are considered to be engaged in a mitzva and need not go to the trouble of building themselves a <i>sukka</i>. However, their commanders, who are tasked with seeing to their wellbeing, should make sure to put up a comfortable <i>sukka</i> in which the soldiers can eat and (security permitting) sleep.
As a rule, one may not work on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. However, there are exceptions to this rule, like people who work in bakeries and dairies (<i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Mo’adim</i> 11:3). In these cases, if going to the <i>sukka</i> during work hours is troublesome for a worker, he is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> due to the principle of “‘<i>teshvu</i>’ – <i>ke’ein taduru</i>.” Just as all year long they do not take the trouble to eat in a set dining room, so too on Sukkot, they are not required to take the trouble to eat in a <i>sukka</i>. If all year long they would prefer to eat in a cafeteria if there is one nearby, so too on Sukkot, they must eat in a <i>sukka</i> if there is one that they can use without troubling themselves.
Similarly, if one must take a business trip on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> to avoid the loss of a significant amount of money, and it would be troublesome for him to find a <i>sukka</i> while traveling, he may eat outside a <i>sukka</i>. If he is traveling by day, he is obligated in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> at night. However, if putting up a <i>sukka</i> or traveling to one will take hours and harm the goals of the trip, he is exempt at night as well (SA and Rema 640:8; <i>Levush</i>; BHL s.v. “holkhei”).
One who must have a medical procedure on Sukkot that will cause him pain, to the point that he is considered a <i>mitzta’er</i>, is exempt from <i>sukka</i> as long as the pain endures. However, if the treatment can be performed before or after Sukkot, and he nevertheless decides to do it on Sukkot, then even though he is in pain, he is obligated in <i>sukka</i>. Since he unnecessarily inserted himself into a situation that makes him a <i>mitzta’er</i>, he is not exempt (<i>Or Zaru’a</i>; <i>Hagahot Asheri</i>; Rema 640:3).

Section 14

<b>14. Outings</b>
Families who want to go on an outing need to plan ahead so that they can eat their meals in a <i>sukka</i>. If they decide to go somewhere without a <i>sukka</i>, they should make sure not to eat <i>se’udot keva</i> during the trip. Rather, they should make do with fruits, vegetables, and a little bit of <i>mezonot</i> (above, section 5). Some disagree and maintain that when traveling, one may eat even <i>se’udot keva</i> outside of a <i>sukka</i>. Just as during the year, one who is traveling is not meticulous about eating in a house under a roof, so too on Sukkot, a traveler need not take care to eat in a <i>sukka</i>. Nevertheless, it seems that being lenient in this case is not appropriate. Only someone who is compelled to travel is exempt from <i>sukka</i>. But someone who decides to go on a pleasure trip is making a conscious decision to neglect the mitzva for no compelling reason, so he may go on a trip only if he takes care to eat all <i>se’udot keva</i> in a <i>sukka</i>.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">“Our Rabbis taught: Travelers by day are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by day and obligated by night; travelers by night are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by night and obligated by day. Travelers by both day and night are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by both day and night” (<i>Sukka</i> 26a). Some maintain that those on an outing or pleasure trip have the same status as any travelers who are exempt from <i>sukka</i>, because one must treat his <i>sukka</i> as he treats his home; just as all year round, when one goes on a nature hike, he does not take care to eat at home, so too if one goes hiking on Sukkot, he is exempt from eating in a <i>sukka</i>. This is the opinion of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (<i>He’arot Be-Masekhet</i> <i>Sukka</i>, 26a), R. Dov Lior (as quoted in R. Moshe Harari’s <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh: Hilkhot Sukkot</i>, p. 587), and R. Shlomo Aviner (<i>Responsa She’elat Shlomo</i> 2:98). In contrast, according to many, when the Sages exempted travelers from <i>sukka</i> based on the principle of “‘<i>teshvu</i>’ – <i>ke’ein taduru</i>,” they were referring to a situation where one was compelled to travel for his livelihood or another important necessity. In that case, he may behave as he does all year, when travelers eat outside the home. However, when it is not necessary to travel, this is precisely the situation about which the Torah commands us to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> and not go elsewhere to exempt oneself from the mitzva. Thus, if one decides to travel for pleasure on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, he must make sure a <i>sukka</i> is available. (We saw something similar at the end of section 13: If one decides to have a medical procedure on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> when it could have been safely delayed, Rema rules he must sit in a <i>sukka</i> even if he is in pain.) This is the opinion of R. Moshe Feinstein (<i>Igrot Moshe</i> OḤ 3:91), R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:21), R. Ovadia Yosef (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:47), and R. Yaakov Ariel (<i>Be-ohalah shel Torah</i> 2:93). Additionally, those who travel on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> are not living the way they live normally; most people can travel only occasionally or during vacation, so they take advantage of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> to travel. But the days of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> are not simply vacation days. They are sacred days that are meant to be devoted to enjoying the festival through festive meals and Torah study. Therefore, those who decide to travel must at the very least make sure to eat in a <i>sukka</i>. If they planned the trip properly, and because of some mishap out of their control they ended up somewhere without a <i>sukka</i> and are hungry, it would seem that they may eat. After all, during the year if someone hungry gets stuck somewhere away from home, he eats there.</i>
As a rule, one should make sure not to waste <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> on outings, as these holy days are meant for Torah study and festive meals. As I have written elsewhere, half the day should be dedicated to God, i.e., spent on study and prayer (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 10:6). The reason that <i>melakha</i> is forbidden on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> is to enable Torah study (<i>y</i>. <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 2:3). When one devotes the holidays to his own pleasures, God says to him, “These are not My festivals, but rather yours.” About such people it says, “Your new moons and fixed seasons fill Me with loathing; they have become a burden to Me; I cannot endure them” (Yeshayahu 1:14). However, those who dedicate <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> to Torah, prayer, and festive meals are beloved of God (<i>Shelah</i>, <i>Sukka</i>, <i>Ner Mitzva</i> 31).
Some trips have a mitzva element. One example is visiting one’s rabbi whom he does not see on a monthly basis. Another example is visiting Jerusalem in order to enjoy its courtyards, come close to the Temple Mount, and pray at the Western Wall; this is a quasi-fulfillment of the mitzva to make a pilgrimage to the Temple (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:16-17; 10:6). When people are on these types of trips and it is difficult for them to find a <i>sukka</i>, they may eat <i>se’udot keva</i> without one.

Chapter 4



Section 1

<b>1. The Mitzva of the Four Species (<i>Arba’at Ha-minim</i>)</b>
On Sukkot there is a mitzva to take the four species: <i>etrog</i> (citron), <i>lulav</i> (palm branch), <i>hadas</i> (myrtle), and <i>arava</i> (willow). As we read: “On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:40). The Gemara elaborates: “The fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” refers to an <i>etrog</i>; “branches of palm trees” to a <i>lulav</i>; “boughs of dense-leaved trees” to <i>hadasim</i>; and “willows of the brook” to <i>aravot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 35a; see Me’iri and Ritva <i>ad loc</i>. and Rambam’s introduction to<i> Peirush Ha-mishnayot</i>).
Since the <i>lulav</i> is the tallest of them all, the mitzva is referred to as “taking the <i>lulav</i>,” and the <i>berakha</i> recited is “Who has made us holy through His commandments and has commanded us about taking the <i>lulav</i>” (“<i>al netilat lulav</i>”).
On a Torah level, the mitzva only applies on the first day, as we read, “On the <b>first day</b> you shall take.” Only in the Temple precincts are we commanded to take the <i>lulav</i> each day, as we see from the continuation of the verse, “and you shall rejoice <b>before the Lord your God</b> seven days.” In practice, since there is a mitzva to go up to the Temple on the three pilgrimage festivals, in Temple times many Jews performed the mitzva of <i>lulav</i> for seven days.
After the destruction of the Temple, R. Yoḥanan ben Zakkai ordained that the <i>lulav</i> should be taken for seven days everywhere, to commemorate the Temple. Such commemorative practices are very important, as our Sages tell us that by remembering the Temple and continuing to observe the <i>mitzvot</i> that were observed there, we help to restore what was lost with the destruction and exile and hasten the redemption (<i>Sukka</i> 41a).
We take one <i>etrog</i>, one <i>lulav</i>, three <i>hadasim</i>, and two <i>aravot</i>. In pressing circumstances, one takes just one <i>hadas</i> and one <i>arava</i> but does not recite the <i>berakha</i> (SA 651:1).<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Tarfon maintains that one must take three <i>hadasim</i> and two <i>aravot</i>. Rav Yehuda, quoting Shmuel, declares that this is the <i>halakha</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 34b). This is the opinion of most of <i>poskim</i>, including <i>Behag</i>, Rambam, and Rosh, and it is the ruling of SA 651:1. Others say that the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Akiva, who maintains that one <i>hadas</i> and one <i>arava</i> are taken. Ramban and Ritva are of this opinion. Rema states that under pressing circumstances, one may rely on this view. Although some say that one even recites the <i>berakha</i> in this case (see MB <i>ad loc</i>. 6), many maintain that one should not recite the <i>berakha</i>, and we refrain from reciting <i>berakhot</i> in cases of uncertainty.</i>
If any one of the four species is very small, it is invalid. The minimum sizes are: an <i>etrog</i> must be at least an egg’s volume; the spine of the <i>lulav</i> must be at least 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> long; <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i> must be at least 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> long. There is no maximum size. As long as one can carry them, they are kosher. We will expand on these laws below (sections 7-9, 12; nn. 4, 6).

Section 2

<b>2. Expressing the Unity of the Jewish People</b>
In order to fulfill the mitzva, all four species must be taken. If any one of them is missing, the mitzva cannot be fulfilled (<i>Menaḥot</i> 27a). <i>Le-khatḥila</i> they should be taken together, the <i>lulav</i> bundled with the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i>. However, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if someone took them serially, he has fulfilled the obligation (SA 651:12; see 5:2 below).
This <i>halakha</i> teaches us something profound. Our Sages say that just as among the four species there are two that produce fruit (<i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>) and two that do not (<i>hadas</i> and <i>arava</i>), so too, in Israel there are Torah scholars and people of action. Just as the presence of all four species is necessary to fulfill the mitzva, so too the presence of both scholars and doers is necessary for the nation to thrive. Scholars cannot survive without doers, who help support them; and doers cannot survive without scholars, who enrich their lives with spiritual content and help connect them to the next world (based on <i>Menaḥot</i> 27a; <i>Ḥullin</i> 92a; <i>Tanḥuma</i> Emor; R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at, <i>Hilkhot Lulav</i>).
A more elaborate midrash explains that the four species represent four types of people. The <i>etrog</i>, which both tastes and smells good, corresponds to Jews who are full of both Torah and good deeds. The <i>lulav</i> (date palm), whose fruits taste good, but which has no smell, corresponds to Torah scholars who are full of Torah but do not perform many good deeds. The <i>hadas</i>, which smells good but has no taste, corresponds to people who perform good deeds but are not Torah scholars. The <i>arava</i>, which has neither taste nor smell, represents simple Jews who do not have much Torah or many good deeds. At first glance, we might think that their lives are not worth that much, and they will be unable to reach the next world. But God says: “Bundle them all together, and they will atone for one another.” When this is done, God is exalted and the supernal chambers are built up, as we read (Amos 9:6): “He builds His chambers in heaven when His bundle is established on earth” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:12).
Our Sages further suggest that the four species correspond to the founders of the Jewish people: the three patriarchs and Yosef, or the four matriarchs. They also suggest (based on wordplay) that the species hint at the Sanhedrin and Torah scholars (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:9-11).

Section 3

<b>3. Additional Symbolism</b>
The Torah links the principle of <i>hidur</i> (beauty) to the <i>etrog</i>, which both tastes and smells good, corresponding to wholesome people who both study Torah and perform good deeds, and thus alluding to the wholesomeness that will be achieved in the future. As we will learn, we are more meticulous about the <i>hidur</i> and magnificence of the <i>etrog</i> than we are about the other species.
The <i>lulav</i> corresponds to Torah scholars, who represent the holy Torah, even if they do not perform many good deeds. Just as the <i>lulav</i> is taller than all the other species, so the Torah is above everything. The Sages ordained that the <i>berakha</i> is recited on the <i>lulav</i>, indicating that there is nothing more exalted than the Torah.
The basic condition for Torah study is that it must remain connected to, and united with, the entire Jewish people. Even though Torah contains different opinions and perspectives, it all comes from a single source, and the pieces will ultimately join together again. The unique form of the <i>lulav</i> expresses this unity. Its leaves grow on opposite sides of the spine, but they remain close to it, in unity. There are many leaves, but they are not separate. Rather each one overlaps with the next and just adds a little bit of its own. Together, the leaves cover the spine. Furthermore, each leaf is actually two leaves, held together at the tip (the <i>tiyomet</i>, as explained in section 6). The straightness of the <i>lulav</i> also expresses unity, as it is entirely oriented toward one goal. If a <i>lulav</i> is crooked, it is invalid because it faces in two directions. Thus, our Sages state, “Just as the palm has only one heart, so too Israel has only one heart, for their Father in Heaven” (<i>Sukka</i> 45b). Additionally, our Sages state, “The palm branches (<i>kapot</i>) are Torah scholars, who force (<i>kofin</i>) themselves to learn Torah from one another” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:11). Thus, the <i>lulav</i> alludes to Torah, which has disagreements and different views that all stem from one source and share a common goal. This idea should inspire Torah scholars to increase peace and unity in the world. (See <i>Berakhot</i> 64a and <i>Ein Aya ad loc.</i>)
<i>Hadasim</i> allude to <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds. The impact of good deeds radiates outward like a pleasant fragrance. The Sages say that the righteous are referred to as <i>hadasim</i>, and it is in their merit that the world endures (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 93a). It is through the practice of <i>mitzvot</i> that holiness is revealed in the activities of daily life. This discloses the value of this world, and it thus is worthy of enduring. The <i>hadasim</i> also allude to the mitzva to procreate and to educate one’s children. Its threefold leaves express increase, and the Sages say that the <i>hadas</i> alludes to our forebears Yaakov and Leah: “Just as the <i>hadas</i> is surrounded by leaves, so Yaakov was surrounded by children…and so Leah was surrounded by children” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:10). Women who undertake the difficult jobs of having children, bringing them up, and educating them are the ones who primarily have the privilege of revealing the holiness of daily life.
At first glance, it would seem that the <i>arava</i> has no stature at all. It has neither aroma nor taste, neither Torah nor good deeds. But it has incredible growing power and expresses the vitality and beauty of this world, the “common decency” which precedes Torah study. Therefore, the <i>arava</i> has great value, just as the vitality of simple Jews sustains Torah scholars and doers. Out of this vitality, Torah giants grow. We are witness to this frequently – people who are notable for their Torah knowledge or good deeds emerge from simple families.
Furthermore, the <i>arava</i> expresses the condition of Israel in this world. On the one hand, this world naturally has tremendous potential for growth, and through it God’s name can be sanctified in incomparable ways. On the other hand, holiness does not regularly manifest itself in this world. So too, the <i>arava</i> has no taste or smell, and when it does not receive water, which alludes to Torah and faith, it withers rapidly, just as when our Temple was destroyed, and we were exiled. We also find the Sages stating (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:10) that the <i>arava</i> alludes to Raḥel and Yosef: On the one hand, the existence of the Jews in this world is thanks to them, for all of Yaakov’s children were born because of his desire to marry Raḥel, and Israel’s continued existence in Egypt was thanks to the actions of the righteous Yosef, who laid the groundwork there that allowed them to flourish. On the other hand, since Raḥel and Yosef were connected to this-worldly life, which tends to distance people from the spiritual source of life, they both died younger than their siblings. Nevertheless, they are the ones who take the primary role in uncovering the redemptive elements in this world. Raḥel and Yosef’s extraordinary beauty alludes to this. This is also what the Sages mean when they say that during the future redemption, all trees will start bearing fruit (<i>Ketubot</i> 112b).
We see that all the species are needed alike, and only by unifying these forces can Israel fulfill its destiny, improve the world, and benefit all of creation in accordance with the word of God.

Section 4

<b>4. What Invalidates the Four Species</b>
There are five categories of disqualification that invalidate the four species: 1) The species must be those which the Torah specifies, and no others. The “fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” is an <i>etrog</i> and not a lemon. Even a hybrid <i>etrog</i> is invalid (section 10 below). “Boughs of dense-leaved trees” are <i>hadasim</i> with threefold leaves, not wild <i>hadasim</i>. One must take a willow branch, not a poplar branch.
2) They must retain their natural form. Thus, if the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> grow on only one side, or most of the leaves of the <i>hadas</i> or <i>arava</i> have fallen off, they are invalid.
3) They must be of the required size. If they are too small, they would not be referred to as “the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” or “branches of a palm tree” or “boughs of dense-leaved trees” or “willows of the brook” (as explained in sections 7-9 and 12 below). If a specimen does not meet these three requirements, it is invalid for the entire festival.
4) They must possess <i>hadar</i> (beauty, aesthetic pleasantness), that is, they have not lost their natural form and beauty – for example, by completely drying out, even if they retain their basic shape. Most <i>poskim</i> invalidate specimens that lack <i>hadar</i> only on the first Yom Tov (Rambam; Ramban). Others say that this invalidates them all seven days (Rosh).
5) They must be whole. When it comes to an <i>etrog</i>, this means it must not be missing any flesh (section 11 below); regarding a <i>lulav</i>, it means the <i>tiyomet</i> must not be split (section 6 below). These defects invalidate the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i> on the first Yom Tov, but do not invalidate them during the rest of the festival. (See <i>Sukka</i> 34b; <i>Tosafot ad loc</i>. s.v. “she-tehei”; Rashi on 36b, s.v. “u-meshaninan.”)
Thus, to disqualify a specimen, it must have undergone a significant change. It follows that the stress that some people feel when choosing their specimens is unwarranted. True, in the upcoming sections we will deal extensively with the various defects that invalidate the four species, but these issues rarely come up. Even though most of the specimens on sale are kosher, Jewish practice is to enhance the mitzva by choosing beautiful specimens, as the Torah says, “This is my God and I will glorify Him (<i>ve-anvehu</i>)” (Shemot 15:2), which the Sages expound to mean: “Beautify (<i>hitna’eh</i>) yourself before Him through <i>mitzvot</i>: Make a beautiful (<i>na’ah</i>) <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful (<i>na’eh</i>) <i>lulav</i>…” (<i>Shabbat</i> 133b). This, however, should not be a source of stress.
When circumstances are pressing and it is impossible to obtain kosher specimens, one may fulfill the mitzva using specimens that lack <i>hadar</i> or are not whole (requirements 4 and 5 above), such as a <i>lulav</i> which is dried out or has a split <i>tiyomet</i>. According to most <i>poskim</i>, one even recites the <i>berakha</i> when taking them; others say that one does not recite it.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">“R. Yehuda said: ‘It happened that city-dwellers would bequeath their <i>lulavim</i> to their children (i.e., a dried -out <i>lulav</i> is kosher).’ [The Sages] said to him: ‘Pressing circumstances are no proof’” (<i>Sukka</i> 31a-b). Thus, even the Sages agree that a dry <i>lulav</i> may be used under pressing circumstances. According to Raavad, they would use dry <i>lulavim</i> only so that the mitzva would not be forgotten, but they did not recite the <i>berakha</i>. SA 649:6 shows concern for this position. In contrast, Rambam maintains that one does recite the <i>berakha</i> over a dry <i>lulav</i>, but not over a <i>lulav</i> disqualified for one of the other reasons. According to the vast majority of Rishonim, under pressing circumstances one may recite the <i>berakha</i> over the four species even if they are not <i>hadar</i> or are incomplete. These include R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at; <i>Maḥzor Vitri</i> §373; Rabbeinu Tam; Rid; <i>Itur</i>; <i>Ha-manhig</i>; Raavya 2:653; Rosh (<i>Sukka</i> 3:14); <i>Smag</i>; <i>Or Zaru’a</i>; and many more. This is also the view of Radbaz; MA; <i>Eliya Rabba</i>; and MB 649:58.</i>
In addition to the five types of disqualification, which relate to the specimens themselves, one also does not fulfill the mitzva with a stolen specimen. On the first Yom Tov, even a borrowed specimen is invalid (as explained below in section 13). Additionally, anything dedicated for idolatry is invalid to fulfill the mitzva (SA 649:3).

Section 5

<b>5. The <i>Lulav</i></b>
<i>Lulav</i> leaves grow from both sides of the <i>lulav</i> and cover the spine. A <i>lulav</i> is invalid if it has leaves on only one side of the spine, while the second side is bare (SA 645:3). 
Generally, the <i>lulav</i>’s leaves grow one atop the other, covering the entire spine. If its leaves are so short that one leaf does not reach the one above it, it is invalid (SA 645:4).
The branches of the palm tree begin as <i>lulavim</i>, branches whose leaves are all tight to the spine. As the branch continues to grow, the leaves open, forming the fan-like branches that people associate with date trees. At this point they are referred to as <i>ḥariyot</i>.
<i>Le-khatḥila</i> it is best if the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> are tight to the spine, such that if the <i>lulav</i> is left on a table, the leaves still cling tightly to it without assistance. If the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> have started to open, the <i>lulav</i> is kosher as long as the leaves can be bound together and pulled tight to the spine. This is referred to as “a <i>lulav</i> whose leaves have separated.” If the opening leaves have hardened so that it is impossible to bind them together and draw them flat to the spine of the <i>lulav</i>, then the <i>lulav</i> is invalid. This is referred to as “a <i>lulav</i> whose leaves have broken free” (<i>Sukka</i> 29b; SA 645:1-2).
If the <i>lulav</i> has become so crooked that it is semicircular, like a scythe, it is invalid. If it is not so crooked, it is kosher but not <i>mehudar</i> (especially beautiful), as straightness is a feature that makes a <i>lulav</i> beautiful. If it is bent like a scythe, but the curve is toward the spine, this is somewhat common natural curvature, so the <i>lulav</i> is kosher (SA 645:8).
If the spine is bent over at an angle, it is invalid (SA 645:9). Some say that even if just the leaves are bent at an angle, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid (<i>Taz</i>; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 40-41). However, if just the tips of the uppermost leaves are bent like the letter <i>vav</i>, the <i>lulav</i> is kosher, as some <i>lulavim</i> grow this way.
Some say that if the tips of the uppermost leaves are bent over like the letter <i>peh</i>, resembling a button (a “<i>knepel</i>”), the <i>lulav</i> is invalid (Ran and Ritva). Others maintain that such a <i>lulav</i> is actually <i>mehudar</i>, as this ensures that the <i>tiyomet</i> of the upper leaf will not open (Rosh). In practice, this <i>lulav</i> is kosher, as many <i>lulavim</i> grow this way. However, since some are stringent, it is not considered <i>mehudar</i> (SA 645:9 and MB <i>ad loc.</i> 42).

Section 6

<b>6. A Split <i>Tiyomet</i></b>
Every leaf in a <i>lulav</i> is comprised of two leaflets joined together by the posterior edge. The place where they are joined is called the “<i>tiyomet</i>,” because it makes each pair of leaflets resemble conjoined twins (“<i>te’omim</i>”). As the <i>lulavim</i> continue to grow and develop into <i>ḥariyot</i>, the tips of the leaves open up. The first to open is the central, uppermost leaf in the <i>lulav</i>. Since the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> are naturally closed because they are connected at the <i>tiyomet</i>, when the <i>tiyomet</i> opens, the <i>lulav</i> is considered deficient, not whole. Thus, even though it still looks like a <i>lulav</i>, it is disqualified for use on the first Yom Tov, as all the species must be whole. However, it may be used on subsequent days.
The <i>poskim</i> disagree about how to define a split <i>tiyomet</i>. Some say the <i>lulav</i> is invalid only if most of the <i>tiyomot</i> of most of the leaves are split (Rif and Rambam). Others say the law of the split <i>tiyomet</i> applies only to the upper, central leaf, since it is the most prominent and discernible of the leaves; if most of this <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid (Ge’onim and Ran). The <i>halakha</i> in practice follows the latter view: on the first Yom Tov, if most of the central <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> may not be used. In truth, in the vast majority of <i>lulavim</i>, most of the central leaf is closed, so almost all <i>lulavim</i> are kosher for use even on the first Yom Tov. Some are meticulous to avoid, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, a <i>lulav</i> whose central <i>tiyomet</i> has even a small split. However, there are very few <i>lulavim</i> where the <i>tiyomet</i> is completely closed, and the more developed and beautiful the <i>lulav</i>, the more likely that a bit of its uppermost leaf will be open. It would seem preferable to use a large, beautiful <i>lulav</i> with a slightly open central leaf than a small, shriveled <i>lulav</i> with a closed upper leaf. If one is concerned that the central leaf will continue to open and be mostly open by the first Yom Tov, he may glue it together to prevent its disqualification.
If there are two leaves at the central tip of the <i>lulav</i>, the <i>tiyomet</i> of each one has to be mostly closed. However, if these two leaves separate from one another, the <i>lulav</i> is kosher since they are two different leaves (MB 645:15; <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Mishbetzot Zahav ad loc.</i> 4).
Some prefer to use a <i>lulav</i> which has “<i>korei</i>,” a flaky brown membrane that keeps the leaves together. In their view, as long as there is a <i>korei</i> on the leaves, they are considered closed. However, others say that <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is preferable to take a <i>lulav</i> without a <i>korei</i>, for two reasons: First, they maintain that the <i>korei</i> does not ensure that the central leaf is closed. True, it is not necessary to worry that it is mostly split underneath the <i>korei</i>, because that is extraordinarily rare, but it is possible that a small split is hidden underneath, which is not <i>mehudar</i> according to some. Second, Ashkenazic custom is to shake the <i>lulav</i> in such a way that it rustles. When a <i>lulav</i> has <i>korei</i>, this cannot be done.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">According to most Rishonim, including Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Rif, Rambam, and Ramban, a split <i>tiyomet</i> invalidates a <i>lulav</i> if the majority of the leaves are split most of the way down. SA 645:3 rules this way. According to R. Paltoi Gaon and Ran, if the central leaf’s <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid. Even though most Rishonim are lenient, on the first Yom Tov almost no Aḥaronim allow using a <i>lulav</i> if the <i>tiyomet</i> of its central leaf is split. Within that view, some say the <i>lulav</i> is invalid only if the <i>tiyomet</i> is split all the way down (Rema; SAH; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>), while others invalidate it even when it is split only most of the way down (Ran; <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>; <i>Baḥ</i>; Vilna Gaon; MB 645:19). Some write that a <i>lulav</i> whose central leaf has not opened is most <i>mehudar</i>, but there is a disagreement about this <i>hidur</i>. <i>Taz</i> says it means it is not split more than a <i>tefaḥ</i>, while <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> and <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> say it cannot be split at all. In any case, since we are talking about a <i>hidur</i>, and it is the subject of dispute, it is better to look for <i>lulavim</i> that are beautiful in other ways.<br>In the opinion of <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 645:9, when the middle leaf is closed by the <i>korei</i>, it is considered closed even if it turns out after the <i>korei</i> is removed that it was open. From this perspective, a <i>lulav</i> with <i>korei</i> is <i>mehudar</i>. This is the ruling of R. Mordechai Eliyahu. However, <i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> 645:4 maintains that having <i>korei</i> does not mean the <i>lulav</i> is considered closed. Many defer to this opinion. Therefore, those who want to ensure that the <i>lulav</i> is closed according to all opinions prefer one without <i>korei</i> (Ḥazon Ish; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>; <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 645 n. 13). For those who follow Ashkenazic custom, there is another reason that a <i>lulav</i> without <i>korei</i> is better: it rustles when shaken (<i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 645:2). However, according to SA (651:9), there is no need for it to rustle.</i>

Section 7

<b>7. The Requisite Size of a <i>Lulav</i> and a Canary Island Date Palm <i>Lulav</i></b>
If most the upper leaves of a <i>lulav</i> were pared or truncated, or the central leaf is pared or truncated, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid for use on the first Yom Tov (SA and Rema 645:6). If there is a thorn-like protrusion on the tip of the uppermost leaf, it is not considered part of the <i>lulav</i>, so even if it is singed or cut off, the <i>lulav</i> is kosher even according to the most meticulous.
A <i>lulav</i> whose uppermost leaf ends in a zigzag, as sometimes happens, is kosher<i> le-khatḥila</i>.
If most of a <i>lulav</i>’s leaves have dried out and turned white, with no green left at all, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid (SA 645:5).
The spine of a <i>lulav</i> must be at least 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> tall (c. 32 cm, or 25.3 cm in pressing circumstances). This is the minimum size required to fulfill the obligation. However, it is a <i>hidur</i> for the <i>lulav</i> to be tall, as is accepted (MA 672:3).<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Tarfon, the <i>tefaḥim</i> used to measure the four species are a sixth smaller than standard <i>tefaḥim</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 32b). <i>Tosafot</i>, Rabbeinu Yona, Rosh, and Ran rule this way. However, the four species are measured using standard <i>tefaḥim</i>, according to Rif and Rambam (following the general principle that we rule in accordance with the first Tanna quoted in a <i>mishna</i>). The SA and Rema rule that <i>le-khatḥila</i> we use standard measurements, but when circumstances are pressing, we are lenient. The <i>berakha</i> is recited even when the smaller measurements are used (SA and Rema 603:1). As we have seen previously, there is also disagreement as to the size of a standard <i>tefaḥ</i>. According to R. Ḥayim Naeh it is 8 cm, which means that a <i>lulav</i> must be 32 cm <i>le-khatḥila</i>, and 26.6 cm under pressing circumstances. Based on updated measurements, a <i>tefaḥ</i> is 7.6 cm, which means that a <i>lulav</i> must be 30.4 cm <i>le-khatḥila</i> and 25.3 cm under pressing circumstances. Nevertheless, what I write above does not follow the updated measurements. This is because R. Naeh’s measurements have been in use for the last couple of generations (and involve round numbers). However, when necessary, the updated measurements can be used, because really they are the correct ones. (See above, ch. 2 n.1. There is a more stringent <i>shi’ur</i> following <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i> and Ḥazon Ish, according to which a <i>tefaḥ</i> is 9.6 cm. Following this, a <i>lulav</i> should be 38.4 cm <i>le</i>-<i>khatḥila</i> and 32 cm if circumstances are pressing.)</i>
In recent times a question has arisen concerning the validity of <i>lulavim</i> from a particular species of date palm imported from the Canary Islands. The Canary Island date palm differs from the common date palm in several respects: its leaves are shorter, denser, and softer; it is greener, and its dates do not taste good; its spine is softer and more flexible, bending in whichever direction it is tilted.
Those who deem the Canary Island date palm acceptable maintain that since it comes from a palm tree that produces dates, it is kosher, despite all the differences (<i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 8:22; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach). Others say that since its dates are not so edible and it differs from the common date palm in so many ways, it does not qualify as the “branches of palm trees” referred to in the verse (<i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 4:123). In practice, since there are acceptable species of the date palm similar to the Canary Island date palm, the reasoning of those who are lenient seems more convincing. Nevertheless, since this is the subject of dispute, it is preferable to avoid using a <i>lulav</i> from a Canary Island date palm. When circumstances are pressing, one may rely on those who are lenient, use it, and recite the <i>berakha</i>.

Section 8

<b>8. The <i>Hadas</i></b>
“Boughs of dense-leaved trees (<i>anaf etz avot</i>)” are myrtle branches whose leaves grow in groups of three, look like braids, and cover the stem, making them look like densely-leaved boughs. Each group of three leaves must sprout from the same node, that is, from the same height; if a <i>hadas</i> has one leaf higher or lower than the other two, it is referred to as a “wild <i>hadas</i>” and is invalid (<i>Sukka</i> 32b; SA 646:3). A healthy, vibrant <i>hadas</i> normally has three leaves sprouting from each node. One need not be too exacting; as long as the three leaves appear to the naked eye to sprout from the same height along the branch, they are threefold, even if one is in fact slightly higher than the others.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Sometimes, the leaves look threefold at first glance, but upon closer examination, it becomes clear that one leaf is a little higher than the others. Nevertheless, the principle is that if the leaves look threefold at first glance, they are deemed threefold. This is evident from the practice of many <i>poskim</i>, who give the <i>hadas</i> a cursory glance, and therefore this is the <i>halakha</i>. (See <i>Harḥavot</i> 4:8:1.) Some are more meticulous, but even according to them, if the petiole of all three leaves intersects a common plane, it is kosher. The petiole (the part of the leaf that connects to the stem) is generally at least 2 mm long, so if one leaf is 1.5 mm higher than the others, all three still intersect a common horizontal plane – some at the top of the petiole and some at its base.</i>
Three <i>hadasim</i> must be taken together with the <i>lulav</i>, and each must be at least 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> tall (c. 24 cm; under pressing circumstances, 19 cm). There is no limit on how long a <i>hadas</i> may be. Even if it is very long indeed, it is still kosher, but when bundling the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>lulav</i> together, one should make sure that the <i>lulav</i> extends at least a <i>tefaḥ</i> higher than the <i>hadasim</i> (SA 650:1-2; see 5:2 below).
<i>Le-khathila</i>, the threefold leaves must cover the full length of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, as some maintain that the <i>hadas</i> is invalid otherwise (Ge’onim). However, in practice, if the threefold leaves cover most of the 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the <i>hadas</i> is kosher, as this is the position of most <i>poskim</i> (Raavad; Rosh; SA 646:5). Even if the branch is 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> long or more, as long as the threefold leaves cover the majority of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, it is kosher. If there are at least 3 full <i>tefaḥim</i> of threefold leaves, even if the branch also has leaves that are not threefold, the <i>hadas</i> is kosher even for the most scrupulous (<i>Baḥ</i>; see BHL 646:9, end of s.v. “u-le’ikuva”).<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">See above, n. 4. According to R. Naeh, <i>hadasim</i> must be 24 cm long. According to the updated measurements they must be 22.8 cm long, and 19 cm under pressing circumstances. (According to Ḥazon Ish, they must be 28.8 cm long.) The length is determined by measuring the branch, not including the leaves that extend beyond it. To fulfill the mitzva <i>le-khatḥila</i>, the branch should be measured from where the lowest leaves start growing. When calculating whether threefold leaves cover the majority, most of the length of the branch must be threefold, and <i>le-khatḥila</i> most of the nodes must be threefold. If initially there were three leaves at each node, and one leaf per node fell off, some say it is kosher (Ra’ah; Rabbeinu Yeruḥam; Ritva), and others disqualify it (Ran; <i>Beit Yosef</i>). According to many Aḥaronim, one may be lenient under pressing circumstances (SHT 646:21).</i>
The <i>hadas</i> produces small berries. They start out green and turn red and black. If the berries are green, the <i>hadas</i> is kosher. If they are red or black, and the number of berries exceeds the number of leaves across 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the <i>hadas</i> is invalid because it is of a spotted color. If one picks off the berries, it reverts to being kosher, but one may not remove the berries on Yom Tov, as it looks like he is fixing something (<i>Sukka</i> 33b; SA 646:2, 11).
Sometimes additional branches grow between the leaves. It is recommended to prune them (SHT 646:36).
If the top of a <i>hadas</i> is truncated, it is preferable to take a different one, as some maintain that such a <i>hadas</i> is invalid (Raavad; <i>Ha-ma’or</i>). If no other <i>hadas</i> is available, the branch should be cut in such a way that the leaves hide the truncated part, and then one may recite a <i>berakha</i> on it (SA 646:10; SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 32).
A <i>hadas</i> whose leaves have withered is still kosher. However, if it has become completely desiccated, to the point that it crumbles to the touch and lost all its greenness, it is invalid. If the <i>hadas</i> was soaked in water for a day and is no longer blanched and crumbly, we see it was not entirely desiccated, and it is kosher (SA 646:6-7; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 20).

Section 9

<b>9. The <i>Arava</i></b>
There are three criteria that an <i>arava</i> must meet: 1) The leaves are elongated, like a brook, but not symmetrical; 2) the edges of the leaves must be smooth; 3) the stem must be reddish – even if it is green when young, it must be of a species that reddens later. The poplar is similar to the <i>arava</i>, but it lacks those features. Its leaves are symmetrically elongated, its leaves are serrated, and its stem is green. True, there is a type of <i>arava</i> whose leaf edges are not smooth, but its serrations are gentler than those of the poplar (<i>Sukka</i> 33b; SA 647:1).
Since most <i>aravot</i> grow alongside streams, they are known as “willows of the brook.” Still, this is not a necessary condition for a kosher <i>arava</i>; rather, any type of willow, even one that grows in the mountains or deserts, is absolutely kosher, even for the most meticulous.
One must take two <i>aravot</i> together with the <i>lulav</i>. Each <i>arava</i> must be at least 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> long (c. 24 cm, or 19 cm under pressing circumstances; see notes 4 and 6). There is no limit as to their length; they are kosher even if very long. However, when bundling the <i>aravot</i> with the <i>lulav</i>, one should make certain that the <i>lulav</i> extends at least a <i>tefaḥ</i> above the <i>aravot</i> (SA 650:1-2; below, 5:2).
The primary characteristic of the willow tree is that it is full of vitality and growth potential, so naturally it grows near water. When an <i>arava</i> is deprived of water, it quickly dries out. If most of its leaves dry out, to the point where it pales and loses its greenness, it is invalid. If the leaves are withered but not completely dried out, it is kosher <i>be-di’avad</i> (SA 647:2). Since <i>aravot</i> dry out quickly, those who are meticulous replace their <i>aravot</i> several times during the course of the festival. Sometimes, if the <i>aravot</i> are kept in a sealed plastic case and removed only to be used for the mitzva, their beauty is preserved for the entire festival.
If most of the leaves fall off an <i>arava</i>, it is invalid. One must watch out for this, because sometimes leaves get pulled off when inserting the <i>aravot</i> into the <i>lulav</i> bundle (SA 647:10).
If the top of an <i>arava</i> was truncated, the <i>arava</i> is invalid because it lacks <i>hadar</i>. However, if the top leaf falls off but the stem remains whole, it is kosher (MB 647:10).

Section 10

<b>10. A Grafted <i>Etrog</i> and the Status of the <i>Pitam</i></b>
The “fruit of the <i>hadar</i> tree” that we are commanded to take on Sukkot is the <i>etrog</i>. The identity of the <i>etrog</i> is a tradition passed down from generation to generation. Just as with all fruits, there are different varieties of <i>etrog</i>: some large, some small, some yellow, some greenish – and all kosher.
A few hundred years ago, a serious problem arose. Since the <i>etrog</i> tree is delicate, sensitive, and susceptible to disease, its cultivators (most of whom were non-Jews) often grafted an <i>etrog</i> branch onto a lemon or bitter orange tree. Although some <i>poskim</i> were lenient about these <i>etrogim</i>, the accepted ruling is that an <i>etrog</i> that grows from a grafted tree is invalid. For the Torah commands that an <i>etrog</i> be taken, whereas a grafted <i>etrog</i> is considered a new being or a combination of two fruits, an <i>etrog</i> and whichever tree the <i>etrog</i> branch was grafted to (Rema; MA; <i>Shvut Yaakov</i>). Others invalidate it because it is the product of a prohibited action – it is forbidden to graft the branch of one tree onto the trunk of another (<i>Levush</i>). Nowadays, <i>etrog</i> growers are careful to avoid hybrids, so one can rely on sellers when they state that their <i>etrogim</i> are not grafted.
All <i>etrogim</i> start out with a <i>pitam</i> (blossom-end), but it usually dries out and falls off while the <i>etrog</i> is very small. These <i>etrogim</i> without a <i>pitam</i> are kosher <i>le-khatḥila</i> and are not deficient in any way, as this is how they grow. There are some varieties of <i>etrogim</i> that are more likely to retain their <i>pitam</i>. Sometimes the <i>pitam</i> is very robust and fleshy, and other times it is dry and woody. There is a spray that stops the <i>pitam</i> from drying out and falling off, and cultivators who want to grow <i>etrogim</i> with fleshy <i>pitams</i> use it.
A fleshy <i>pitam</i> is the same color as the <i>etrog</i>, and its flesh resembles the flesh of the <i>etrog</i>. At its tip is a <i>shoshanta</i> (stigma), a dry, woody flower knob. The fleshy <i>pitam</i> has the same status as the tip of the <i>etrog</i> in every respect. Any deficiency or stain that invalidates the <i>etrog</i> when found on its sloping top (“nose”) also invalidates it when found on the fleshy part of the <i>pitam</i>. With regard to the <i>shoshanta</i>, if it is entirely missing, the <i>etrog</i> is invalid, but if enough remains of it to cover the flesh of the <i>pitam</i>, the <i>etrog</i> is kosher. (See <i>Harḥavot</i> 4:10:7-9.)
The status of a woody <i>pitam</i> is more lenient. If the <i>pitam</i> is completely missing, so that nothing at all protrudes, the <i>etrog</i> is invalid. If even a tiny bit of it remains protruding from the <i>etrog</i>, the <i>etrog</i> is kosher (SA 648:7; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 30).
If the entire <i>oketz</i> – the end of the branch that joins the <i>etrog</i> to the tree – is missing and the flesh of the <i>etrog</i> is visible, the <i>etrog</i> may not be used for the first Yom Tov because it is deficient. If enough of the <i>oketz</i> remains to cover the flesh of the <i>etrog</i>, the <i>etrog</i> is kosher and may be used even on the first Yom Tov (SA 648:8; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 33).

Section 11

<b>11. Deficiency and Stains</b>
An <i>etrog</i> that was pierced and is missing a piece (<i>ḥaser</i>, deficient) is invalid for use on the first Yom Tov, as the <i>etrog</i> used then must be whole, as it is written: “On the first day you shall take (<i>u-lekaḥtem</i>)” (Vayikra 23:40). Our Sages expound: “<i>lekaḥtem</i>” means “<i>lekiḥa tama</i>” – something whole must be taken. However, during the rest of the festival, even if part of the <i>etrog</i> is missing, it is kosher. Even on the first Yom Tov, if the <i>etrog</i> was damaged by a thorn, and it is uncertain whether the <i>etrog</i> is missing a part, the <i>etrog</i> is kosher. Additionally, even if it is clear that the <i>etrog</i> was missing a piece, but it continued to grow and the site of the damage scabbed over, the <i>etrog</i> is kosher for the first Yom Tov (SA 648:2; <i>Harḥavot</i> 4:11:1-4).
If a <i>ḥazazit</i> – a sort of festering lesion – is found on the <i>etrog</i> and cannot be peeled off without removing some of the <i>etrog</i>’s flesh, then if the <i>ḥazazit</i> covers most of the <i>etrog</i>, it is invalid. Similarly, if a <i>ḥazazit</i> was found in two or three places that are spread out over most of the <i>etrog</i>, even if the <i>ḥazazit</i>, in the aggregate, does not cover most of the <i>etrog</i>, the <i>etrog</i> is invalid since it looks spotted. If the <i>ḥazazit</i> appears on the nose – the sloping upper part – of the <i>etrog</i>, even if it is small, if it stands out to a cursory glance, the <i>etrog</i> is invalid. A black, white, or strange-colored stain has the same status as a <i>ḥazazit</i> (SA 648:9-13, 16). These lesions and stains are very rare, as only anomalies invalidate the four species.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>ḥazazit</i> invalidates the <i>etrog</i> because it is lacking <i>hadar</i> (<i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i> 649:5), so according to most Rishonim as well as SA 649:5, it invalidates only for the first Yom Tov, and according to Rosh and Rema, it invalidates for the entire festival (section 4 above). Rema further writes that cutting off the <i>ḥazazit</i> after the first Yom Tov does not validate it for use then, because even though a deficient <i>etrog</i> is kosher after the first Yom Tov, in this case, since the new defect is created by the removal of the original defect, it remains invalid. However, in practice one may be lenient in this case, since SA and most <i>poskim</i> say the <i>etrog</i> is kosher after the first Yom Tov even if the <i>ḥazazit</i> is not removed (so states MB <i>ad loc</i>. 38). Additionally, according to <i>Taz</i> (649:9) and <i>Pri Megadim</i>, it is unclear whether a <i>ḥazazit</i> invalidates due to lack of <i>hadar</i> or because it is considered deficient. If the reason is that it is deficient, all agree that it invalidates only on the first Yom Tov. Therefore, when circumstances are pressing, one may be lenient for the rest of the festival and use an <i>etrog</i> with a <i>ḥazazit</i>, even without cutting it off (MB 649:49 and SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 53).</i>
Common yellow, gray, and brown stains (<i>bletlekh</i>) do not invalidate the <i>etrog</i>, as they are normal for <i>etrogim</i>. These stains are generally caused by the <i>etrog</i>’s contact with leaves and branches, which lightly scratch it. The scratch causes the discharge of a liquid that forms a crust on the outside of the <i>etrog</i>. If these stains protrude and cannot be removed without taking off some of the flesh of the <i>etrog</i>, some people avoid using this <i>etrog</i> except in pressing circumstances (MB 648:50, 53). However, in practice, even if the stains protrude and cannot be scraped off, they do not invalidate the <i>etrog</i>, since they are commonly found on <i>etrogim</i>. Nevertheless, the more stains an <i>etrog</i> has, the less beautiful and <i>mehudar</i> it is.
It should be noted that after an <i>etrog</i> is picked, if it absorbs a light blow, there is concern that it will be damaged and discharge some clear liquid that will form a brown stain on the site. Though this stain does not invalidate the <i>etrog</i>, it does impair its beauty. For this reason, people generally wrap their <i>etrog</i> in flax or styrofoam mesh. If an <i>etrog</i> absorbs a blow, the discharged liquid should be rinsed off so that no stain forms.

Section 12

<b>12. More Laws Concerning the <i>Etrog</i></b>
A black <i>etrog</i> is invalid, because this is not the normal color of an <i>etrog</i> (SA 648:17). An <i>etrog</i> that is dark green is invalid because it is immature. But if it is clear that it will turn yellow under the right circumstances (e.g., if left to ripen with apples), even when it is still dark green, it is kosher (SA 648:21). An <i>etrog</i> that has turned orange is kosher (<i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i> 648).
For an <i>etrog</i> to be kosher, it must be fit to eat. Therefore, an <i>etrog</i> is invalid if it is <i>orla</i> or if it has not had <i>teruma</i> and <i>ma’aser</i> taken from it (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 8:2).
An <i>etrog</i> is invalid if it is smaller than a <i>keveitza</i> (c. 50 cc), because it is immature. However, if it is a <i>keveitza</i>, then even though it is still unripe, it is kosher. There is no upward limit on size. Even if carrying an <i>etrog</i> requires both hands, it is kosher (SA 648:22). Some are stringent and require the <i>etrog</i> to be at least the volume of two eggs (100 cc). Although we do not follow this opinion, but rather rule that an <i>etrog</i> of 50 cc is kosher (<i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10 n. 11), <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is preferable to beautify the mitzva, and part of this is for the <i>etrog</i> to be normal-sized and not small.
A dried-up <i>etrog</i> – one that does not discharge any liquid, so that if one pierces it all the way through with a threaded needle, the thread will remain dry (SA 648:1) – is invalid because it lacks <i>hadar</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 31a and 34b). Any <i>etrog</i> left over from the previous year is assumed to be dried out (Rema <i>ad loc</i>.). However, if it was kept carefully in a refrigerator or a sealed bag, even after a year, it may retain some moisture and thus be kosher (<i>Bikurei Yaakov ad loc.</i> 4; SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 8).
An <i>etrog</i> is invalid if its shape is totally different from that of a regular <i>etrog</i> – for example, if it is round like a ball or was grown in a square container. However, an <i>etrog</i> that has two tops but is fused at the bottom, like conjoined twins, is kosher, as it is not totally different from the standard shape (SA 648:18-20).

Section 13

<b>13. Borrowed and Stolen</b>
On the first Yom Tov of Sukkot, one must use a <i>lulav</i> that belongs to him, as it is written, “On the first day you shall take (<i>u-lekaḥtem lakhem</i>)” (Vayikra 23:40), which literally reads as “you shall take unto yourselves,” and which the Sages interpreted to mean “of your own (<i>mi-shelakhem</i>),” i.e., the <i>lulav</i> must belong to the person performing the mitzva. Therefore, one cannot fulfill his obligation with a borrowed <i>lulav</i> on the first Yom Tov. During the rest of the festival, there is no requirement that the <i>lulav</i> belong to the person performing the mitzva, and one may fulfill the mitzva with a borrowed <i>lulav</i>.
If, however, a <i>lulav</i>’s owner gives his <i>lulav</i> to someone as a gift, the recipient can fulfill the mitzva with it even on the first Yom Tov. In order to avoid the possible complication of the recipient refusing to return the <i>lulav</i>, the owner should give the <i>lulav</i> to the recipient on condition that the recipient returns the <i>lulav</i> to him (<i>matana al menat le-haḥzir</i>); if the recipient does not return it within a reasonable amount of time, the condition has not been fulfilled, and the gift is annulled (<i>Sukka</i> 41b; SA 658:3-4).
According to <i>halakha</i>, a minor (a child under the age of bar or bat mitzva) can accept a gift but cannot give one. Therefore, if an adult gives a minor a <i>lulav</i> as a gift, the minor is unable to return it. Thus, on the first Yom Tov, one must make sure to give a minor the <i>lulav</i> only after all the adults have already fulfilled the mitzva (SA 658:6; see below, 5:6 n. 5).
If one of the four species is stolen, no matter how beautiful, it is invalid for performing the mitzva throughout Sukkot, as it is “a mitzva that comes through sin” (<i>mitzva ha-ba’a ba-aveira</i>). However, if the owner of the stolen <i>lulav</i> has despaired of getting it back, and the thief gave or sold it to a third party, one may use it to perform the mitzva, since it is no longer in the thief’s possession. Nevertheless, it is forbidden to recite a <i>berakha</i> on this <i>lulav</i>, even if it was passed on to someone else, who passes it along to someone else, and so on; as long as the <i>lulav</i> is known to be stolen, one may not recite a <i>berakha</i> on it, and one who does is considered to be cursing instead of blessing (BK 94a; SA 649:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 6).<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 29b) records a dispute regarding a <i>mitzva ha-ba’a ba-aveira</i>. According to the vast majority of Rishonim, a <i>mitzva ha-ba’a ba-aveira</i> is not considered a mitzva. This is the view of <i>Behag</i>, Rif, Raavad, Ramban, Ra’ah, Rosh, Ritva, Ran, and others. However, according to <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, the sin does not negate the mitzva, and it seems that Rambam agrees. The ruling in practice is that any <i>mitzva ha-ba’a ba-aveira</i> is disqualified (Rema 649:1; <i>Levush</i>; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>; and others). If the <i>lulav</i> left the thief’s possession – for instance, if the original owner despaired of recovering it and the thief passed it on to someone else – since the <i>lulav</i> no longer belongs to the original owner (as the thief is required to return the monetary value of the <i>lulav</i>, not the <i>lulav</i> itself), one may fulfill the mitzva, but one may not recite the <i>berakha</i> over it.</i>
If someone who does not have a <i>lulav</i> arrives at the synagogue and sees a <i>lulav</i> there, he should ask the <i>lulav</i>’s owner for permission to use his <i>lulav</i> to perform the mitzva. If the owner is nowhere to be found and there is no way to ask his permission, the person may use the <i>lulav</i> without permission. It has the status of a borrowed <i>lulav</i> and thus cannot be used to fulfill the mitzva on the first Yom Tov, but it can be used during the rest of the festival. Normally, someone who takes an item without permission is considered a thief. However, in this case, as the person is taking something to use for a mitzva, the Sages presume that people want their belongings to be used for <i>mitzvot</i>. This is on condition that the borrower does not take the <i>lulav</i> from its place and is very careful with it (Rema 649:5). If the <i>lulav</i> owner is known to be especially particular about his belongings, then it is forbidden to use his <i>lulav</i> without his permission, even to perform the mitzva (MB <i>ad loc</i>. 34).

Section 14

<b>14. <i>Hidur Mitzva</i> – Beautifying the <i>Mitzvot</i></b>
There is a mitzva to beautify <i>mitzvot</i>, as it is written, “This is my God, and I will glorify Him (<i>ve-anvehu</i>)” (Shemot 15:2), which the Sages expound to mean: “Beautify (<i>hitna’eh</i>) yourself before Him through <i>mitzvot</i>: Make a beautiful (<i>na’ah</i>) <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful (<i>na’eh</i>) <i>lulav</i>, a beautiful shofar, and quality <i>tzitzit</i>. Have a beautiful Torah scroll, written for the sake of heaven by a skilled scribe using quality ink and a quality quill, and wrap it in a beautiful silk covering” (<i>Shabbat</i> 133b). Along these lines, we find that God accepted the offering of Hevel, who brought his best and fattest sheep, while He did not accept Kayin’s stingy offering of simple fruits and vegetables (Bereshit 4:3-5; MT, Laws of Altar Prohibitions 7:10-11).
Our Sages tell us that in order to beautify a mitzva, one should be prepared to spend up to a third over and above the basic price of the item (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 9a). For example, if one went to the market and found kosher <i>lulavim</i> at different prices, it is a mitzva for him to add a third to the price of the simplest <i>lulav</i> in order to buy a nicer one. If he wishes to further beautify the mitzva by spending even more for an even better <i>lulav</i>, God will reward him. This is on condition that the additional spending will not be at the expense of his fulfilling other, more important <i>mitzvot</i> or of his ability to pay his bills or provide for his household.
So, if one has three possible <i>lulav</i> sets to buy – a kosher set that costs $30, a nicer set for $40, and an even nicer set for $50, the mitzva to beautify requires him to add a third (i.e., add $10 beyond the $30 price of the basic set) and buy the $40 set. If he wants to beautify the mitzva even more, he may buy the $50 set, and God will reward him.
This all applies to the average person. But for someone whose financial situation is precarious, there is no mitzva to add a third (<i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>; MA; MB 656:6). Conversely, if one is fortunate enough to be wealthy, it is appropriate for him to pay more than an additional third to beautify the <i>mitzvot</i>. This is especially true of someone who generally buys expensive clothing and furniture and is prepared to pay several times the basic price of those items. He should be prepared to spend similarly on <i>mitzvot</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 9a) discusses whether the extra third is calculated by the final price (<i>milevar</i>, “from the outside”) or the basic price (<i>milegav</i>, “from the inside”). Calculating <i>milegav</i> means that one must add 1/3 of that basic price, so, for instance, if the basic set costs $30, one must add a third of that, or $10, and buy a $40 set. Calculating <i>milevar</i> means that the additional spending must come to 1/3 of the final price, so, for instance, if the basic set costs $30, one must add $15, which is 1/3 of the final price of $45. Most Rishonim rule that we calculate <i>milevar</i> (Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Ran, Raavan, and others), but Rosh rules leniently, that we calculate <i>milegav</i>. <i>Beit Yosef</i> (656:1) rules accordingly since we are lenient in cases of uncertainty about rabbinic law. This is also the position of most Aḥaronim, and I follow this method of calculating in the text above.<br>If one bought a basic set and later has an opportunity to buy a better one, the mitzva of <i>hidur</i> requires him to buy it and pay more, but only if he can find someone to buy the basic set from him. Otherwise, he would ultimately be adding more than an extra third (Vilna Gaon based on Yerushalmi; MB 656:5; SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 2).</i>

Chapter 5



Section 1

<b>1. The Time of the Mitzva</b>
The <i>lulav</i> is taken by day, not by night. It is customary to take the <i>lulav</i> at <i>Shaḥarit</i>. However, if one did not take it then, he should take it later. If the sun has already set, he should take it without reciting a <i>berakha</i>. Once the stars are out, he has lost the mitzva for the day (SA 652:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 2).
It is a mitzva to take the <i>lulav</i> while reciting <i>Hallel</i> and to shake it while reciting the verses, “<i>Hodu la-Shem ki tov ki le-olam ḥasdo</i>” (“Thank the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever”) and “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>” (“Lord, please, save us”). The Sages instituted a <i>berakha</i> to be recited before taking the <i>lulav</i>. While it is generally recited before <i>Hallel</i>, some recite it earlier, before prayers, in the <i>sukka</i> (section 3 below).
<i>Le-khatḥila</i> one should not take the <i>lulav</i> before sunrise. However, if one needs to set out early and will not be able to take the <i>lulav</i> after sunrise, he may take it and recite a <i>berakha</i> once dawn has broken (SA 652:1; <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 11:2 note 1).
As we have seen (4:1), the Torah commands us to take the <i>lulav</i> on only the first day of the festival. Only in the Temple was there a mitzva to take it all seven days. During Temple times, everywhere in the world except for the Temple, the <i>lulav</i> was taken only on the first Yom Tov; during the rest of the festival, only pilgrims to the Temple took it. If the first day of the festival was on Shabbat, those living in Eretz Yisrael still took the <i>lulav</i>, but to ensure that people would not carry the <i>lulav</i> in the public domain (thus desecrating Shabbat), the Sages instituted that it be taken at home (<i>Sukka</i> 42b). Those who lived outside of Eretz Yisrael did not take the <i>lulav</i> if the first day was on Shabbat, because they did not know with certainty when the month had been sanctified by the <i>beit din.</i> Due to the resulting uncertainty about when the festival begins, they observed two consecutive days of Yom Tov. The extra day is called <i>Yom Tov Sheni shel Galuyot</i>. Since the people did not know for certain that the first day was indeed on Shabbat, the Sages ordained that outside of Eretz Yisrael, the <i>lulav</i> should not be taken at all on Shabbat, not even in the home, lest people mistakenly violate Shabbat by carrying the <i>lulav</i> in a public domain (<i>Sukka</i> 43a). However, because Diaspora Jews observed a second day of Yom Tov, even if one day coincided with Shabbat, they would take the <i>lulav</i> on the other day, and in years when neither day of Yom Tov coincided with Shabbat, Diaspora Jews would take the <i>lulav</i> on both days.
After the destruction of the Temple, the Sages ordained that throughout the world, the <i>lulav</i> should be taken on all seven days of the festival (except on Shabbat), to commemorate the Temple. They also instituted that even in Eretz Yisrael, when the first day is on Shabbat, the <i>lulav</i> is not taken, so that all Israel is uniform in its practice (<i>Sukka</i> 44a). Later, when the calendar was fixed and there was no longer uncertainty about when the first day was, the prohibition of taking the <i>lulav</i> on the first day of the festival when it fell on Shabbat remained in force (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 7:16-18).
Perhaps we can suggest the reasoning behind this ruling. After the destruction, the spiritual impact of the mitzva of <i>lulav</i> was diminished, so it was necessary to reinforce it by having everyone, everywhere take the <i>lulav</i> all seven days. On the other hand, the Sages were very concerned about impinging on the sanctity of Shabbat, for after the destruction, Shabbat remained as the foundation of the vitality and blessing of continued Jewish existence; on Shabbat, we can say, the sanctity of the day accomplished what taking the <i>lulav</i> accomplished on the other days. So to ensure that no one desecrate Shabbat (God forbid), the Sages decreed that on Shabbat, even when it coincides with Yom Tov, the <i>lulav</i> is not taken. In practice, this means that when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat, we do not fulfill the Torah commandment of taking the <i>lulav</i>, as taking the <i>lulav</i> during the rest of the festival is rabbinic.

Section 2

<b>2. Bundling the Four Species</b>
The four species are all requisite; if one of them is missing, the mitzva is not fulfilled with the other three (<i>Menaḥot</i> 27a). The mitzva is to take the four species together. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, the mitzva is fulfilled, and the <i>berakha</i> may be recited, by taking them serially (SA 651:12).
Not only is there a mitzva to take all four species together, there is also a mitzva to bundle the <i>lulav</i> with the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i>, as doing so beautifies the mitzva, and beautifying a mitzva is itself a mitzva, as the Torah says, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Shemot 15:2). But the <i>etrog</i> is not bundled with the other three. The Sages derive this from a subtlety in the verse (Vayikra 23:40) that describes the four species. The <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadasim</i>, and <i>aravot</i> are joined by a conjunction, the letter “<i>vav</i>,” while the <i>etrog</i> stands alone (“<i>pri etz hadar</i>, <i>kapot temarim <b>va</b>-anaf etz avot <b>ve</b>-arvei naḥal</i>”). Thus, the <i>etrog</i> is not bundled with the rest.
Some say it is necessary to use a permanent knot – the kind forbidden to tie on Shabbat, like a double knot. Consequently, even those who use <i>koishelakh</i> (“little baskets” woven from <i>lulav</i> leaves) to hold the three species together should also bind them with a double knot (SA 651:1). Others say this is not necessary; rather, the main thing is for the three species to be bundled together (Ritva; see MB 651:8).
Despite the fact that many people bundle the three species using <i>lulav</i> leaves, one may use any type of thread or strap (SA 651:1).
When bundling the <i>lulav</i> with the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i>, one must make sure that the spine of the <i>lulav</i> extends at least a <i>tefaḥ</i> beyond them (SA 650:2). If the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i> are long and the <i>lulav</i> is so short that its spine does not extend a <i>tefaḥ</i> beyond them, one must either shorten the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i> to the minimum requisite length of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i>, so that the spine of the <i>lulav</i> extends a <i>tefaḥ</i> beyond them, or one should bundle them lower than the <i>lulav</i>, so that the spine of the <i>lulav</i> extends a <i>tefaḥ</i> beyond their tips.
One should not take more than one <i>lulav</i> and one <i>etrog</i> at once. The minimum is three <i>hadasim</i> and two <i>aravot</i>, and if one wishes to add <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i> he may, although many are meticulous not to add to the required three <i>hadasim</i> and two <i>aravot</i> (SA 651:15).
One may not add a fifth species to the four mandated by the Torah. One who does so violates the prohibition of “<i>bal tosif</i>” (adding <i>mitzvot</i> to the Torah) (SA 651:14).<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Some say that just as it is prohibited to add a fifth species, so it is prohibited to add a wild <i>hadas</i> (<i>Behag</i>; see 4:8 above). Others maintain that a wild <i>hadas</i> is not considered an additional species, so one who wishes to add it may do so (R. Natronai Gaon and R. Paltoi Gaon). This is the Yemenite custom.</i>
Some place the <i>hadasim</i> on the right of the spine of <i>lulav</i> and the <i>aravot</i> on the left (<i>Shlah</i>; MB 651:12). Others place one <i>hadas</i> on the right, one on the left, and one in the middle, and one <i>arava</i> on the right and one on the left (MA <i>ad loc</i>. 4 in the name of Arizal). Both ways fulfill the mitzva even for the most meticulous.
Some are meticulous to have the <i>hadasim</i> extend a little higher than the <i>aravot</i>, because <i>hadasim</i> symbolize the righteous, while <i>aravot</i> allude to the unlearned (Rema 651:1).
In addition to the mitzva of bundling the three species together, some are meticulous to bind the <i>lulav</i> itself with three additional knots, though Ashkenazim take care to leave the top of the <i>lulav</i> unbound, so that it rustles when shaken (Rema 651:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 14). Some have the custom of binding the <i>lulav</i> with 18 knots. (See <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc</i>. 16.)

Section 3

<b>3. The Procedure for Taking the <i>Lulav</i> and Reciting the <i>Berakha</i></b>
The bundled <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadasim</i>, and <i>aravot</i> are picked up with the right hand, and the <i>etrog</i> with the left, because the three species together are more significant than the <i>etrog</i> and should therefore be picked up with the more prestigious and stronger right hand. If one mistakenly did the reverse, he has still fulfilled the obligation. 
Some maintain that even lefties should take the <i>lulav</i> in the right hand, because even for lefties, the right hand, which alludes to the divine attribute of kindness, has significance (SA 651:3). This is the kabbalistic practice. Others maintain that since the left hand is dominant and more important for him, a lefty should take the three bundled species in his left hand and the <i>etrog</i> in his right (Rema).
One must hold the four species in the direction they grow: their stems pointing downward and their tips pointing upward. Accordingly, the <i>oketz</i> of the <i>etrog</i> should be at the bottom and the nose on top, for this is how it begins to grow from the tree. If one of the species is reversed, he has not fulfilled the mitzva (<i>Sukka</i> 37b, 45b; SA 651:2).
When one picks up the <i>lulav</i>, its spine should face him. The <i>etrog</i> should be held next to the <i>lulav</i> bundle (SA 651:11). Holding the four species thus, one shakes them in each of the four directions, as well as up and down, as is explained in the next section.
Our Sages ordained reciting a <i>berakha</i> before fulfilling the mitzva: “Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has made us holy through His commandments, and has commanded us about taking the <i>lulav</i>” (“<i>al netilat lulav</i>”). So that the <i>berakha</i> is recited just before fulfilling the mitzva, one picks up the four species before reciting the <i>berakha</i> but holds the <i>etrog</i> upside down (<i>oketz</i> up, nose down, a manner that does not fulfill the mitzva). Then one recites the <i>berakha</i> and immediately flips the <i>etrog</i> and shakes the four species. Some hold only the bundled species when reciting the <i>berakha</i>; then, immediately upon concluding the <i>berakha</i>, they pick up the <i>etrog</i> and shake it with the other species (SA 651:5). On the first day, <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> is recited before performing the mitzva (<i>ibid</i>. 6).
It is customary to stand while reciting the <i>berakha</i> and taking the <i>lulav</i>. The <i>berakha</i> covers all the <i>lulavim</i> one might take and shake for the rest of the day (Rema 651:5).
The custom is to take the <i>lulav</i> and recite the <i>berakha</i> right before beginning <i>Hallel</i> (SA 644:1). Some show alacrity by taking the <i>lulav</i> and reciting the <i>berakha</i> in the <i>sukka</i> before going to the synagogue, in order to combine the mitzva of <i>lulav</i> with the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (Arizal; <i>Shlah</i>). People who pray <i>vatikin</i> (reaching the <i>Amida</i> at sunrise) may not do so, as the time for taking the <i>lulav</i> begins at sunrise.
There must be no barrier between one’s hands and the four species; one who places them in a case or container and then picks up the container does not fulfill the obligation. However, the material used to bundle the three species together is not considered a barrier, as it is meant as an auxiliary to the species. Some people take care to remove rings, but technically rings are not considered barriers, as they cover only a very small part of the hand (SA 651:7).
If one’s hand is bandaged, but his fingers extend beyond the bandages so that he can still hold the species with them, he may, <i>be-di’avad</i>, fulfill the mitzva in this way (<i>Ikarei Hadat</i> 33:25; see <i>Harḥavot</i>). If he cannot hold the four species directly with his fingers, he should fulfill the mitzva using his unbandaged hand only. He should recite the <i>berakha</i>, pick up the bundled species, put them down, and then pick up the <i>etrog</i>. As we have learned, <i>be-di’avad</i> the species may be taken serially.

Section 4

<b>4. Shaking the <i>Lulav</i></b>
By merely taking the four species and lifting them, one fulfills the mitzva, as it is written: “You shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree…” (Vayikra 23:40). The Sages ordained shaking the <i>lulav</i> in the way that the Torah commands the waving of certain offerings (<i>Sukka</i> 42a; <i>Menaḥot</i> 61a).
The Gemara describes how the offerings were waved: “One moves forth and back, up and down.” That is, one moves the <i>lulav</i> away from himself and then brings it back, lifts it up and brings it back down. This is also an expression of faith: “forth and back – for the sake of the One to Whom the four corners of the earth belong; up and down – for the sake of the One to Whom heaven and earth belong (<i>Sukka</i> 37b). This is why the custom is to wave the <i>lulav</i> toward all four directions plus up and down. Our Sages further expound: “forth and back – to halt harmful winds; up and down – to halt harmful dew” (<i>ibid</i>.).
Additionally, following Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, the days of judgment when we stood before God in prayer, we begin the new year joyously. We wave the four species as a symbol of our victory in successfully repenting and renewing our close relationship to God (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:2; above, 1:3).
The procedure for shaking the four species is as follows: The bundled species in the right hand and the <i>etrog</i> in the left are brought together and held close to the body. Some are careful to pull them all the way to the chest. From there, the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i> are moved in a given direction, with the top of the <i>lulav</i> pointing upward but angled toward that direction. Then the four species are brought back to the body. This is repeated three times for each of the six directions (east, west, north, south, up, down). When shaking the <i>lulav</i> in the downward direction, one does not turn it upside down; rather, the top continues to point upward, and the person moves the <i>lulav</i> downward from the chest.
Some begin by shaking eastward and then continue moving rightward – south, west, north – and then upward and downward (SA 651:10). Some follow this order but begin with the direction that worshippers are facing.
According to the custom of Arizal, the first shake is to the south, followed by north, east, up, down, and west.
Some turn their whole bodies in the direction in which they are shaking the <i>lulav</i>; when they shake it upward and downward, they face east. Others face east the whole time but angle the <i>lulav</i> according to the procedure for shaking. All of these customs are acceptable, and each person should continue his family’s custom. If the custom is unclear, he may do as he wishes.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 37b), as we saw, says: “One moves it forth and back, up and down. Forth and back – for the sake of the One to Whom the four corners of the earth belong; up and down – for the sake of the One to Whom heaven and earth belong.” Many interpret this to mean that one must shake the <i>lulav</i> in all four directions plus up and down (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>; Rosh 3:26). This is the widespread custom (SA 651:9). Others read it more simply – one moves it away from himself, then back toward himself, and then up and down, with no requirement to turn to the four directions (MT Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 7:10; Ritva). This is the custom of some Yemenites (Maharitz). Regarding the number of shakes, we learn: “One must shake three times in each case” (<i>y. Sukka</i> 3:8). Some interpret this to mean that when the <i>lulav</i> is away from the body, one jiggles it three times, and after bringing it back to the body, one jiggles it another three times (SA 651:9). Others take it to mean that it is moved away from the body and back toward the body three times in each direction (Rema). Arizal supported the latter custom, which is the widespread practice. Some take care to fulfill both views. They move the <i>lulav</i> forth and back three times in each direction, and during one of those times, they jiggle it three times while it is away from the body and three more times when it is close (<i>Baḥ</i>; Maharshal; <i>Taz</i>; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 651:33). Some stay facing forward and simply shake the <i>lulav</i> in each direction without turning (Maharil; <i>Eliya Rabba</i> 651:24; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 37). Others turn their bodies in each direction (<i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 13; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 96). Arizal’s custom of beginning each shake at the chest fits better with the latter custom. (See SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 49.)</i>
Ashkenazic custom is to shake the <i>lulav</i> such that its upper leaves rustle (MB 651:47). Sephardim do not follow this practice.

Section 5

<b>5. When to Shake the <i>Lulav</i></b>
In addition to the shaking after the recitation of the <i>berakha</i> on the <i>lulav</i>, the Sages ordained holding the <i>lulav</i> during the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> and shaking it when reciting the verses of “<i>Hodu la-Shem ki tov ki le-olam ḥasdo</i>” (“Thank the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever”) and “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>” (“Lord, please, save us”) (<i>Sukka</i> 37b). They linked their enactment to a verse: “Then shall all the trees of the forest shout for joy…. Thank the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever. Declare: Save us (<i>hoshi’enu</i>), O God, our deliverer, and gather us and save us from the nations, to acclaim Your holy name, to glory in Your praise” (1 Divrei Hayamim 16:33-35). How can trees “shout for joy”? When they sway and rustle. And when is that? When they recite “<i>hodu</i>” and “<i>hoshi’enu</i>.” The end of this verse may allude to an additional function of shaking the <i>lulav</i> – it may serve as a prayer for the ingathering of the exiles from the four corners of the earth.
Since Sukkot is when we are judged concerning rain, shaking the four species – which grew from the rains of the previous year – expresses thanks for the blessings of the previous year and a prayer for the upcoming one: that from the heaven, the earth, and the four winds will come beneficial rain and dew, not harmful precipitation and destructive winds.
As we have learned, we shake the <i>lulav</i> when we recite the verses “<i>Hodu la-Shem ki tov ki le-olam ḥasdo</i>” and “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>” in <i>Hallel</i>. The shaking is parsed according to the words, and when saying God’s name, one stops and concentrates on the holiness of His name. Thus, when reciting “<i>Hodu</i>,” which contains six words apart from the name of God, one shakes in one direction with each word. When reciting “<i>Ana</i>,” which has only three words apart from the name of God, one shakes in two directions with each word (MB 651:37).
According to the kabbalists, we shake the <i>lulav</i> five times: 1) After reciting the <i>berakha</i> on the <i>lulav</i>; 2) at the first instance of “<i>Hodu</i>”; 3-4) at the two instances of “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>”; 5) during the recitation of “<i>Hodu”</i> at the end of <i>Hallel</i>. There is no difference between the <i>ḥazan</i> and the congregation in this respect. Sephardim and some <i>Ḥasidim</i> follow this practice. Yemenites shake the <i>lulav</i> only four times, as they recite “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>” only once.
According to Ashkenazic custom, the congregation shakes the <i>lulav</i> nine times, and the <i>ḥazan</i> seven, because according to this practice, the custom is to shake the <i>lulav</i> every time the verse of “<i>Hodu</i>” is recited. When the <i>ḥazan</i> recites “<i>Hodu</i>” and the next three verses (“<i>Yomar Na</i>,” “<i>Yomru Na Beit Aharon</i>,” and “<i>Yomru Na Yir’ei Hashem</i>”), the congregation responds with “<i>Hodu</i>.” The <i>ḥazan</i> shakes the <i>lulav</i> only to accompany the first two verses, “<i>Hodu</i>” and “<i>Yomar Na</i>”: the first because he is praising God, and the second because he is calling on all of Israel to praise God, and he is part of their subsequent praise. In contrast, the last two verses are not all-inclusive but are limited to the house of Aharon and God-fearers; he is not included among them, so he does not shake the <i>lulav</i> then (SA and Rema 651:8). The ninth shake (the <i>ḥazan</i>’s seventh) is at the end of <i>Hallel</i>, when Ashkenazim recite the verse of “<i>Hodu</i>” twice and shake the <i>lulav</i> each time, whereas, as we said in the previous paragraph, the kabbalistic practice is to shake only once then.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">In some Ashkenazic synagogues, the <i>ḥazan</i> also shakes the <i>lulav</i> during the congregation’s recitation of “<i>Yomru Na Beit Aharon</i>” and “<i>Yomru Na Yir’ei Hashem</i>” (as described in <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Sukka</i> 37b, s.v. “be-hodu”). <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 651:32 states that this custom should not be annulled. In Sephardic practice, the congregation repeats each of the four verses (rather than responding to each verse with “<i>Hodu</i>”). So in that part of <i>Hallel</i>, “<i>Hodu</i>” is recited only once. See <i>Peninei Halakha:</i> <i>Zemanim</i> ch. 1, n.17 for the sources of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs concerning this responsive reading.</i>

Section 6

<b>6. Women and Children</b>
Women are exempt from the mitzva to take the <i>lulav</i> since it is time-bound, and as a rule, women are exempt from time-bound positive <i>mitzvot</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a). Nevertheless, a woman who wishes to fulfill a time-bound positive mitzva is rewarded for doing so.
According to most Sephardim, women do not recite a <i>berakha</i> over the performance of a time-bound positive mitzva, for how can one who is not commanded recite a <i>berakha</i> that contains the word “<i>ve-tzivanu</i>” (“and commanded us”)? According to Ashkenazic custom, since women are fulfilling a mitzva, they recite the <i>berakha</i>; the language of the <i>berakha</i> is not a problem, as they do not recite “and commanded me” but “and commanded us” – “us” connotes the Jewish people as a whole. Even though Sephardic women generally do not recite <i>berakhot</i> over time-bound positive <i>mitzvot</i>, many recite the <i>berakha</i> over the <i>lulav</i>, and some have offered kabbalistic reasons for this.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Peninei Halakha: Women’s Prayer</i> 2:8 n. 9. Ḥida writes that women should recite the <i>berakha</i>, as do <i>Zekhor Le-Avraham</i>; <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> 1, <i>Sod Yesharim</i> §12; and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 589:23. Additionally, this was the practice of R. Ovadia Hedaya’s family. R. Shalom Messas writes in <i>Shemesh U-magen</i> 2:72:3 that women may recite the <i>berakha</i>. In contrast, according to <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>, they may not recite the <i>berakha</i>, and R. Ovadia Yosef reinforces this in <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 1:39-42 and 5:43.</i>
Once a young boy knows how to properly shake the <i>lulav</i>, forth and back, up and down, his father must train him to do so. When the son has reached an age when he can go to the synagogue and pray, his father should buy him his own set of four species, so he can shake the <i>lulav</i> at the times ordained by the Sages. If a father does not have the means to buy his son his own set, he should allow his son to use his, so that the son can fulfill the mitzva (<i>Sukka</i> 42a; SA 657:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 4).<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">As we learned above in 4:13, on the first Yom Tov one cannot fulfill the obligation with a borrowed <i>lulav</i>. Thus, one must be careful not to give the <i>lulav</i> to a minor then. Since he is unable to give it back, no one else would be able to fulfill the mitzva with it. However, after all the adults have fulfilled the mitzva, one may give the <i>lulav</i> to a minor (SA 658:6). Some say that even then, it is preferable not to give the <i>lulav</i> to a minor, because an adult might come along who needs to fulfill the mitzva (<i>Eliya Rabba</i> <i>ad loc.</i> 10). According to this, presumably the minor would use a borrowed <i>lulav</i>. However, some say that a minor does not fulfill the mitzva for training purposes on the first Yom Tov unless the <i>lulav</i> belongs to him, just as adults cannot fulfill the mitzva with a borrowed <i>lulav</i> (MA; <i>Eliya Rabba</i>; <i>Pri Megadim</i>; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>). Others say that since this is for training, he may use a borrowed <i>lulav</i> and may even recite the <i>berakha</i> beforehand (<i>Bigdei Yesha</i>; Mordekhai,<i> Raavan</i>, and SA according to MB 658:28 and SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 36). This opinion may be relied upon.</i>
Young girls should be encouraged to shake the <i>lulav</i> each day of Sukkot. Even though women and girls are exempt, they fulfill a mitzva by doing so, and it teaches them to love <i>mitzvot</i>.

Section 7

<b>7. Caring for the Four Species</b>
One must try to keep the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot</i> fresh, and to that end the longstanding practice is to keep them in water. The Mishna states that it is permissible on Yom Tov to return the three bundled species to a container of water where they had already been kept, and even to add water to the container (<i>Sukka</i> 42a). However, the Sages forbade filling a container with water or changing the water in the original container on Yom Tov, as it is bothersome and resembles the action one would take to fix a <i>kli</i>, as it allows the species to last (SA 654:1).
On <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, some people would change the water in which they hydrated the <i>lulav</i>, <i>hadasim</i>, and <i>aravot</i> to keep them fresh. Others would unbundle the species and place the <i>hadasim</i> in a vase with water and wrap the <i>aravot</i> in a damp towel or place them in water. Another way to keep the species fresh is to place them in a sealed carrying case, but this works only if they have not been out for very long; if they were out for a long time and have already started drying out, it is better to first place them in water to revive them.
Some beautify the mitzva by changing the <i>aravot</i> every day, as the main way to beautify the <i>aravot</i> is to keep them fresh (Rema 654:1). Many are content to make efforts to keep them from drying out.
As we learned above (section 2), there is a mitzva to bundle the <i>lulav</i> with the <i>hadasim</i> and <i>aravot.</i> Therefore, when one introduces new <i>aravot</i> or returns the <i>hadasim</i> from the vase, he should not just jam them into the existing bundle. Rather, he should re-tie the knot, gently reinsert them into the <i>koishelakh</i>, or at least add a new knot, to fulfill the mitzva of bundling (MB 654:5).

Section 8

<b>8. <i>Muktzeh</i> and the Four Species</b>
Once the four species have been taken on the first day, they are considered to be set aside (<i>muktzeh</i>) for the mitzva and may not be used for any other purpose. Therefore, one may not eat the <i>etrog</i> or smell the <i>hadasim</i> during the festival. One may not even use the <i>hadasim</i> for <i>havdala</i> after Shabbat. Even if the <i>etrog</i> or <i>hadasim</i> become invalid during the course of Sukkot, they are still <i>muktzeh</i> until the end of the festival (SA 653:1 and 665:1).
It is, however, permissible to smell an <i>etrog</i>, because its primary purpose is for eating, so it is <i>muktzeh</i> only in this regard; it is not <i>muktzeh</i> with respect to its aroma (<i>Sukka</i> 37b). If one picks up an <i>etrog</i> with the idea of fulfilling the mitzva and also enjoying its smell, uncertainty arises regarding the proper <i>berakha</i>. Some say that since he is deriving pleasure from its fragrance, he should recite the <i>berakha</i> of “Who gives pleasant fragrance to fruits.” Others say that since the primary reason he is picking it up is to fulfill the mitzva, he should not recite this <i>berakha</i>. In order to remove this uncertainty, it is proper for one to have in mind when picking up the <i>etrog</i> that he is doing so in order to fulfill the mitzva and not to enjoy its scent (SA 216:14 and 653:1). However, if someone wishes to smell the <i>etrog</i> at a time when he is not fulfilling the mitzva, he recites the <i>berakha</i> of “Who gives pleasant fragrance to fruits.”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 37b) states: “Rabba said: A <i>hadas</i> used to fulfill the mitzva may not be smelled, while an <i>etrog</i> used to fulfill the mitzva may be smelled. Why? A <i>hadas</i> is for smelling, so when it is set aside [for the mitzva], it is set aside from smelling. An <i>etrog</i> is for eating, so when it is set aside [for the mitzva], it is set aside from eating.” When one picks up the <i>etrog</i> in order to fulfill the mitzva, he may smell it incidentally. However, he does not recite the <i>berakha</i>, just as one does not recite a <i>berakha</i> if he happened to smell a fruit in the course of eating it. What if one picks up the <i>etrog</i> and has in mind to smell it? According to Raavya, Raavan, and <i>Roke’aḥ</i>, he is then obligated to recite the <i>berakha</i>, but according to Rabbeinu Simḥa, he does not recite it, since the <i>etrog</i>’s status as a mitzva object annuls its status as an aromatic object. Rabbeinu Peretz writes that in order to avoid this uncertainty, it is preferable to avoid smelling the <i>etrog</i> (cited in SA 216:14 and 653:1). What if one picks up the <i>etrog</i> at a different time in order to smell it? According to most Rishonim, Maharshal, MA, and <i>Ḥavot Ya’ir</i>, he recites the <i>berakha</i>, but according to Rabbeinu Simḥa, <i>Taz</i>, <i>Eliya Rabba</i>, <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, and <i>Seder Birkhot Ha-nehenin</i>, he does not recite it. Mainstream <i>halakha</i> follows the view that the <i>berakha</i> is recited, as this is the plain meaning of <i>Sukka</i> 37b. So state MB 216:52, BHL s.v. “ha-meri’aḥ,” and <i>Ḥazon Ovadia:</i> <i>Hilkhot Berakhot</i>, p. 327. Additionally, if one is in the habit of smelling his <i>etrog</i> and reciting the <i>berakha</i>, it is as if he has made a condition that the <i>etrog</i> would not become <i>muktzeh</i> for smelling purposes, and thus even those who are stringent allow him to recite the <i>berakha</i>. (See BHL 664:9 s.v. “im.”)</i>
When the festival ends, the species cease being <i>muktzeh</i> and may be used for any purpose. However, they may not be treated disrespectfully; for instance, they may not be stepped on or thrown into the garbage (SA 664:8).
If one had in mind before taking the four species that they would not become <i>muktzeh</i>, but rather could be used in whatever way he wanted, this condition is effective. They do not become <i>muktzeh</i> and can be used without restriction during the festival.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukka</i> 46b states that if one set aside seven <i>etrogim</i>, one per day for each of the seven days of the festival, then each <i>etrog</i> becomes <i>muktzeh</i> on its designated day; however, once that day is over, it is permissible to eat that day’s <i>etrog</i>. This is the ruling of SA 665:2. If one made a condition from the start that the four species would not become <i>muktzeh</i>, then they do not, and they may be used freely. <i>Bi’ur Halakha</i> explains that according to <i>Tosafot</i>, on the first Yom Tov, when the four species must be whole, this condition does not take effect. It is only for the rest of the festival that it is effective. However, according to Rashba, Ran, and <i>Yere’im</i>, the condition is effective even on the first Yom Tov, and this is the position cited in SA 664:9 (BHL 664:9 s.v. “im”).</i>

Section 9

<b>9. <i>Hakafot</i> (Circling the Altar) in Temple Times</b>
On each day of Sukkot, the <i>kohanim</i> in the Temple would circle the altar once; on the seventh day they circled it seven times. During these <i>hakafot</i> (circuits) they called out: “Lord, please, save us. Lord, please, grant us success” (“<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na. Ana Hashem hatzliḥa na</i>”). According to R. Yehuda, they called out: “<i>Ani Va-hu</i>, <i>hoshi’a na</i>” (<i>Sukka</i> 45a). Some maintain that they carried the <i>lulav</i> with them during the <i>hakafot</i>, while others maintain that they carried the <i>aravot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 43b).<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">There is a debate in <i>Sukka</i> 43b (and the Rishonim explaining it) as to what the <i>kohanim</i> held during the <i>hakafot</i> in the Temple. According to Rashi, they held <i>aravot</i>; <i>Tosafot</i> agrees and adds that when the <i>hakafot</i> were finished, the <i>aravot</i> were left standing by the side of the altar. In contrast, Rambam (MT Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 7:22-23) and Ran maintain that the <i>hakafot</i> were done while holding the <i>lulav</i>. Rambam adds that the <i>aravot</i> were left standing alongside the altar rather than used during <i>hakafot</i>. Our custom follows that of Rambam: We do the <i>hakafot</i> while carrying the <i>lulav</i>. On Hoshana Rabba, after the completion of the <i>hakafot</i>, we put down the <i>lulav</i> and pick up <i>aravot</i>. (However, according to SA 664:3, on Hoshana Rabba the <i>hakafot</i> are done with <i>aravot</i>.)</i>
The Sages tell us that the Temple <i>hakafot</i> were instituted in commemoration of God’s command to Israel to circle Yeriḥo (Jericho) at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun, enabling them to conquer it and the rest of the land (<i>y. Sukka</i> 4:3). The circuits at Yeriḥo were done as follows: The procession was led by soldiers and <i>kohanim</i>. A vanguard walked at the very front, followed by seven <i>kohanim</i> blowing the shofar. Then came the Ark, carried by other <i>kohanim</i>. The rest of the soldiers walked behind the Ark. They circled Jericho once a day for six days; on the seventh day, they made seven circuits. With the conclusion of the final circuit, the <i>kohanim</i> blew a <i>teki’a gedola</i>, the entire nation shouted, and miraculously the walls of Jericho sank into the ground, allowing Israel to conquer the city (Yehoshua ch. 6).
According to the kabbalists, Jericho, which is the lowest city in the world, was the center of Canaanite culture; Canaan’s spirit of impurity was concentrated there. The Canaanites subverted the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael to serve their mundane desires. The great walls that surrounded the city served as a barrier blocking the divine light and allowing the Canaanites to carry on with their corrupt ways without any disturbing thoughts of repentance or pangs of conscience that emanate from the divine illumination that envelops all of existence. This is why Jericho was the “lock” that prevented Israel from entering the land and revealing God’s word there. (See <i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 15:15.) God commanded Israel to circle (<i>lehakif</i>) Jericho and thus disclose the divine light that envelops (<i>makif</i>) all existence. This caused the walls of Jericho to fall, allowing Israel to conquer it and begin revealing the sanctity of the mundane.
Just as the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael illuminates all of existence and discloses the sanctity of the mundane, so too the mitzva of dwelling in the <i>sukka</i>, which encompasses the entire human being, reveals the sanctity of the mundane by transforming the physical aspects of life, such as eating and sleeping, into <i>mitzvot</i>.
The Sages instituted <i>hakafot</i> around the altar on Sukkot in order to bring down the walls of impurity that block the divine light from shining upon us, and to strengthen the illumination of the enveloping light. Through this we can increase our faith and reveal the sanctity within the physical world.

Section 10

<b>10. The Contemporary Custom of <i>Hakafot</i> (<i>Hoshanot</i>)</b>
Following the destruction of the Temple, Israel adopted the practice of performing <i>hakafot</i> in the synagogue to commemorate the Temple. Since this was never formally ordained, we find that different customs emerged in the Geonic era, though by the time of the Rishonim, custom crystallized into the relatively uniform custom that is practiced today.
The Torah scroll is placed on the <i>bima</i>, the entire congregation takes their four species in hand, and they circle the <i>bima</i> once each day, and seven times on the seventh day. We circle the Torah because after the destruction of the Temple, Torah study is in lieu of the altar, for one who studies the laws of the offerings is considered as having brought them on the altar. The prevailing custom is that one person stands at the <i>bima</i> and holds the Torah scroll during the <i>hakafot</i> (Ḥida; <i>Pri Megadim</i>), although some Sephardic communities do not insist on this (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 660:6).
Over time, special prayers were composed for recitation during these <i>hakafot</i>. The refrain of these prayers is the phrase “<i>hosha na</i>” (“please save”) and the similar phrase “<i>hoshi’a na</i>,” which is why these prayers are often called “<i>hoshanot</i>.” Depending on custom, these prayers are recited before, during, or after the <i>hakafot</i>.
Someone without a <i>lulav</i> does not circle the <i>bima</i> (Rema 660:2; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 660:13), so it is customary to have such a person stand at the <i>bima</i> and hold the Torah scroll.
The circuits are counterclockwise; that is, if one is facing the <i>bima</i>, he turns to his right to begin his circuit (SA 660:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 3).
Some maintain that during <i>hakafot</i> the <i>lulav</i> is held in the same way as it is held to perform the mitzva – with the bundled species in the right hand and the <i>etrog</i> in the left, with the two hands close together (<i>Roke’aḥ</i>; Maharil; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>). Others say that one who needs to hold his <i>siddur</i> in one hand may hold the bundled species and the <i>etrog</i> together in the other (<i>Yafeh La-lev</i>; <i>Ginat Veradim</i>). Both customs are fine.
It is customary to leave the ark open during the <i>hakafot</i> (<i>Kitzur Shulḥan Arukh</i> 137:11).
Some maintain that if there is no Torah scroll, there are no <i>hakafot</i> (<i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 660:2), while others say <i>hakafot</i> are done even without a Torah scroll (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Ha’azinu §15).
The custom of Sephardim and <i>ḥasidim</i> is to perform <i>hakafot</i> after the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> and before the recitation of <i>Kaddish Titkabel</i> (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 660:4). Some Ashkenazim perform <i>hakafot</i> after <i>Musaf</i> (<i>Olat Re’iya</i>, vol. 2, p. 370).
On Shabbat, <i>hakafot</i> are not performed. Some recite the accompanying <i>hoshanot</i> prayers anyway, while others do not (SA 660:3; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc.</i> 23).
Some say that a mourner within the year of the death of a parent does not perform <i>hakafot</i>, since they were instituted to bring joy (Rema 660:2; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 9). Many maintain that a mourner does participate in the <i>hakafot</i> (<i>Beit Yosef</i>; Arizal; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 148:19). This is the custom of all Sephardim and many Ashkenazim (<i>Gesher Ha-ḥayim</i> 20:3:60).

Chapter 6



Section 1

<b>1. Hoshana Rabba</b>
The seventh day of Sukkot is also known as Hoshana Rabba. It is an especially significant day because on Sukkot, God renders judgment about how much water there will be during the upcoming year, so on the seventh day of Sukkot, the final verdict is sealed. Since all plant, animal, and human life depends upon water, on this last day of judgment, we multiply our pleas of “<i>hosha na</i>” (“please save”) to God. On this day, we take <i>aravot</i> (sometimes called <i>hoshanot</i>), because they require more water than the other species, and it is easily discernable when they dry out. The Sages made sure that Hoshana Rabba never falls on Shabbat, so that we have the opportunity to plead and cry out for water (<i>Roke’aḥ</i> §221).
Just as water sustains physical life, the Torah sustains the life of the spirit. In the words of the Sages, “Water refers to Torah” (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 17a). Accordingly, the judgment concerning water on Hoshana Rabba includes judgment about human life in its entirety, the physical and the spiritual. This is the meaning of <i>Zohar</i>’s statement that there are three times of judgment: Rosh Ha-shana, Yom Kippur, and Hoshana Rabba (<i>Zohar</i> II 142a). Similarly, there is a tradition that God told Avraham, “If your children are not forgiven on Rosh Ha-shana, they will be forgiven on Yom Kippur; and if not on Yom Kippur, then on Hoshana Rabba” (<i>Mateh Moshe</i> §957; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 664:2).
This is also expressed in another way: Even though verdicts are recorded (“written”) on Rosh Ha-shana and finalized (“sealed”) on Yom Kippur, the directive to execute the verdict takes place only on Hoshana Rabba. This can be compared to a human court. Even after a verdict has been handed down, if it has not yet been written in an execution order and conveyed to the agents of justice responsible for carrying it out, it is still possible to work for its reversal. This is the idea of Hoshana Rabba, when each verdict is written on an execution order, or “<i>petek</i>,” and given to messengers to convey to the angels in charge of carrying it out. Until then, it is still possible to reverse the judgment, as the execution orders have not yet been written and sent out with couriers. Therefore, it is appropriate to repent on Hoshana Rabba (<i>Zohar</i> III 31b). Furthermore, even after the verdict is conveyed to the angels on Hoshana Rabba, they are not permitted to carry it out until the end of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, repentance is still effective in reversing or improving one’s verdict until then (<i>Zohar</i> I 220a and II 142a; <i>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</i>, <i>Derushei Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>, pp. 314-316).
Some hold a large, joyful celebration on the night of Hoshana Rabba, like on the other nights of Sukkot (<i>Zera Emet</i> 2:157), but the widespread custom is to study Torah on the night of Hoshana Rabba, thus combining Torah study with festival joy, albeit without music and dancing. There is a pious custom to stay awake all night studying Torah on Hoshana Rabba, to repair and purify the soul before judgment is final. Some have the custom to read the entire Torah on this night (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §371). Based on Arizal’s teachings, a <i>tikun</i> focusing on Devarim and Tehilim was composed for recitation on this night (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 664:3-4).
As we have learned (5:10), on each day of Sukkot there is a custom to circle the <i>bima</i> once while carrying the four species, reciting supplications before, during, and after the circuit. On Hoshana Rabba, we circle seven times, after which we recite many supplications.
Because of Hoshana Rabba’s sanctity and its special <i>mitzvot</i>, it is customary to have a festive meal during the day (AHS 664:13).

Section 2

<b>2. The Custom of the <i>Arava</i> in Temple Times and Today</b>
In addition to the Torah’s commandment to take <i>aravot</i> as one of the four species (4:1 above), there is another mitzva, which originates as <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, to bring long <i>aravot</i> branches to the Temple and stand them next to the altar with their tops bent over onto the altar. When the <i>aravot</i> were brought, the <i>kohanim</i> sounded a <i>teki’a</i>-<i>teru’a</i>-<i>teki’a</i> blast on the shofar. This was done on each day of Sukkot except for Shabbat. However, if Hoshana Rabba coincided with Shabbat, it was done, because the main significance of the mitzva of <i>arava</i> was on this day. To avoid Shabbat desecration, the <i>aravot</i> were picked before Shabbat and left in golden vases filled with water to prevent their withering. Then, on Shabbat, the <i>kohanim</i> would simply stand up the <i>aravot</i> next to the altar (<i>Sukka</i> 45a).<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Technically, the concern for Shabbat desecration was only regarding the <i>lulav</i>. Since everyone fulfilled that mitzva, there was reason to be concerned that some people would end up carrying the <i>lulav</i> 4 <i>amot</i> in the public domain. In contrast, the mitzva to bring <i>aravot</i> to the altar, which was <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, was fulfilled by the <i>kohanim</i> in the Temple. Even the custom later established by the prophets for everyone everywhere to take <i>aravot</i> would not have led to a concern about Shabbat desecration, since the <i>gabbai</i> would have brought the <i>aravot</i> to the synagogue before Shabbat. And there was no reason to be concerned that people would desecrate Shabbat by carrying the <i>aravot</i> to ask if they were kosher for use, since there was no concern that they are invalid. Nevertheless, if the <i>arava</i> ritual had been done in the Temple on Shabbat, it might have led people to mistakenly conclude that the mitzva of <i>arava</i>, which is not explicit in the Torah, was more important than the mitzva of <i>lulav</i>, which is explicit in the Torah, so they did not perform the <i>arava</i> ritual on Shabbat (<i>Sukka</i> 44a). Hoshana Rabba, though, was different. If it was on Shabbat, the mitzva of <i>arava</i> was practiced in the Temple. This way, everyone would be aware that it carried the significance of <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, and from a certain perspective it is considered a mitzva from the Torah (<i>Sukka</i> 43b).</i>
Extending this practice, the prophets instituted that <i>aravot</i> be taken not only in the Temple, but by Jews everywhere. They also instituted that the <i>aravot</i> are beaten. After the destruction, the Jews continued this custom in commemoration of the Temple. Even though in Temple times they took <i>aravot</i> every day, after the destruction it became the custom to do so on one day only. The seventh day was chosen, as it had been the primary day for the mitzva in the Temple, when they circled the altar seven times. According to the kabbalists, there is a hidden link between the mitzva of <i>arava</i> and the seventh day.
The mitzva of <i>arava</i> is so important that according to some Amora’im, after the destruction, when the Sanhedrin was still sanctifying each month, it avoided declaring Rosh Ha-shana on Sunday, so that Hoshana Rabba would never be on Shabbat, and people would always be able to take the <i>aravot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 43b). Likewise, when the last <i>Sanhedrin</i> in Eretz Yisrael fixed the Jewish calendar as we know it, they made sure that Hoshana Rabba would never fall on Shabbat (Ran; <i>Levush</i>; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</i> 1:3).
It would seem, at first glance, that since an <i>arava</i> has neither taste nor smell, it represents the simplest Jew, who has neither Torah nor good deeds. The Torah commands us to bundle the <i>aravot</i> with the other species in order to protect this type of Jew (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:12; 4:2-3 above). Given this, we may ask: Why take the <i>arava</i> on its own? Clearly, the <i>arava</i> has another dimension. Precisely because it lacks both taste and smell, it represents the penitent, who is aware of his limited value and many deficiencies, and who realizes that God alone can help him. From this perspective, a penitent is closer to God than someone who is completely righteous. The latter has earned his right to exist in the merit of his good deeds; he does not need special help from heaven. In contrast, a penitent is aware that he is totally dependent upon God, Who extends a hand to him despite his sins and accepts his repentance. This connects him to God more profoundly. Of this, the Sages declared: “Where penitents stand, even completely righteous people cannot stand” (<i>Berakhot</i> 34b).
By the time Hoshana Rabba arrives, after we have already done our best to repent, praying extensively on Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, we now approach God to humbly ask for help. We take the <i>aravot</i> to show that, like penitents, we know that our salvation is dependent upon God alone. Perhaps this is why the <i>aravot</i> are called <i>hoshanot</i>, which allude to our repeated plea to God to “save us.” For if we deserve to be saved, it is in the merit of the humility that they represent. The custom of beating the <i>aravot</i> also expresses our willingness to disregard ourselves and our evil inclination in order to serve God wholeheartedly.

Section 3

<b>3. Beating the <i>Aravot</i></b>
The custom of Israel is to take <i>aravot</i> on the seventh day, to commemorate the Temple, and to beat them on the ground or something else, as the prophets instituted in Temple times (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 7:22). The Amora’im disagree as to whether the prophets introduced this practice as an enactment, in which case a <i>berakha</i> is recited, or as a custom, in which case no <i>berakha</i> is recited (<i>Sukka</i> 42a-b with Rashi). The accepted practical ruling is that it is a custom, and no <i>berakha</i> is recited (SA 664:2).
The <i>aravot</i> need to be 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> long (like the <i>aravot</i> bundled with the <i>lulav</i>). Technically, one <i>arava</i> is enough, but it is customary nowadays to follow Arizal and take five <i>aravot</i> (SA 664:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 16). Some prefer not to tie the five <i>aravot</i> together. Others prefer to tie them, and this is the custom (MB 664:17; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc</i>. 35).
Although the <i>aravot</i> used for the mitzva of the four species are invalid if most of its leaves have fallen off, <i>aravot</i> used for the custom of beating are acceptable as long as one leaf remains on each <i>arava</i>. Nevertheless, one should not be lenient. Rather, one should beautify the custom and use nice <i>aravot</i> that are valid for use with the <i>lulav</i> (SA and Rema 664:4; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc</i>. 34).
<i>Le-khatḥila</i>, one should take new <i>aravot</i> for beating, rather than those that have already been used by someone else. However, technically, many people can fulfill the custom with the same <i>aravot</i>. The beating itself does not disqualify them. As long as each is 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> long and has at least one remaining leaf, they may be used multiple times to fulfill the custom.
The <i>aravot</i> are beaten two or three times on the ground or something else (Rambam; SA 664:4). According to Arizal, the custom is to beat the <i>aravot</i> five times on the ground. Some Aḥaronim write that it is preferable to first beat the <i>aravot</i> on the ground in accordance with Arizal’s custom and then beat them on pews or other furniture, because some maintain that it is better when the beating tears off leaves, which is more likely to happen when beating them on furniture (<i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 664:16; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 19). Those who follow Arizal meticulously beat the <i>aravot</i> five times on unpaved ground and make sure that the <i>aravot</i> remain kosher enough to be used for a <i>lulav</i> throughout the beating (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 664:37).
In most communities, the four species are not taken together with the <i>aravot</i> for beating. Rather, the seven <i>hakafot</i> and the subsequent prayers and liturgical poems are conducted while holding the four species. Then the four species are put aside and the <i>aravot</i> picked up. Additional prayers and liturgical poems are then recited, and the service concludes with the beating of the <i>aravot</i> (Rema 664:7; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 26 based on Arizal; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc</i>. 32). The Yemenite custom is to hold the four species plus the <i>aravot</i> during the <i>hakafot</i> of Hoshana Rabba (as described in SA 664:3).
One cannot fulfill this obligation using <i>aravot</i> that are still bundled with the <i>lulav</i>. However, if the <i>aravot</i> are removed from the bundle after the four species have been taken, one may use them for the mitzva of beating <i>aravot</i> (SA 664:5; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 21).

Section 4

<b>4. The Status of the Four Species After the Festival</b>
As we have seen (5:8 above), during the festival the four species are set aside (<i>muktzeh</i>) for mitzva purposes and may not be used for any other purpose. Therefore, even after one has taken the <i>lulav</i> on Hoshana Rabba and is finished with the mitzva until next Sukkot, he may not eat the <i>etrog</i> or smell the <i>hadasim</i> (unless he had made a condition before the festival). With the completion of Hoshana Rabba, they are released from the prohibition, and they may be smelled or eaten (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Sukka</i> 10b, s.v. “ad”; BHL 665:1, s.v. “etrog”). 
In fact, if one has no further use for the four species after fulfilling the mitzva on the final day of Sukkot, he may leave them in the yard or anywhere that people leave grass clippings or yard trim. Since they are considered <i>tashmishei mitzva</i> (objects used in a mitzva), they need not be buried (as do <i>tashmishei kedusha</i> – objects with intrinsic sanctity, like a Torah scroll, <i>tefilin</i>, or <i>mezuza</i>). Nevertheless, they should not be thrown in the garbage or left where they will be trampled. Since they were used to perform a mitzva, they may not be treated disrespectfully (SA 664:8).
As for the <i>aravot</i> that were beaten on Hoshana Rabba, some have a custom to leave them atop the ark. Perhaps this was to ensure that they are not thrown on the ground outside of the synagogue where they would be trampled. Ultimately, however, it is preferable to protect the dignity of the ark and not leave the <i>aravot</i> there. Instead, they should be left on the side of the yard or wherever yard trim is left. Some set aside the <i>aravot</i> until Erev Pesaḥ, at which point they burn them together with the <i>ḥametz</i> or use them to fuel the oven for baking <i>matzot</i> (Rema 664:9). Some keep the <i>aravot</i> in their house or yard as a protective charm.

Section 5

<b>5. Taking Leave of the <i>Sukka</i></b>
The <i>sukka</i> should not be taken down until Sukkot is over. Even if one finished eating on Hoshana Rabba and does not intend to sleep for the remainder of the day, he should not take down his <i>sukka</i>. This is because the mitzva of sitting in the <i>sukka</i> continues until day’s end, so if one wants to study Torah or chat with friends, it is still a mitzva to do so in the <i>sukka</i>. However, c. 2.5 hours before sunset, one may move furniture from the <i>sukka</i> back into the house, in preparation for Shemini Atzeret (SA 666:1).
It is appropriate to spend time in the <i>sukka</i> at the end of Hoshana Rabba, in order to spend as much time as possible in the shade of a mitzva from which we are about to take leave for an entire year. Some kiss the <i>sukka</i> as they depart at the end of Hoshana Rabba (<i>Shlah</i>; MB 477:5). Some recite a prayer, found in some <i>siddurim</i>, when leaving the <i>sukka</i>, (Rema 667:1).
The <i>sekhakh</i>, walls, and decorations of the <i>sukka</i> were set aside for mitzva use, and therefore may not be used for any other purpose during the festival. Even though there is no longer a <i>mitzva</i> to sit in the <i>sukka</i> on the eighth day, they remain <i>muktzeh</i> then too, since the prohibition extends until the end of <i>bein ha-shmashot</i> of the seventh day, and at that point, the eighth day has already begun (SA 667:1;2:16 above).
Since the <i>sekhakh</i>, walls, and decorations are <i>tashmishei mitzva</i>, they do not require burial, but they may not be treated disrespectfully. For example, <i>sukka</i> beams may not be used as floorboards, and paper decorations may not be used as toilet paper (MB 638:24).
In Eretz Yisrael, it is forbidden to eat in the <i>sukka</i> on the eighth day. If one does so while intending to do a mitzva, he transgresses the Torah prohibition of <i>bal tosif</i>, as it is written: “Be careful to observe only that which I enjoin upon you: neither add to it (<i>lo tosef</i>) nor take away from it” (Devarim 13:1). Even if he does not have in mind that he is fulfilling the mitzva, he is still transgressing the rabbinic prohibition to eat in the <i>sukka</i> on the eighth day, because it looks like he is trying to add to the mitzva. If someone has nowhere else to eat, before the eighth day he should remove <i>sekhakh</i> that covers an area 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> long (c. 32 cm) and 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, making it clear that he is not interested in the <i>sekhakh</i> (SA 666:1). The concern that one appears to be adding to the mitzva applies only on the eighth day. One who wants to eat in the <i>sukka</i> any time after that need not remove <i>sekhakh</i>, because by that late date nobody would think that he means to add to the mitzva (Rema 666:1).
Outside of Eretz Yisrael, people eat in the <i>sukka</i> on the eighth day, because it is treated as though it might be the seventh day. However, no <i>berakha</i> is recited. Since the day is primarily treated as Shemini Atzeret and not Sukkot, reciting the <i>berakha</i> would render the day’s practices self-contradictory (<i>Sukka</i> 47a; SA 668:1; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> ch. 9 n. 4).
On the ninth day, when Simḥat Torah is celebrated outside of Eretz Yisrael, it is forbidden to eat in the <i>sukka</i>, because it looks like one is adding to the mitzva. If one has nowhere else to eat, he may not remove <i>sekhakh</i> before the ninth day, because of the prohibition of <i>Soter</i> on Yom Tov. To avoid looking like he is transgressing <i>bal tosif</i>, he should bring dirty pots and dishes into the <i>sukka</i>. Since it is prohibited to do so on Sukkot, this makes it clear that he is not intending to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> when he eats there (SA 666:1).

Chapter 7



Section 1

<b>1. Shemini Atzeret – a Holiday in Its Own Right</b>
The Yom Tov of Shemini Atzeret is both a continuation of Sukkot and an independent festival. The fact that the Torah calls it the “eighth” (<i>shemini</i>) indicates that it is a continuation of the seven days of Sukkot. Likewise, with respect to the mitzva to make a pilgrimage and offer an <i>olat re’iya</i> (pilgrimage burnt offering) and <i>shalmei ḥagiga</i> (festival peace-offering), it was deemed a continuation of Sukkot; one who ascended to the Temple and offered the requisite sacrifices on Sukkot did not need to offer them again on Shemini Atzeret, while one who did not offer the sacrifices on Sukkot could offer them on Shemini Atzeret (<i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 4b).
On the other hand, in several respects, Shemini Atzeret is considered an independent festival. First, the special <i>mitzvot</i> of Sukkot do not pertain to it: There is no mitzva to sit in the <i>sukka</i>, to take the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>, or to offer a water libation with the <i>tamid</i> offering. Therefore, it has a different name; it is not called Sukkot, but Shemini Atzeret in the prayers, <i>kiddush</i>, and <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">If one mistakenly says “<i>Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>” instead of “Shemini Atzeret” in the <i>Amida</i>, then if he has not yet completed that <i>berakha</i>, he should return to the beginning of the paragraph that begins “<i>Va-titen lanu</i>” and correct himself. If he completed the <i>Amida</i> before realizing his mistake, some say that <i>be-di’avad</i> he has fulfilled his obligation, since in some ways Shemini Atzeret is a part of Sukkot (<i>Beit Yehuda</i>, OḤ §4; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 28:15). However, the mainstream position and that of most <i>poskim</i> is that he has not fulfilled his obligation and must repeat the <i>Amida</i> (<i>Birkei Yosef</i> 668:2; <i>Ma’amar Mordekhai ad loc.</i> 1; R. Shlomo Kluger, <i>Responsa</i> <i>Shenot Ḥayim</i> §140; <i>Sho’el U-meshiv</i> 4:6:22; <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 4:51). If he remembered that it is Shemini Atzeret but simply misspoke, some maintain that he does not have to repeat (<i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 668:2; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Ve-zot Ha-berakha §2). If one says “<i>Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>” instead of “Shemini Atzeret” in <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> of <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, he need not repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i> because, according to many <i>poskim</i>, even one who forgot to say <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> altogether need not repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, as we are concerned for the view that there is no obligation to eat bread at a Yom Tov meal. Sephardim and some Ashkenazim follow this opinion in practice. In this case, where there is an additional uncertainty (i.e., Shemini Atzeret may be part of Sukkot), all agree that there is no need to repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>. (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 2:6 n. 5; <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Berakhot</i> 4:8.)</i> Second, the sacrifices offered on Shemini Atzeret in Temple times were different. On each day of Sukkot, fourteen lambs and two rams were offered, but on Shemini Atzeret, seven lambs and one ram were offered. On Sukkot, 13 bulls were offered on the first day, 12 on the second, and so forth until 7 bulls were offered on the seventh day. If Shemini Atzeret were a continuation of Sukkot, presumably 6 bulls would have been offered. In fact, only a single bull was offered, indicating that Shemini Atzeret is an independent festival (Bamidbar 29:32-39).
Since, in some ways, Shemini Atzeret is a holiday in its own right, we recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> in <i>kiddush</i> at night; the <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> recited on the first night of Sukkot does not cover Shemini Atzeret (<i>Sukka</i> 47b; SA 668:1).

Section 2

<b>2. The Idea Behind Shemini Atzeret</b>
The Sages tell us that the seventy bulls offered on Sukkot correspond to the seventy nations of the world, while the single bull offered on Shemini Atzeret corresponds to the singular nation of Israel. The Gemara illustrates: “This can be compared to a king of flesh and blood who told his servants, ‘Make me a big feast.’ Then on the last day of the celebration he said to his favorite, ‘Make me a small banquet, so that I can enjoy your company alone’” (<i>Sukka</i> 55b). A <i>midrash</i> makes a similar analogy. “This can be compared to a king who threw a week-long party and invited everyone in the country to it. Once the week was over, he said to his favorite, ‘We have already fulfilled our duty to the countrymen. Let the two of us continue with whatever we find – some meat, fish, or vegetable.’ Similarly, when God said to Israel, ‘On the eighth day you shall hold a joyous gathering <b>for yourselves</b>’ (Bamidbar 29:35), He was telling them, ‘Continue with whatever you find – a bull and a ram’” (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 21:24).
<i>Zohar</i> (III 104b) presents a third variation on the analogy. All throughout Sukkot, Israel offered sacrifices on behalf of the seventy nations. Shemini Atzeret, though, is the King’s day to celebrate exclusively with Israel. It can be compared to a king who invited guests. Everyone in the palace worked on their behalf. Later on, the king said to them, “Thus far, you and I have made efforts on behalf of all the guests. You have brought all these offerings for the seventy nations. Now we will celebrate for one day, just us.” This is the meaning of: “On the eighth day you shall hold a joyous gathering <b>for yourselves</b>” – these offerings are for you.
Another <i>midrash</i> focuses on the joy of celebrating Shemini Atzeret with God. “When Israel heard about it, they began praising God with the verse, ‘This is the day that the Lord has made – let us delight and rejoice in it (<i>bo</i>)’ (Tehilim 118:24). Rabbi Avin asked: [The Hebrew word <i>bo</i> is ambiguous, so] we do not know whether to rejoice on the day or to rejoice in God. King Shlomo came and resolved it: ‘Let us delight and rejoice in You’ (Shir Ha-shirim 1:4) – in You, through Your Torah; in You through Your salvation…” (<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Pinḥas §782).
This is what is unique about Shemini Atzeret. It has no special mitzva other than rejoicing in God, His Torah, and His salvation.

Section 3

<b>3. The Meaning of “<i>Atzeret</i>”</b>
The word “<i>atzeret</i>” derives from “<i>atzara</i>,” a gathering, for on this day, we gather together to bid farewell to the annual holiday cycle. This cycle begins with Pesaḥ, when we left Egypt, continues to Shavu’ot, when we were given the Torah, goes on to Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, times of remembrance, repentance, and atonement, and culminates with Sukkot, the Festival of Ingathering, when we gather in all the physical and spiritual fruits of the year and rejoice in them, thus spreading joy and blessing throughout the world. On Shemini Atzeret, which wraps everything up, we have a farewell get-together. “This can be compared to a king who invited his children to a party that was scheduled for a certain amount of time. When the time for departure arrived, he said, ‘My children, please stay with me for one more day. Saying goodbye is hard for me” (Rashi on Vayikra 23:36).
From this perspective, it is appropriate to be happier on Shemini Atzeret than on any other holiday. It is on this day, which concludes the yearly cycle of uplifting holidays, that we reach the pinnacle of closeness and connection to God. The joy we experience on Shemini Atzeret does not hinge on a specific mitzva, such as the <i>sukka</i> or four species, but stems from the very fact that we are God’s children and people. Thus, the Vilna Gaon says that the mitzva is to rejoice in God exclusively, as it is written, “You shall have nothing but joy” (Devarim 16:15). It is told that the Vilna Gaon rejoiced greatly on Sukkot and was even more joyful on Shemini Atzeret, because, according to esoteric teachings of the Torah, it is the happiest day of all (<i>Ma’aseh Rav</i> §233).
In this festive farewell get-together, when we draw especially close to God, He gave us the opportunity to permanently conserve and preserve in our souls forever all the illumination that we absorbed over the previous year. This makes it possible for us to continue to ascend in the upcoming year. There is another holiday that the Torah calls an <i>atzeret</i>, namely the seventh day of Pesaḥ: “You shall hold a joyous gathering (<i>atzeret</i>) for the Lord your God on the seventh day” (Devarim 16:8). It is described as an <i>atzeret</i> <b>for God</b> because all the light we gather and absorb during Pesaḥ we give back to God to guard it for us, as we are not yet on the level to permanently store it within us. But six months later on Shemini Atzeret, after completing all the year’s festivals, we have reached a point where we can store within ourselves, forever, all the light and goodness that we absorbed during the year. Thus, it is written: “On the eighth day you shall hold a joyous gathering (<i>atzeret</i>) <b>for yourselves</b>.” (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Moadim</i> 13:6 for why Shavu’ot is also called <i>Atzeret</i>.)
The eighth day is fitting for this celebration, as this world, the natural world, is linked with the number seven. It was created in seven days, and everything in it is temporary and finite. In order to store all of the goodness and divine illumination that manifests in it, we must sanctify ourselves and ascend to a level beyond nature and time, a level that is linked to the number eight. The power of this level that is beyond nature makes it possible to improve the world. We are similarly commanded to perform a <i>brit mila</i>, which improves upon nature, on the eighth day, for the covenant is eternal, beyond nature and time. God also gave us the eternal Torah on an “eighth day” of sorts – the day after we finished counting seven weeks of seven days. For this reason, it is appropriate to associate Simḥat Torah with Shemini Atzeret, the holiday correlated with the number eight (Maharal, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> ch. 2).

Section 4

<b>4. <i>Tefilat Geshem –</i> the Prayer for Rain</b>
Rain brings water to the world, allowing all plants, animals, and people to survive. Therefore, it is proper to praise God and pray to Him for beneficial rain. The Sages thus instituted two mentions of rain into the <i>Amida</i>, to be recited during the rainy season, between Sukkot and Pesaḥ. In the second <i>berakha</i>, on the theme of God’s might, the Sages ordained that we <b>praise</b> the omnipotent God by <b>declaring</b> that He “makes the wind blow and the rain fall” (“<i>mashiv ha-ru’aḥ u-morid ha-geshem</i>”). This invocation is called “<i>hazkarat geshamim</i>” (“the mention of rain”). In the ninth <i>berakha</i>, in which we <b>petition</b> God for sustenance and livelihood, we <b>ask</b> Him to bring down “benevolent dew and rain” during the winter months. This is called “<i>she’elat geshamim</i>” (“the request for rain”).
Sukkot marks the start of the rainy season, so it would have been reasonable to start mentioning and requesting rain already at the beginning of the festival. However, rain on Sukkot is seen as a bad omen, since we cannot fulfill the mitzva of sitting in the <i>sukka</i> in the rain. 
For this reason, the Sages delayed <i>hazkarat geshamim</i> until after Sukkot and ordained that we begin reciting “<i>mashiv ha-ru’aḥ</i>” at <i>Musaf</i> of Shemini Atzeret, when synagogue attendance is high and it is a good time to announce the beginning of <i>hazkarat geshamim</i>. Since not everyone comes to <i>Ma’ariv</i>, and it is forbidden to announce anything just prior to the <i>Amida</i> of <i>Shaḥarit</i>, so the announcement is made at <i>Musaf</i> (<i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 114:1-2).
Along with starting <i>hazkarat geshamim</i>, at <i>Musaf</i> of Shemini Atzeret we also recite <i>Tefilat Geshem</i>, the prayer for rain, in which we ask God that all the upcoming year’s rain be beneficial. It is customary to open the ark for <i>Tefilat Geshem</i> and to recite it with great intent and supplication. Ashkenazic custom treats this prayer like the prayers of the Days of Awe; the <i>ḥazan</i> wears a <i>kittel</i> and chants a special melody, as on the Days of Awe.
The custom of Sephardim and some Ashkenazim is to recite <i>Tefilat Geshem</i> before <i>Musaf</i>, and the custom of most Ashkenazim is to insert it into the <i>ḥazan</i>’s repetition of the <i>Amida</i>, in the second <i>berakha</i>, at the point where <i>hazkarat geshamim</i> appears. For those who follow this custom, the <i>gabbai</i> must declare loudly, before the silent <i>Amida</i>: “<i>Mashiv ha-ru’aḥ u-morid ha-geshem</i>!” By virtue of this announcement, the congregants recite this phrase during their silent <i>Amida</i>, even though they have not yet recited <i>Tefilat Geshem</i>.
It would make sense to begin <i>she’elat geshamim</i> with the first <i>Ma’ariv</i> after the festival. However, the Sages were concerned about pilgrims who traveled great distances, so they delayed the beginning of <i>she’elat geshamim</i> for another 15 days, until the night of the seventh of Marḥeshvan. This allowed the last of the pilgrims, who came from across the Euphrates, to return home without getting caught in a downpour (SA 117:1). In Eretz Yisrael, we continue this beautiful custom, which reminds us of Temple times, to this day. (Regarding the proper practice outside of Eretz Yisrael, see <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 18:7.) 
If one forgot to say “<i>mashiv ha-ru’aḥ</i>” in <i>Musaf</i> on Shemini Atzeret or anytime afterward, he need not repeat the <i>Amida</i> as long as he said “<i>morid ha-tal</i>” (“Who brings down dew”; this is the prevailing custom in Eretz Yisrael). If one forgot <i>she’elat geshamim</i> anytime after the seventh of Marḥeshvan, he should insert it into the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Shome’a Tefila</i>. If he forgot to say it there, he should return to the ninth <i>berakha</i> (where it is normally recited) and continue the <i>Amida</i> from there. If he finished the <i>Amida</i> before realizing his omission, he must repeat the entire <i>Amida</i>. (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 18:4-5.)
The Torah is likened to water: “Just as water gives life to the world, so the words of Torah give life to the world” (<i>Sifrei</i>, Ekev §48). Water animates the body and Torah animates the soul. Therefore, it is proper during <i>Tefilat Geshem</i> to have in mind spiritual water as well as physical water, so that the next year will be blessed with Torah. 
In the Diaspora, where there are two days of Yom Tov, <i>Tefilat Geshem</i> is also recited on the first day (Shemini Atzeret), just as in Eretz Yisrael. On the second day (Simḥat Torah), the yearly cycle of reading the Torah is completed.

Section 5

<b>5. The Completion of the Torah</b>
Jewish custom is to read one portion (<i>parasha</i>) of the Torah each week and to complete the entire Torah each year on Simḥat Torah. In Eretz Yisrael, this is the same day as Shemini Atzeret, whereas outside of Eretz Yisrael, Simḥat Torah is the day after Shemini Atzeret.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times, there were two customs governing the weekly Torah reading. In Eretz Yisrael, the Torah was completed every three years, whereas in Babylonia, it was completed every year. Additionally, since Babylonia is outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jewish communities there kept a second day of Yom Tov. It was ordained by Ezra that the <i>Tokhaḥa</i>, the curses of <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i> (Devarim 28), be read during the weeks leading up to Rosh Ha-shana (<i>Megila</i> 31b). Since the <i>Tokhaḥa</i> is just before the end of the Torah, the custom emerged in Babylonia to divide the remainder of the Torah into four <i>parshiyot</i>, so that the Torah would be completed each year on the second day of Shemini Atzeret, which thus became known as Simḥat Torah. Over time, the Babylonian custom came to predominate, and by the end of the Geonic era, all Jewish communities – even the communities of Eretz Yisrael – completed the annual reading of the Torah each year on Simḥat Torah (MT, Laws of Prayer 13:1).<br>In order to ensure that the Torah is completed each year on Simḥat Torah, there is some built-in flexibility regarding how the <i>parshiyot</i> are broken up. For instance, leap years have four more <i>Shabbatot</i> than regular years, and when Yom Tov coincides with Shabbat, the Torah reading for Yom Tov takes precedence, so there is a varying number of <i>Shabbatot</i> on which the regular Torah reading takes place. Finally, certain <i>parshiyot</i> are linked with certain times of the year: <i>Parashat Beḥukotai</i> is read before Shavu’ot, <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i>, as noted, is read before Rosh Ha-shana, and so forth. To keep the Torah reading cycle “on schedule,” certain <i>parshiyot</i> are doubled up.</i>
Even though the standard practice on Yom Tov is to call up five people to the Torah for <i>aliyot</i>, on Simḥat Torah, the <i>parasha</i>, <i>Vezot Haberakha</i>, is divided into seven <i>aliyot</i>. In addition, to honor the completion of the Torah, it is customary to call up every congregant for an <i>aliya</i>. To this end, the first five <i>aliyot</i> are read over and over, until everyone present has been called up, except for the four people who will be called up later: two for the last two <i>aliyot</i>, one for the beginning of Bereishit, and one for <i>maftir</i>.
<i>Le-khatḥila</i>, each time the <i>parasha</i> is repeated, people are called up in the standard order: first a <i>kohen</i>, then a Levite, and then three Yisraelim. If there are more <i>kohanim</i> or Levites to call up, they can be called up for the fourth and fifth <i>aliyot</i> as well as the usual first and second. When possible, they should still be called up in order, meaning, the fourth <i>aliya</i> should be given to the <i>kohen</i> and the fifth to the Levite (MB 135:37). If many <i>kohanim</i> are present but only a few Levites, a <i>kohen</i> should be called up for the first <i>aliya</i> but then a Yisrael may be called up for the second (<i>Meshiv Davar</i> 2:48). Once all <i>kohanim</i> and Levites have been called up, Yisraelim can be called up for all five <i>aliyot</i>.
When there are many congregants, it is customary to split up into multiple <i>minyanim</i> for the Torah reading, in order to shorten the time it takes to give everyone an <i>aliya</i>. Afterward the congregation reassembles for the final <i>aliyot</i> that conclude the Torah.
On Simḥat Torah it is customary to give <i>aliyot</i> to minors under the age of bar mitzvah. The widespread custom is to give an individual <i>aliya</i> to every child who knows how to recite the <i>berakhot</i> and can read along silently with the Torah reader. Minors who are not yet able to do that go up to the <i>bima</i> together with an esteemed member of the community for the <i>aliya</i> called “<i>Kol Ha-ne’arim</i>” (“All the Children”). The accompanying adult recites the <i>berakhot</i> slowly and loudly, and the children repeat each word after him. This is the penultimate <i>aliya</i>, and it begins with the word “<i>me’ona.</i>”
By giving every congregant an <i>aliya</i>, we show that every Jew – young and old, scholar and layperson – has a part in the Torah.

Section 6

<b>6. The “<i>Ḥatanim</i>”</b>
There are four especially prestigious <i>aliyot</i> on Simḥat Torah, and the most important of all is the one that concludes the Torah. The person honored with this <i>aliya</i> is called the “<i>Ḥatan Torah</i>.” The penultimate <i>aliya</i> is <i>Kol Ha-ne’arim</i>, discussed above, and it, too, is prestigious. The person called up for this <i>aliyah</i> is sometimes called the “<i>Ḥatan Me’ona</i>,” as “<i>me’ona</i>” is the first word of this <i>aliya</i>.
Immediately after the Torah is concluded, another Torah scroll is brought out. Another person is called up, and the first verses of Bereishit are read. It is a great honor to receive this <i>aliya</i>, and the person who receives it is called the “<i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i>.” This <i>aliya</i> expresses our devotion to Torah. When we finish reading the Torah, we do not bid it farewell, not even for a moment. Rather, we immediately begin it again (MB 668:10).
After the <i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i>, a third Torah scroll is brought out, and the <i>aliya</i> of <i>maftir</i> is read. This reading is about the offerings of the festival as described in <i>Parashat Pinḥas</i> (SA 668:2).
It is customary to read the beginning of Yehoshua as the <i>haftara</i>. Since the entire objective of the Torah is for it to be fulfilled in Eretz Yisrael, after completing the Torah it is appropriate to begin Yehoshua, which is about “the value of Eretz Yisrael” (see <i>Nedarim</i> 22b). Another reason to read Yehoshua at this point is because of its important verses about the value of Torah: But you must be very strong and resolute to observe faithfully all the Torah that My servant Moses enjoined upon you. Do not deviate from it to the right or to the left, so that you will be successful wherever you go. Let not this book of the Torah cease from your mouth, but recite it day and night, so that you will observe faithfully all that is written in it. (Yehoshua 1:7-8)
It is also appropriate to begin studying the Prophets right after completing the Torah.
In many places, it is customary to sell these four prestigious <i>aliyot</i> to the largest donors to the synagogue and financial supporters of Torah scholars. Elsewhere, these <i>aliyot</i> are given to Torah scholars or community leaders. If choosing honorees is likely to cause conflict, because it is difficult to determine who is most deserving, it is better to sell the <i>aliyot</i> to the highest bidder. It is an added bonus if a buyer is also a Torah scholar or community leader (<i>Kenesset Ha-gedola</i>; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 669:3). In some places, the wealthy buy these <i>aliyot</i> and then give them to Torah scholars. Their merit is great, as they both make a donation and honor the Torah.
Some have a custom that each person who receives an <i>aliya</i> pledges to make a donation to synagogue upkeep and Torah study (MB 669:7).
If one already had an <i>aliya</i> and then finds out that the congregation wishes to honor him as <i>Ḥatan Torah</i>, <i>Ḥatan Me’ona</i>, <i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i>, or <i>maftir</i>, he may accept this additional <i>aliya</i>, and there is no concern that he is making an unnecessary <i>berakha</i>. However, if one is honored as <i>Ḥatan Torah</i>, he should not receive the <i>aliya</i> of <i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i> as well, as it would be disrespectful toward the first Torah scroll; it would look as though he had to come back for an extra <i>aliya</i> because the first Torah scroll was found to be invalid (<i>Eliya Rabba</i>; <i>Pri Megadim</i>; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 669:4; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 2). A <i>kohen</i> or Levite can be <i>Ḥatan Torah</i> or <i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i> (Maharil; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 669:4).
Ashkenazic custom is to read three <i>aliyot</i> from <i>Parashat Vezot Haberakha</i> on the night of Simḥat Torah, after the <i>hakafot</i>. Those who are called up recite the <i>berakhot</i> (MB 669:15).

Section 7

<b>7. Customs of <i>Hakafot</i></b>
It is customary on Simḥat Torah to have seven <i>hakafot</i> at night and another seven during the day. As we have learned, <i>hakafot</i> allude to the <i>or makif</i>, the highest illumination that envelops us, uplifts us, and inspires us, but which is so sublime that we cannot apprehend it through our intellects in any definite way (above, 1:7 and 5:9). Everything that we learned and had the privilege to understand in the course of the year is a type of internal light, which our intellect absorbs in a definite, demarcated manner. Through this, when we complete the Torah, we can absorb something of the <i>or makif</i>, which emerges from the Torah as a whole. The intensity of Simḥat Torah facilitates this process.
Before the <i>hakafot</i>, the custom is to take all the Torah scrolls out of the ark, including invalid scrolls. Ashkenazic custom is to carry all the scrolls and dance with them for the duration of the <i>hakafot</i>. If there are more scrolls than the dancers can carry, only those scrolls that have someone to carry them are taken out. According to Sephardic custom, for most of the <i>hakafot</i>, almost all of the Torah scrolls are placed on the <i>bima</i>, while one person holds one Torah scroll, and everyone else dances around them. Based on the teachings of Arizal, some have the custom to circle the <i>bima</i> with one Torah scroll exactly once for each of the seven <i>hakafot</i>. (See <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Vezot Ha-berakha §17.) All these customs are acceptable.
Seven circuits suffice to uphold the custom of <i>hakafot</i>, but to rejoice with and honor the Torah, the main focus of Simḥat Torah, one should expand and extend the dancing. The extra dancing does not have to take the form of circuits around the <i>bima</i>. It is customary (but not required) to sing liturgical poems during <i>hakafot</i>, each community according to its customs.
The night <i>hakafot</i> take place after <i>Ma’ariv</i>. During the day, some have the <i>hakafot</i> after <i>Musaf</i> and some have them after the Torah reading (Ḥida, <i>Le-David Emet</i>, end of §26). But in most congregations, <i>hakafot</i> take place earlier, after <i>Shaḥarit</i> and before the Torah reading.
Many synagogues have a <i>kiddush</i> during <i>hakafot</i>, where some people drink a lot of wine and get tipsy, but they make sure to avoid intoxication. One must make sure to leave enough time to become sober and clearheaded before <i>Musaf</i> and <i>Minḥa</i>, as it is prohibited to pray the <i>Amida</i> while under the influence of alcohol (SA 99:1; <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 5:11). It is also prohibited for a <i>kohen</i> to perform <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> while under the influence (SA 128:38).
<i>Le-khatḥila</i>, everyone present in the synagogue should stand during the entire time of <i>hakafot</i>. However, if it is difficult for someone to stand, he may sit, but he should stand up at the beginning of each <i>hakafa</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Every synagogue has some people who sit during <i>hakafot</i>, though, at first glance, the <i>halakha</i> is that one must stand throughout the <i>hakafot</i>, for we learn in <i>Kiddushin</i> (33b): “If one must stand for a Torah scholar, as it is written, ‘You shall honor the sage’ (Vayikra 19:32), then certainly one must stand for the Torah scroll itself.” AHS YD 282:2 records this ruling but states that this is not the prevailing practice and justifies this practice by explaining that when the Torah scrolls are being held between <i>hakafot</i>, they can be considered to be “at rest,” and it is not necessary to stand, just as it is not necessary to stand when the Torah scroll is lying on the <i>bima</i>. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach justifies those who sit during <i>hakafot</i> on the grounds that during the <i>hakafot</i>, the circle of the <i>hakafot</i> is considered to be the place of the Torah scroll (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i>, <i>Mo’adim</i> 12:9). Others find justification based on the laws about standing for a Torah scholar; according to <i>Tosafot</i> and Rema YD 242:16, it is enough to stand for a Torah scholar once in the morning and once in the evening, not necessarily every time he passes (<i>Be-tzel Ha-ḥokhma</i> 5:139). Still others argue that if the people dancing on Simḥat Torah are crowded together, with less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of space between them, then they count as a barrier separating the Torah scroll from those sitting down (<i>Pri Eliyahu</i> 3:24).</i>
Based on a kabbalistic custom from Arizal’s time, some Israeli communities hold “second” <i>hakafot</i> (“<i>hakafot sheniyot</i>”) at night after Shemini Atzeret ends. They, too, are in honor of the Torah, so there is an element of mitzva in them. Rav Kook says that musical instruments should be played during <i>hakafot sheniyot</i> to make it clear that Yom Tov is over, and that they are not celebrating <i>Yom Tov Sheni shel Galuyot</i> in Eretz Yisrael (<i>Oraḥ Mishpat</i> §142).

Section 8

<b>8. Intense Joy</b>
The joy of Simḥat Torah is so intense because there is no greater joy than that associated with Torah. Thus we find that when King Shlomo attained wisdom, he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and made a great feast for all his servants. We learn from this that we make a feast to celebrate the completion of the Torah (<i>Shir Hashirim Rabba</i> 1:9).
It was said in praise of Abaye, one of the greatest of the Amora’im, that he declared a holiday with a festive meal for the sages every time one of his students completed a tractate (<i>Shabbat</i> 128b). Thus, there is a custom to have a great feast on Simḥat Torah. In many places, the <i>Ḥatan Torah</i> and <i>Ḥatan Bereishit</i> invite the whole congregation to a <i>kiddush</i> or provide wine for the feast.
The importance of this joy is evident from the fact that the Ge’onim ruled that in honor of Simḥat Torah, it is permissible to dance and clap, even though the Sages prohibited dancing and clapping on Shabbat and Yom Tov, out of concern that people might end up fixing their musical instruments (<i>Beitza</i> 36b; SA 339:3). More recently, after the great Ḥasidic masters emphasized the value and importance of the mitzva to be joyful, many are lenient about this even on an ordinary Shabbat. (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 22:18.)<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The status of a mourner on Simḥat Torah: Sephardic practice allows mourners who have concluded <i>shiva</i> to participate in all aspects of Simḥat Torah, including <i>hakafot</i>, dancing, and the communal meal in the synagogue (<i>Shalmei Mo’ed</i>; R. Mordechai Eliyahu, <i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 55:30; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 467). According to Ashkenazic practice, they may participate in the communal meal and <i>hakafot</i>, but not the dancing, and mourners for a parent do not participate in the dancing during their twelve months of mourning (MB 669:8; <i>Gesher Ha-ḥayim</i> 23:3-7; <i>Pnei Barukh</i> 29:10). However, if it would be obvious that a mourner is avoiding the dancing (as in the case of a rabbi whom people always dance with, or one whose dancing usually stands out), he may dance, for if he does not do so, it will look like he is mourning on Yom Tov. (<i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 6:62 gives this as the reason to be lenient in the case of the rabbi.) It would seem that if people from different communities pray together, an Ashkenazi who wants to rely on the Sephardic practice may do so. I also heard from my father and teacher, Rav Zalman Baruch Melamed, that there are grounds for leniency when it can reasonably be assumed that the parents would not want their child to miss out on Simḥat Torah because of them, since all the customs of mourning parents are to honor them.</i>
It is customary for women and children to come to synagogue in honor of Simḥat Torah. Some say that there is a certain similarity between Simḥat Torah and the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>, which took place on Sukkot every seven years. (See chapter 8 below.) Just as all Israel assembled to hear the king read the Torah, so too all Israel assembles to honor the Torah.
Many Torah giants would dance their hearts out on Simḥat Torah. It is told of the Vilna Gaon: He was very happy on Sukkot, and even happier on Shemini Atzeret, because it is the happiest time of all according to esoteric teachings.... He would march before the Torah scroll joyously and energetically, his face alight with wisdom like a burning torch. He clapped and twirled and leapt with all his might before the Torah scroll. The song leaders would sing a verse, and he would repeat after them…. (<i>Ma’aseh Rav</i> §233; see <i>Harḥavot</i>)
Some do not stand on their dignity during the dancing. They are following the example of King David. When he escorted the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, he wore his best clothing, made with links of gold; he danced and leapt with all his might before the Ark, kicking his legs high, even exposing himself a bit, while the gold links of his clothing clanked and jingled (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 4:20). When his wife, Michal the daughter of King Shaul, saw this, she was disgusted with him. When he returned home, she greeted him with rebuke, because she felt he had degraded the honor of the monarchy by acting like riffraff in the presence of his slaves and maidservants. King David responded that he was not dancing for his honor. Rather, he danced “before the Lord, Who chose me instead of your father and all his family, and appointed me ruler over the Lord’s people Israel! I will dance before the Lord and dishonor myself even more, and be low in my own esteem, but among the maidservants that you speak of I will be honored” (2 Shmuel 6:21-22).
It is said that anyone who dances and rejoices with all his might in honor of the Torah is guaranteed that the Torah will not be alien to his descendants (Rabbi Yisrael Yaakov<b></b> Algazi, <i>Shalmei Ḥagiga</i> 17:16). Others say that all of our imperfect prayers and supplications, which could not ascend to heaven during the year and even during the Days of Awe, now ascend and are well received thanks to our dancing on Simḥat Torah (Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, the first Belzer Rebbe). It is also said that the holy Arizal attained the highest levels of insight into the esoteric aspects of the Torah because he rejoiced with all his might when performing <i>mitzvot</i> (MB 669:11).

Chapter 8



Section 1

<b>1. The Mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i></b>
It is a positive mitzva to assemble all of Israel – men, women, and children – on Sukkot at the end of each <i>Shemita</i> year, during their pilgrimage to the Temple. Sections of the Torah that encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance are then read to them, as it is written: And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year, at the time of the <i>Shemita</i> year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Torah aloud in the presence of all Israel. Assemble (<i>Hak’hel</i>) the people – men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities – that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Torah. Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere the Lord your God as long as they live, in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. (Devarim 31:10-13)
The purpose of this assembly, which took place once in seven years, was to raise the honor of the Torah and its commandments. There was no grander, more impressive event than this, in which all of Israel participated – young and old, men and women, and most esteemed of all, the king, who would read from the Torah to the people. This spurred everyone to ask: What is the point of this large assembly? The answer was self-evident: “To hear the words of Torah, which is our foundation, our glory, and our grandeur. This would lead them to speak its great praises and its esteemed glory. They would all be implanted with desire for it, and from this desire they would learn to know God, earn the ultimate goodness, and God would be pleased with their actions” (<i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §612).
Every participant benefited greatly from <i>Hak’hel</i>. Those able to study Torah in depth were inspired to increase their study. Those able to listen and understand were inspired to listen avidly to the Torah’s words and to live by them. Children who were old enough to understand listened to the words, and the sanctity of the occasion inspired and encouraged them to study Torah and keep <i>mitzvot</i>. As for those children who were too young to understand, their souls absorbed the tremendous value and incomparable importance of Torah, when they saw that everyone was gathering together to hear it. Their parents were inspired too, recognizing the monumental mission incumbent upon them: to educate their children to Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> (Ramban on Devarim 31:12-13; Maharal, <i>Gur Aryeh</i>, <i>ad loc</i>.; see <i>Harḥavot</i>).
All were obligated in this mitzva, from converts who did not yet understand Hebrew to great sages who knew the entire Torah, for <i>Hak’hel</i> is a reflection of the revelation at Mount Sinai; the entire people must imagine and feel that they are now accepting the Torah directly from God. (See MT, Laws of Pilgrimage Offerings 3:6.)
The Sages ordained that the king read from the Torah to further dignify the event. However, even when there is no king, the king’s voice is weak, or he is a minor, the mitzva is not abrogated. Rather, a very prominent person does the reading – a prince, Kohen Gadol, or great Torah sage. (See: <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> on <i>Sota</i> 7:8; <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i> §612; <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Devarim 31:11; R. Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim (Aderet), <i>Zekher Le-Mikdash</i> ch. 1.)

Section 2

<b>2. The Reading</b>
<i>Hak’hel</i> must be read in the holy tongue, the Hebrew of Scripture, as the verse states, “You shall read <b>this</b> Torah aloud” (Devarim 31:11) – as it is written. Those who do not understand the holy tongue are still required to listen, just as when the Torah was given on Sinai (<i>Sota</i> 32a; MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:5-6).
All the readings were from the book of Devarim. The first section was from the beginning of Devarim until the end of the <i>Shema</i> paragraph (1:1-6:9). These chapters describe the preparations for entering Eretz Yisrael, the sin of the spies and its consequences, the conquest of the east bank of the Jordan River, and Moshe’s supplications to enter the land. This is followed by a lengthy section about the revelation at Sinai and the prohibition of idol worship, and an admonition to future generations to keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> and teach them to their children. As a reward, they will endure in the land. The first selection concludes with <i>Shema</i> (<i>ibid</i>. 6:4-9), which expresses the foundation of faith and includes the commandment to love God.
The second selection was the paragraph of “<i>Ve-haya im shamo’a</i>” (11:13-21), which speaks of reward and punishment for keeping the <i>mitzvot</i>. 
The third and fourth sections had to do with tithing: “<i>Aser te’aser</i>” (14:22-27) and “<i>Ki tekhaleh le’aser</i>” (26:12-15). The fifth section was about the king and his commandments (17:14-20). Finally, the sixth and final section was the blessings and curses (ch. 28), detailing the reward for Israel if they keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, and the punishment if they do not (<i>Sota</i> 41a).
According to Rambam, everything from the section on tithes to the end of the curses was read straight through (14:22-28:69). This lengthy reading includes many <i>mitzvot</i>; 138 <i>mitzvot</i> appear here for the first time (§473-611 in <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i>), as do many more <i>mitzvot</i> that were mentioned earlier in the Torah. These include many interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i>, including tithing, charity, returning lost objects, appointing judges, rules of justice, and the prohibition upon charging interest. Other <i>mitzvot</i> relate to kings and war, prophecy and priesthood, and marriage, as well as many prohibitions connected to idolatry and magic.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">MT, Laws of Pilgrimage Offerings 3:3, based on <i>y.</i> <i>Sota</i> 7:8 and Rambam’s version of the <i>mishna</i>. The first opinion cited above is based on the text of the <i>mishna</i> as it appears in <i>Sota</i> 41a. According to this version, “<i>Ki tekhaleh le’aser</i>” was read before the section on the king, even though in the Torah it appears later, to keep the two sections on tithes together. Rashi has a third version of the <i>mishna</i>, according to which the blessings and curses were read after “<i>Ki tekhaleh le’aser</i>,” and the section about the king was read at the end.</i>

Section 3

<b>3. The Timing of the Mitzva and Those Obligated in It</b>
<i>Hak’hel</i> took place on Sukkot right after the <i>Shemita</i> year: “Every seventh year, at the time of the <i>Shemita</i> year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God” (Devarim 31:10-11). Based on the phrase “when all Israel comes,” the Sages extrapolate that the verse refers to the beginning of the festival, as that was when everyone came to Jerusalem (<i>Sota</i> 41a). However, the Sages did not want to hold the assembly on the first day of the festival, because that day is Yom Tov, and it would be forbidden to erect the platform on which the king stood. Putting it up before the festival was not a good option either, because that would have led to crowding in the Temple courtyard when everyone came to offer sacrifices. Therefore, <i>Hak’hel</i> was postponed until right after the first Yom Tov (Rashi). Alternatively, it can be derived from the verse’s use of the word “<i>ba-mo’ed</i>” (translated above “at the time”), which can be understood to mean “in the festival,” that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place in the middle of the festival, not at the very beginning (<i>Tosafot</i>).
Some say that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place at night, right after the first Yom Tov (<i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>). Others maintain that it took place the next day, on the first day of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> (Aderet).
The <i>Hak’hel</i> assembly put the stamp of sanctity on the concluding <i>Shemita</i> cycle. The gathering of the entire nation then to hear the Torah conveyed a powerful message: everything connected to Torah has eternal value, while everything else is eventually lost and forgotten. This message strengthened and enlightened Israel to continue following the Torah’s ways for the next seven-year cycle.
Since <i>Hak’hel</i> took place on a pilgrimage festival, the Sages derived from a <i>gezera shava</i> that men who are exempt from making the pilgrimage and offering the festival sacrifices (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:15) are also exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>. Therefore, the deaf, mute, blind, lame, and <i>tamei</i> are exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>, as are slaves. Elderly and sick men unable to walk from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount are exempt as well. However, women are obligated in <i>Hak’hel</i> even though they are not obligated to make the pilgrimage.
Parents are obligated to bring a minor with a disability to <i>Hak’hel</i>, just as they were obligated to bring the rest of their children. This was true even if the disability would exempt the child from the obligation to undertake the pilgrimage himself as an adult (<i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i> 612:4). The uncircumcised are also obligated in <i>Hak’hel</i> (MT, Laws of Pilgrimage Offerings 3:2).
Even if someone could not hear the king read – whether because he was forced to stand very far away due to the crowds or because he was hard of hearing – he was still expected to focus his attention on the reading. Rambam elaborates: “It was established by Scripture only to strengthen the true religion. One is meant to see himself as if he is being commanded directly by God, right now. The king is a messenger, conveying the words of God” (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:6 as interpreted by <i>Leḥem Mishneh ad loc</i>.).

Section 4

<b>4. The Proceedings</b>
In preparation for the assembly, the <i>kohanim</i> walked through Jerusalem blowing trumpets to gather everyone to the Temple Mount. A large wooden platform was erected in the middle of the women’s courtyard. The king ascended and sat there so that everyone could hear and see him as he read (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4). If he wanted to honor the Torah by standing up during the reading, this was deemed praiseworthy. (See <i>Tosafot</i> on <i>Sota</i> 41a, s.v. “mitzva.”)<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Gemara, the event took place in the women’s courtyard (<i>Sota</i> 41a). The Tosefta (<i>t. Sota</i> 7:8) also records the view of R. Eliezer b. Yaakov that it took place on the Temple Mount. Rambam writes that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place in the women’s courtyard (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4). This would seem to be problematic, since the women’s courtyard was too small for the entire nation to assemble there. R. Yisrael Ariel writes that the women’s courtyard could hold, at most, 10,000 people. This leads him to conclude that generally there was not a very big crowd, and the mitzva could be fulfilled in the women’s courtyard. But when the crowds were larger, <i>Hak’hel</i> was held on the Temple Mount, in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer ben Yaakov (<i>Maḥzor Ha-Mikdash</i>, Sukkot volume).<br>This leads to another question: How could all the people assembled hear the king without a microphone? Perhaps in the women’s courtyard, which was closed off, 10,000 people could hear the king if his voice was strong. But if there were more than that, they would not have been able to hear him for such a long reading. Evidently, it was not necessary for everyone to hear him. This idea is supported by the requirement for the hard of hearing to attend (<i>Leḥem Mishneh</i> on MT, <i>Ḥagiga</i> 3:6). Even though they would not have been able to hear, they were expected to be there and imagine that God was issuing these commands at that moment. If this is correct, we may conclude that the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the Sages (and Rambam) that the event took place in the women’s courtyard. Ten thousand people were there, and the rest of the nation stood on the Temple Mount. Even though an individual might not hear, he still completely fulfilled the mitzva. Alternatively, according to <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 3a s.v. “af”), the mitzva does require each and every person to hear, which leaves open the question of how the masses could fulfill the mitzva. In any case, people in the future Temple will certainly fulfill the obligation, because the king will be able to use a microphone. See <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 12:9 n. 8.</i>
To honor the Torah and the king, the people assembled would pass the Torah scroll from person to person until it reached the king. The attendant of the synagogue on the Temple Mount took the scroll and gave it to the head of the synagogue, who passed it to the Deputy Kohen Gadol, who gave it to the Kohen Gadol, who passed it to the king. The king accepted the Torah scroll while standing (<i>Sota</i> 41a; MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4).
Before and after the reading, the king recited the <i>berakhot</i> that are normally said at the beginning and end of an <i>aliya</i>. Afterward, he added seven more <i>berakhot</i>: 1) <i>Retzei</i> (<i>Birkat Ha-avoda</i>, from the regular <i>Amida</i>); 2) <i>Modim</i> (<i>Birkat Ha-hoda’a</i>, also from the regular <i>Amida</i>); 3) <i>Ata Veḥartanu</i> (the fourth <i>berakha</i> of the Yom Tov <i>Amida</i>); 4) a prayer for the Temple to endure, concluding with “<i>Barukh ata Hashem, ha-shokhen be-Tziyon</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord, Who dwells in Zion”); 5) a prayer for the monarchy of Israel to endure, concluding with “<i>Barukh ata Hashem, ha-boḥer be-Yisrael</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord, Who chooses Israel”); 6) a prayer for the service of the <i>kohanim</i> to find favor with God, concluding with “<i>Barukh ata Hashem, mekadesh ha-kohanim</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord, Who sanctifies the <i>kohanim</i>”); 7) an extensive, unscripted prayer, concluding with “<i>Hosha Hashem et amkha Yisrael, she-amkha tzerikhin lehivashe’a</i>” (“Lord, save Your people, Israel, for your people needs salvation”), followed by “<i>Barukh ata Hashem, shome’a tefilla</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer”) (<i>Sota</i> 41a; MT, <i>op. cit</i>. 3:4).

Section 5

<b>5. Commemorating <i>Hak’hel</i></b>
In recent times, the great of rabbis have encouraged the Jews of Eretz Yisrael to hold a commemoration of this precious mitzva, to honor the Torah and commemorate the Temple. We have learned that the Sages enacted several ordinances to commemorate Temple practices. They derived the impetus for these commemorations from a verse: “But I will bring healing to you and cure you of your wounds, declares the Lord. Though they called you ‘Outcast, that Zion whom no one seeks out’” (Yirmiyahu 30:17). The Gemara elaborates: “whom no one seeks out” implies that we should seek Zion and remember it. Doing so will help it heal (<i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 30a).
All agree that there is no way to fulfill the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> nowadays, because it is linked to the mitzva of making a pilgrimage to the Temple for the festival, as it is written: “At the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose” (Devarim 31:10-11). As long as the Temple is in ruins and it is impossible to offer the festival sacrifices, the mitzva of making the pilgrimage does not apply (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:16). The Sages derived this from a <i>gezera shava</i>, as the Torah speaks of “appearing” in the context of both <i>mitzvot</i> (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 3a). Rambam codifies this succinctly: “All who are exempt from the pilgrimage are exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>, except for women and children…” (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:2).
Nevertheless, the greatest of rabbis considered it important to make a nationwide commemoration of <i>Hak’hel</i>, especially in our generation, as the Jewish people continue to gather in its land. The first person to put forth this idea was R. Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, “the Aderet,” who composed a booklet called <i>Zekher Le-Mikdash</i> and then moved to Jerusalem at the end of his life to serve as its chief rabbi. His son-in-law, our master Rav Kook, supported the idea as well, but neither of them lived to see it happen. Other rabbis who were in favor of a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration included R. Yeḥiel Michel Tikochinsky (<i>Ir Ha-kodesh Ve-hamikdash</i> 4:15) and two chief rabbis of Israel – R. Yitzḥak Ha-Levi Herzog and R. Ben-Zion Uziel – as well as R. Yaakov Moshe Charlap and R. Zvi Yehuda Kook. Two rabbis who worked hard to turn it into a reality were R. Shlomo David Kahana, who served for decades as the head of the Warsaw <i>beit din</i> and later as Chief Rabbi of the Old City of Jerusalem, and his son, R. Dr. Shmuel Zanvil Kahana, who served for two decades as the Director General of Israel’s Ministry for Religious Services. It was during his tenure there he organized the <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration.
In 1945, after the Holocaust and before the founding of the State of Israel, the initiative of these rabbis came to fruition, and the first <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration took place, with the participation of the chief rabbis and other leading rabbis. It was organized by the cultural division of Hapoel Hamizrachi, a political party of Religious Zionist workers. Every seven years since then, at the end of every <i>Shemita</i>, there has been a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration. The one exception was in 1973, at the height of the Yom Kippur War, when the men had been called up to fight and risk their lives to protect the land and its people. In 1987 there was an especially impressive <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration, led by Chief Rabbis R. Avraham Shapira and R. Mordechai Eliyahu. Tens of thousands gathered at the Kotel and the porches overlooking it. The Western Wall Plaza was filled to capacity, and the crowds overflowed into the alleyways. The event was broadcast live on TV. The President of Israel, Chaim Herzog, participated in the reading, along with the chief rabbis. Many of the country’s luminaries participated in the ceremony, including the Prime Minister, many other ministers, and the President of the Supreme Court. Ever since then, at the end of each <i>Shemita</i> on the first day of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration takes place at the Kotel, drawing huge crowds and bringing great honor to God and His Torah.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">See R. Yehuda Zoldan’s article “<i>Le-toldot ‘Zekher La-Hak’hel’</i>” in the collection <i>Sefer Hak’hel</i> (pp. 653-678). Some Ḥaredi rabbis were opposed to a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration. Their reasoning was similar to the reason for their opposition to settling Eretz Yisrael and establishing the State of Israel – fear of breaking with tradition – which was popularly expressed in the proverb, “Anything new is prohibited by the Torah.” Since their position does not have a strong halakhic basis, most of the great rabbis dismissed it. See R. Yehuda Amichai’s article “<i>Takanot Zekher La-Mikdash</i>” in that collection (pp. 606-617), where he puts forth the thesis that anywhere the Temple can be commemorated, it should be done, as long as there will not be negative halakhic consequences.<br>Should a <i>berakha</i> be recited on a commemoration of the Temple? If a mitzva still applies after the Temple’s destruction (such as the <i>lulav</i>, where there is a mitzva everywhere to take it on the first day, even without the Temple), and the Sages expanded its scope as a commemoration of the Temple (ordaining that the <i>lulav</i> be taken everywhere during the rest of the festival as well), a <i>berakha</i> is recited on the commemoration. In contrast, if there is no mitzva remaining after the destruction, then its commemoration is performed without a <i>berakha</i> (as would seem to be the case with the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>, which applies only when the Temple stands). Nevertheless, R. Herzog, in his article “<i>Hatza’ot Le-ma’amad Zekher Le-Hak’hel</i> 5713” tentatively presents a halakhic justification for the Torah reader at the <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration to recite the <i>berakhot</i> that are normally said before and after an <i>aliya</i> (p. 620 in that collection). R. Ovadia Yosef gives his support to the custom of commemorating <i>Hak’hel</i> but says not to recite <i>berakhot</i> (<i>Yabi’a Omer</i>, YD 10:22). This was also the position of the other chief rabbis.</i>
