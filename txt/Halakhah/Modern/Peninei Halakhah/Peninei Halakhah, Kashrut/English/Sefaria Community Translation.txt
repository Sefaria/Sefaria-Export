<b>Challah/The Practical Order for the Separation of Challah</b>
There is a commandment to separate challah (the dough tithe) from dough intended for baking when its flour is from one of the five types of grain (see below, Section 8) and it is a significant quantity, such that it is possible to prepare at least enough food for a full day from it. That is, that its volume is at least like the volume of 43.2 eggs, which is approximately 2.16 liters (see below, Section 6).
The commandment applies equally to men and women. However if a man and a woman are kneading dough together, her right to the commandment has priority, since she has more responsibility for matters of the home (see Ohr Zarua, at the end of Paragraph 125; Rashi on Shabbat 32a). 
One who separates challah from flour has not fulfilled the commandment. For the obligation of the commandment does not begin until the mixing of flour and water, at which time it becomes applicable to separate challah. And the choicest time is at the end of the kneading of the dough (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 327:3).
Before performing the commandment, we recite the blessing, "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe who has commanded us with His commandments and commanded us to separate challah" (the Yemenite custom and that of some Ashkenazim) or "to separate challah terumah" (the Sepharadic custom), or "to separate challah from the dough" (the custom of most Ashkenazim and North African Jews).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There are many customs about the formula of the blessing, and all of them are proper: "To separate challah (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of First Fruits and other Gifts to Priests Outside the Sanctuary 5:11; Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 35:1; Olat Reiyah, p. 153; Shemirat Shabbat KeHilkhatah 42:12; Derekh Emunah 5:100); "to separate challah terumah" (Ben Ish Chai; Kaf HaChaim 457:9); "to separate challah from the dough" (Rashba; Siddur Beit Yaakov); "to separate terumah" (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 328:1; Gra 2); "to separate terumah challah" (Rashal; Chatam Sofer). The root of this discrepancy among customs is that the expression, challah, in the Torah means dough; and we separate terumah (tithe) from it, as it is stated (Numbers 15:20), "The first of your kneading troughs, challah, you should separate [as] tithe." But in the usage of the Sages, the commandment and that which is given to the priest is called challah; and even the tractate that deals with the commandment is called Challah.</i>
After the blessing, we separate a very small piece; and when it is separated some say, "Behold, this is challah," . Since it is forbidden to eat challah, it needs to be burned so that we do not make a mistake and eat it. Likewise, it is possible to place it in the garbage can; but in order that it not be disgraced, it should first be wrapped in something, and then placed that way into the garbage can. And many follow this practice (see above, Chapter 9, Section 5, note 8)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam and the Shulchan Arukh did not write to say, "Behold, this is challah." But there are those who reason that one must say [it] (according to Ravaad). And many follow this practice, but it is not obligatory. As we learned above, Chapter 9, note  8 - according to many Rishonim, it is a commandment to burn impure challah and terumah; and there are some that determined this to be the practical law (Shaarei Tzedek 14:34; HaMaaser veHaTerumah 10:30; Tevuat HaSadeh 9:10). When one burns the challah, one should not place it on a baking pan. As it is forbidden to eat challah, and its taste will be absorbed in the pan (which will subsequently transfer that taste to the next thing baked on it). Rather one should place it at the bottom of the oven. And it is possible to do this even when other food is being baked in the oven, for there is no possibility that the taste of the challah will be transferred to that food. But some are stringent, to wrap it in aluminum foil (see Tevuat HaSadeh 8:6). In practice, many are accustomed to be lenient to wrap it and place it in the garbage can. And, as we learned there, since it is complicated to burn it and the waiting period before it is burned is apt to cause mistakes, the practice is to be lenient. And there are some that say that when we separate less than a <i>kazayit</i> of challah, all opinions agree that there is no need to burn it (Yehudah Yaaleh, Yoreh Deah 352). However the Ramah (on Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah) 252 wrote that the custom is to enhance [the commandment] and to separate the quantity of a <i>kazayit</i>. One can choose how to enhance it. When the priests would eat challah, they were very careful not to make it impure. Hence they would show alacrity in separating the challah at the first possible time, meaning when most of the flour is mixed with the water. However today when we are all impure, we can wait until the choicest time, which is when the dough is made into a proper solid dough (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 327:2-3).</i>
If we have forgotten to separate challah from the dough, we can separate it after it has been baked, and we can then permit the baked good in that way. One who is concerned that challah was not separated from a baked good that he is served may separate a small crumb as challah and put it in a place about which there is no concern that he will come to eat it.
From the time that girls or boys are of bar or bat mitzvah age, they are permitted to fulfill the commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rambam, girls or boys that separated challah within the year before they reach the age of bar or bat mitzvah, have ex post facto fulfilled the commandment, like the law of a vow by a person close to the age of adulthood - with the stipulation that they understood what they did (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Heave Offerings 4:5; Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 131:33). But some say that so long as they have not reached the age of  bar or bat mitzvah, they did not have the ability to separate [it] (Biur HaGra 331:78, like the undifferentiated opinion in the Mishnah, Terumot 1:1).</i>
Someone can appoint another Jew in his stead to separate the challah from his dough as his agent. And then the agent separates the challah with a blessing. It is also possible to appoint the cook as a permanent agent, such that he separate challah from all of the doughs that he kneads throughout the entire period of time that he works [for the owner]. However the separation of challah by someone who separates it against the will of the dough's owner is ineffective (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 328:3).

Section 6

<b>Challah/Quantity for the Obligation of Challah</b>
The dough for which there is an obligation of [separating] hallah is the dough that the generation of the desert was accustomed to making, as it is stated (Numbers 15:20), "The first of your kneading troughs, challah, you should separate [as] tithe." The "kneading trough" is the dough that they would prepare from the manna that fell in the desert every day for each man, as it is stated (Exodus 16:16), "This is what the Lord has commanded: Each man shall gather his requirement of food; an omer per person, according to the number of your people, shall each man take for those in his tent." They would grind the manna and make it into a dough (Numbers 11:8). And the quantity for each person was a tenth of an ephah, as it is stated (Exodus 16:36), "And the omer is a tenth of an ephah" (Eruvin 83b). But dough that is of a smaller quantity than this is not significant, so it is exempt from challah. 
A tenth of an ephah is the volume of 43 and 1/5 eggs, meaning 2.16 liters (an egg is approximately 50 cubic centimeters); but, a priori, it is proper to round up the amount to 2.2 liters. This amount of flour is before it is kneaded with water, and without the addition of salt and spices. In order to be exact about the quantity of flour, it should be measured with instruments that are marked for volume. When it is not possible to measure the volume, we can look to the calculation of the amount by weight. However since we are talking about an estimation that is dependent on the density of the flour, there is a doubt. As sometimes the flour the volume of which obligates it for challah weighs more and sometimes it weighs less. Hence, there is a need to fix two quantities, one for the obligation to separate challah based on a doubt without a blessing; and another to separate challah without a doubt with a blessing. But because there is a difference between the different types of flour, there is a need to set a different quantity for each [type of] flour, as elucidated below: 
<b>With a blessing (dense flour):</b> Whole Wheat - 1.65 kg; White Flour and Spelt - 1.55 kg; Rye - 1.35 kg; Oat and Barley - 1.2 kg. <b>Without a blessing (loose flour):</b> Whole Wheat - 1.45 kg; White Flour and Spelt - 1.25 kg; Rye - 1.15 kg; Oat and Barley - 1.05 kg.

Despite the fact that it was permitted to humans to eat meat, one should be very careful with the desire that is connected to the eating of meat, which tends to make a person go after brutishness and sin. And so we find that the desire to eat meat caused Israel to sin, as it is written (Numbers 11:4) "Now the riffraff among them craved a craving and moreover the Children of Israel wept again and said: Who will give us meat to eat?" And Moshe our teacher complained to Hashem: "From where should I [get] meat to give to this entire people, when they weep on me, saying: Give us meat so that we may eat! I am not able, I alone, to carry this entire people, for it is too heavy for me!" (Numbers 11:13-14). And so Moshe was commanded to answer Israel that their punishment was going to come in the fulfillment of their request: "for a monthful of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes for you something-disgusting because you have spurned Hashem who is among you, by weeping before him, saying: Why, now, did we leave Egypt?" (Numbers 11:20) " and a rush-of-wind moved from Hashem and swept in quails from the sea... the people arose all that day and all night, and all the morrow day and gathered the quail; the least gathered ten homers [a large measure, some say a homer is 30 gallons] and they slaughtered all around the camp. The meat was still between their teeth, not yet completely chewed, when the anger of Hashem  flared up among the people, and Hashem struck down among the people an exceedingly great striking. So they called the name of that place: Kivrot Ha-Taava/ Burial-Places of the Craving, for there they buried the people who had-the-craving"(Numbers 11:31-34). From this we learned for the generations how severe and dangerous the exaggerated desire to eat meat is, that it extinguished the light of the soul and kills the body.

It is permissible to raise pets, such as dogs, cats and parrots. However, the  Sages forbade a Jew from doing business with impure animals, meaning animals the meat of which is not fit (kosher) to eat. However, the prohibition is upon animals, the meat of which non-Jews are accustomed to eating. And they decreed not to do business with them, lest from their being found in the possession of a Jew, he will come to eat its meat. But there is no prohibition about impure animals, the meat of which they are not accustomed to eating, so it is permissible to do business with them and to raise them for recreation or as a hobby (Beit Yosef, Yoreh Deah 117; Birkhei Yosef 2). However, there are some that claim that since these are called impure, it is inappropriate to bring them into the home. Yet this reasoning is not mentioned in the the books of the <i>poskim</i> (decisors). And these animals are [only] called impure because they are forbidden to eat, and one who eats from its meat makes himself impure. But this does not mean that their traits are defective to the point that one who raises them will likely render his soul defective. And it is the opposite, that each animal has its own particular good trait; so the Sages praised also types of impure animals, and noted the loyalty of the dog and the modesty of the cat. Hence it is permissible to raise pets.
However, when a pet causes anguish to someone in the family, it is forbidden to raise it. Hence, one who has a dog who is accustomed to scaring visitors to the house must send it to be trained, so that the dog learns to stop this and his owners be able to entertain guests with the appropriate honor (Shabbat 63a-b). 
The Sages said that a person should not bring an animal into his domain without knowing that he is able to provide it with appropriate food (Yerushalmi, Ketuvot 4:8). And included in this is that he be able to concern himself with lodging or a cage appropriate for it. And likewise, that he be able to clean its place according to what is required, and concern himself with its inoculation if that is called for.
When one's animal becomes sick, the owner must take care of it as is customary. When its disease is terminal and it is suffering, it is best to kill it in order to minimize its afflictions. It is fitting for someone who erred and to whom it [subsequently] becomes clear to him that he really is not fit to take care of his animal to find a different owner for it to take care of it. But if he does not find [one], he is not obligated to hold on to it and sustain it. And in a time of need, it is permissible for him to kill it, to minimize its pain (see above, section 7).

Even though the commandment of <i>shechitah</i> (ritual slaughter) is a divine commandment the reason for which we can not fully understand, it is clear that there is an expression of compassion in the laws of <i>shechitah</i>, as explained in Rabbi Dr. Levinger's comprehensive book (<i>Slaughter and Pain in Animals</i>). For <i>shechitah</i> is the easiest way to kill animals without great pain. For the vein that carries most of the blood to the brain passes through the location of the <i>shechitah</i>, such that there is no more supply of blood to the brain immediately after the <i>shechitah</i>. Hence, at the the time that the feeling of pain was supposed to reach the brain's membrum in which pain is recorded, the brain's membrum is not capable of recording the pain on account of the lack of blood and oxygen. Even before the main vein is severed, the pain is almost not felt because the <i>shechitah</i> must be done with a sharp and smooth knife and with a swift movement. In this way, the pain is almost not felt. Moreover, the practice is to have the animal lay down before the <i>shechitah</i>. Through this, its pain is lessened, since this position distracts its mind from the act of <i>shechitah</i>. Also, the supply of blood and oxygen to the brain is quickly [diminished] by this position. On top of this, research has made clear that the animals are not aware that they are about to be killed. For even after animals standing next to them are slaughtered, they continued to chew grass in peace; yet they do stop chewing during times of distress.

Together with the permission of eating meat that is not offered in the Temple there is the prohibition of eating blood, as it is written (Deut. 12:20-23) ... that is to say, blood has a specific mission, which is to support the soul of the living animal, and therefore even though the Torah permitted us to eat meat, it did not permit us to eat blood.
