Rabbinic Authority I

Foreword

In referring to the highest level of truth finding in a judicial proceeding, our Sages use of the phrase, “<i>Ha-dan din emet la-amito</i>.” What is being conveyed here is that knowledge of the law is not sufficient to render a verdict of truth. In order for the <i>dayan</i> to arrive at the correct verdict, the precise facts of the case must be discovered as well.
A beth din panel is not only thoroughly versed in the relevant hala­khot, but is also well-equipped by virtue of educational background and professional work experience to grasp the reality on the ground. This entails a relentless commitment to relevant fact finding, taking nothing at face value, and understanding the implications of the facts for the commercial behavior of the parties.
A second characteristic of the halakhic-judicial process dealing with monetary matters consists of the documentation that must accompany the verdict that the panel hands over to the litigants at the conclusion of the proceedings. The claims of the plaintiff, as well as the respondent’s rebuttals and counterclaims, are meticulously recorded. Next, a thorough discussion of the issues from a halakhic perspective is presented. Finally, the verdict is rendered, and this verdict is demonstrated to have flowed from the halakhic discussion.
R. Dr. A. Yehuda Warburg has assumed a vital role in implementing this vision of a “double level” of truth in the Beth Din of America and on other panels. In the present work, <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, R. Warburg presents a number of his judicial rulings. What stands out in these decisions is the halakhic framework, legal perspective, and “reasoned opinions” R. Warburg sets up to support his decisions.
For a number of decades, I have been involved on an ad hoc basis as a <i>dayan</i>, including serving on judicial panels for the Beth Din of America<i>.</i> In this capacity, I have often crossed paths with R. Warburg and served together with him on the same judicial panel. In each panel we served on together, R. Warburg’s outstanding Torah scholarship was always in evidence, scholarship motivated by a perfectionist’s drive to achieve new vistas in advancing the “double dimension” of truth that stands as the ideal for the halakhic-judicial process.

Preface

The present volume is intended as an introduction to a subject unfamiliar to many – rabbinic authority as reflected in our halakhic sources. Its subtitle – “The Vision and the Reality” – indicates the two perspectives from which we will approach this topic.
In discussing the halakhic “vision” of rabbinic authority, we will address a number of questions. How does Halakhah (Jewish law) envision rabbinic authority? What are the credentials for being a rabbinic authority? What is the difference between a rabbi who is “an authority” and one who is “in-authority”? What is the status of a congregational rabbi? How does a rabbi arrive at a halakhic decision? Is a rabbi bound to follow the opinions of his predecessors, or may he choose to render his own independent opinion? Under what conditions can he choose to issue his own judgment?
The author of <i>Sefer Ha-Arukh</i>, the first halakhic lexicon, defines Halakhah concisely:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Something that travels from the beginning of time until the end, or the path that the Jewish community walks.</small></span>
Halakhah embodies the traditions transmitted throughout the generations; it is the path that the Jewish People have chosen to follow. But how wide is that path?
John Stuart Mill, the father of modern liberalism, famously claimed:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The only purpose for which power can be exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>On Liberty</i>, (NY: 1956) chap. 1, para. 9.</i></small></span>
Does Halakhah endorse such a perspective, which would lead “socially harmless” matters to the individual conscience, even when it comes to business affairs?
This question leads us to many others. Are directors and employees in the corporate world halakhically and/or legally accountable for all their decisions? Should a halakhic arbiter or a civil court defer to a decision rendered by an employee or director, or should we scrutinize the propriety of their decision? To answer these questions, we will examine how two different legal systems – Halakhah and American law – approach the application of the business judgment rule in the profit and not-for-profit corporate world.
The final component of my discussion of the “vision” of rabbinic authority is an attempt to solve a particularly vexing problem faced by the contemporary Jewish court in some cases of divorce – the problem of one spouse refusing to execute a <i>get</i>, a bill of Jewish divorce. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> results in a <i>get me’usah</i>, a forced <i>get</i>, which is invalid. In this volume, I present a viable halakhic solution to this problem in an expanded version of an article that originally appeared in the <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (vol. 18), entitled, “Recovery for Infliction of Emotional Distress: Toward Relief for the <i>Agunah</i>.” Our contribution is an attempt to invoke the halakhot of <i>nezikin</i> (monetary damages for injury caused) to reduce the problem of “chained spouses” in our community.
The “reality” of rabbinic authority presented in this volume deals with one type of that authority – the Jewish court, or <i>beit din</i>. As members of our covenant-faith community, we are obligated to resolve our differences in a <i>beit din</i> rather than resorting to litigation in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i>, <i>piska</i> 6; <i>Gittin</i> 88b; <i>SA</i>, HM 26:1–3.</i> The parties who appear before a <i>beit din</i> sign a <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement) that empowers the panel of <i>dayanim</i> to resolve the matter in contention according to the norms of Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rema</i>, <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (HM) 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 12:18.</i> Assuming the <i>beit din</i> process and its decision comply with the rules of secular arbitration law, the judgment will be enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Uniform Arbitration Act, sec. 1. A <i>dayan</i> is responsible not only to render a judgment in accordance with Halakhah, but equally to ensure that the decision will be enforceable in civil court; see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 14b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:18; <i>Perush ha-Gra</i>, <i>Mishlei</i> 31:9; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 177.</i>
Interestingly, as central as the <i>beit din</i> system is in vision and reality, it is an institution whose workings and contributions to the “path of Halakhah” are largely unknown to most segments of the Jewish community. One of the primary reasons for unfamiliarity with the <i>beit din</i> can be traced back to a Mishnaic ruling:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Upon finishing their deliberations, they would bring the litigants back to the courtroom, and the senior member of the panel would state: Mr. X, you are acquitted, and Mr. X, you are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:7.</i></small></span>
A review of relevant passages in the Talmud and rulings throughout the ages and until today demonstrates that Jewish courts generally took this Mishnaic ruling to heart, limiting their decisions to identifying the innocent and responsible parties, but not offering much in the way of reasoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 84b; <i>Shavuot</i> 30b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Shulhan Aruch</i> (SA), HM 19:1.</i> However, prior to a <i>beit din</i>’s <i>psak din</i> (final decision), a litigant may request that the panel provide a reasoned opinion if he is concerned that one or more of the judges are ignorant of a relevant <i>halakhah</i> or that they are biased in some way.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 14; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 14:1, 4; <i>Sma</i>, HM 14:25; <i>SA</i>, HM 12:2; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Yehoshua</i> 1–2. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 12.</i> According to some authorities, this is true not only of a standing <i>beit din</i> that requires litigants to appear before them regarding a contentious matter, but also when the <i>beit din</i> is an ad hoc panel, known as <i>zabla</i> (“<i>zeh borer lo ehad</i>” – “one chooses one”)<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the absence of a standing <i>beit din</i> or when one or more of the litigants do not want to appear in front of a standing <i>beit din</i>, each party may choose one <i>dayan</i>, and the two <i>dayanim</i> (arbitrators) choose a third; see <i>SA</i>, HM 13:1–2.</i>
<i>Maharah Or Zarua</i> and <i>Havot Ya’ir</i> are of the opinion that each and every <i>dayan</i> should provide the grounds for his decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharah Or Zarua</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 165.</i> In our day especially, many litigants question a <i>dayan</i>’s credibility, halakhic expertise, and/or business acumen; therefore, if at all possible, a reasoned opinion should be forthcoming.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">R. Tzvi Yehuda ben Ya’akov, “The Obligation of Giving a Reasoned <i>Psak Din</i>” [Hebrew], 19 <i>Tehumin</i> (5759), 223, 234.</i>
Due to the fact that halakhic court procedure does not mandate the issuance of a reasoned opinion, however, contemporary <i>dayanim</i> have generally refrained from submitting reasoned judgments. Nevertheless, certain <i>dayanim</i> who sit on the Beth Din of America in New York City and others who serve in the Israeli <i>beit din</i> networks under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate and Eretz Hemdah-Gazit have done so.
During the last thirteen years, I have served as a <i>dayan</i> on the Beth Din of America and appeared on various <i>zabla</i> panels as well as a single arbitrator for the Hassidic, Modern Orthodox, Sephardic, and <i>yeshiva</i> communities in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. In numerous instances, I have rendered reasoned opinions in commercial matters and domestic relations. Among other matters, these decisions touch on issues of employment termination and severance awards, partnership dissolution, the validity of <i>minhag ha-soherim</i> (commercial practice), civil law, contractual agreements and preliminary agreements, the interpretation of contracts, the principle of indemnity in insurance law, recovery of economic loss of funds, consequential damages, lease, construction, and loan agreements, self-dealing in non-profit organizations, and copyright infringement. In addressing family matters, I have dealt with the grounds for issuing a divorce judgment, dividing up marital assets upon divorce, spousal support, child support and placement, filial obligations to one’s parents, and <i>yerushah</i> (inheritance) issues, such as guidelines for drafting a halakhic will and the validity of a civil will and a trust agreement.
The cases chosen for this volume cover the range of subjects characteristic of all modern legal systems – <i>dinei mamonot</i> (civil matters), public and administrative law, family law, and philosophy of law. Given that Halakhah is a religious legal system, the impact of <i>issur ve-heter</i> (ritual law) upon the monetary issues under investigation is equally dealt with in our judgments.
In this volume, I have included ten presentations inspired by reasoned opinions handed down as a member of a <i>beit din</i> panel. Two of these, dealing with drafting a halakhic will and labor relations, are expanded versions of my decisions that have recently appeared in the journal <i>Hakirah</i> (vols. 10 and 12). In each presentation, I offer a rendition of the facts of the case, followed by the claims of the <i>Tove’a</i> (plaintiff), the reply of the <i>Nitva</i> (defendant), and any counterclaims. Subsequently, there is a discussion of the halakhic issues emerging from the parties’ respective claims and counterclaims, followed by a decision rendered by the <i>beit din</i> panel. To preserve the confidentiality of the parties involved in these cases, all names have been changed, and some facts have been changed and/or deleted.
It is my hope that this collection will educate our community to the parameters and scope of rabbinic authority in general and the institution of the <i>beit din</i> in particular.
My appreciation to the publisher of Urim Publications, Tzvi Mauer. I offer my best wishes that the passion and sense of mission he brings to his calling to disseminate Torah scholarship will continue to be crowned with great success.
My thanks is given to Michal Alatin and Batsheva Pomerantz of Urim Publications for their expertise and technical skill in preparing my book for publication.

Part I; Rabbinic Authority; The Vision

Chapter 1; Towards Defining the Concept of Rabbinic Authority; A Contemporary Analysis

<big><strong>Towards Defining the Concept of Rabbinic Authority: A Contemporary Analysis</strong></big>
Mary Ann Glendon, a law professor at Harvard University and an astute observer of the interaction of law and social mores, observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The American rights dialect is distinguished by not only what we say and how we say it, but also what we leave unsaid. Each day’s newspapers, radio broadcasts and television programs attest to our tendency to speak of whatever is most important to us in terms of rights, and to our predilection for overstating the absoluteness of the rights we claim. Our habitual silences concerning responsibilities are more apt to remain unnoticed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mary Ann Glendon, <i>Rights Talk: The Impoverishment of Political Discourse</i> (NY: 1991), 76.</i></small></span>
Whereas American society places an emphasis on rugged individualism and individual rights,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Ronald Dworkin, <i>Taking Rights Seriously</i> (Boston: 1977); Joel Feinberg, <i>Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law</i> (NY: 1984); Will Kymlicka, <i>Liberalism, Community and Culture</i> (NY: 1989). America’s right-based system traces its ideological origins to the classical liberal utilitarian morality of John Stuart Mill and the possessive individualism of Thomas Hobbes. See Alexis de Tocqueville, <i>Democracy in America</i> (NY: 1945), vol. 1, 254; Mill, <i>On Liberty</i> (NY: 1956), 99–100; Mill, <i>Utilitarianism</i> (NY: 1910), 55; C. B. Macpherson, <i>The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke</i> (England: 1962), Part II; and H. Marks Roelof, <i>Ideology and Myth in American Politics</i> (Boston: 1976), 51, 56–60, 67–69.</i> from a halakhic perspective, the mission of man – and equally of the Jew – focuses upon duty, compliance with a divine norm.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For man in general, the mission centers around the fulfillment of seven “Noahide” commandments, while for the Jew there is an obligation to comply with 613 commandments. For further discussion regarding the halakhic system as a duty-based system, see my “May One Destroy a Neighbor’s Property In Order to Save One’s Life: A Case Study in a Conflict of Duties and Its Contemporary Implications for the Incorporation of Jewish Law into the Israeli Legal System,” in Michael Shmidman (ed.), <i>Turim: Studies in Jewish History and Literature Presented to Dr. Bernard Lander</i> (NY: 2007), 331.</i> Thus, <i>R. Dr. Joseph Soloveitchik</i> writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Natural man, moving straight forwards, comes suddenly to a stop, turns around, and casts as an outsider, a contemplative gaze upon his environment … He discovers an awesome and mysterious domain of things and events which is independent of and disobedient to him, an objective order limiting the exercise of his power … In the wake of this discovery, he discovers himself. Once self-discovery is accomplished, and a … I-awareness of an existence which is limited and opposed by a non-I outside emerges, something new is born – namely the divine norm … “And the Lord God commanded the man” … Man attains his unique identity when, after having been enlightened by God that he is not only a committed but also a free person, endowed with power to implement his commitment, he grasps the incommensurability of what he is and what he is destined to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph B. Soloveitchik, “Confrontation,” 6 <i>Tradition</i> (1964), 5, 11.</i></small></span>
Thus, in contrast to the habitual silence in American society regarding legislating morality except to avoid the infliction of harm, a committed Jew must develop a more expansive notion of obligation vis-à-vis God and his fellow-man based upon fulfillment of divine commandments.
Furthermore, being a liberal-democratic society, legal authority in American life has been seen as appropriate for the public square, but limited in the private realm. An American inquires of a lawyer about his rights and their infringement. A committed Jew, by contrast, must seek to understand his obligations, which extend well beyond “negative rights,” his right of protection against individual and governmental intrusion.
How does one discern one’s halakhic obligations? In the words of the Torah itself, “What does the Lord thy God ask of you?”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 10:12.</i> Most committed Jews, even well-educated ones, will not be able to answer this question on their own. Rather, we are told, “Establish a rabbi for yourself and avoid doubt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 1:15 and <i>Rambam</i> ad loc. Cf. <i>Avot</i> 1:6 and <i>Rambam</i> ad loc. The latter <i>mishnah</i> addresses the need to choose a rabbi for the purposes of study, rather than as a spiritual guide.</i> Who is the rabbi in question, and what are the parameters of his authority? In this essay, we will focus on the varying approaches in which the halakhic tradition, in particular post-Talmudic sources, has grappled with these questions.
This essay seeks to map and depict the main functions and normative meanings that encompass the concept of rabbinic authority. Other than a handful of dogmatic and historical descriptions, there have been very few attempts to focus upon the post-Talmudic sources that address this topic.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the most comprehensive and systematic compilation of rabbinic sources regarding our topic, see Hanina Ben-Menahem, Neil Hecht, and Shai Wosner (eds.), <i>Controversy and Dialogue in the Halakhic Sources</i> [Hebrew] (Boston and Jerusalem: 1991,1993), vol. 1, 243–354, 401–58; vol. 2, 753–954. For our study, this compilation has been mined assiduously.<br>Although the scope of authority encompasses Halakhah, <i>minhag</i>, and matters of faith and belief (<i>emunot ve-de’ot</i>), our study will focus solely on Halakhah. Moreover, this is a phenomenological sketch based upon post-Talmudic sources that does not purport to illustrate a particular codifier’s or respondent’s methodology. Finally, certain subjects, such as the option of an individual to choose between conflicting views, the right of an authority to resolve matters for himself and his family or to legislate, act stricter in private than his public posture, and practice his own rejected approach, are beyond the scope of this essay.</i> Although some of the sources that will be analyzed have historical implications, we are concerned in developing a conceptual framework based upon the sources that have been assigned normative value by the halakhic system.
<b>1. The Parameters of “<i>Lo Tasur</i>”</b>
The Torah states that a member of the Jewish community who has a doubt regarding a point of Halakhah is obligated to seek halakhic counsel and abide by the ruling of the court:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If there is a matter too hard from you in judgment, between blood and blood, between ruling and ruling … subjects of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise and go up to the place that God will choose. And you shall come to the … judge who shall be in those days, and inquire, and they shall render the words of the judgment. And you shall follow according to the sentence which they declare to you from that place which God shall choose and you shall observe to do according to what they instruct you. According to the law which they shall instruct you and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, shall you do. You shall not deviate (<i>lo tasur</i>) from the word they shall tell you, neither to the right nor to the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 17:8–13. This translation is culled (with certain modifications) from Aharon Cohen, “The Parameters of Rabbinic Authority: A Study of Three Sources,” 27 <i>Tradition</i> (Summer, 1993), 100–1.</i></small></span>
The Talmud explains that the “place that God will choose” refers to the Great Sanhedrin, which met in the <i>lishkat ha-gazit</i> on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta Hagigah</i> 2:9; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88a.</i> Accordingly, the commandment of “<i>lo tasur</i>,” “you shall not deviate from the word they shall tell you,” is limited to the judgments and interpretations of Halakhah as rendered by the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i>. Many decisors – among them <i>Rambam</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, positive mitzvah 174, negative mitzvah 312; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 1:1. However, according to <i>Rambam</i> and others, in situations where there are <i>batei din</i> or rabbinic assemblies, there is an obligation to follow their respective rulings based on the principle of “follow the majority.” See his Introduction to <i>Mishnah Torah</i>; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, YD 84 (p. 126, column 3).</i> <i>Ramban</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban,</i> Commentary on the Torah, <i>Devarim</i> 17:11.</i> <i>Rivash</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 261.</i> <i>R. Yehuda ha-Levi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kuzari</i> 3:41.</i> and <i>Ran</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Derashot ha-Ran</i>, <i>derush</i> 12.</i> – thus conclude that the prohibition does not apply to decisions handed down by lower courts or by independent rabbinic authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that these <i>Rishonim</i> would argue that compliance is mandated due to the general mitzvah of “<i>li-shmo’a li-divrei hakhamim</i>.” See <i>Yevamot</i> 20a; Talmud Yerushalmi <i>Sukkah</i> 3:4; <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 1, <i>perek</i> 7; <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 1. Consequently, compliance to our arbiters includes abiding by <i>mitzvot</i>, <i>takanoth</i> (rabbinic legislation), <i>gezerot</i> (rabbinic decrees), and <i>minhagim</i> (customs). See <i>Rambam</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 496; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran, Sanhedrin</i> 89a; <i>Kuntres Divrei Soferim</i> 1:32 in the name of Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik; <i>R. Ya’akov Anatoly</i>, <i>Melamed ha-Talmidim</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i> (Mekizei Nirdamim edition), 71b–72b.<br>Cf. <i>Peri Megadim</i>, Pesicha Ko’lelet, helek aleph (40); R. Yosef Engel, <i>Tzi’yunim le-Torah</i>, Kelal 10 who contend that “<i>lo tasur</i>” is applicable to <i>gezerot</i>, rabbinic legislation which extends or adds prohibitions beyond the preexisting Halakhah.</i>
The <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, however, suggests otherwise:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>As for the obligation given to us to obey the words of our ancient Sages, our great authorities in the wisdom of the Torah, and our judges in our generation, it is in effect everywhere, at every time.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvot 495–496. R. Eliyahu Dessler claims that antecedents to this approach can be found in <i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 17:154 (Finkelstein edition) and <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 17:11. See his <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i> 1:75–77.</i></small></span>
Similarly, <i>Rashba</i> writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>We must listen to one of the <i>Rishonim</i> [early rabbinic authorities], provided that he is a scholar that one can rely upon … We must listen to the scholars of every era, as it is written: “And to the judge that will be in those days,” even if they tell you that right is left …<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:322. For an antecedent to this approach, see Yerushalmi <i>Horayot</i> 1:1. Cf. the variant version, “even when it appears to you that they are saying that right is left and left is right, you must obey them;” <i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Devarim</i>, <i>Shofetim</i>, sec. 154; <i>Midrash Tannaim</i>, 102–103; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Shofetim</i> 911. See also <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 5:246; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:68; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:1, 5; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96.</i></small></span>
According to <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i> and <i>Rashba</i>, the positive commandment of “adhering to what they teach and rule” and the prohibition of “<i>lo tasur</i>” apply to all rabbinic leaders in every generation, not only to the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i>.
<i>Ran</i> concurs with the opinion that there is an obligation to adhere to the halakhic decisions of the arbiter in every community and in every generation, but he invokes a different source for the requirement:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>How do we know that we are obligated to comply with the decisions of the scholars in every generation? The answer is that the Biblical verse states, “Follow the majority.” This is a general warning to follow Torah judgments [based upon the consensus of the majority of scholars].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Derashot ha-Ran</i>, supra n. 14.</i></small></span>
The common denominator of both approaches is the requirement for an individual to choose a rabbinic authority and adhere to his rulings. While some authorities maintain that there is an obligation that mandates compliance with decisions of a rabbinic authority in every generation, others maintain that there is no religious duty to comply with a decisor’s ruling unless he was a member of the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i>. According to the latter view, once an authority has been accepted, his decisions become binding, but a violation thereof does not entail contravention of a biblical imperative.
Translating this controversy into the conceptual scheme of authority elucidated by Richard T. De George is quite instructive.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">R. Dr. Aharon Lichtenstein argues cogently that there is merit to such comparison: “The structure and substance of law … fall within the purview of general as well as Torah thought. Knowledge of how such questions, legal and/or philosophic, have been treated in different traditions can frequently enhance our understanding of Torah positions, as regards either broad outlines or specific detail.” See his “Torah and General Culture: Confluence and Conflict,” in J. J. Schacter (ed.), <i>Judaism and Encounters with Other Cultures</i> (NY: 1997), 220, 230.</i> George distinguishes between two types of authority – imperative/executive and epistemic. Whereas an imperative authority has the right or power to act and expect compliance to his orders, an epistemic authority is an authority in a field of knowledge, but he does not possess any right to command:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A person is an epistemic authority if he is considered an authority by another or by others with respect to some field or area of knowledge. Thus, X is a … epistemic authority if there is some Y who considers X an authority for Y in some realm … For Y to consider X a … epistemic authority for Y means that at least under certain conditions and at least to some extent, Y is willing to believe what X says in R …<br>Imperative authority involves the right or the power of some bearer … to command someone who is subject to authority to act or to forbear from acting in certain ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Richard T. De George, <i>The Nature and Limits of Authority</i> (Kansas: 1985), 27, 63.</i></small></span>
Essentially, an imperative authority is “in-authority,” while an epistemic authority is simply “an-authority.” The halakhic positions regarding the nature of rabbinic authority can be described accordingly.
The view that limits the purview of “<i>lo tasur</i>” to the judgments of the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i> views all other rabbinic authorities as examples of epistemic authority. It is only upon the questioner’s acceptance of the authority’s spiritual hegemony that his status as “an-authority” is transformed into one of “in-authority.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">R. S. Peters, “<i>Authority,</i>” 32 <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</i>, Supplementary, 86–89.</i> Thus, <i>R. Moshe Soloveitchik</i> maintains that a decisor who does not have the status of being ordained (<i>semikhah</i>) is
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>essentially a reference guide, providing reliable information about what the tradition and its sources, properly understood and interpreted, state; but it is they, rather than he, that bind authoritatively.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Aharon Lichtenstein, <i>Leaves of Faith: The World of Jewish Learning (</i>NY: 2004), 293.</i></small></span>
Those who either extend the purview of “<i>lo tasur</i>” or invoke other obligations to accept rabbinic decisions throughout the generations view these rulings as an exercise of imperative authority. Upon acceptance of their authority, their rulings become binding upon the inquirer.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, abiding by the rulings of the late R. Elyashiv, <i>z”l</i>, accepted by many in the Ashkenazic community as the greatest Torah scholar of the 21st century, can be based upon varying rationales. Either one is bound to his rulings as one who is “in-authority” due to “<i>lo tasur</i>” or due to his status as being “one’s rabbi,” even though one has not formally learnt from him. See <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, supra n. 16; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Berakhot</i> 31b, s.v. <i>moreh</i>; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 238. Alternatively, his decisions are followed based upon one’s formal acceptance of his rulings, similar to a <i>mara de-atra</i> and no different from any other rabbinic authority or his rulings must be complied with by the entire Jewish community, no different than following the rulings of the <i>Tanna’im</i> and <i>Amora’im</i>. See <i>Kuntres Divrei Soferim</i> 2:4; A. Sherman, “The Authority of <i>Gedolei ha-Dor</i> in Matters of Personal Status and Conversion” [Hebrew], 30 <i>Tehumin</i> (5770), 163. S.

Z. Goldberg argues that after the appearance of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>, who are our <i>mara de-atra</i>s, there is no decisor who wields authority over the community unless he is one’s personal or community rabbi. Hence, there is no duty to comply with contemporary authority’s rulings unless the decisions are grounded in <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and/or <i>Rema</i>. See Z. Goldberg, <i>Darkhei ha-Psak</i> [Hebrew] (Givat Shmuel: 5764), 34. Cf. <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:5.</i>
<b>2. The <i>Mara De-Atra</i></b>
<i>Rambam</i> describes the extent of rabbinic authority in the following fashion:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If a court established in any country after the time of the Talmud made decrees and ordinances or introduced customs for those residing in its particular country or for residents of other countries, its enactments did not gain the acceptance of all Israel because of the remoteness of the Jewish settlements and the difficulties of travel. And as the court of any particular country consisted of individuals [whose authority was not universally recognized], while the Supreme Court of seventy-one members had, several years before the compilation of the Talmud, ceased to exist, no compulsion is exercised on those living in one country to observe the customs of another country; nor is any court directed to issue a decree that has been issued by another court in the same country. So too, if one of the <i>Ge’onim</i> taught that a certain way of judgment was correct, and it became clear to a court at a later date that this was not in accordance with the view of the Gemara, the earlier authority is not necessarily followed, but the view is adopted which seems more reasonable, whether it be that of an earlier or of a later authority. The foregoing observations refer to rules, decrees, ordinances, and customs that originated after the Talmud had been compiled. But whatever is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud is binding on all Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, Introduction. Translation culled (with certain modifications) from Isadore Twersky, <i>Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishnah Torah)</i> (New Haven: 1980), 128–9.</i></small></span>
Although <i>Rambam</i> writes specifically about the judicial independence of the Jewish court, <i>R. Joseph Karo</i> notes that his conclusions equally apply to all authorities who are interpreters and arbiters of Halakhah – both the courts and independent arbiters have accepted to be subservient to the rulings found in the Mishnah and Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesef Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 2:1. Pursuant to the <i>Kesef Mishnah</i>’s logic, had scholars refrained from making such a determination, the Talmudic and post-Talmudic sages could have overruled their predecessors. See Z. H. Chajes, <i>Kol Sifrei Maharatz Hayut</i> (Jerusalem: 5718), 109. Whereas <i>Rambam</i> maintains that the authority of the Talmud is due to the assent of the Jewish community and that it was part and parcel of an unbroken tradition dating back to Moshe, R. Chajes and R. Elhanan Wasserman argue that the finality is attributed to a decision by all or the majority of scholars, whose status is akin to the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i>. Others, such as <i>Hazon Ish</i>, contend that the authority of the Talmud is a result of “the decline of the generations” (see text below). Rejecting this historically contingent explanation, R. Hayyim Soloveitchik contends that there is actually no prohibition for Talmudic and post-Talmudic scholars to overrule their predecessors, but they refrain from doing so in practice. For an overview of these approaches and others, see Shlomo Havlin, “On ‘Literary Sealing’ as the Foundation for the Division of Halakhah into Epochs” [Hebrew], in <i>Mehkarim be-Safrut ha-Talmudit</i> (Israel: 1983), 148, 169–83.<br>Acceptance of the Talmud’s rulings was not limited to courts and arbiters, but equally affirmed by the Jewish community. See <i>Rambam</i>, supra n. 24; <i>Kesef Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 2:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>Yoreh Deah</i> (YD) 115:3; <i>Derashot ha-Ran</i>, <i>derush</i> 12.</i>
The authority of the Talmud Bavli stems from its acceptance by the Jewish community, as its Sages comprised the total or the majority of the scholars of Israel, and the chain of tradition from them to Moses was never broken. <i>Rambam</i> is quick to note that embarking upon “the sea of the Talmud” and delving into its difficult formulations requires education and skills. Consequently, it is no wonder that after its compilation, divergent interpretations of this corpus were to be found among the <i>dayanim</i> and decisors throughout the various communities.
Decentralization of the Jewish community coupled with an acute need to resolve halakhic indeterminacies were factors in the emergence and proliferation of rabbinic authorities who made decisions for particular Jewish communities. Such rabbinic personalities were referred to as the “<i>mara de-atra</i>,” literally, the “master of the place.” Upon acceptance of his authority, his rulings are authoritatively binding upon the members of his community. Briefly sketching this role, Professor Aharon Kirschenbaum observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Traces of such rabbinic authority … for the inhabitants of a limited geographic area may be found among the <i>Tanna’im</i>. Thus, although his colleagues limited the suspension of Sabbath restrictions to the circumcision itself, “in the place of R. Eliezer they used to cut wood [on the Sabbath] to make charcoal in order to forge an iron instrument.” R. Eliezer held that all necessary requisites for the circumcision … superseded the Sabbath prohibition. Hence, even the charcoal necessary for the forging of the circumcision knife was permitted to be prepared. Although R. Eliezer was overruled by the other <i>Tanna’im</i>, his position was accepted as valid “in his place.”<br>Similarly, R. Jose the Galilean’s opinion that the cooking of the flesh of fowl in milk was totally permitted was rejected by his colleagues … Nevertheless, the Talmud states that, “in the place of R. Jose the Galilean, they used to eat fowl’s flesh cooked in milk” …<br>On the basis of these Tannaitic precedents, the <i>Amora’im</i> ruled that the opinion of the <i>mara de-atra</i> was binding on the <i>atra</i> even where it was in opposition to the normative Halakhah. For example, there is a well-known dispute in the matter of <i>muktzah</i>, wherein R. Simeon rejected the rules of <i>muktzah</i> as we know them. Although R. Hamnuna agreed with R. Simeon, he excommunicated a certain disciple who gave a practical decision in accordance with R. Simeon’s position. He did so because the disciple had made that decision in an area that was within the jurisdiction of Rav. Since Rav opposed R. Simeon’s position, the disciple should have acted accordingly. Thus, the Talmud defends the excommunication declared by R. Hamnuna even though the latter agreed with the substance of the disciple’s decision. The respect due Rav, the <i>mara de-atra</i>, was overriding. <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Mara De-Atra:</i> A Brief Sketch,” 27 <i>Tradition</i> (Summer 1993), 35–36.</i></small></span>
Even if a <i>mara de-atra</i> follows a minority view – even if he permits something that according to others is biblically prohibited – his ruling must be followed by the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 130b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Ran</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, EH, <i>kelal</i> 2:9.</i>
At first glance, this seems to conflict with the most basic principle of halakhic decision-making, “<i>aharei rabbim le-hatot</i>,” the rule to follow the majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:6; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 29a.</i> However, as various decisors note, the application of that rule is limited to resolving issues within the confines of a <i>moshav beit din</i>, judicial proceedings.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>kelal</i> 1, 5; <i>Teshuvot Maharlbah</i> 147; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 13 (end) in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 95, YD 82; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 207.</i> Since a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling is a resolution of a controversy among decisors, outside of a <i>moshav beit din</i>, the command to follow the majority view is inapplicable, and his position, although reflecting a minority view, becomes binding upon the members of the community, whether it reflects a stringent or lenient opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be’er Eliyahu</i>, HM 25:22; <i>Kuntres Divrei Soferim</i> 5:18; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, EH 3:19; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:1; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:17(4). The <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling is binding even though the matter would have been resolved according to the majority opinion had the <i>mara de-atra</i> sat in a <i>moshav beit din</i>, and his community is obligated to comply with his view even though it is a minority opinion. Moreover, his ruling must be followed regardless of whether there exists a more stringent or lenient opinion. See <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 15; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, OH 3; <i>Pri Hadash</i>, OH 496, <i>Minhagei Issur</i> 11; <i>Teshuvot Ein Mishpat</i>, YD 9; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:1. However, if the community accepted as their <i>mara de-atra</i> someone who is no longer alive (see text below), a scholar who advocates a stricter position may be followed. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253; <i>Bah</i>, HM 25; <i>Teshuvot Semikhah le-Hayyim</i>, YD 5. Although a community must follow a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s teachings in ritual matters, in monetary matters that are subject to arbitration, one may deviate from the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings. See <i>Teshuvot Semikhah le-Hayyim</i>, EH 9; <i>Teshuvot Hikikei Lev</i>, YD 1:43. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Ridbaz</i> 1:405, 2:638.</i>
Did this model of rabbinic authority persist beyond the Talmudic period? <i>R. Joseph b. David ibn Lev</i> (<i>Maharival</i>), a sixteenth century <i>posek</i> (decisor) from Salonika, writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It was only during those days [the Mishnaic and Talmudic periods], when in every city there was a rabbi who would instruct them … that in every city they were obligated to honor their teachers. However, in these times, in all these matters our decisors and our rabbinic scholars from whose waters we drink are our rabbis …<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 1:73. According to <i>Mishpetei Shmuel</i> (Conforto), HM 2, <i>Maharival</i> allows for the appointment of a <i>mara de-atra</i> for his expertise solely in defining halakhic controversies, rather than issuing a leniency in biblical matters. See also <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> (Kali) 67; <i>Teshuvot Hemdah Genusah</i>, <i>Kuntres ha-Pesikah ha-Hilkhatit</i>, 47–51.</i></small></span>
Whereas the <i>mara de-atra</i> was once the binding authority in all matters of Halakhah, we are now privileged to have many rabbis, and we must thus refrain from adopting one binding authority. Should there be a difference of opinion amongst the rabbis, the typical decision-making rules, such as following the majority, must facilitate the resolution of the matter. A community is authorized to appoint a <i>mara de-atra</i> only to resolve monetary issues, regarding which one may make stipulations contrary to what is written in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 83b–84a; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 54a–b.</i>
<i>Maharival</i>’s position reflects a minority view, however; the role of the <i>mara de-atra</i> persisted well after the compilation of the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Among those rejecting <i>Maharival</i>’s approach are <i>Pri Hadash</i>, OH 496:11, and <i>Hikrei Lev</i>, <i>Orah Hayim</i> (OH) 496:96. <i>Hikrei Lev</i> points out that regarding personal status matters (<i>ishut</i>), one cannot follow one decisor; <i>Pri Hadash</i> argues that only “some of the great scholars of the generation” can be empowered with such authority.</i> R. Dr. Yitzhak Z. Kahana lists numerous communities throughout medieval and modern Jewish history who chose to follow the rulings of various authorities, the <i>mara de-atra</i>s of these communities.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzhak Z. Kahane, “The Polemics Regarding Determination of the Halakhah According to <i>Rambam</i>” [Hebrew], <i>Mehkarim be-Safrut ha-Teshuvot</i> (Jerusalem: 5733), 8–88.</i> As in Mishnaic and Talmudic times, communal acceptance was the grounds for legitimating the binding authority of the <i>mara de-atra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 151; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 49 and 62; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:210; ibid., <i>Hut ha-Meshulash</i>, <i>ha-Tur ha-Shlishi</i>, 35; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 105; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:192, 547; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 16, 49; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 32; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 90; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 18, <i>hadarim</i> 8–13; <i>Teshuvot Hikekei Lev</i>, YD 43; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev,</i> YD 49; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ranah</i> 109; <i>Teshuvot Perah Mateh Aharon</i> 2:81; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:82; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 312:37; <i>Piskei Din Rabbaniyim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 10:38; 11:97. In certain instances, other scholars were involved in his communal appointment. See <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 221. Cf. <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 245:29, who argues that during the period of <i>Rivash</i>, <i>Tashbetz</i>, and others, rabbinic appointment was <i>de facto</i> – that is, by dint of his teaching, the scholar assumed the position.<br>Relying upon an inference from <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 242:57, R. Aharon Lichtenstein points out that a community has no obligation to elect a <i>mara de-atra</i>. See Aharon Lichtenstein, <i>“</i>The Israel Chief Rabbinate: A Current Halakhic Perspective,” 26 <i>Tradition</i> (Summer 1992), 26–27, n.9.<br>For a general overview, see Menachem Elon, <i>Jewish Law</i> (Philadelphia: 1993), vol. 2, 678–779.</i>
Thus, a communal enactment evidently promulgated in fourteenth century Spain addressing a dispute between a husband and wife states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The community in which she lives … agreed and enacted that in all their laws and legal controversies, they will follow the books of <i>Rambam</i>, of blessed memory, in regard to everything that is written in them concerning matters of ritual law, monetary matters, marriage … and divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 48.</i></small></span>
The communal enactment obligated members of the community to follow <i>Rambam</i>’s rulings in certain designated areas of Halakhah. Being selective regarding which matters are under the purview of a <i>mara de-atra</i> is thus permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In a teacher-disciple relationship, one may choose a rabbi to answer questions in certain designated area(s) of Halakhah; see <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242:12. Logically, this conclusion should equally apply to choosing a <i>mara de-atra</i>. Numerous authorities approved of this practice regarding a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s sphere of jurisdiction; see Kahane, supra n. 34, 18, 20, and 41.</i>
Five hundred years later, <i>R. Samson Raphael Hirsch</i> responded in uncompromising terms to a “guest rabbi” who directed R. Hirsch’s congregation to rebel against their <i>mara de-atra</i>’s teachings:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The members of the Jewish community, who accepted a scholar as a rabbi and spiritual guide, have obligated themselves to heed his instructions regarding all communal matters dealing with the individual as well as regarding the community, in particular, given that this has been established in the communal enactments that he is the exclusive decisor to resolve communal matters …<br>But his honor, who is a foreigner to our city, did not refrain from interfering with my communal matters, having been appointed to be the rabbi and chief justice [<i>av beit din</i>], and he refused to abstain from persuading members of my community to rebel against my ruling, telling them that my ruling is not a ruling, and he did not refrain from publicizing his view in a newspaper …<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shemesh Marpeh</i> 52.</i></small></span>
Clearly, for hundreds of years, various communities were guided by their respective <i>mara de-atra</i>s.
In effect, community consensus regarding the appointment of a <i>mara de-atra</i> resulted in a spatial division of authority. In many instances, there could be various communities in the same locale practicing divergent halakhic behaviors. At first glance, this diffusion of authority among two communities in the same town seems to violate the injunction of “<i>lo titgodedu</i>,” which the Sages interpreted to refer to a prohibition against creating factions in the same community.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Based on <i>Devarim</i> 14:1. The verse literally means, “You shall not gash yourselves.” The Talmud <i>Yerushalmi Pesachim</i> 4:1, interpreted it, “<i>lo ta’asu agudot agudot</i>,” “do not create divergent groups.”</i> It is possible that just as two different courts in the same locale may issue contradictory decisions resulting in divergent behaviors in the same place,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban</i> and <i>Ran</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 43b; and <i>Ritva</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 14a. However, according to <i>Shakh</i>, this is contingent upon the fact that the two <i>batei din</i> are well known; see <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242 (end); <i>Kitzur Issur ve-heter</i> 10. Second, if the two <i>batei din</i> are unequal in scholarly stature, the proscription applies; see <i>Shakh</i>, ibid., in the name of <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 153. Moreover, the proscription applies to a community, rather than to an individual who deviates from the common practice. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 13b, s.v. <i>ta shma</i>; <i>Tosafot Rid</i>, ad loc., s.v. <i>tenan hatam</i>.</i> two communities in the same town are entitled to abide by different <i>mara de-atra</i>s who may issue different rulings;<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharshdam</i>, ibid.; <i>Teshuvot Re’em</i> 53.</i> neither <i>mara de-atra</i> has jurisdiction over the adherents of the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 12.</i> Alternatively, it is possible that the prohibition against factionalism refers to teaching others to follow one’s practices when one authority advocates one position and the other demurs. Since two communities living side by side are simply practicing rather than exhorting others to follow their behavior, the prohibition is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Bedek ha-Bayit</i>, YD 242 in the name of R. Yeruham; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 32; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 21. Generally speaking, regarding enactments adopted by a community, each community within a town was viewed as a “<i>kahal</i>,” a halakhic community that was not promoting factionalism. Whether the prohibition against promoting factionalism applies to diverse practices, <i>minhagim</i>, of communities within a town is subject to much debate and beyond the scope of our study.</i>
The institutional legitimatization of halakhic pluralism poses great challenges in the modern State of Israel. Given the differing traditions of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities, how is halakhic practice to be structured for the citizenry? Ought the goal be to establish uniformity of practice or to promote communal diversity? Is either goal attainable at present? While some have advocated the need to maintain halakhic diversity, others argue that the <i>mara de-atra</i>(s) of the Land of Israel ought to be <i>Rambam</i> and/or <i>R. Karo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of these varying approaches, see Ratzon Arusi, “Conflict of Laws and The Ethnic Factor in Halakhic Determination in Israel” [Hebrew] (unpublished doctoral dissertation; Tel Aviv, 1987), 250–348. For the application of these views to the area of Halakhic matrimonial law, an ongoing topic of public and legal discourse in contemporary Israel, see Elimelech Westreich, “The Preservation of Marital Status of the Jewish Woman in Israel: Confrontation Between Legal Traditions of Different Ethnic Backgrounds” [Hebrew], 7 <i>Pelillim</i> (5759), 273.</i>
What is the scope of the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s authority? Which members of the community create it? Is every member of the community duty bound to ask their questions of the <i>mara de-atra</i>? Is an individual who joins the community subsequent to the communal acceptance of the <i>mara de-atra</i> obligated to ask him his questions and abide by his judgments? Some argue that given that the election of the <i>mara de-atra</i> was executed via a communal enactment, the norms of <i>takanot ha-kahal</i>, communal enactments, are applicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Rivash</i> 105; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 62.</i> Because such enactments are passed upon majority rule of its members or its representatives, even the minority must comply,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Asheri</i> 6:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 6:105, 107; <i>Teshuvot Re’em</i> 53; <i>SA</i>, YD 228:34; <i>Rema</i>, HM 163:1. One may contend that in this matter, as in others, the community may permit individuals to exclude themselves; see <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Rivash</i> 249.</i> and the legislation binds even individuals who have yet to permanently reside in the locale.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Rivash</i> 399. Therefore, just as a community may impose penal measures upon its members, a <i>mara de-atra</i> possesses such authority; see <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 2:2; <i>Teshuvot Da’at Kohen</i> 193.</i> The <i>mara de-atra</i> is “in-authority” for all these individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 20–21.</i>
Alternatively, the <i>mara de-atra</i> is granted authority only over those who accept him upon themselves. <i>R. Shaul Yisraeli</i> observed in 1966:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The majority of the public in Israel has accepted the Chief Rabbinate as its rabbi … It follows that the Chief Rabbinate enjoys the status of “the local master” throughout Israel and its local rabbis act only as its agents.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Amud ha-Yemini</i>, 51. Given that an individual cannot exempt himself from being subservient to a communal enactment (see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:769, <i>SA</i>, YD 228:34, and many others), R. Yisraeli’s position seems problematic. However, the position may be tenable based upon the following two grounds: First, if the community is not insistent that a member comply with its legislation, a dissenter may refrain from complying; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 249 in the name of <i>Rashba</i>. Second, given that the minority members of the community and out of town residents (under certain circumstances) must still adhere to the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings of a public nature (see text below), outward unity as reflected in public acceptance of the <i>mara de-atra</i> would still exist. Alternatively, in our contemporary context, due to the breakdown of communal structures and various other factors (see text below), the role of the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s authority is limited <i>de facto</i> to certain public matters; consequently, every member, even the minority, must accept his authority for these matters. However, regarding personal matters, members of the community and/or synagogue may turn to other rabbinic authorities for their spiritual guidance. Hence, the issue of a minority’s unwillingness to accept a particular <i>mara de-atra</i> will not arise.<br>Although one might suggest that the permissibility of the minority’s noncompliance is grounded in the opinions that mandate unanimity for passage of a communal enactment, there are authorities who argue that this position is inapplicable in cases in which the custom is to follow majority rule or the community or its officials is empowered to always resolve matters based upon majority rule. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 2 and 73; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 116; <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah</i>, HM 231:29, 77.<br>For antecedents of the view that Israel is to be construed as a “community,” see <i>Horayot</i> 3a; <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Perush ha-Mishnayot</i>, <i>Bekhorot</i> 4:3; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, OH 314; R. Yitzhak Herzog, <i>Constitution and Law in a Jewish State According to the Halakhah</i> (Hebrew) (Jerusalem: 5749), vol. 2, 58; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 6, HM 8, 28; R. Mordekhai Eliyahu and R. Avraham Shapiro, “The Status of Civil Legislation and Halakhah” [Hebrew], 3 <i>Tehumin</i> (5742), 242, 249.</i></small></span>
<i>R. Yisraeli</i> concludes that segments of the Israeli populace who have not accepted this authority are free to follow their own decisors. If an individual chooses to accept the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s authority, he is bound by his teachings; should he decline to do so, he may choose another decisor.
Accordingly, those who disagreed with the election of the <i>mara de-atra</i> or moved to the locale only after his installment may freely choose to follow a different recognized authority. However, the dissenting individual is no different than any visitor who arrives in the town, who must refrain from any public behavior that contradicts specific rulings of the <i>mara de-atra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud thus relates that upon R. Avahu’s arrival “in the place of R. Yehoshua b. Levi,” he would carry candles on Shabbat in accordance with his own view, but when he was in the place of R. Yohanan, he refrained from carrying them; see <i>Yevamot</i> 14a. See also <i>Eruvin</i> 94a.</i>
According to both schools of thought, the binding nature of a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings is based upon communal acceptance, either actualized through the adoption of a communal enactment or the execution of a “<i>ketav rabbanut</i>,” a rabbinic contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Ya’akov Katz, “On the History of the Rabbinate at the End of the Middle Ages” [Hebrew], in <i>Binyamin DeVries Memorial Volume</i> (Tel Aviv: 1968), 281–94; Reuvain Bonfil, <i>The Rabbinate in Renaissance Italy</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 5739), 67–122, 238–44; Meir Benayahu, <i>Marbitz Torah</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 5713); Mordekhai Breuer, <i>The Ashkenazic Rabbinate in the Middle Ages</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 5736). In fact, in certain communities, a <i>mara de-atra</i> was mandated by the community to follow certain decisors, such as <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>. See Chaim Tchernowitz, <i>Toledot ha-Poskim</i> [Hebrew] 1:8. The selection of a <i>mara de-atra</i> by one community does not preclude the right of another scholar to be elected as a <i>mara de-atra</i> by another community in the same town; see <i>Rema</i>, HM 245: 22. The issue of <i>hasagat gevul</i>, economic competition, is beyond the scope of this essay.</i> Consequently, an individual who agrees and subsequently reneges on his commitment is viewed as someone who makes an oath not to be bound by a communal enactment, a meaningless oath that is therefore in vain and in violation of a biblical commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, YD 228:33. For the difficulties with this position, see <i>Bi’ur ha</i>-<i>Gra</i> ad loc., 94; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha</i>-<i>Deshen</i> 281. Just as an individual who asks a question of a scholar is bound to abide by his answer (even if it is <i>le-humrah</i>, stringent), a town which accepts a <i>mara de-atra</i> is obligated to adhere to all of his teachings; see <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:210.</i> Moreover, according to some authorities, he has violated the biblical prohibition of “<i>lo tasur</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Binyamin Lipkin, “The Legislative Authority of the Public” (Hebrew), 20 <i>Torah she-Be’al Peh</i> (5739): 108,126-7. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, YD 49.</i>
In short, “an-authority” is transformed by the community into a <i>mara de-atra</i> who is “in-authority.” His rulings are therefore biblically binding in all public matters, such as marriage, divorce, liturgical practice, <i>kashrut</i> standards, and <i>eruvin</i>, as well as personal matters, such as monetary obligations, interest, theft, and Shabbat and Yom Tov regulations.
Furthermore, a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s decision that is grounded in a minority view has been characterized as “akin to being of biblical status” and “like <i>Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>,” traditions from Sinai regarding which there is unanimity.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, <i>Hut ha-Meshulash</i>, <i>Tur Shilishi</i>, 35; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Ridbaz</i> 1:229; <i>Teshuvot Maharif</i> 59.</i>
Given the stature assigned to the <i>mara de-atra</i>, as we will demonstrate in the latter portion of our presentation, he must exhibit piety (<i>yirat Shamayim</i>), possess a proficiency in Talmudic and post-Talmudic scholarship, and have honed skills in analogical reasoning and rendering decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Pursuant to various Talmudic dicta, the right to instruct requires that the individual be both learned (“<i>gamir</i>”), capable of cogent reasoning (“<i>savir</i>”), and God-fearing. These are requirements for an arbiter in ritual matters as well as in judging monetary affairs. See <i>Ketuvot</i> 103a; <i>Horayot</i> 2b; <i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, <i>Horayot</i> 2b; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:82; Bonfil, supra n.51, 236. According to <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:30, along with these skills, the rabbi must be capable of rendering a <i>psak</i>, rather than simply engage in the pilpulistic reasoning of halakhic study.(The identical point is made earlier by <i>Hakhmei Ashkenaz</i> of the fifteenth century; see <i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 164; <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 16; <i>Teshuvot Maharil ha-Hadashot</i> 134; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 92.)<br>Whether a son inheriting his father’s rabbinical post must be a scholar or “somewhat of a scholar” is subject to debate. See <i>Rema</i>, YD 245:22; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 245:29; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 312:45; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Kelei ha-Mikdash</i> 4:20; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:82.<br>In <i>Rema</i>’s words, a scholar “whose trade is his study of Torah” is defined as one who knows Talmudic argumentation (“the give and take of the Talmud”), understands most of the topics discussed in the Talmud, its commentaries, and Geonic opinions, and whose sole profession is Torah study; see <i>Rema</i>, YD 233:2. This definition of scholar has no bearing on a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s credentials if he holds a second job.<br>Although <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 242:29, 56, argues that the relationship between an individual and his <i>mara de-atra</i> is equivalent to a teacher-student relationship (<i>rabbo muvhak-talmid</i>), many disagree. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 98;<i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 220; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 95; <i>Hiddushei Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 6a; R. Shmuel D. Munk (attributed author)<i>, Kuntres She’eilot u-Teshuvot be-Ein Hazon</i> (Haifa, 5736), 71.</i> Although a <i>mara de-atra</i> has great authority over his constituents, it is not unlimited. If it is clear that the <i>mara de-atra</i> is in error – if he made a “<i>ta’ut be-devar mishnah</i>” (a mistake in black-letter Halakhah),<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 63a, 94a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 94a; <i>Amud ha</i>-<i>Yemini</i> 6:10.</i> or permitted the forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 94a; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 98.</i> one is not obligated to follow his directive. <i>R. Zerahiah ha-Levi</i> (<i>Ba’al ha-Ma’or</i>) states that if the arbiter awarded an item to one party in a dispute and it was later revealed that the decision was in error, the decision is reversible and the other party must be reimbursed for his loss:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Since it was an error in a matter of a <i>mishnah</i>, he [the litigant] should have been aware of the error and should not have relied upon the arbiter and executed the decision. Rather, he ought to have inquired and uncovered the error. This is as clear as “a clear <i>mishnah.</i>” Hence, the party was negligent.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ba’al ha-Ma’or</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 12b. See also <i>Hiddushei Ba’al Seredei Esh</i>, 22.</i></small></span>
In other words, even if one receives a <i>psak</i> from one’s rabbi, it is the individual’s responsibility to understand the reasons for the ruling. If he fails to do so and therefore follows an incorrect ruling, the halakhic system labels him a “<i>poshei’a</i>,” a negligent person. “<i>Emunat hakhamim</i>,” faith in the wise, does not entail, at least in this context, blind obedience.
<b>3. A Deceased <i>Mara De-Atra</i></b>
In an often-cited and widely accepted <i>teshuvah</i> (responsum), <i>R. Shlomo ben Aderet</i> (<i>Rashba</i>) succinctly describes the role of the <i>mara de-atra</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If there is one rabbi in their location who has taught them, they should follow his opinion … The same is true of those who have customarily acted according to one of the great authorities, as in a place in which they invariably follow the rulings of <i>R. Alfasi</i> or <i>Rambam</i>, for they have adopted these great decisors as their own rabbi. <sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253. For a list of the sources that cite this landmark <i>teshuvah</i>, see Shlomo Havlin, “R. Yehiel Ashkenazi and His Teshuvot<i>”</i> (Hebrew), 7 <i>Shalem</i> (5762), 71, 93, n. 16. The significance of this <i>teshuva</i> is underscored by the fact that numerous <i>Aharonim</i>, such as <i>Pri Hadash</i> (OH 496), <i>Massa Melekh</i> (<i>Dinei ha-Minhagot</i>, <i>hakirah</i> 13), and <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i> (OH 296), offer painstaking analysis to resolve the seeming contradiction between this <i>teshuvah</i> and another one of <i>Rashba</i> (1:190).</i></small></span>
According to <i>Rashba</i>, the <i>mara de-atra</i> of a community may already be deceased, as <i>Rif</i> and <i>Rambam</i> were when he penned this <i>teshuvah</i>. A community may either choose to accept the jurisdiction of a contemporary authority or rely on an earlier <i>mara de-atra</i> for rendering decisions. Even though these rabbinic authorities may never have lived in this place and are no longer living, the community practices the custom (“<i>keivan she-nahagu</i>”) to abide by their decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See the numerous <i>teshuvot</i> cited by Kahane, supra n. 34.</i>
Concurring with <i>Rashba</i>’s position, <i>R. Nissim ben Yosef Mizrahi</i> (eighteenth century Turkey) states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Even though <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Rambam</i> were not the <i>mara de-atra</i> in that place, since in all actions the community follows their words, <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Rambam</i> are considered their rabbis and <i>mara de-atra</i>s, even though their net was not spread over the place.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Admat Kodesh</i> 1:10.</i></small></span>
Obviously, a community’s choice to accept a <i>mara de-atra</i> who is no longer living presents formidable challenges. Since many members of the community are likely neither knowledgeable nor conversant regarding their <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings, a scholar would have to be elected to transmit those teachings. Thus, in one of the dozens of communities that have accepted <i>Rambam</i>’s authority in halakhic matters, the scholar would require broad knowledge of <i>Rambam</i>’s <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, commentary on the Mishnah, and responsa. In order to fully comprehend <i>Rambam</i>’s rulings, the scholar would also of necessity need to be able to unearth <i>Rambam</i>’s Talmudic and Geonic sources. Moreover, since the community would be posed from time to time with questions that were never addressed by <i>Rambam</i>, the scholar would also need the erudition to deliver <i>pesikah</i> that would either optimally “follow in <i>Rambam</i>’s footsteps” or be rooted in the teachings of others. Operating within the context of abiding by the judgments of a deceased rabbi, of course, is no small feat.
What is the justification for relying on an authority who is no longer alive to serve as a community’s <i>mara de-atra</i>? In the Tannaitic and Talmudic periods, dispute resolution demanded the expertise of a <i>rav</i> (rabbi), and his disciples were proscribed from issuing decisions in his presence. In post-Talmudic times, however, the norms governing the teacher-student relationship were abrogated. As <i>R. Moshe of Evreux</i>, a twelfth century Tosafist, explains:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>From the time the Jewish people was exiled from its land, when our Temple was destroyed … the law that reverence for a teacher must be like reverence for God no longer applies, and all the rules regarding the relationship between disciple and master are abrogated. This is because the books, the treatises, and the commentaries are our masters, and everything depends on intelligence and logic.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Aharon ha-Kohen of Lunel, <i>Orhot Hayyim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Talmud Torah</i>, ch. 21. While most halakhic authorities and Jewish legal historians contend that this is the earliest source for this notion, some historians argue that precedents to this concept are to be found in the earlier writings of Ri and Rash mi-Shantz. See Ephraim Urbach, <i>Ba’alei ha-Tosafot</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 5740), 251; Ephraim Kanarfogel, “Rabbinic Authority and the Right to Open an Academy in Medieval Ashkenaz,” 12 <i>Michael</i> (1991), 233; idem., “Progress and Tradition in Medieval Ashkenaz,” 14 <i>Jewish History</i> (2000), 287.<br>Accepting this concept as a technique of decision-making has led various authorities to claim that the Talmudic requirement requiring an individual to be forty years old prior to rendering a decision no longer applies. See <i>Lehem Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Talmud Torah</i> 5:1–4; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 200; <i>Teshuvot Ridbaz</i> 5:2147; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 1. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 369; <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:31. Even during the periods when such a requirement existed, the scope of the requirement was limited; see <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 280. Others, such as <i>Sefer ha</i>-<i>Ittur</i> 1; <i>Berurin</i> (2b); <i>Teshuvot Shevut Yaakov</i> 1:140; and <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Ridbaz</i> 5:2147, contend that this age requirement is limited to <i>hora’ah</i>, ritual matters.<br>According to R. Ovadiah Yosef, “the books … are our masters” mandates that all books must be examined prior to rendering a <i>psak.</i> Accordingly, if certain decisors arrive at a <i>psak</i> by looking only at certain books, such as the Talmud and <i>Rishonim</i>, the age requirement should remain operative. See <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 4, HM 1:6. Accordingly, <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, who explicitly states that his <i>pesakim</i> are based upon the Talmud and early codifiers and who refrains from delving into contemporary <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa) and recent predecessors’ writings, would be proscribed from rendering decisions prior to the age of forty. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, vol. 1, YD 55, vol. 2, YD 86, and vol. 1, OH 38. In fact, R. Yosef claims that all early Ashkenazic rabbinic decisors who failed to study the teachings of the <i>Aharonim</i> prior to handing down a <i>psak</i> were prohibited from serving as decisors prior to the age of forty.</i></small></span>
While this change led to attenuated or nonexistent personal ties between teachers and students, reliance upon “the books rather than scribes” (“<i>mi-pi seforim ve-lo mi-pi soferim</i>”) expanded the sources for rabbinic decision-making. Many communities chose to abide by the decisions of rabbinic arbiters of yesteryear, such as <i>Rif</i> and <i>Rambam</i> – “<i>mi-pi seforim</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See Kahane, supra n. 34.</i>
Despite the fact that <i>Rashba</i> accorded the status of <i>mara de-atra</i> to authorities who are no longer alive, he notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If there is one rabbi who has taught them, they should follow his opinion … If there be a scholar qualified to rule on Halakhah who adduces a proof to prohibit what they [<i>Rif</i> and <i>Rambam</i>] have permitted, one should prohibit, since they are not truly like their own rabbis. For if they do not abide by the opinion of the rabbi in their own locale, this would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253.</i></small></span>
<i>Rashba</i> (and others) introduce a caveat that the rule of halakhic subservience only applies to a <i>mara de-atra</i> out of concern for his honor and in deference to his rulings. Since these concerns are inapplicable to a decisor who is no longer living, if a scholar marshals proofs to prohibit a matter against the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s opinion, the scholar’s judgment may become binding. Upon the demise of a <i>mara de-atra</i>, it is permissible for another <i>posek</i> to overturn his rulings.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Numerous legists have offered the rationale for compliance to a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings as an expression of honor; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i>, ibid.; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 46a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 256; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 98; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 12, <i>heder</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 90, 149; <i>Teshuvot Muharash ha-Levi</i>, YD 10; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 95; <i>Pri Hadash</i>, <i>Yom Tov</i> 496, <i>Dinei Minhag</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Mateh Yosef</i>, vol. 2, YD 2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, OH 2, HM 100; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 242:57; <i>Kovetz Shiurim</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 273. However, this rationale is specifically applicable to a <i>mara de-atra</i>, rather than every <i>moreh hora’ah</i>.<br><i>Berakhot</i> 63b states that concerning <i>issur ve’heter</i>, ritual matters, “if a scholar prohibited something, his colleague has no authority to permit it after it already has been forbidden.” Most legists understand this to mean that once something has been declared forbidden, it can no longer be declared permissible. See <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Perush ha-Ra’avad</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, ad loc.; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:66. Cf. the views of <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Niddah</i> 20b, and <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2a (<i>Rif</i> pagination), who claim that “<i>kevod ha-Rav</i>,” deference and respect, precludes the second decisor from overruling the first decisor. (<i>Ran</i> notes that he lacks the status to counter the majority position, which disagrees with this view. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:362). For other approaches which bar overruling a previous decisor – either to preclude the conception that there are two systems of Halakhah or because the questioner has accepted the first decisor’s decision – see <i>Ran</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 379.<br>Based upon this debate, <i>Shiltei ha-Gibborim</i>, <i>Avoda Zarah</i> ad loc., argues that if the original <i>posek</i> issued a permissive ruling, according to Ra’avad et al., a second decisor may forbid the matter; according to <i>Rashi</i> et al., the second decisor must refrain from issuing such a ruling. A cursory glance at the works of <i>Poskim</i> will attest to the fact that legists frequently overrule and forbid what colleagues have previously permitted, thus corroborating the majority position. Moreover, numerous authorities have sanctioned overruling of colleagues; see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ad loc.; <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:31; <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242:58; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), YD 197; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 86. This conclusion extends even to being stringent against the Halakhah; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:112; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:188. Finally, some have argued that the rule “if a scholar prohibited something, his colleague has no authority to permit it after it already has been forbidden” is inapplicable today. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i> YD 242:63, <i>Teshuvot ha-Rama me-Pano</i> 108; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 9:79. Cf. <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:34; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:362; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i>, YD 9.<br>This conclusion, however, is limited to a non-institutional rabbinic authority. A scholar must refrain from deciding in a more stringent fashion than a living <i>mara de-atra</i>; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253. Hence, the fact that a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling is final is a unique <i>halakhah</i> regarding deference to his rulings and inapplicable to every <i>moreh horo’ah</i>. While a scholar’s issuance of a more stringent opinions – except in matters of <i>ishut</i>, personal status – is not generally perceived as an affront to his lenient predecessor (“<i>la’az al ha-rishonim</i>”), one must refrain from deciding in a stringent manner contrary to a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s lenient opinion. See <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 3:12; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 95; Eliav Shochetman, “The Concern for Reflecting Unfavorably upon Earlier Decisors as a Factor in Halakhic Decision-Making” [Hebrew], 18–19 <i>Bar Ilan Yearbook</i> (5741), 170.<br>Alternatively, others have advanced the notion that overruling a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s judgments displays improper manners, “<i>lav orcha de-ara</i>,” rather than a formal violation of deference. See <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Berakhot</i> 63a and <i>Hullin</i> 53a; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 239.</i>
A case in point is the nuanced approach of a number of 16–17th century Egyptian-Israeli authorities to the rulings of <i>Rambam</i>. <i>R. David ibn Zimra</i> (<i>Ridbaz</i>), for example, accepted <i>Rambam</i> as the <i>mara de-atra</i> of Egypt;<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:335; 4:1048, 1165; 6:2181.</i> nevertheless, in certain instances, <i>Ridbaz</i>’s autonomous judgment prevails.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid<i>.</i>, 1:121, 432, 433, 518; 3:1011.</i> Similarly, <i>R. Ya’akov Castro</i> (<i>Maharikash</i>) and <i>R. Avraham ha-Levi</i> (<i>Ginat Veradim</i>) exhibit a gravitational pull to <i>Rambam</i> as the <i>mara de-atra</i> of Egypt, yet remain innovative in many of their own rulings.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Oholei Yaakov</i> 13, 78; <i>Erekh Lehem</i>, OH 388; <i>Teshuvot Darkhei Noam</i>, HM 15; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, OH 3:26, YD 3:6; <i>Even Ha-Ezer</i> (EH) 2:7, HM 3:29.</i> As we will see, this navigation between the poles of deference and autonomy is characteristic of halakhic methodology in general and to the decisor’s relationship with a deceased <i>mara de-atra</i> in particular.
To buttress his conclusion, <i>Rashba</i> invokes the Talmud’s account of <i>Rabbah bar Hanna</i>’s practice when he visited Bavel (Babylonia). While there, he ate fat that the Sages of the Land of Israel had declared permissible, but which had been prohibited by the Sages of Bavel. <i>R. Ashi</i> explained that since <i>Rabbah</i> had intention to return to the Land of Israel, he was permitted to consume this fat; one must follow the practice of the place where he permanently resides, whether that practice is lenient or strict.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesahim</i> 51a. See <i>SA</i>, OH 574 and YD 214:2; <i>Shakh</i>, YD 214:8; <i>Magen Avraham</i>, OH 468:9. In general, if there is a conflict between the <i>minhag ha-makom</i> and family practice, the <i>minhag ha-makom</i> supersedes the family <i>minhag</i> and becomes binding upon the resident; see <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 127. However, if a <i>mara de-atra</i> follows his own <i>minhag</i> and some of the residents practice their own custom, these families may continue to follow their own <i>minhag</i>; see <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 103.</i> Since the “<i>minhag ha-makom</i>,” the local custom, in the Land of Israel was to follow the lenient view, <i>Rabbah</i> was compelled to follow it as well. Had he decided to permanently relocate to Bavel, he would then have been exempt from all of the communal enactments of his former locale, unless these enactments also existed in his new residence.
<i>Rashba</i> concludes that just as <i>minhag ha-makom</i> determines proper practice in cases of <i>issur ve-heter</i> (ritual Halakhah) in cases in which there is a difference of opinion, it is similarly the deciding factor in dealing with communities guided by a <i>mara de-atra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">These norms applying to communal enactments are analogous to the norms applying to divergent customs; see <i>SA</i>, YD 214:2. Moreover, one must continue to abide by his <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings even if he is temporarily residing elsewhere; see <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 49; <i>Teshuvot Mateh Yosef</i>, YD 1. If the communal enactment is accompanied by the sanction of <i>herem</i> (excommunication), the individual must comply with the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s judgments even when permanently residing in another community; see <i>SA,</i> YD 228:29 in the name of <i>Radakh</i>; <i>Teshuvot Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 12, <i>heder</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 149.<br>For antecedents for this position, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 48. However, others point out that <i>Ran</i>‘s ruling deals solely with enactments emanating from the <i>Beit din ha</i>-<i>Gadol</i>, the supreme court; see <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, HM 111; <i>Massa Melekh</i> 11a; <i>Pri Hadash</i> 496:13. On the role of the <i>herem</i> in communal legislation, see Gerald Blidstein, “Individual and Community in the Middle Ages” in D. Elazar (ed.), <i>Kinship and Consent</i> (Washington D.C., 1983), 217, 227–33.</i> Just as <i>Rabbah</i> heeded his <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling, members of any community are obligated to adhere to their <i>mara de-atra</i>’s decisions, even in the face of contrary ruling by a qualified authority. If, however, the community appoints an authority that is no longer alive as its <i>mara de-atra</i>, one can no longer speak of “his place.” A qualified authority is thus entitled to overrule the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s view.
If a duly elected <i>mara de-atra</i> subsequently dies, <i>R. Dovid Gershon</i> (seventeenth century Egypt) concludes that his rulings are still binding upon the community, even if other recognized authorities disagree with his view.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, EH, <i>kelal</i> 2:9. However, a reading of <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1190 indicates otherwise.</i> In effect, the notion of <i>minhag ha-makom</i> remains operative even after the <i>mara de-atra</i> is no longer alive. Other authorities, such as <i>R. Yeshayahu de-Trani</i> (<i>Shiltei ha-Gibborim</i>) and <i>R. Yosef ibn Ezra</i> (<i>Massa Melekh</i>), concur with this conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shiltei ha-Gibborim</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2a (Rif pagination); <i>Massah Melekh</i>, <i>Ne’ilat She’arim be-Minhagei Issur</i>, <i>hakirah</i> 13.</i>
Others, however, including <i>R. Yoel Sirkes</i> (<i>Bah</i>), <i>R. Hezekiyah De Silva</i> (<i>Peri Hadash</i>), and <i>R. Yosef ben Moshe ha-Levi</i> (<i>Mateh Yosef</i>), argue that a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s decisions must be followed by members of a community residing within his geographical location only during his lifetime. Should the community desire to continue to follow the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s teachings after his death, the community would have to reaffirm him as their <i>mara de-atra</i>. Otherwise, the rulings of a new <i>mara de-atra</i> may become binding upon the community or those of a recognized decisor may become binding upon individuals. <sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah</i>, HM 25; <i>Pri Hadash</i>, OH, <i>Minhagei Issur</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Mateh Yosef</i>, vol. 2, YD 2.</i>
This latter position affirms the critical role that the community plays in the establishment of obligatory halakhic compliance with the rulings of the <i>mara de-atra</i>. But what is the nature of that authority? Do the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings govern the community members of a particular locale or the locale itself? For example, if a community was disbanded due to war or expulsion and Jews repopulate the area years later, are they bound to the rulings of the previous <i>mara de-atra</i> based upon <i>minhag ha-makom</i>, even if the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s community no longer exists? Do we insist that <i>kavod ha-rav</i> necessitates that we defer to the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s view, even in the absence of his constituency, or is <i>minhag ha-makom</i> solely a function of the presence of the <i>kahal</i>, the community?
Both <i>Shiltei ha-Gibborim</i> and <i>R.

<b>4. The <i>Mara De-Atra</i> and the Modern Jewish Community</b>
This entire discussion is premised upon the sociological existence of a <i>kahal</i>. With the advent of modernization, secularization, the widespread bureaucratization of authority, and social mobility, the traditional communities, the “<i>atra</i>s” (the places), have been weakened significantly. These social and political forces, combined with easy access to other arbiters of national and international standing via telephone, fax, and e-mail, undermine and undercut the traditional role of a <i>mara de-atra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem Friedman, “The Changing Role of the Community Rabbinate,” 25 <i>The Jerusalem Quarterly</i> (Fall 1982), 79–99; idem., “Halachic Rabbinic Authority in the Modern Open Society,” in J. Werthheimer (ed.), <i>Jewish Religious Leadership: Image and Reality</i> (NY: 2004), 757–70. Whether the rise of Hasidism and the Lithuanian <i>yeshiva</i> in the 19th century impacted upon traditional rabbinic leadership, as argued by Friedman, I leave as an open question for further study.</i> Commenting upon this sociological change, Professor Menachem Friedman observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>In the past, I coined the term “voluntary community” to distinguish between the traditional Jewish community that existed in Europe, at least until the middle of the eighteenth century, and the Jewish community that developed via the processes of modernization and secularization, which was paralleled by the disintegration of the traditional community framework. While the former was defined primarily by geographic bounds and included all the Jews who resided within these bounds … the voluntary community, to the extent that such a term can be used in this context, was organized on the basis of the willingness of the individual to be affiliated with it and to assume the norms and values that define the identity of the community … The development of the voluntary community became possible from the moment that the leadership of the Jewish community no longer had the power to enforce the observance of the traditional Jewish way of life on the members of the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Friedman, “Halachic Rabbinic Authority,” supra n. 81, 765–6.</i></small></span>
Despite the countervailing forces of modernity, an authority who possesses the requisite scholarly credentials can function institutionally in the United States as a <i>mara de-atra</i> within certain contexts. This is the case, for example, in the context of the rebbe of a Hasidic community or a <i>Rosh Yeshiva</i> within the walls of his <i>yeshiva</i>. However, for all practical purposes, the presence of a <i>mara de-atra</i> as a <i>kahal</i> authority has vanished from most Jewish communities. Thus, R. Feinstein observes that neither Manhattan nor Brooklyn possess a <i>mara de-atra</i> who is the authority for the entire populace.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 1:159. In a later <i>teshuvah</i>, he points out that communities retaining their own customs do not exist; see ibid., OH 4:33. R. Rafael Bloom similarly mentions that there is no <i>mara de-atra</i> functioning in the United States; see <i>Teshuvot Birkhot Shamayim</i>, EH 47:3.</i> Similarly, in Israel, residents of Bnei Brak are not necessarily bound to follow the teachings of the late <i>Hazon Ish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, YD 3:88. See also Z. Goldberg, supra n. 23, 33–34. Cf. R. Shlomo Shapiro, supra n. 23, 149, n. 1, who argues that synagogue membership entails accepting the rabbi as one’s <i>mara de-atra</i>.</i>
Despite the absence of a communal framework within many Jewish enclaves, in many instances, the synagogue in a particular locale may be deemed halakhically as a <i>kahal</i> if it operates as an autonomous institution.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 153; <i>Bi’ur Halakhah</i>, OH 468. For others who subscribe to or reject this position, see R. Shalom Schwadron, <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 231:32.</i> For these purposes, the synagogue’s autonomy is defined by having its own rabbi, conducting daily prayer services with its own liturgical practices, and maintaining governance by its lay membership. If the synagogue is construed as a <i>kahal</i>, the elected rabbi, contingent upon possessing the requisite scholarship, is to be viewed as the <i>mara de-atra</i> of the synagogue.
The synagogue’s <i>mara de-atra</i> will either be “an-authority” or “in-authority” to the same degree that any communal <i>mara de-atra</i> is. Synagogue acceptance of the <i>mara de-atra</i> is either actualized through the adoption of a <i>takanat ha-kahal</i>, synagogue bylaws,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Although the halakhic norms governing the construction, use, and sale of a synagogue are predicated upon the authoritative <i>takanot ha-kahal</i> promulgated by the duly elected and representative members of a particular town (<i>SA</i>, OH 153), we equally extend this capacity of passage of <i>takanot ha-kahal</i> to the general membership and/or board of a synagogue.</i> and/or the execution of a <i>ketav rabbanut</i>, a rabbinic contract. Members of the synagogue are then obligated to abide by his rulings either by dint of the membership’s election or by voluntarily accepting his authority<i>.</i> Should a member decline to accept him as his <i>mara de-atra</i>, the member (or a non-member attending the synagogue) must refrain from any public behavior in the synagogue that undercuts specific rulings issued by the <i>mara de-atra</i>. As <i>R. Hayyim D. ha-Levi</i> elucidates:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Although there is an obligation to comply with … the local rabbi’s rulings … surely if one does not accept his rulings … since he knows that other scholars differ with him, it is clear that he is not labeled a sinner. However, he is prohibited from acting in variance with the rabbi and his congregation in any public fashion, since such behavior would be an infraction of “<i>lo titgodedu</i>,” which seeks to prevent controversy and promote peace in the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mayyim Hayyim</i> 1:71. For further discussion, see supra text accompanying n. 50; <i>Teshuvot Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 22, <i>heder</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Moharash ha-Levi</i>, YD 10; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, YD 2:99; <i>Teshuvot Seredei Esh</i> 2:12. According to many, the role of a <i>mara de-atra</i> today is limited to matters of a public nature. Thus, R. Herschel Schachter has stated that although he places his <i>tallit</i> over his head during certain portions of the prayer service, he does not do so if he is praying in a synagogue in which the rabbi has not adopted this practice. Additionally, a person who enters a synagogue to pray accepts the practices of that synagogue due to the need to follow <i>minhag ha-makom</i>; see <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM, <i>Hashmatot</i>, 5:185.</i></small></span>
<i>Any rulings which entails public behavior in the synagogue, such as synagogue liturgy, kashrut standards in the synagogue, and legal decisions affecting synagogue practice, apply to all synagogue members, even those who follow another rabbi’s teachings. Indeed, it is not uncommon in many of our communities to find members of one synagogue who choose to pose their halakhic questions to the rabbi of another synagogue or a yeshiva. As long as when you pray at a particular synagogue you communicate public recognition and validation of the synagogue rabbi and his rulings relating to the synagogue rather than practicing in the synagogue and/or voicing the rulings of your rabbi, such behavior appears to be entirely legitimate. To state it differently, though a particular congregant has chosen a rabbi for halakhic counsel (who is “in authority”) to address his personal needs, nevertheless, when attending the synagogue he must abide by all the rulings and practices of the congregational who is “in authority” in the synagogue.</i>
As we saw above regarding a communal <i>mara de-atra</i>, every synagogue member, regardless of whether he has selected the synagogue rabbi as “one’s rabbi” or not is obligated to refrain from complying with a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling if he has erred “<i>be-devar Mishnah</i>,” in a matter of black-letter Halakhah or in permitting the forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 56–58.</i>
<b>5. <i>Mara de-Atra</i> of an Ideological Community</b>
In the foregoing discussion, we discussed the authority of living and deceased <i>mara de-atra</i>s, the extent of that authority, and the applicability to the modern day Jewish community. The common feature of the <i>mara de-atra</i>s that we have discussed is that they are chosen by a community in a particular geographical location. Can the notion of community transcend geographical boundaries? Can ideological and principled commitment create an ideological community, which in turn chooses its <i>mara de-atra</i>?
<i>R. Aharon Lichtenstein</i> responds to this question:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The definition of the relevant community, however, is murky. The <i>gemara</i> speaks of locale, but it seems strange that geography should be the sole determinant … Would only residents of twelfth-century Egypt be entitled to rely upon the Rambam’s minority <i>kulot</i>? … It seems far more likely that other factors – ethnic identity or, above all … spiritual and ideological fealty – should carry no less weight … Physical proximity is obviously not intended here. What is envisioned is, evidently, a principled and consistent attachment … [S]piritual commitment rather than geographic continuity is the determining factor. A Sephardic congregation in Warsaw could be still bound by the rulings of the <i>Rishon le-Tzion</i>. Would a Gerer <i>hasid</i> cease to be part of the <i>Beis Yisrael</i>’s community just because he had moved to Paris?<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Aharon Lichtenstein, <i>Leaves of Faith: The World of Jewish Learning</i> (NY: 2004), vol. 2, 289.</i></small></span>
Upon the basis of this presentation, which is grounded in his interpretation of <i>Rashba</i>’s teachings,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 56. A more explicit recognition of a <i>mara de-atra</i> advancing a macro halakhic tradition and ideology, such as <i>Beit Hillel</i> and <i>Beit Shammai</i>, may be found in the writings of <i>Rashba</i>’s teacher; see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 43b.</i> <i>R. Lichtenstein</i> concludes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The implications for a contemporary Orthodox Jew’s legitimating of his response to modernity are self-evident. Were there no genuine <i>gadol</i> who had subscribed to the core halakhic positions of what is roughly denominated as Modern Orthodoxy, ordinary rabbis and laymen would be hard-put to cling to them … No objective observer of the American Torah scene – or the international scene, for that matter – can fail to acknowledge the Rav’s [R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik] position as one of the <i>gedolim</i> of this century, and his advocacy of the critical values of Modern Orthodoxy … On the central issues … he has been steadfast and consistent: on the interrelated questions of general culture, confronting the world and Religious Zionism … There can also be no question of his right to champion his positions. That right is relevant not only to the Rav personally, but to any declared member of his ideological community. Those who identify with his worldview and halakhic orientation can rightfully regard their similar views as legitimized by his authority – with the proviso, of course, that they generally submit to that authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 89, 289–90.</i></small></span>
Whereas, as we have seen, the members of community in a particular locale formally choose their <i>mara de-atra</i>, in this context, the ideological community residing in various places, without any formal mechanism of election, adopts their adherence to one <i>posek</i>’s rulings. This entails compliance with his positions regarding such macro issues as the legitimacy of secular education, the significance of the State of Israel, and relations with fellow Jews and non-Jews, but at the same time, it entails subservience to his rulings in all realms of Halakhah, such as <i>kashrut</i>, Shabbat, family relations, business matters, and the like. One cannot simply decide to follow a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s teachings related to his <i>weltanschauung</i> and abstain from compliance to his rulings dealing with daily halakhic concern.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Whether he is “an-authority,” and his decisions accordingly become binding due to individual choice, or he is “in-authority,” and his decisions are thus binding upon individuals and noncompliance entails a violation of <i>lo tasur</i>, is subject to debate; see supra text accompanying nn. 8–18. Alternatively, individual choice is irrelevant and a conclave like the Sanhedrin is empowered to issue decisions for the entire Jewish community. See infra n. 93.</i> This notion of an ideological community being bound by a <i>mara de-atra</i> equally extends to following the teachings of an enclave of scholars, such as the <i>Moetzes Gedolei Hatorah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">For precedents for viewing a collective body as a <i>mara de-atra</i>, see <i>Hullin</i> 43b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 43b. For discussion regarding the status of rabbinic groups convened after the cessation of the Sanhedrin, see <i>Teshuvot Ya’avetz</i> 153; Menachem Mendel Landau, <i>Sefer Meikitz Nirdamim</i> (Petrokov, 1904), 44, 65; <i>Kol Kitvei Maharatz Chayot</i>, 103; Elhanan Wasserman, <i>Kovetz Shiurim</i>, <i>Kuntres Divrei Soferim</i> 2:3; R. Shmuel Munk (attributed author), <i>Kuntres She’eilot u-Teshuvot be-Ein Hazon</i>, Introduction and no. 9.</i> Whether the guidelines that address the credentials and parameters of the <i>mara de-atra</i> in a particular geographical location apply to a <i>mara de-atra</i> of an ideological community are beyond the scope of this presentation.
<b>6. The <i>Psak</i> of a <i>Mara de-Atra</i>: Subservience to One’s Predecessors or Autonomous Judgment?</b>
Until this point, we have focused upon rabbinic authorities who are institutionally based, either within the context of the community, a <i>yeshiva</i>, or a synagogue. Whether these arbiters either live in physical proximity to their adherents, live elsewhere, or are no longer living, their adherents have a principled and committed attachment to their teachings. What remains to be addressed are the dynamics involved in a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s or a non-institutional rabbinic authority’s issuance of a <i>psak din</i> (decision). How does any <i>mara de-atra</i> – or, for that matter, any <i>posek</i> (arbiter) resolve a matter in question? Given the dissemination of <i>sifrei hiddushim</i> (novellae), <i>sifrei psak</i> (restatements), and <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa), ought an individual arbitrarily choose one ruling over another?
Expounding upon the dictum, “Designate yourself a teacher and remove doubt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 6.</i> <i>Yosef ibn Nahmias</i> cites his teacher, <i>R. Asher ben Yehiel</i> (<i>Rosh</i>):
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he has a [legal] tradition from his master, he should act accordingly, and if he does not, he should choose one of the restatements from among [those written by] the great authors, one that he admires, and act in accordance with his decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Commentary of Yosef ibn Nahmias on <i>Avot</i> 7a, quoted by Judah Galinsky, “Ashkenazim in Sefarad: The Rosh and the Tur on the Codification of Jewish Law,” 16 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2006), 3, 14–15.</i></small></span>
According to <i>Rosh</i>, in the presence of conflicting views regarding a point of Halakhah, one should either opt to abide by one’s teacher or, assuming one is learned and erudite, follow a specific restatement (such as the <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, or <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>). <i>Rosh</i> notes, however, regarding <i>Rambam</i>’s <i>Mishnah Torah</i> that, “One should refrain from relying upon his reading in this book to assess and render decisions unless one finds proof in the Talmud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 31:9.</i> If a <i>sefer psak</i> characteristically lacks corroborating sources, one should preferably rely on one’s autonomous judgment rather than simply invoke the ruling found in the restatement. If one has the ability, he can overrule his predecessor by unearthing his sources and revealing his latent processes of reasoning.
However, <i>Rosh</i> introduces two qualifications regarding the right of a scholar to overrule an earlier opinion by adducing proofs for his own view:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>In cases where two scholars of stature argue regarding a halakhic determination, let not an arbiter say, “I will render a decision as I see fit.” If he acted in this manner, this is a false judgment – unless he was a scholar of stature, learned, and capable of reasoning and is able to resolve the matter according to one of the opinions based on clear and cogent proofs …<br>And I say that it is surely true that someone who erred regarding the rulings of the <i>Ge’onim</i> because he had not heard of their view, but when he was informed of the Geonic decision it appeared correct to him, he has erred in black-letter Halakhah (<i>ta’ut be-devar Mishnah</i>). And the same is true not only of Geonic rulings, but also of the scholars of every generation … Should their words not appear agreeable to him and he cites proofs for his position which are acceptable to his generation, then “Yiftah in his generation is like Samuel in his.”<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 4:6. For this explanation of his position, see <i>Kovetz Shiurim</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 272. For a similar approach, see <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 1, Introduction; YD 1:101, 3:88. There are times when R. Feinstein would rely upon the stature of the authority as a grounds for a decision; see <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 1:39, 5:13, 24.</i></small></span>
Halakhah limits the finality of a judgment (<i>res judicata</i>) by distinguishing an error committed by an arbiter regarding fundamental law, such as a matter explicit and unanimously accepted in the Mishnah, Tosefta, or Talmud (<i>ta’ut be-devar Mishnah</i>), in which case the decision is reversible, and error in resolving a disputed point of law (<i>ta’ut be-shikul ha-da’at</i>), in which case the decision is final. <i>Rosh</i> argues that the opinions of the <i>Ge’onim</i> and <i>Rishonim</i> are accorded the status of <i>devar Mishnah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 33a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 6:1; <i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 33a. For an extensive discussion of <i>Rishonim</i> regarding this subject, see my “The Finality of a Judicial Decision in Jewish Law” [Hebrew] (unpublished doctoral dissertation; Hebrew University Faculty of Law, 1984).</i> Accordingly, if an arbiter ignores their rulings in favor of another view, it is construed as an error in <i>devar Mishnah</i>. Furthermore, the stature of these writings obligates a halakhist to be aware of their existence; failing to take them into account at the time of the decision renders the <i>psak</i> null and void if it contradicts his predecessors. Nevertheless, <i>Rosh</i> argues that a scholar who is aware of these early opinions and yet adduces clear and compelling proofs (<i>berurot u-nekhonot</i>) is entitled to overrule these opinions, provided that these proofs are agreeable (<i>mekubalot</i>) to his own generation.
Following in the footsteps of <i>Rosh</i>, <i>R. Moshe Isserles</i> (<i>Rema</i>) states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If it seems to the scholar and his contemporaries, based upon compelling proofs, that the Halakhah is at variance with what is mentioned among the decisors, one may disagree with them, since it is not mentioned in the Talmud …<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 25:1. See also, <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:3, <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150, <i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM, Likkutim 1.</i></small></span>
According to <i>Rema</i>, overruling one’s predecessor(s) is contingent upon advancing “compelling proofs” which are acceptable to the arbiter and his contemporaries. The “compelling proofs” in this context may either be proofs based upon a halakhic tradition of arbiters’ rulings or convincing proofs without halakhic precedent.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 1 adopts the latter interpretation.</i> Whether the unearthing of sources for scrutiny and potential dissent is limited to the Talmud, <i>Ge’onim</i>, and <i>Rishonim</i> or encompasses the teachings of <i>Aharonim</i> as well is subject to much debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon the Talmudic discussion of the finality of judgment and judicial malpractice (see text accompanying n. 98), divergent conclusions have been drawn.

Relying upon the view of <i>R. Yisrael Isserlin</i> (<i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 2:241. In an earlier <i>teshuva</i> (233), a distinction is made between “compositions which are widespread” and “compositions which are unknown.”</i> <i>Rema</i> adds the following caveat:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>However, one cannot be lenient regarding strictures found in compositions (<i>hibburim</i>) which have spread throughout the majority of Israel, unless one has a tradition from one’s teachers that we do not practice this particular stricture.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 25:1. The phrase “books which have been spread throughout the majority of Israel” brings to mind the Talmudic comment, “We are accustomed to daily decisions being handed down in this manner;” see <i>Ketuvot</i> 68b, 95b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 163b. Precedent for <i>Rema</i>’s position regarding the significance of the dissemination of the books can be found in <i>Ran</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 36a (<i>Rif</i> pagination). See <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 25:7.</i></small></span>
<i>Rema</i>’s reference to “books” and <i>Rosh</i>’s focus upon “early authorities” is an implicit adoption of the thirteenth century Ashkenazic tradition that “[halakhic] compositions … are the teachers of men.”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 62–63.</i>
In contrast, <i>Maharam Alsheikh</i>, <i>Maharam ibn Haviv</i>, and <i>Shakh</i> argue that even if the individual has the requisite credentials, if there is a significant disparity of knowledge between the predecessor and himself, it is improper for him to overrule his predecessor.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 39; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 3; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 25:21.</i>
<i>R. J. David Bleich</i> invokes the significance of considering normative Halakhah as the grounds for one’s <i>psak</i> prior to issuing an autonomous judgment:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Leniencies and permissive rulings exist in abundance. The point is to seek neither the stringent nor the lenient, but the view that is most authoritative. Moreover, there usually is a view which has been accepted in practice by the majority of <i>Poskim</i> as the accepted standard. Thereupon, such a ruling becomes normative and deviation cannot be considered other than by virtue of compelling reasons.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</i> (NY: 1995), vol. 4, Introduction, 13–14.</i></small></span>
Adopting “our teachers are the books” as a basis for decision-making poses a formidable challenge for every arbiter. Whether one is a recognized authority or a <i>mara de-atra</i>, the <i>posek</i> has a daunting task. Prior to rendering a decision, the arbiter must acknowledge his own finitude in terms of the level of his own halakhic knowledge compared to his contemporaries and predecessors, as well as recognize the importance of rendering a <i>psak</i> pursuant to normative Halakhah regarding the matter he is addressing. Should compelling reasons dictate the need to deviate from normative Halakhah, utilizing the canons of decision-making, he may render an autonomous judgment. To arrive at a <i>psak</i>, the <i>posek</i> must delve into commentaries on the Talmud and responsa literature, which generally reveal their reasoning processes, as well as the restatements and rabbinic court judgments, which are frequently devoid of proofs and explicit reasoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:7; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 30a, 31b; <i>SA</i>, HM 22:2.</i>
It is worth noting that we have thus far referred to <i>sifrei psak</i> as “restatements,” rather than the more conventional translation, “codes.” A code is characterized by a sense of certitude and finality. Frequently, its rules are in canonical form; they have been given a particular authoritative formulation. We have avoided this translation because a <i>sefer psak</i> is actually merely a restatement of a particular area of Halakhah that remains subject to future debate and interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">M. Elon, supra n. 35, vol. 2, 1144–8.</i> Thus, Professor Isadore Twersky writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Any student who follows the course of rabbinic literature from the Geonic works of the eighth century through the <i>Mishnah Torah</i> and <i>Turim</i> and on down to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> cannot ignore this see-saw tendency … No sooner is the need for codification met than a wave of non-codifactory work rises. A restatement, even in the eyes of its admirers, required vigilant explanation and judicious application.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Isadore Twersky, <i>Studies in Jewish Law and Philosophy</i> (NY: 1982), 138.</i></small></span>
Although <i>sifrei psak</i> are characterized by their comprehensiveness, systematization, abstractness, and <i>ko’ah ha-hiddush</i> (creativity), their rulings did not nullify existing opinions within the halakhic system, opinions which are also authoritative or potentially may become authoritative in the future.
Moreover, the legist’s creative-interpretative role remains attempting to clarify ambiguities and gaps in the restatement’s rulings. In fact, according to <i>Maharal</i>, even if a scholar with credential errs in interpreting a passage in the Talmud, it is preferable to follow one’s interpretation rather than abide by a restatement “like a blind traveler on a highway.”<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot Olam</i>, <i>Netiv ha-Torah</i>, ch. 15.

However, numerous commentators on <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> view it as akin to any other <i>sefer psak</i> whose rulings can be overruled. Regardless of the source of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s authority,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">For the differing approaches to the significance of the rabbinic affirmation of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, see Yaakov Hayyim Sofer, “Regarding Maran, Who Received the Approbation of 200 Rabbis” [Hebrew], <i>Zekhor le-Avraham</i> (Holon, 5754–55), 27.</i> its decisions were subject to much debate and disagreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">A cursory glance of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s commentaries certainly corroborates such a conclusion.</i>
The absence of finality regarding a majority opinion and the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s rulings is reflected in the policy of “<i>ko’ah de-hetera adif</i>” (the power of rendering a lenient ruling is preferable). While a lenient view may have been overruled, it can be taken into account under certain conditions in arriving at a <i>psak</i>.
<i>Rashba</i> establishes the following guidelines concerning the implementation of this rule:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It is normative Halakhah that we rule according to the superior opinion in wisdom and in number, and even in an emergency situation; we do not rely upon the opinion that is inferior in number and in wisdom. A similar rule applies in a controversy between the individual and majority view, unless it is an emergency-situation, when there is a danger of financial loss or the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 59.</i></small></span>
In cases of disputes between arbiters of equal scholarly stature, we may pronounce, in Talmudic parlance, “Rabbi X is worthy to be relied upon in a dire need” (one may rely upon a minority lenient opinion in times of emergency).<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">For definitional guidance, see <i>Or Zarua</i>, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:306; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:75; <i>Teshuvot Binyan Olam</i>, OH 14. Regarding <i>agunah</i> matters, see <i>SA</i>, EH 127:2. To rely upon this principle, there must be a consensus that indeed this is a state of emergency; see <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> 205; <i>Teshuvot Emunat Shmuel</i> 24.</i>
The right of an arbiter to exercise discretion, relying upon an individual opinion in cases of emergency and significant financial loss, even when the majority rules against that view, is firmly rooted in Talmudic precedent.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 9a; <i>Shabbat</i> 45a; <i>Gittin</i> 18b; <i>Niddah</i> 6a, 9b.</i> <i>Radakh</i> and <i>Hazon Ish</i><sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 3, <i>heder</i> 1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 160:3–4.</i> argue that that the presence of a majority view is to be construed as “<i>itmar hilkhisa</i>” – the <i>halakhah</i> has been decided and one therefore cannot impart legitimacy to an individual opinion even in extenuating circumstances. It appears that in their view, “abiding by the majority” in halakhic controversy is akin to following the majority in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. However, <i>Rashbatz</i>, <i>Rashbash</i>, <i>Bah</i>, <i>Rema</i>, <i>Shakh</i>, <i>Taz</i>, and <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i> disagree.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei u-Piskei ha-Rashbatz</i>, <i>Niddah</i> 9b; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 513; <i>Bah</i>, YD, <i>Kuntres Aharon</i>; <i>Rema</i>, HM 25:2; <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242; <i>Taz</i>, YD 293:3; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, vol. 1, YD 21, vol. 2, EH 9. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Binyan Olam</i>, YD 50, who argues that this rule may be only invoked in cases enumerated in the Talmud. Although limited to ritual matters (see <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:33), some contend that this rule applies even to biblical prohibitions; see <i>Bah</i>, ibid.; <i>Taz</i>, ibid. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:8; <i>Shakh</i>, ibid.; <i>Nekudat ha-Kesef</i>, YD 293. According to <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Bah</i>, this principle is operative only in the absence of a decisive ruling in either direction and the views are divided equally. However, one may adhere to the lenient opinion provided that the authority is of greater erudition than the advocate of the stricter view. Should the authority of the strict view be of greater prominence, one must abide by his view. Finally, one cannot rely upon an individual lenient opinion in case of pressing need without accompanying financial loss. However, <i>be-diavad</i> (ex post facto), if the rendering of the <i>psak</i> affects the arbiter’s honor, we construe the situation as akin to “financial need” and give credence to the position. See <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> 1:122.<br>Others argue that in cases in which a matter has been resolved based upon the rules of halakhic decision-making, such as “<i>halakhah ke-Shemuel be-mamona</i>” or “<i>mishnat Rabbi Yossi kav ve-naki</i>,” then one may rely on a minority view in a situation of a pressing need. See <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 11.</i> Whereas a majority view is determinative following a judicial proceeding, the various authorities debating a halakhic issue generally function as discrete individuals adducing evidence for their respective positions, rather than as a group sitting together arriving at a reasoned judgment. Since halakhic controversy transcends geographic location and time period, one can clearly conclude that “<i>lo itmar hilkhisa</i>” – there is no definitive ruling, and one can therefore rely on an individual opinion in a time of emergency and significant financial loss. The fact that one can ascertain the position of the majority is irrelevant;<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashbatz</i>, supra n. 120; <i>Rashbash</i>, supra n. 120; R.

The legitimacy of recourse to an individual opinion under these conditions equally becomes a source of debate regarding the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>. Are its rulings to be characterized as “<i>itmar hilkhisa</i>” or not? Whereas <i>Hazon Ish</i>, pursuant to his earlier cited position, and <i>R. Naftali Tzvi Berlin</i> argue that its decisions are akin to a majority view and one may therefore not rely on a different minority opinion even in extenuating circumstances,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, supra n. 118; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 4:80.</i> <i>R. Tzvi ben Ya’akov Ashkenazi</i> (<i>Hakham Tzvi</i>) argues that the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s rulings are categorized as “<i>de-lo itmar hilkhisa</i>,” similar to any other <i>sefer psak</i> that is subject to debate and overruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 100. For the underpinnings of this position, see the Sephardic sources mentioned supra n. 112.</i> However, an arbiter cannot rule in accordance with a minority opinion of scholarly eminence – even if some authorities agree to the position and even in a situation of financial need and emergency – if a definitive strict ruling has crystallized in rulings of the authorities and the ruling has become widespread throughout the majority of Jewish communities, unless there is a tradition that it is not the practice to abide by a strict opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 117. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Binyan Olam</i>, YD 50.</i>
The requisite need to engage in interpretation of our restatements equally applies to published decisions of Jewish courts. Because there is no general obligation to provide a reasoned judgment in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:7; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 31b.</i> most decisions are rendered without accompanying rationales. Here again, it becomes the arbiter’s responsibility to delve into these rulings in order to uncover the grounds for the ruling, rather than simply accepting them at face value, lest one erroneously misinterpret them. In sum, “our teachers are our books” is actually a formidable challenge to an authority who accepts the awesome responsibility for rendering judgment.
The absence of finality of a <i>psak</i> is also true of <i>she’eilot u-teshuvot</i> (responsa) literature, in which the facts of the case under discussion are usually clear and the decision is accompanied by reasoned corroboration. When the son of <i>R. Akiva Eiger</i>, a renowned eighteenth century legist, asked his father for permission to publish his responsa under the name “<i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>,” <i>R. Eiger</i> responds:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>And regarding my dear son’s request, if it is favorable in my eyes to describe these <i>pesakim</i> and these writings … The name “<i>pesakim</i>” is improper, because it seems that this is the final decision for me and one cannot disagree with it … It is difficult for me to hear that upon the appearance of halakhic composition some authorities abide by its rulings. Such an approach is improper, since they are responsible to investigate the matter thoroughly; if, after proper examination, they find that the author’s teachings are correct, then they should follow him. But to believe whatever is found in the written word … is not from the ways of wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, p. 1. Regarding R. Eiger’s stature, see R. C. Berlin, <i>Meromei Sadeh</i>, Introduction; <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Introduction.</i></small></span>
Thus, <i>R. Eiger</i>, who some view as having the stature almost equal to that of a <i>Rishon</i> (early authority), preconditioned any acceptance of a ruling upon exercising one’s autonomous judgment.
<b>7. The Role of <i>Hekesh</i> (Analogical Reasoning) in the Rendering of a <i>Psak</i></b>
The ability to analyze and potentially overrule one’s predecessor, whether he be the author of a <i>teshuvah</i> or a <i>sefer psak</i>, requires that the arbiter (including a <i>mara de-atra or a dayan</i>) possess <i>yirat Shamayim</i> (religious piety) and scholarship. In his decision-making, he must weigh the significance of contrary precedent opinion and exercise logic as well. Clearly, many questions posed to an arbiter can be answered by simply opening <i>sifrei psak</i> and <i>teshuvot</i>. In order to address new questions, however, being conversant with these sources does not suffice.
Borrowing Talmudic terminology, <i>Rosh</i> argues that an arbiter must engage in a special type of logic, “<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>,” applying analogical inferences for the purpose of discerning the similarities and differences between cases in order to address new situations.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>kelal</i> 55:9 and 78:3. There is an ongoing debate about which types of reasoning are permissible in <i>pesikah</i>. See, for example, <i>Or Zarua</i> 2:33; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 164; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 16; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 92; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:322; <i>She’alat David</i>, <i>Kuntres ha-Hiddushin</i>, 73.</i> Implicitly relying upon Talmudic precedent, <i>R. Avraham</i> the son of <i>Rambam</i> expounds upon the nature of this type of logic:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>An arbiter who in his decisions follows only what is written and explicitly stated is weak … In every decision that he is considering, he should analogize his case to something that is similar to it and derive branches from those roots … They [Talmudic precedents] were preserved for a reason … in order that the wise man, hearing them frequently, will develop his ability to weigh the matters with discretion and render decisions properly.</small></span>
The vitality and effervescence of the decision-making process is maintained when the arbiter seeks to resolve a problem by searching for examples that may serve as fruitful sources for comparison. In comparing these precedents to the case at hand, the arbiter analyzes the similarities and differences between them, deriving a tentative analogy that posits a logical relationship between the examples and the problem. Finally, the arbiter confirms the rule by inquiring whether it meets the guidelines for invoking an analogy in this particular situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">For other examples, see my “A Parent’s Decision to Withhold Medical Treatment from Children – A Case Study in Competing Analogies,” 17 <i>Dinei Israel</i> (1993–94), 35; “The Investment Advisor: Liabilities and Halachic Identity,” 58 <i>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> (2009),107; “Self-Dealing in the Not-for-Profit Board Room: An Inquiry into a Trustee’s Multifaceted Halakhic Identity,” 43 <i>Tradition</i> (Spring 2010), 7 and “The Multi-Faceted Halakhic Identity of a Jewish Investment Broker,” 43 <i>Tradition</i> (Fall 2010), 51.</i> In effect, the method of analogy, unlike ordinary open-ended reasoning, starts with the prior decisions of one’s predecessors, rather the arbiter’s own reasoning and intuition.
The practice of analogical reasoning reflects the ongoing dialectic between deference to early authorities and creative innovation. The spur to originality and creativeness, <i>ko’ah ha</i>-<i>hiddush</i>, is tempered by the commitment to thoroughly investigate a wealth of sources and the collaborative effort of numerous arbiters over time who may have addressed similar and/or identical problems. The weightiness of precedent opinion facilitates avoidance of flawed and misplaced reasoning. The engagement in “<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>” is thus concomitantly a stimulant and a depressant – a spur to creativity, but equally a motive for restraint.
As the Talmud informs us:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Once a person has asked and was informed that a <i>halakhah</i> was to be taken as a guide for practical decisions, he may continue to give practical decisions accordingly, provided he draws no comparisons. But surely, in the entire domain of the Torah comparisons are made! <i>R. Ashi</i> said: It is this that was meant: Provided one draws no comparisons in ritual questions related to <i>treifot</i> [diseased animals which, though ritually slaughtered, are forbidden to be eaten] …<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 130b.</i></small></span>
The Talmud argues that the application of “<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>” is embedded and integrated within the entire corpus of Halakhah, allowing the arbiter to analogize from one branch to another. Upon further reflection, pursuant to <i>R. Ashi’</i>s posture, extreme care must be given prior to comparing one case to another, lest one succumb to a mistaken analogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">This conclusion is reiterated in <i>Gittin</i> 19a and 37a.</i> According to <i>R. Yair Bachrach</i> (<i>Havot Ya’ir</i>), a mistaken analogy is in fact subsumed in the category of a “<i>ta’ut be-devar Mishnah</i>,” an error in black-letter Halakhah, which means that such a decision is null and void.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 45.</i>
While the Talmud employs this type of dialectic in the contexts of both <i>issura</i> (ritual law) and <i>mamona</i> (monetary matters),<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe Silberg, <i>Talmudic Law and the Modern State</i> (NY: 1973), 65–66, cited by Elon, supra n. 35, 111.</i> the Talmud itself exhorts us not to draw an analogy between the two; “no analogy in a manner involving ritual law may be established from monetary matter,”<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 19b.</i> and conversely, “no analogy in a monetary matter may be established from a matter concerning ritual law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 46b.</i>
These statements leave us with many questions. Are there any situations in which one can derive a norm in monetary matters from a norm in ritual matters or vice versa? Is it possible to draw an analogy to ritual matters from a norm in a matter comprised of both ritual and monetary aspects, or an analogy to monetary matters from a norm in a matter comprised of both ritual and monetary characteristics? Can one draw an analogy between two commandments, two rules of Shabbat, two <i>minhagim</i> (customs), or two legal presumptions? Can we compare legal fictions from different spheres or permit a legal fiction based upon the use of analogy? Is it possible to draw an analogical inference when there is an explicit proof in the Talmud but later teachings lead to a contrary conclusion? Can one analogize from the portion of legal thinking that has no bearing on the conclusion (<i>obiter dictum</i>), or must such reasoning be limited to the reasoning essential to the conclusion (<i>ratio decidendi</i>)? In monetary matters, may one rely upon a minority lenient opinion in emergency circumstances, as is the case in ritual matters (“Rabbi X is worthy to be relied upon in a dire need”)? Can one analogize from one piece of legislation to another, from <i>hilkhot mikveh</i> to <i>hilkhot Sukkot</i>?
These questions and many others pose significant challenges to the arbiter as he begins the process of reasoning by analogy. Given the penchant for analogical reasoning and that this reasoning is viewed as infinitely malleable, it is not surprising that the Talmud mandates that prior to invoking an analogy, the arbiter must seek advice from a colleague who is of greater scholarly stature than himself regarding the propriety of this reasoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 109b. Some argue that consultation with “the books” rather than a great scholar fulfills this obligation. See <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, OH 1, Introduction, p. 10. Although the Talmud does not mandate consultation with another scholar for matters that do not involve the exercise of this type of reasoning, some authorities nevertheless require it; see <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 3:93.</i> The classical restatements, including <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, and <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, reiterate this need for consultation.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 20:8, <i>Tur</i>, HM 10; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 10:3; <i>SA</i> 10:2. This requirement equally applies to a <i>mara de-atra</i>; see <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, HM 10:3.</i> Their positions have been understood as mandating this requirement even if the arbiter is free of doubt regarding how to resolve the case. In fact, according to certain authorities, even if he has consulted a greater scholar, he is obligated to confer with him again regarding a similar case, lest he assume that the second case is analogous to the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 109b; <i>Bah</i>, HM 10:3; <i>Perishah</i>, HM, ad loc. Cf. <i>Nimmukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 58b (<i>Rif</i> pagination); <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 14:1. One of the opinions cited by the <i>Hukkot ha-Dayanim</i>, HM 3:3 extends the logic of this position by arguing that if the arbiter is personally confident in the cogency of his analogical reasoning, he may refrain from conferring with a greater scholar; see <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, HM 1:3.</i>
Analogical reasoning coupled with the requirement of consultation with one’s colleagues counteracts the errors of open-ended judgment. Reliance serves as a reason for the arbiter to align his own decisions to prior decisions of other arbiters.
Over-reliance on earlier opinions bereft of rationale equally has its pitfalls. As the Talmud Yerushalmi observes, “All agree that we do not learn the law from a previous ruling.”<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi <i>Hagigah</i> 1:8.</i> One of the commentators notes there:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If one scholar ruled on an issue of Halakhah, one should refrain from determining the <i>halakhah</i> accordingly, since one might be wrong regarding the scholar’s reasons for that decision, since there are many who err in their studies.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Korban ha-Eidah</i>, ibid.</i></small></span>
Thus, conforming to past decisions that are devoid of reasoned judgments must be eschewed.
Even reasoned judgments of predecessors cannot guarantee proper decision-making. As <i>R. Yeshaya ben Yisrael Basan</i>, an eighteenth century Italian scholar, elucidates:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>All these arbiters who stick like glue (<i>to’ke’ah be-devar halakhah</i>) to a particular <i>teshuvah</i> without examining the roots of the manner are not arbiters at all. <i>Rivash</i> of Barcelona … in replying to someone who wanted to rely upon one of his rulings … answered that it should not be used as a precedent because he might have followed <i>Rashba</i> … since Barcelona was under his jurisdiction. And he may have … had his own reasons for deciding in this manner … Not everyone has the privilege of learning from responsa … since frequently their points are statements which do not form a necessary part of the scholar’s ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in <i>Pahad Yitzhak</i>, part 1, p. 325; translation culled from Zorach Warhaftig, “Precedent in Jewish Law,” in H. Ben-Menahem and N. Hecht (eds.), <i>Authority, Process, and Method</i> (London: 1998), 1, 22–23. This position has its Talmudic antecedent in <i>Bava Batra</i> 130b, which addresses the potential pitfalls of drawing erroneous conclusions from actual cases.</i></small></span>
Hence, reliance on precedent should be weighed properly in the course of analogical reasoning.
<b>8. The Prerequisite of “<i>Yirat Shamayim</i>”</b>
The value of reliance is inextricably connected with the arbiter’s concern for <i>yirat hora’ah</i>, the fear of rendering a decision. This fear is engendered in turn by the <i>posek</i>’s <i>yirat Shamayim</i>, his awareness that the halakhic system is reflective of the will of God. The opinions examined during his deliberations are characterized as <i>divrei Elokim hayyim</i>, the words of a living God. Accordingly, “any arbiter who fails to adjudicate a truthful judgment causes the departure of the divine presence from Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 7a. As <i>Maharam Schick</i> observes (<i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, YD 331), arbiters commit errors; this is “part of the human condition.” They therefore choose to consult with others in order to share any ensuing punishment due to an erroneous judgment. See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7a and <i>Rashi</i> ad loc.; <i>Teshuvot Pesakim ve-Ketavim</i> 130; <i>Teshuvot Maharil</i> 127; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 21.<br>It is unsurprising that many decisors recommended that cases being resolved in a <i>beit din</i> setting should be based upon discretion or <i>pesharah</i> (compromise), rather than <i>din Torah</i> (the formal rules of Halakhah), lest punishment ensue due to errors in their decision-making. See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>, positive commandment 107; <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i>, mitzvah 227; <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 24:2; <i>Tur</i>, HM 12; <i>Bah</i>, HM 12:6; <i>SA</i>, HM 12:20. For the precedent for resolving matters based upon <i>pesharah</i> or discretion, see Tosefta <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5:1; Yerushalmi <i>Sanhedrin</i> 1:1; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a.</i>
As a pious individual, an arbiter who engages in arbitrary or capricious judgment must always fear that punishment will ensue, either in this world or the world to come. Nonetheless, the Talmud observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>An arbiter might exclaim: What do I need all this anguish [assuming the personal responsibility of rendering a decision]? To him the Bible responds: “He [God] is with you in giving judgment.” An arbiter should be guided by his own understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b.</i></small></span>
<i>Rashi</i> explains that as long as the legist utilizes his knowledge and understanding, he need not fear punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b.</i> <i>Yirat hora’ah</i> should not lead to an abdication of responsibility. Indeed, the Talmud writes that if an individual who has the credentials to adjudicate refuses to render a <i>psak</i>, the consequence is “<i>va-atzumin kol harugeha</i>,” “many are her slain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 19b.</i>
An arbiter who engages in interpretation, analogy, and logical inference while weighing the import of tradition and precedent is walking a tightrope, but as long as his deliberation is marked by deep-seated humility in resolving <i>devar Hashem</i>, he will not be punished. This is succinctly articulated by <i>R. Aryeh Leib Heller</i> in an oft-cited opinion:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Man is fearful lest he err in anything he may state regarding the Torah, and human reason … pursues the truth and in particular the Torah’s intent … But the Torah was not given to the ministering angels; God gave the Torah to man, who possesses human reason … God said: It is my desire that “truth should emerge from the earth” … and truth will be what the scholars agreed upon, as per their human reason …<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, Introduction.</i></small></span>
This requisite sense of humility is engendered by the simple fact that an arbiter is functioning within a religious legal system, but it is also stimulated by the mentality of “the decline of the generations.” The sense that later scholars are inferior to their predecessors is epitomized in various Talmudic aphorisms:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If the earlier sages were sons of angels, we are but sons of men, and if they were sons of men, we are like asses … Better was the fingernail of the earlier generation than the entire later generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 112b; <i>Eruvin</i> 53a.</i></small></span>
This notion of decline in scholarship informed the thinking of numerous decisors during post-Talmudic times. Extraneous factors, such as social instability and the prevalence of disease (such as during the period of the Black Plague, 1348–1350), coupled with this sense of modesty, led arbiters to describe their historical situation as a generation “enshrouded by the darkness of the intellect and error.” They describe themselves as “dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants,” “orphans of orphans,” “like a monkey vis-à-vis a human being,” and “placing our heads under the soles of the feet of our early ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, HM 25, <i>Tumin</i>, Introduction; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rid</i> 62; <i>Shibbolei ha-Leket</i>, Introduction, p.18; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 169; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 2:5; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 5; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Kovetz Iggerot</i>, vol. 1, <i>mikhtav</i> 32; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 127; <i>Shem ha-Gedolim</i>, <i>Ma’arkhet Gedolim</i>, <i>Ma’arkhet</i> 40:162; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim Sha’al</i> 2:38.</i>
A case in point is the fifteenth century Ashkenazic teachings of <i>Maharil</i>, <i>Mahari Weil</i>, <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, <i>Mahari Bruna</i>, and <i>Mahari Mintz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Yedidya Dinari, <i>The Rabbis of Germany and Austria at the Close of the Middle Ages</i> [Hebrew] (Tel Aviv: 5744), 17–55.</i> These authorities approached early authorities with humility and self-effacement; despite the absence of any general normative obligation to consult with rabbinic colleagues, their advice was enlisted prior to rendering a decision on numerous occasions. This reliance upon precedent and insistence on the need for consultation are further indicated by fifteenth century Ashkenazic rulings that demonstrate subservience to earlier opinions marked by their stringency, <i>humrah</i>, leading one Jewish historian to conclude:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Whenever a doubt existed about the law in a special case and some authority of the past was found who had decided according to the more austere view, no examination was performed, but this strict decision was adopted.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">H. Zimmels, <i>Ashkenazim and Sephardim</i> (London: 1958), 204, cited by Dinari, ibid., 93.</i></small></span>
This position, however, has been found to be untenable. In fact, a review of other rulings of these <i>Poskim</i> demonstrates that they engaged in logic and inference, setting parameters for exercising this methodology and hammering out rulings on the anvil of actual study. More significantly, numerous positions are built upon a leniency, and not necessarily one rooted in precedent opinion. Thus, this period of Jewish legal history is to be characterized as a period leaning toward neither leniency nor strictness.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Dinari, supra n.149, 93–118.</i> One must view the individuality and uniqueness of each case under the prism of critical scrutiny rather than subsume a decisor or group of decisors under any self-inclusive category of being either strict or lenient.
In sum, the arbiter navigates between the poles of precedent reflected in Talmudic and post-Talmudic writings and creative innovation grounded in ordinary reasoning and/or analogical inference, which is tempered by <i>yirat hora’ah</i>. This conception of the decision-making process serves as the rationale for the accepted rule “<i>hilkheta ke-vatra’ei</i>” – in a dispute between earlier and later authorities, the <i>halakhah</i> is in accordance with the later authorities – a technique utilized by many arbiters. <i>Rosh</i>, who programmatically set forth the parameters for the process, explains:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>We consider the views of those later in time to have greater authority, since they were aware of the reasoning of the earlier authorities as well as their own, and they reached their decision on the basis of choice among all views and after fully deliberating in order to get to the heart of the matter. <sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 4:6 and <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 55:9. For a more detailed presentation of the rule, see <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 94, which is authoritatively cited by <i>Rema</i>, HM 25:2, and <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242; <i>Kitzur Hanhagot Issur ve-Heter</i>, 8. Earlier references may be found in <i>Shabbat</i> 61a; <i>Seder Tana’im ve-Amora’im</i>, 25, 50–55; <i>Sefer ha-Eshkol</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sefer Torah</i> 14; <i>Rif</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 35b (<i>Rif</i> pagination). Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 39, 53, 54, who argues that this rule was applicable only to sages during Talmudic times.</i></small></span>
Conversely, if the later <i>Poskim</i> reached their contrary position without being aware of their predecessor’s view, the arbiter may not rely upon the later authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, ibid.; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 94.</i> Similarly, if an opinion is unearthed which was unknown to the later authorities and we can assume that upon examination the later authorities would have subscribed to this view, the arbiter may follow this emerging opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 25:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 3:994; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 39; <i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 152; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, OH 540; <i>Teshuvot Yosef Ometz</i> 73; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 1:119. In fact, some <i>Aharonim</i> implemented this conclusion as grounds for overruling <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>; see <i>Shakh</i>, HM 46:117; <i>Taz</i>, YD 53:11; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim Sha’al</i> 1:56; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, OH 446:4, <i>Bi’ur Halakhah</i>. Cf. <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Kitzur Tokfo Kohen</i> 123–124; <i>Urim</i>, HM 25:22; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 3:102; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 2, YD 105; <i>Teshuvot Kapei Aharon</i>, vol. 1, EH 13. See <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, OH 1, 4:22, who contends that this conclusion is inapplicable to the rulings of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>. The divergence of opinion regarding whether <i>hilkheta ke-vatra’ei</i> allows one to overrule the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> is conceptually similar to the aforementioned controversy regarding the acceptability of relying upon a minority opinion contrary to <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> in extenuating circumstances. See supra, text accompanying nn. 123–124.</i>
How should an arbiter weigh the value of the rule “<i>hilkheta ke-vatra’ei</i>” against a judgment of a deceased <i>mara de-atra</i>? On the one hand, the institution of the <i>mara de-atra</i> demands compliance with his rulings. On the other hand, abiding by “later authorities” entails the possibility that one’s decision may be contrary to the teaching of one’s predecessors, including a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s judgments. Accordingly, it is no surprise that in certain instances, an arbiter will invoke “the place of his master,” while in others he abides by “the later authorities.”<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">For example, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:518 and 2:604.</i>
In situations in which an individual is unwilling to follow a certain <i>mara de-atra</i> or there is no individual authority who has the requisite credentials and personal acumen, it is incumbent to identify an arbiter who can resolve the matter in doubt according to three basic decision-making rules.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 96; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Kitzur Tokfo Kohen</i> 123–124; <i>Teshuvot Maharif</i> 59; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:1. Given the impossibility of determining who constitutes the majority opinion by number, “<i>rov minyan</i>,” R. Ya’akov Emden and Hazon Ish conclude that <i>pesikah</i> based on “the majority opinion” must be accompanied by strong proofs or by logic. See <i>Teshuvot She’alat Yavetz</i> 1:157 and <i>Hazon Ish</i>, op. cit. For further discussion of this problem within the context of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s decision to abide the majority rule, see <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, op. cit., and <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, OH 26–27. However, outside the confines of a <i>beit din</i>, if an individual possesses the proper credentials, he should not rely on the principle of majority rule. See <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Zera’im</i>, <i>Kela’im</i> 1:1. Whether a majority is defined by scholarship rather than numbers would be determinant; see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 32a; <i>Ran</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 4a (<i>Rif</i> pagination); <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, OH 37.</i>
First, one must adhere to the majority opinion among authorities. Just as this rule applies within the confines of a formal pronouncement of <i>beit din</i>, which is predicated upon deliberation among arbiters, it equally applies in disputes between decisors, <i>mahloket ha-poskim</i>, which characteristically lacks discussion between individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Others argue that the majority rule is inapplicable to disputes between rabbinic authorities. See <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 5 and supra nn. 29–30. Although <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Zera’im</i>, <i>Kelayim</i>, sec. 1 and YD 150:8 endorses this position, he argues elsewhere that the presence of a majority view is to be construed as “<i>itmar hilkhisa</i>” – that is, the <i>halakhah</i> has been decided, and one therefore cannot impart legitimacy to a minority opinion even in extenuating circumstances. See supra nn. 118–119 and cf. n. 120.</i> Given the absence of debate, the majority may rely upon a minority view which is strict unless the customary practice or a corroboratory proof supports the lenient position or if it is a qualitative majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 5 (end). This position is an outgrowth of his opinion that majority rule is inapplicable to rabbinic differences of opinion; see supra n. 156. Whereas in the context of the <i>Beit Din ha-Gadol</i>, the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, we follow the numerical majority of judges, after its lapse, we follow the majority in rabbinic scholarship, such as the authors of the classical restatements and erudite scholars. See <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 78; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 32a.</i> Majority rule applies even if the reasons offered by the various authorities in the majority differ from one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 25:2. For qualifications of this rule, see <i>Shakh</i>, HM 25:19; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, vol. 2, HM 3; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meshiv</i>, <i>Mahadura</i> 4, 3:84; <i>Teshuvot Maharasham</i> 5:51.</i> The significance of the rule is reflected in the presumption that if a decisor’s opinion is unclear, we assume that he identifies with the majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">See Ya’akov Sofer, “Regarding the Parameters of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s Rulings” [Hebrew], in <i>Zekhor le-Avraham</i> (Holon: 5762), 67, 82.</i>
If there is no definitive ruling and the controversy has an even number of authorities affirming each position, then one follows the scholars who possess a greater stature or have more adherents.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Yad Malakhi</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 189; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 2, s.v. <i>u’n’man</i>.</i> In cases in which neither of these two rules are applicable, one follows the rule of “<i>safek de-oraita le-humrah ve-safek de-rabbanan le-kulah</i>” – in a matter of doubt regarding a biblical prohibition, the stricter opinion prevails, whereas in a matter of doubt concerning a prohibition of rabbinic status, the lenient opinion prevails.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid. In the absence of deliberation among decisors, one must comply even with the stricter opinion of a minority view. See <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 5. However, if the lenient opinion is that of his teacher, he may follow it; see <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:1. In situations of doubt, a <i>dayan</i> who is confident that he possesses the answer may rule based on his understanding rather than follow the majority opinion. See <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 1:5; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Kuntres ha-Sefakot</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 6, <i>Siman</i> 6.</i>
The foregoing discussion suggests that whether one follows the rulings of a <i>mara de-atra</i> or selects a particular person to serve as one’s halakhic and spiritual guide, this decision is predicated upon communal or individual choice and upon the acute need to choose a person who possesses a certain religious character and scholarly credentials.
<b>9. Concluding Thoughts</b>
The Talmud instructs us:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Upon encountering two <i>Tanna’im</i> or two <i>Amora’im</i> who argue, as did the schools of Shammai and Hillel, one should not adopt the leniencies of both or the stringencies of both, but rather, the leniency and stringency of the one or the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 6b. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, <i>Hut ha-Meshulash</i>, <i>ha-Tur ha-Shlishi</i>, 35. This teaching equally applies to all controversies between decisors.</i></small></span>
The ramifications for adherents to rabbinical authority are clear. Just as a community must refrain from hiring a <i>mara de-atra</i> who will follow only authorities who rule either strictly or leniently on matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharival</i>, vol. 1, <i>Kelal</i> 12, 75; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 1.</i> an individual seeking counsel must be guided by the same instruction.
As we have seen, the methodology of the decision-making process is a challenge and a potential minefield. To traverse this path requires deference to one’s predecessors, discretion based upon a rigorous application of logic and other factors,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">An analysis of these factors is beyond the scope of this presentation.</i> along with “the fear of judgment.” The net result is that any particular authority will communicate both stringent and lenient opinions regarding different issues. Accepting either the leniencies or the stringencies of a particular <i>posek</i> expresses honorific lip service to rabbinic authority but constitutes a basic misunderstanding of the halakhic process in general and rabbinic authority in particular. Recourse to a particular <i>posek</i> motivated by the inquirer’s self-interest, looking for the “right” answer to fit one’s needs, results in a travesty in Torah living. A rabbinic authority is chosen to respond to one’s questions, and that choice entails acceptance of his teachings, whether or not in a particular instance one is personally pleased with the <i>psak</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">According to Hazon Ish, the definition of “one’s rabbi” is someone who one is close to and whose teaching one consistently complies with regarding the majority of <i>mitzvot</i>. See <i>Hazon Ish</i>, YD 150:1. For exceptions to this guideline, see text accompanying nn. 89–91.</i> <i>Hence, abiding by a</i> posek<i>’s lenient rulings and failing to comply with his strict</i> pesakim <i>or vica versa is improper.</i>
<i>Clearly, one may seek counsel from more than one rabbinic arbiter. For example, matters dealing with</i> Orah Hayyim <i>and</i> Yoreh De’ah <i>may be in the purview of one</i> posek<i>, while issues in</i> Even ha-Ezer <i>and</i> Hoshen Mishpat <i>may best be resolved by another.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a; Yerushalmi, <i>Hagigah</i> 1:8; <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242:12; <i>Teshuvot be-Zel ha-Hokhmah</i> 6:29. Cf. <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:7; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, supra n. 166.</i> <i>However, once one has selected an arbiter to whom he will address his questions in a particular realm of Halakhah, one cannot “shop” for another arbiter’s reply due to dissatisfaction with the chosen arbiter’s response regarding a particular issue.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 43b; <i>Teshuvot Mishnat Ya'avetz</i>, HM 5(5).</i> <i>As Plato aptly put it, “God ought to be to us the measure of all things, and not man.” </i><sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Plato, <i>Laws</i>, 716.</i>
Any suspension of our critical faculties as a committed Jew is a reflection of self-indulgence, self-enhancement, and ultimately self-delusion. Arguably, the binding acceptance of a rabbinic authority, all the more so in a liberal-democratic society, is a countervailing force to sustain our character and integrity as a member of our self-respecting covenantal community.

Chapter 2; The Business Judgment Rule in the Corporate World; A Comparative Approach

<big><strong>The Business Judgment Rule in the Corporate World: A Comparative Approach</strong></big>
The purpose of this chapter is twofold. In Part I, we will review the state of American corporate law liability for acts of negligence by directors of for-profit and non-profit businesses. Part II explores whether Halakhah (Jewish law) endorses the business judgment rule for a Jewish profit or non-profit corporation or for Jewish managers and/or directors employed by American corporations. Part III offers a comparative analysis of how the two legal systems addressed this topic by examining the issue of the stakeholder debate and corporate social responsibility.
<b>I. American Law</b>
<b>A. The Business Judgment Rule in the For-Profit Sector</b>
According to state corporate law, directors oversee the affairs of the corporate venture. Whereas the board supervises management and the day-to-day operations and establishes corporate policy, the shareholders vote regarding the election of directors, sale of corporate assets, and approval of the corporate charter and amendments. In carrying out their managerial roles, directors are charged with approving, modifying, or disapproving corporate plans and financial objectives of the firm.
The general standard of conduct applicable to gauge the performance of the directors who actually manage the business of the corporation is “the business judgment rule.” As will be shown, this rule is a judicial creation that imparts recognition and deference to a board decision. It is generally used after a corporate decision has been made and as a defense to a challenge of the soundness of a corporate decision. Much attention has been focused on the proper understanding of the specific content of this rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Harold Marsh Jr., “Are Directors Trustees? Conflict of Interest and Corporate Morality,” 22 <i>Bus. Law</i> (1966), 35; Melvin A. Eisenberg, “The Divergence of Standards of Conduct and Standards of Review in Corporate Law,” 62 <i>Fordham L. Review</i> (1993), 437; R. Franklin Balotti and James J. Hanks, Jr., “Rejudging the Business Judgment Rule,” 48 <i>Bus. Law</i> (1993), 1337; Franklyn A. Gevurtz, “The Business Judgment Rule: Meaningless Verbiage or Misguided Notion?,” 67 <i>S. Cal. L. Review</i> (1993–1994), 287; Lyman Johnson, “The Modest Business Judgment Rule,” 55 <i>Bus. Law</i> (1999–2000), 625; Stephen M. Bainbridge, “The Business Rule as Abstention Doctrine,” 57 <i>Vanderbilt Law Review</i> (2004), 83.</i>
Different courts have defined the business judgment rule differently. In <i>Caremark</i>, the court addresses the suit of shareholders of a corporation against bank directors to hold them liable for failure to prevent employees of the bank from violating the law. Chancellor Allen, writing for the court, states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It was the board’s responsibility to monitor that information and reporting systems exist in the organization that are reasonably designed to provide to senior management and to the board itself timely, accurate information sufficient to allow management and the board, each within its scope, to reach informed judgments concerning both the corporation’s compliance with law and its business performance … It is important that the board exercise a good faith judgment that the corporation’s information and reporting system is in concept and design adequate to assure the board that come to its attention in a timely manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>re Caremark Int’l Inc. Deriv. Litig.,</i> 698 A. 2d 959, 970 (Del. 1963).</i></small></span>
The business judgment rule thus may be seen as a standard whereby the director acts in good faith if he serves in accordance with the honest belief that the action taken or the omission of action was in the best interests of the firm. However, if he fails to set information systems in place, then he breaches his duty of good faith. This holding from <i>Caremark</i>, which defines the violation of the business judgment rule as entailing bad faith, a dereliction of duty, and a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities, is subscribed to by various jurisdictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hodges v. New England Screw Co</i>., 1 R. I. 312, 346 (1850); <i>Davis v. Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Co.,</i> 142 A. 654, 659 (Del. Ch. 1928); <i>Litwin v. Allen</i>, 25 N.Y.S. 2d 667, 678 (NY Sup. Ct. 1940); <i>Kors v. Carey</i>, 158 A. 2d 136, 141, (Del. Ch. 1960); <i>Miller v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co</i>., 507 F. 2d 759, 762 (3d Cir. 1974); <i>Panter v. Marshall Field &amp;</i> Co. 646 F. 2d 271 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1092 (1981); <i>Aronson v. Lewis</i>, 473 A. 2d 805, 812 (Del. 1984); <i>Stern v. GE</i>, 924 F. 2d 472, 476 (2d Cir. 1991); <i>In re Walt Disney Co. Deriv. Litig</i>., 906 A. 2d 27, 64 (Del. 2006); <i>Stone v. Ritter</i>, 911 A. 2d 362, 370 (Del. 2006).<br>As of 2003, Delaware is the state of incorporation for half of all public companies and 59% of the Fortune 500. It should thus be no surprise that Delaware is the primary source of American corporate law. See Lucian Bebchuk and Alma Cohen, “Firms’ Decisions Where to Incorporate,” 446 <i>J. L. &amp; Economics</i>, (2003), 383, 389.</i> Other courts will investigate whether the process of arriving at the decision was reasonable and will abstain from addressing the merits of the decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Graham v. Allis-Chalmers</i>, 188 A. 2d 125 (Del. 1963); <i>Auerbach v. Bennett</i>, 393 N.E. 2d 994, 996 (NY: 1979).</i>
An alternate interpretation of the business judgment rule is that it insulates the director from ordinary negligence as long as there is no specter of conflict of interest, such as a board implementing defensive devices to protect a merger agreement. In <i>Puma v. Marriot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">283 A. 2d 693, 694 (Del. Ch. 1971).</i> for example, five disinterested directors of Marriot Corporation approved the acquisition of six other companies owned by the majority shareholder of the corporation, the Marriot family. In the absence of a showing of fraud or collusion, the court gave full deference to the board decision and concluded that the Marriot’s family influence did not dominate or control the directors in any fashion. This understanding of the business judgment rule has a long pedigree in Delaware law and other jurisdictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Guth v. Loft, Inc</i>., 5 A. 2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939); <i>Bayer v. Beran</i>, 49 N.Y.S. 2d 2, 6 (Sup. Ct. 1944); <i>Lewis v. S.L. &amp; E. Inc.</i>, 629 F. 2d 764, 769 (2d Cir. 1980); <i>Norlin Corp. v. Rooney, Pace Inc.,</i> 744 F. 2d 255, 265 (2d Cir. 1984); <i>AC Acquisitions Corp. v. Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co.,</i> 519 A. 2d 103, 111 (Del. Ch. 1986); <i>Marciano v. Nakash</i>, 535 A. 2d 400, 405 n. 3 (Del. 1987); <i>Mills Acquisition Co. v. Macmillan, Inc.</i>, 559 A. 2d 1261, 1279 (Del. 1988); <i>Unitrin, Inc. v. American General Corp.,</i> 651 A. 2d 1361 (Del. 1995).</i>
A more far-reaching interpretation of this rule was invoked in <i>Kamin v. American Express Co</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">383 N.Y.S. 2d 807 (NY Sup. Ct. 1976), <i>aff’d</i>, 387 N.Y.S. 2d 993 (NY App. Div. 1976).</i> In this case, the American Express’s board decision to distribute shares rather than sell them caused the company to lose over eight million dollars for the purpose of improving reported earnings and thereby maintaining the price at which the company’s stock traded. In an even stronger statement of the business judgment rule than <i>Puma v. Marriot</i> and <i>Caremark</i>, the Court in <i>Kamin</i> argues that directors are not liable for making mistakes, even if those errors result in substantial costs to the corporation and its shareholders. In effect, the holding implicitly gives a green light to the right of directors to hide losses and to report higher earnings in order to maintain the trading price of company stock.
Judicial abstention from review of the American Express’s board decision stems from the court’s enshrinement and endorsement of two goals of corporate management: maximizing profits for the corporation and seeking higher prices for selling shareholders. The courts therefore will abstain from second-guessing a business decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This holding, as well as <i>Smith v. Van Gorkom</i>, 488 2d 858, 872 (Del. 1985), <i>Union Pacific Railroad v. Trustees, Inc.,</i> 8 Utah 2d 101, 329 P. 2d 398 (1958), and others, undermines the position that the implementation of the business judgment rule is unrelated to maximization of shareholder wealth. See Margaret M. Blair &amp; Lynn A. Stout, “A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law,” 85 <i>Va. L. Review</i> (1999), 247, 303.</i> An earlier decision from another jurisdiction further indicates that the business judgment rule operates even where the maximization of shareholder wealth is not at stake.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, some have argued that the business judgment rule has undermined shareholder interests. See Margaret Blair and Lynn Stout, supra n. 8.</i> In <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">237 N.E. 2d 776, 778 (Ill. App. Ct. 1968).</i> the plaintiff alleged that there were two grounds for the defendant’s refusal to install lights in Chicago’s Wrigley Field baseball stadium; both alleged reasons were unrelated to promoting the economic interests of the corporation. First, maintaining that baseball is a daytime sport, the defendant refused to host night baseball. Second, Wrigley alleged that instituting night baseball might cause the neighborhood surrounding the stadium to deteriorate. While these factors were not directly related to the corporation’s economic well-being, the defendant claimed that Wrigley’s long-term financial interests would be best served by continuing to furnish only daytime games. In this case as well, the court abstained from second-guessing a business judgment and held that the reasonableness of the decision is categorically off limits to judicial review. Absent allegations of fraud, illegality, or conflict of interest, the court will abstain from reviewing a director’s decision.
What emerges here is the lack of consensus as to the scope of the business judgment rule and what it purports to accomplish. Nevertheless, the common denominator of these holdings is that the business judgment rule entails a judicial policy of non-review in the majority of cases, rather than a framework for shaping judicial review of a director’s performance.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Michael Dooley, “Two Models of Corporate Governance,” 47 <i>Bus.

The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to rebut the presumptions that the board rendered a decision or decided to refrain from acting in good faith (in accordance with the law), that it was an informed decision, and that the directors had no financial interest in the decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">American Law Institute, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations, Section 4.01(c).</i>

Although the court’s role is to address the rationality of the board’s decision-making process and cases of fraud, illegality and conflicts of interest, there is one area in which the court will invoke the business judgment rule addressing the actual merits of a board decision.

<b>B. The Business Judgment Rule in the Not-for-Profit Sector</b>
Similar to for-profit corporations, non-profit corporations are governed by a board of directors who have diverse tasks, many of which are similar to those in business corporations. As with for-profit corporations, the board is empowered to monitor management and approve major transactions of the non-profit. As we have shown, the business judgment rule serves as the mechanism of judicial oversight for directors’ decisions in the corporate world. Does the same rule hold sway in addressing the decisions of non-profit directors?
Despite certain similarities in the two forms of organization, non-profit directors may have limited business or financial experience; in certain instances, one or two directors may dominate the board, creating a nonresponsive board. This is unlike a business corporation, in which there is an infrastructure of information gathering mechanisms and systems for reporting management operations. Moreover, whereas in the corporate world profits are distributed among the stakeholders, such as directors, managers and the like, in the not-for-profit sector, earned profits are reinvested or earmarked for expenses or salaries rather than distributed among its members. Furthermore, whereas corporate directors are remunerated and accountable for their decisions, the majority of non-profit directors are public-minded individuals who serve without compensation on self-perpetuating boards who frequently either lack the information to arrive at informed judgments or who rubberstamp management decisions.
Yet, despite the difference in the working environments of these two types of organizations, the reasons justifying the business judgment rule in the corporate world have served as the same rationales offered by the courts and commentators for applying this rule to the not-for-profit sector. Aptly summarizing the rationales advanced for invoking this rule in the corporate context, one commentator writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The most frequently cited justifications of the rule include: (1) promoting risk-taking and allowing shareholders to voluntarily undertake risk; (2) encouraging competent directors to serve; (3) preventing judicial second-guessing; (4) allowing directors sufficient leeway in managing the corporation; and (5) permitting more efficient market mechanisms to manage director behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Denise Ping Lee, “The Business Judgment Rule: Should It Protect Nonprofit Directors?” 103 <i>Columbia L. Rev.</i> (2003), 925, 945.</i></small></span>
Though the rule originated in the for-profit world in encouraging innovative and entrepreneurial thinking, limiting litigation by disgruntled shareholders, promoting service by directors with expertise, and limiting judicial scrutiny, courts have implicitly argued that these same values and concerns are applicable to the non-profit world. The courts have therefore extended the rule to the not-for-profit sector and adopted the gross negligence standard as the yardstick for assessing a director’s liability for negligent decision-making.
<b>II. Halakhah</b>
<b>A. The Business Judgment Rule in the For-Profit Sector</b>
The foregoing discussion focused on the business judgment rule as a judicial doctrine precluding American courts from reviewing the decisions of directors and officers of the for-profit and not-for-profit world, provided that they are informed judgments and do not entail self-dealing, fraud, illegality, the absence of reasonable information and reporting systems, an unfair decision-making process, or corporate waste. Moreover, even a director who is grossly negligent will be exempt from liability. In short, a director’s simple negligence, misjudgment, or failure to follow the direction of corporate leadership will not result in legal accountability for his action. The business judgment rule contemplates judicial silence and justifies court intervention only under limited circumstances.
In our forthcoming discussion of Halakhah,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Halakhah is recorded in various authoritative literary sources: (1) the Talmud, the classical exposition of Jewish law; (2) <i>perushim</i> (commentaries) and <i>hiddushim</i> (novella – discursive critical investigations); (3) <i>pesakim</i> (restatements); and (4) <i>she’eilot u-teshuvot</i> (responsa literature) – juridical authorities’ decisions on legal queries of litigants, judges, community leaders, and other concerned individuals.<br>Juridical authorities have at their disposal 5 tools for arriving at legal decisions: <i>midrash</i> (canons of interpretation); <i>takanah u-gezeirah</i> (legislation); <i>minhag</i> and <i>nohag</i> (custom and usage); <i>ma’aseh</i> (precedent); and <i>sevarah</i> (legal logic). For further elucidation of the adjudicative tools and literary sources of Halakhah, see Menachem Elon, <i>Jewish Law: History, Sources and Principles</i> (Philadelphia:1994).<br>The sources and analysis in this section has benefited from Michael Wygoda and Hayyim Zippori, <i>Agency Law</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem, Israel) [Hebrew].</i> we will address whether Jewish law subscribes to this standard of liability for corporate leadership. To address this matter, we need to understand some of the various business organizations recognized by the halakhic legal system.
A type of partnership agreement termed an “<i>iska</i>” implicitly addresses our question. Halakhah prohibits the charging and paying of any amount of interest between two Jews, regardless of how reasonable the rate would be considered in the commercial world.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot</i> 22:24; <i>Vayikra</i> 25:37; <i>Devarim</i> 23:20–21.</i> As such, interest-bearing loans are prohibited. In light of this proscription, there is a technique, dating back to the days of the composition of the Talmud, that allows for the structuring of a loan as a business investment for which profits may be paid.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 104b.</i> One individual, the investing partner (IP), invests the funds which are required for the business enterprise and plays no role in managing the business; the managing partner (MP) uses the IP’s capital to operate the business. Unless stipulated otherwise, all profits and losses are to be divided equally between the two partners. The agreement stipulates that on a specified date, the MP must repay the amount of the loan – that is, fifty percent of the funds advanced to him – regardless of any losses he may have incurred. Half of the profits from the portion of the loan are to be remitted to the MP and half of the profits from the deposit are given to the IP.
Describing this business arrangement, a contemporary authority notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The Talmud calls this arrangement “<i>palga milveh u-palga pikadon</i>,” half loan, half investment. The concept of “half loan, half investment” is based on the principle that each partner in a business is entitled to profits which are generated by his money. The <i>iska</i> agreement entitles the managing partner to receive 50% of the profits, despite the fact that he did not actually invest money into the business. This means that the agreement treats 50% of the invested funds as if they were the managing partner’s. This is because half of the money which was given by the investing partner is considered a loan to the managing partner, which he then uses to realize profits. The agreement also calls for the investing partner to receive 50% of the profits which are generated. This means that 50% of the business funds are considered his. Although he has actually advanced all of the business funds, the agreement treats only half of the money as the investing partner’s. This is the “half investment” portion of the business.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Yisroel Reisman, <i>The Laws of Ribbis</i> (New York: 1995), 379–80.</i></small></span>
The <i>iska</i> agreement most closely resembles the secular legal concept of a limited partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, an “<i>iska</i>” is not similar in all respects to a limited liability company. For example, whereas a secular partnership is vicariously liable for wrongs committed by each partner and employees during the course of its business, such liability does not exist in a halakhic partnership. See Fletcher Cyc. Corp. Sec 11.35 (1996 Cum. Supp.); Haim Hefetz, “Vicarious Liability in Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 6 <i>Dine Israel</i> (1975), 49.</i> In a limited partnership, at least one general partner manages the business and is personally liable for the partnership’s debts, while the limited partner contributes capital and is neither involved in management nor personally liable for the partnership’s obligations.
If the MP decides unilaterally to borrow the monies for his own use, is he permitted to minimize the IP’s return on his investment? Replying to this question, the Talmud states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It was said in Nehardea: Now that we say that it is a half-loan and a half-bailment, if he [the MP] wishes to drink beer from it [the loan portion], he may do so. Rava said: It is therefore called <i>iska</i> [business] because he can tell him, “I gave it to you for trading, not for drinking beer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i>, supra n. 32.</i></small></span>
The underlying logic of <i>Rava</i>’s view is that the IP’s focus is to maximize his profits. The creation of any other ventures unrelated to the goals of the partnership agreement will only dilute the IP’s efforts in managing the enterprise, as well as expose the capital investment to substantial risk. The resolution of this matter is addressed within the context of agency law. The <i>iska</i> arrangement, similar to a secular partnership, equally generates a principal-agent relationship whereby each partner is both an agent to his fellow partner and a member of the partnership is a principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Uniform Partnership Act Section 4(3), 9(1); <i>Bi’ur Hagra,</i> YD 167:1, HM 77:13; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 77:4.</i>
Addressing the above Talmudic scenario of the MP seeking profits for himself, diverting funds from the loan part of the <i>iska</i> for his personal use, <i>Rambam</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Several rabbinical authorities have ruled that if [the agent] purchased the article for himself using the money given to him by his colleague after considering it to be a loan, he is considered to have purchased the article for himself. We accept the claim: “I considered the money that was given to be a loan.” I state that this is not true. Instead the purchase belongs to the principal, as will be explained with regard to the law of <i>iska</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i> 12:7.</i></small></span>
Thus, according to <i>Rambam</i>, despite the MP’s intention to borrow the money for his personal use and divert the funds from the <i>iska</i>, the IP, who is the principal, retains ownership of the money; therefore, any profits accrued from the MP’s personal venture are to be shared with the IP. Stated somewhat differently, the third party who is engaged in business with the MP does not necessarily assume that the MP is the owner of the money, but views him rather as the agent of a principal who is the real owner and will receive the money from the transaction. Despite the MP’s intentions to borrow the monies for his personal use, profits accrue to the IP, as principal and any loss of the capital is the MP’s responsibility.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">R. Shimon Shkop, <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Shimon Yehuda ha-Kohen</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 17. See Michael Wygoda, “The Agent Who Breaches His Principal’s Trust,” 18 <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (2009), text accompanying n. 124.</i>
However, subsequent restatements of Halakhah disagree. As <i>R. Karo</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If someone gives to his friend money for an investment, even though half of it is a loan, he cannot use the money for his personal use and manage the investment with the other half of the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, YD 177:30.</i></small></span>
According to this approach, if the MP, as an agent, acquired an article for himself with the assets of the IP, the principal, that object now belongs to the IP. Should this diversion of funds occur, <i>Rema</i> concurs with <i>R. Karo</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he deviates from the investor’s instructions and states that he is now working for himself rather than the <i>iska</i>, he is akin to a robber.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 183:3.</i></small></span>
In other words, the misappropriation of the principal’s assets is construed as <i>gezeilah</i>, theft, and the agent is obligated to reimburse the original market value of the article and accrued profits to the IP, the principal. <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Pursuant to the ruling that robbers pay according to the value of the misappropriated item at the time of the theft. See <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:1.</i>
Thus, there is a controversy regarding whether funds diverted by an agent from an <i>iska</i> arrangement for his own use belong to the principal or the agent. However, the common denominator of the two approaches is that the partner, as principal, has a legal claim against his other partner, as agent, who deviates from his mandated instructions for his own personal benefit.
In effect, the partnership relationship reflects the conventional principal-agency model. In the absence of a partnership arrangement, how does halakhic agency law address the case of an agent who harms the principal’s interests without deviating from his explicit instructions? <i>Rambam</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>When an agent [intentionally] violates the instructions of his principal, his deeds are of no consequence. Similarly, if he erred even with regard to the slightest amount, the transaction, whether involving landed property or movable property, is nullified. For [the principal] can state: “I sent you to improve my [position] not to impair it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhim ve-Shutefim</i> 1:2, Eliyahu Touger (trans.) (New York: 1999), 556.</i></small></span>
The agency is thus voidable. Should the principal continue to authorize this transaction even though it has harmed his interests, the agency relationship continues to be operative. However, should the principal be unwilling to accept this harm, the principal may elect to rescind the agency.
What happens if the principal cancels the agency? Is the principal or the agent liable to a third party for any losses incurred by the cancellation of a particular transaction? <i>Rambam</i> informs us:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>When a principal transfers money to an agent to purchase real property and the agent purchases it for him without [requiring the seller to accept] financial responsibility, [if it is expropriated from the purchaser], he is considered to have damaged the principal’s position. The agent must purchase the property without financial responsibility, as he did for himself. Then he must sell it to the principal and accept financial responsibility. [This decision is rendered] because [the agent] purchased [the property] with money belonging [to the principal]. The agent must accept the financial responsibility himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid<i>.</i>, 556–8.</i></small></span>
Third party redress is dependent upon whether we are dealing with a disclosed agency or undisclosed agency. If the agent is acting for a disclosed principal, it is the third party’s responsibility to verify the scope of the agent’s mandate prior to proceeding to engage in business with the agent. Consequently, if the agent deviated from his mandate, the transaction between the agent and the third party is nullified. However, <i>Rambam</i> is addressing the situation of an undisclosed agency.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Numerous commentators and legists have interpreted <i>Rambam</i> in this fashion. See Shimshon Ettinger, <i>Agency in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1999), 154–5; Hayyim Zippori and Michael Wygoda, <i>Agency Law: Section 6</i> (Jerusalem: 2006), 16, n. 59.</i> In such a case, if the agent, acting for an undisclosed principal, deviates from his instructions, the actions between the principal and the third party are not binding. Nonetheless, the agent’s actions are binding between the third party and himself. Given that the agent is aware that he harmed the principal’s interests and deceived the third party by representing himself as being authorized to act, he is personally liable for any losses. This position is endorsed by other legists, such as <i>R. Shlomo ben Aderet</i> (<i>Rashba</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:255. See also, <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 42b, s.v. <i>ve-lo</i>; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhim ve-Shutfim</i> 16. See Zippori and Wygoda, supra n. 44 at text accompanying nn. 78 and 83; Ettinger, supra n. 44, 157. For a different interpretation of <i>Rashba</i>, see Zippori and Wygoda, ibid.</i>
The aforementioned position is predicated upon a transaction executed between the third party and the agent without the principal’s material or financial input. What happens if the principal’s assets are invested in the transaction either through the agent’s sale of a principal’s asset or use of the principal’s monies, resulting in harm to the principal’s interests? One approach is that the principal may decide to consent to the agent’s act and direct him to correct the harm. Another approach is that the principal must choose between the two options: either to accept the agent’s action and accept the loss, or rescind the agency and initiate a claim for redress for the harm caused by the agent. However, the principal may not choose both options. A third approach advocates that the agency is void and the agent is personally liable for any losses. The final view is that the agency relationship remains intact; the transaction is binding between the agent and the third party and the agent is responsible to indemnify any losses.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For a systematic exposition of these positions, see Zippori and Wygoda, supra n. 44, 17–24.</i>
Is an agent liable even if there is no connection between his violation of the terms of the agreement and the actual losses? This question is the focal point of a seventeenth century Egyptian <i>beit din</i> decision. Reuven sent merchandise from Egypt to Italy to his <i>shaliah</i> (agent) instructing him to sell the merchandise there. In exchange, it was agreed that the <i>shaliah</i> should purchase certain merchandise and send it to Reuven via ocean freight. Due to time constraints, the <i>shaliah</i> deviated from the instructions and forwarded Reuven a different type of merchandise. Subsequently, the boat capsized and the merchandise was lost. The two sides appointed a <i>dayan</i> as arbiter to resolve whether the <i>shaliah</i> was liable for the loss. His decision was that the <i>shaliah</i> was liable, even though there was no connection between the deviation from Reuven’s mandate and the lost merchandise. Such a deviation is no different than the Talmudic case of the principal who instructed the agent to purchase wheat and he bought barley.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 183:5; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 183:7; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shelihim ve-Shutfim</i> 1; Hayyim Zippori and Michael Wygoda, <i>Agency Law Section 9</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem) [Hebrew], 14, n. 164.</i> This decision is defended by some legists,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashakh</i> 3:66; <i>Teshuvot Oholei Yaakov</i> 45; Hayyim Zippori and Michael Wygoda, supra n. 47, 14–15.</i> but others demur and argue that a <i>shaliah</i>’s responsibility is limited. Therefore, if there is no connection between the deviation from the principal’s instructions and the actual loss, the <i>shaliah</i> is exempt from bearing the loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:179; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 183:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 176:47.</i>
A partner of an “<i>iska</i>,” which is akin to a limited partnership arrangement, generates a principal-agent relationship whereby each partner is both an agent to his fellow partner and a member of the partnership is a principal. Should an agent deviate from the explicit instructions of his principal, even if this deviation is unrelated to subsequent losses, or if he causes harm to the principal’s interests, the partner qua agent is liable for his actions. In effect, agency law serves to define the parameters of a partner’s liability.
On the other hand, one of the other distinctive consequences that flow from this “<i>iska</i>” relationship is that the partner is equally an employee, a <i>po’eil</i>. For example, regarding the IP setting the wages of the MP in the <i>iska</i>, the Mishnah states that the MP is receiving his remuneration as a worker.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 68a.</i> As such, although an <i>iska</i> arrangement is characterized as a limited partnership, the MP is comparable to a worker who has the right to withdraw from the venture. As <i>R. Karo</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If someone receives an <i>iska</i> for a prescribed period of time, the recipient may withdraw from it akin to any worker; however, the investor may not withdraw.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA,</i> HM 176:44.</i></small></span>
Elucidating the rationale for this view, <i>R. Falk</i> observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A manager of an <i>iska</i> is different due to being viewed as a slave who works solely for the investor, as it says, “You, the community of Israel, are a servant to me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 176:44. See also <i>Sma</i>, HM 176:57–58. Implicit in this position is that a manager of an <i>iska</i> is similar to an employee who is akin to a non-Jewish slave, whose “hand is like his master’s hand.” See <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhim ve-Shutfim</i> 11, in the name of <i>Rashba</i>.</i></small></span>
Whereas the IP invested capital in the enterprise and therefore is not viewed as a worker, the MP’s investment of his time and effort to develop the venture deems him a worker, and he therefore may withdraw from the business at any time.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 113.</i>
The identity of the partner as a worker is not limited to an <i>iska</i>, a limited partnership. Regarding damage committed by an employee in a proprietorship, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Professional craftsmen who caused irreparable loss, he [an employer] can terminate him without forewarning, given that they are deemed forewarned by dint of his due diligence to perform his job.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 306:8.</i></small></span>
Irreparable loss is defined as spoiled goods that cannot be appraised. In such a situation, the contractor may be terminated. However, if the losses incurred are quantifiable, the employee is precluded from discharging the worker and may only seek monetary redress from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 306:20.</i> On the basis of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s position, <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> analogizes this norm of an employer-employee relationship to every type of partnership. Just as a contractor may be terminated in cases of irreparable loss, a partner who has caused such loss may similarly be terminated from a partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 176:33.</i>
Moreover, the applicability of halakhic labor law equally extends to any principal-agent relationship and is not limited to a partnership and proprietorship relationships. For example, any rank-and-file employee, whether employed by a corporation or proprietorship, has a right to withdraw from a labor agreement at any time. Interpreting the biblical verse, “For to me are the children of Israel servants,”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra</i> 25:55.</i> the Talmud expounds, “They are my servants, but not servants to servants.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 10a. Regarding whether a laborer is comparable to an agent in every respect, see Ettinger, supra n. 44, 79–84. Even if his salary was prepaid, the employee can withdraw from the job; if he doesn’t have the financial means to repay his former employee, the salary constitutes a debt which must be repaid. <i>SA,</i> HM 333:3. Cf. <i>Shakh</i>, ad loc. 15; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, ad loc. 5–6.</i> Denying an employee the right to retract from a labor agreement would impair his autonomy.
Thus, <i>R. Moshe Sofer</i> opines:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he desires to withdraw from his mandate, the law of the laborer who withdraws in the middle of the day is applicable to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 178.</i></small></span>
Analogously, the right of withdrawal applies to an agent. As <i>R. Yehezkel Landau</i> argues:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>In the case of the agent and the principal … if he wants to withdraw, it is clear that the agent … has the status of a <i>po’eil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahdura Kama</i>, 30:9. The converse is equally true; a <i>po’eil</i> has the status of an agent. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 105:1.</i></small></span>
Given that we are dealing with a gratuitous agent, if he fails to carry out the mandate he undertook, he has committed a moral offense, but is not subject to any legal consequences.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For the scope of a paid agent’s liability for retracting from a job, see Shilem Warhaftig, <i>Labor Law in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1982), 1:22–24, 2:654–720.</i> The agent is treated like an employee who resigns from his work; although possibly exempt from indirect damages (<i>grama</i>) or prevented from employment due to <i>force majeure</i> (<i>ones</i>), he is liable for direct damages that cause irreparable loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Divrei Ge’onim</i> 96:23; <i>SA</i>, HM 333:2, 4–5; S. Warhaftig, supra n. 61, 2:654–720. Should he cause the damages unintentionally, he would be exempt from liability; see <i>Shakh</i>, HM 386:1, 6. If his actions are commonplace in the corporate world, he would be liable even for indirect damages; see <i>Rema</i>, HM 386:3; <i>Bi’ur ha’Gra</i>, HM 386:10.</i>
In short, partnership and proprietorship arrangements are governed by the norms of halakhic labor law and agency law. Agents have the status of a worker and a worker is treated as an agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">As we have briefly noted supra in the text accompanying nn. 57–61, given the particular circumstances of a partnership, there will be situations in which invoking halakhic labor law and agency law may lead to different results. There will be equally cases where labor law will trump agency law or visa versa and define an employee by applicable provisions of labor law or by agency law. This matter is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i>
Based on the above conclusions regarding the applicability of agency and labor law to halakhic partnerships and proprietorships, we can now begin to address if the halakhic system incorporates the business judgment rule as a judicial mechanism for reviewing a director’s decision of a for-profit corporation.
In this context, we will not delve into the question of how Halakhah conceptualizes the role of directors of business corporations (as either owners, agents, or employees). For the sake of our presentation, we will assume the premises of American law regarding these individuals. For over a century, scholars have debated the issue of how to construe the employees of a business corporation. The dominant approach is the view that its assets are collectively owned by shareholders or that the shareholders are principals who employ officers and directors as agents to manage the assets on their behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">William Cary, “Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections upon Delaware,” 83 <i>Yale L.

Despite the many proponents of this contractarian approach, the dominant mode of thinking in corporate law<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">William Allen, “Contracts and Communities in Corporation Law,” 50 <i>Washington &amp; Lee L. Rev</i>. (1993), 1395, 1399.</i> continues to view directors as agents of the shareholders.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Bainbridge, supra n. 64, 6; Blair and Stout, supra n. 8, 290.

Corp. Law</i> (2008), 247, 259.</i> Thus, regardless of which perspective we accept, the directors are either conceptualized as agents or employees of the corporation.
Assuming that directors are either agents or employees according to Halakhah, are the parameters of their liability relating to deviation from a principal’s mandate or causing irreparable loss identical to the scope of responsibility as we described above for partners, managers, and employees of a halakhic partnership or proprietorship?
At first glance, this question hinges upon how one conceptualizes a corporation. Does Halakhah subscribe to Chief Justice Marshall’s description of the corporation as “an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law,”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.), 518, 636 (1819).</i> or is the corporate form to be construed as a partnership benefiting shareholder’s interests?<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See Simcha Meron, “The Status of a Corporation in Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 59 <i>Sinai</i> (1966), 228; Y. Kurtzman, “The Legal Foundations of a Corporation in Jewish Law” [Hebrew] (Master’s thesis, Bar Ilan University, 2002); <i>PDR</i> 6:315; 10:273; 19:9; Michael Broyde and Steven Resnicoff, “Jewish Law and Modern Business Structures: The Corporate Paradigm,” 43 <i>Wayne Law Review</i> (1997), 1685; my <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, vol. 2 (forthcoming).</i>
Subscribing to the dominant halakhic view that construes a corporation as a general partnership, does the system recognize the business judgment rule as a mechanism to protect directors from derivative suits of shareholders except in cases of fraud, illegality, self-interest, corporate waste, and the irrationality of the board’s decision-making process? Given that a director is comparable to either an agent or an employee who is comparable to an agent,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying notes 36–63. For authorities who view corporate directors as agents, see <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:54; <i>Yad Shaul</i>, 45; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Eliezer</i> 2:22; <i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham</i>, YD 34; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, YD 157. Cf. R. Schmelkes, who argues that a director is an owner; see <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, YD, vol. 2, <i>Kuntres Aharon</i> 32. However, his position may simply reflect the era in which he lived, when directors were personally liable for debts. Others contend that a manager is an owner in terms of the laws of <i>ribbit</i>; see <i>Shakh</i>, <i>Nekudat Kesef</i>, YD 160: 11; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, vol. 1, (2d edition), 136; <i>Teshuvot Doveiv Mesharim</i> 1:10.</i> agency law or labor law ought to be applicable.
As we have shown, the provisions of labor law and agency law dictate compliance with the mandate of the shareholders – that is, the principals. The scope of discretionary judgment is limited. Consequently, Professor Aaron Levine’s conclusion is that the halakhic legal system would reject the business judgment rule, which gives wide latitude to corporate directors and refrains from second-guessing their decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron Levine, “Epilogue,” in Aaron Levine and Moshe Pava (eds.), <i>Jewish Business Ethics: The Firm and Its Stakeholders</i> (NY: 1999), 273, 281–286.</i> In effect, from a halakhic perspective, a director’s corporate behavior should be scrutinized no differently than a rank-and-file employee of a partnership or proprietorship.
It seems, however, that this matter requires further scrutiny. What happens if the shareholder instructs the director that he may do any act that he wishes, even if it is detrimental to the corporation and its shareholders? In that case, is the harmful act of the director binding upon the shareholder? Based upon <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>’s ruling, it would seem that such an agreement would be valid. As <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he stipulates with the agent that the agent act either for his benefit or for his harm … he cannot revoke the agency.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 182:3. Such a conclusion equally applies to a partnership; see <i>Shakh</i>, HM 77:19.</i></small></span>
Should we adopt this perspective, it would seem that Halakhah would, in fact, endorse the business judgment rule and refrain from scrutinizing a director’s decision even in cases of gross negligence.
Nonetheless, even the existence of such private ordering between the shareholders and the directors of the corporation fails to give them immunity for illegal acts. As we have seen, while an agent is bound to the principal’s instructions absent an agreement of the parties to the contrary, and is liable should he deviate from that mandate, should the principal direct the agent to commit an illegal act, such as a tort that may entail a criminal infraction, the agent is liable for the performance of these illegal acts. As the Talmud states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If one dispatches a fire to a deaf-mute, an insane person, or a minor and then the bearer of the fire sets ablaze the property of another person, the one who sent him is exempt from liability under the laws of man … Why is the agent exempt? Let us rather say he is liable, since the person who set the fire acted as his agent and a person’s agent is considered to be like himself? [This case is different.] Here, the agent was commanded to commit a transgression [to damage the property of another], and one cannot be an agent to commit an act of transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 42b.</i></small></span>
<i>Tur</i> states the rule:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Just as one is proscribed from stealing … similarly, it is prohibited from injuring your friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 378. For further discussion, see Zalman N. Goldberg, “The Parameters of the Prohibition to Injure and the Duty of <i>Grama</i> According to Heavenly Law” [Hebrew], 1 <i>ha-Yashar ve-ha-Tov</i> (2006), 5. Cf. Broyde and Resnicoff, supra n. 73, 1779, n. 308.</i></small></span>
Given that an agent cannot be authorized to execute an illegal act, a violation of ritual Halakhah,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 42b–43a. The rationale for this rule – whether agency authorization is predicated upon executing permissible acts or whether due to the principal’s expectation that the agent will not commit an illegal act agency was never created – is subject to debate. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 348:6 and 388:67 and <i>Sma</i>, HM 182:2 and 348:20. Consequently, if an investment broker employed by a bank executed an unauthorized transaction, the broker would be personally liable for negligence for any incurred loss. See <i>Rabbanut ha-Rashit le-Yerushalayim</i>, <i>Beit ha-Din le-Dinnei Mamonot ve-le</i>-<i>berur Yahadut</i> 4:265, 268. Generally, a corporate employee, executive, or director cannot commit a violation of ritual Halakhah on behalf of his superior. See infra text accompanying nn. 96–100.</i> if the agent, in this case a director, were to act negligently, he would be liable. Thus, whereas the best judgment rule would immunize in such cases from liability, Halakhah would find a basis for action.
By way of example, in <i>Para-Medical Leasing Inc. v. Hangen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">739 P. 2d 717 (Wash. App. 1987).</i> a company sued its manager for negligent mismanagement, but the court found in favor of the manager. Indeed, precedent can be found in earlier Washington case law for shielding officers from such liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nursing Home Bldg. Corp. v. Deltort</i>, 535 P. 2d 137 (Wash. Ct. App. 1975).</i> In contrast, assuming the allegations are proven, legists of Halakhah would mandate liability in such a case. <sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Even should the facts demonstrate that the actions are to be labeled “<i>grama</i>,” indirect damage, it may be actionable within the context of a <i>beit din</i> implementing the rules of <i>pesharah</i>, compromise. See <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; R. Z. Goldberg, <i>Shivhei ha-Peshara</i>, section 5 (letter sent to Kollel Mishpetei Aretz, Ofra, Israel).<br>Whether the principal would be monetarily responsible for such illegal acts is subject to dispute. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Kama</i>, 64 and 75; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 182:1.</i> Similarly, in <i>Craig v. Graphic Arts Studio, Inc.</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">166 A. 2d 444 (Del. Ch. 1960).</i> the court held that an officer or director is permitted to be employed in a competitor’s enterprise as long he does not violate any legal or ethical fiduciary duty with his own company. Because the officer was a minor shareholder in his company and failed to disclose to his company his real interest in the competitor’s business, the court held he had breached his fiduciary duty to his company. In the absence of such breach, however, the reasonable inference of the holding is that it was proper for the directors to be engaged in two businesses simultaneously; the court’s application of the business judgment rule would have granted him immunity in such a case. Here again, generally speaking, Halakhah obligates that an employee perform due diligence on his job and prohibits the performance of a second job, “moonlighting” that will impede his tenure of employment at his existing job.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Warhaftig, supra n. 61, vol. 2, 330–4.</i>
A distinction between American law and Halakhah is also apparent when the director’s activities entail a degree of lying or misreporting. For example, in <i>Kamin v. American Express</i>, a company wished to increase its earnings per share by employing false accounting practices.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 7.</i> In this case, the court held that the directors of American Express were shielded from liability based on the business judgment rule. In contrast, according to Halakhah, directors, officers, and shareholders alike must refrain from lying<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 105:3; Aaron Levine, <i>Economics and Jewish Law</i> (NY: 1987), 23–24. Cf. those who argue that a partner assumes liability for his partner’s illegal actions such as theft; see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 8a; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 348:3; Zafri, infra n. 97, 50.</i> by way of altering financial statements to either mislead potential shareholders about the underlying economic performance of the company or to influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting statements. The potential victims of earnings management are, of course, the end users of the financial statement, including bond and equity investors, banks, suppliers, and institutional/individual investors. Misleading financial reporting designed to inflate earnings is a form of deceitful misrepresentation; the creation of a false impression, <i>geneivat da’at</i>, in the eyes of gentiles and Jews alike is a violation of Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 228:6; Aaron Levine, <i>Free Enterprise and Jewish Law</i> (NY: 1980), 122–124. One form of deceitful misrepresentation is negligent misrepresentation of financial advice by a broker to his client. See David Schonberg, “Aspects of the Jewish Law of Negligent Misrepresentation,” 13–14 <i>Dinei Israel</i> (1986–1988), 31; my “The Investment Advisor: Liabilities and Halachic Identity,” 57 <i>The Journal of Halacha &amp; Contemporary Society</i> (Fall 2009), 107; “The Multi-Faceted Halakhic Identity of a Jewish Investment Broker,” 43 <i>Tradition</i> (2010), 51; “The Tort of Negligent Misrepresentation in Investment Planning: A Comparative Analysis<i>,</i>” 19 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2011), 141<i>.</i> For contemporary rulings relating to the liability of a bank employee or financial planner who proffer ill-advice on securities investments, see <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 4:265, 12:51; <i>PDR</i> 9:16; <i>Mishpatecha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:34.<br>Although there appears to be little discussion of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> obligations of rank and file employees, directors, officers, and shareholders of a corporation, it is clear from rulings issued with regard to issues of Shabbat, <i>ribbit</i>, and <i>chametz</i> that such individuals must refrain from engaging in any ritual prohibitions. See <i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> OH 1:62; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 4: 16, 18; <i>Teshuvot ha-Elef Lekha Shlomo</i>, OH 238. Although protected by the limited liability rule even for acts of tort (see James Cox and Thomas Haven on <i>Corporations</i>, Section 1.05 at 11, 2d ed. 2003), officers, directors and shareholders are proscribed from engaging in <i>issurim</i>. The same conclusion may be equally applied to rank and file employees. For example, engaging in <i>hezek</i> may involve a violation of returning a lost object or theft. Whether the employee will be personally liable depends on if he owns shares in the corporation or if he is employee without a personal investment in the corporation. In the former case, any <i>hezek</i> is a corporate responsibility; in the latter case, he will be personally liable if he deviated from the corporate mandate should there be an agreement that both the corporation and employee are jointly liable.</i> Decisors of Halakhah would therefore have ruled very differently in this case. While the courts have attempted for decades to define the contours of the business judgment rule by fine-tuning the gross negligence standard as it relates to procedural due care in the director’s decision-making process,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bayer v. Beran</i>, 49 N.Y. S. 2d 2, 6 (Sup. Ct. 1944); <i>Kamin v. American Express</i>, supra n. 7, 811.<br><i>Aronson v. Lewis</i>, supra n. 3, 812; <i>Smith v.

One might argue that since the systemic rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, “the law of the kingdom is law,” is applicable to liberal democracies such as the United States,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See Shmuel Shilo, <i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1974), 109–14, 175–6.</i> the business judgment rule should be determinative even in situations which are conflict with the norms of Halakhah. <i>Rema</i> argues that this principle applies even in cases in which the secular law contradicts Halakhah, and this is the position historically accepted by most legists in his wake.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Shilo, supra n. 89, 147–57.

See e.g., Hershel Schachter, “<i>Dina de-Malchuta Dina</i>,” 1 <i>Journal of Halacha &amp; Contemporary Society</i> (1981), 103.</i> Nevertheless, there is a clear halakhic consensus that the rule may only be invoked regarding civil matters, <i>mamona</i>. In civil matters which entail an element of ritual law, <i>issura</i>, such as the tort matters in <i>Para-Medical Leasing Inc. v. Hangen, Craig v. Graphic Arts Studio, Inc. and Kamin v. American Express</i>, the Jewish legal system will refrain from incorporating the norms of the foreign legal system<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yeshayahu Trani, <i>Tosafot Rid</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:158, 2: 290. See Shilo, supra n. 89, 115–16. See also <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, 2d edition, 83.</i>
This conclusion is based on the assumption that a director should be viewed halakhically as an agent and is therefore liable for his activities. As we noted above, however, a director’s conduct is equally governed by halakhic labor law. In some situations, an individual can serve in the capacity of an employee and yet be incapable of acting as an agent. For example, if someone was hired to seize a debtor’s property on behalf of a creditor, his action is valid despite the fact that his conduct will cause an economic loss to other creditors. Because “the hand of the worker is like the employee,” the action is valid. In contrast, if a gratuitous agent committed such an act, he would be unable to acquire the property on behalf of the principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 10a; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 105:1.</i>
Pursuant to the logic of this position, there are some authorities, including <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, who validate the actions of an employee which entail infractions of halakhic ritual law.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhim ve-Shutfim</i> 11, as understood by <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i>, 2: 110. See also <i>Hokhmat Shlomo,</i> HM 182:1; <i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham,</i> YD 34.</i> These actions are essentially considered those of the employer, despite the rule that “there is no agency to commit an illegal act.” According to this perspective, it would seem that the halakhic system would endorse the business judgment rule and refrain from scrutinizing a director’s judgment call, even in cases of gross negligence entailing an infraction of ritual Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">This conclusion assumes that a director is an agent. See supra text accompanying n. 75.</i>
However, many decisors reject this approach and contend that employee conduct which involves the commission of sin is prohibited. As <i>R. Shalom Schwadron</i> notes, “Many disagree with <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:20; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 188:1; text accompanying n. 79.</i> and <i>R.

See Hayyim Zippori, <i>Agency Law: Section 1</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem, 2008) [Hebrew], 50. See also <i>Mishpat Shalom,</i> HM 188:1.</i> In effect, although a director has the status of an employee, and in certain instances this special status trumps agency law, in cases of violations of <i>issura</i>, such as negligent behavior vis-à-vis shareholders,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Kama,</i> EH 64–65. Cf. others who argue that the rule that “there is no agent for illegal acts” is to be invoked for criminal matters and is inapplicable to civil matters such as torts. See <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 182:1.<br>On the other hand, there is a debate whether a corporate employee who engages regularly in commission of a sin involving his work is responsible for his behavior or whether his employer is liable. See <i>Rema,</i> HM 388:15; <i>Shakh</i>, ad loc. 67; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, ad loc. 12; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:164. Clearly, however, the consensus is that either the employer or employee cannot hide behind the corporate veil and engage in <i>issurim</i>.<br>Even if the employee is a non-Jew and “there is no agent for illegal acts,” Halakhah still obligates the individual who authorized him to perform the halakhically illegal act as responsible for the non-Jew’s conduct either based upon the rationale that an exception to this rule is an employee whose “hand is like the hand of his employer” or grounded in the rule that someone who transfers assets of a Jew to a non-Jew (“<i>moseir mamon Yisrael be-yad goy</i>) is obligated to pay based upon <i>garmi</i>. See S<i>edei Hemed</i>, <i>kelal</i> 49, <i>Ma’arechet ha-Alef</i> (p. 173), s.v. <i>ve-hinei ra’isi</i>; <i>PDR</i> 16:205, 208–209.<br>Similarly, all employees must refrain from violating <i>issurim</i> such as creating a false impression (<i>geneivat da’at</i>), and therefore must disclose all the details of a transaction. See <i>SA,</i> HM 228:6, 9; 231:7. Regarding officers, directors, and shareholders, see supra n. 87. For an exception to this rule, see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 76b; <i>Tur</i>, HM 333.</i> there are grounds for corporate liability. Thus, a <i>beit din</i> would refrain from invoking the business judgment rule and would rule that such conduct is an infraction of Halakhah.
In summary, if Halakhah construes the corporation as a joint effort of partners, directors (and, for that matter, shareholders and officers) are either agents and/or employees who must comply with their individual obligations, agency law, labor law, and the defined interests of the corporation.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh,</i> HM 77:19. Clearly, he would be shielded from the payment of any corporate debt. For the differing rationales for recognizing the doctrine of limited liability, see <i>PDR</i> 6:315, 322.</i> Since corporate law assumes that actual liability will be assumed by the corporation, any deviation by the individuals from such halakhic legal norms will result in corporate liability vis-à-vis the shareholders. Whereas the business judgment rule would shield a director or officer<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 23.</i> from personal liability in these situations, Halakhah, although concurring that there would be corporate liability, would scrutinize their behavior and look askance at a director or officer engaging in improper behavior.
Alternatively, if a corporation is construed as an independent entity,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 73.</i> would the provisions of agency law lead to liability for directors (or officers, managers and employees) for conduct which is a violation of agency norms? Agency law is operative provided that the principal is Jewish and mentally competent. Consequently, a gentile, a minor, a deaf-mute, or a mentally deficient individual cannot serve as a principal in the establishment of an agency relationship.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 188:1, 2; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 188:2; <i>Netivoth ha-Mishpat,</i> HM 188:1.</i> Being an artificial person, a corporation is bereft of any personality and has no mind and no ability to act on its own and cannot issue instructions to a person. Hence, agency law would be inapplicable to a corporation viewed as an artificial being.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i>, 243, n. 8; <i>Hilkhot Geneivah</i>, 112, n. 51, 440, n. 22 (end).</i> Thus, whereas secular corporate law squarely embraces agency law in this case,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Deborah DeMott, “The Mechanisms of Control,” 13 <i>Conn. J. Int’l L.</i> (1998–1999), 233; Donald Langevoort, “Agency Law inside the Corporation: Problems of Candor and Knowledge,” 71 <i>U. Cin. L. Rev</i>. (2002–2003), 1187.</i> Halakhah discounts it.
Nevertheless, <i>R. Blau</i> aptly observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It seems that a manager or an employee of a corporation who is authorized may appoint an agent, since the principal is a private individual and the agent would be bounds by the laws of agency. Even if an individual cannot act as an agent, if he is remunerated for his work, agency law is applicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen, Hilkhot Shomerim</i>, supra n. 102, 243–4, n. 8. See supra n. 87 (end). Cf. <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eger</i>, 3d edition, 112, who argues that remuneration is not required.</i></small></span>
Given that the directors, officers, and managers are employees of the corporation,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel, <i>The Economic Structure of Corporate Law</i> (1991), 91, who argue that directors and officers are agents of shareholders. See supra nn. 64 and 70.</i> there are grounds for shareholders filing derivative suits against them.
Even if one were to contend that a corporation cannot create an agency relationship with its directors, managers, and officers, such individuals nevertheless do retain the status of a <i>po’eil</i>, an employee who can perform actions representing the corporation, despite it being an artificial person. As <i>R. Ephraim Navon</i> explains, “An employee may serve as an agent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahaneh Ephraim, Hilkhot Sheluhim ve-Shutefim</i> 11. See also, <i>Shakh</i>, HM 105:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 188:11. Cf. <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 182:2 in the name of <i>Sha’ar ha-Mishpat</i>.</i> Even though the corporation is an independent legal entity, given their status as employees, directors equally serve as agents, and as we have seen, an agent may not exploit his position in any fashion that will harm the interests of the principal. Should such an action transpire, the principal can advance the argument, “I sent you to benefit me rather than harm me.” Consequently, should the principal demonstrate that in fact his mandate has been undermined, the agency relationship is void and any action of the agent does not obligate the principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 42b; <i>Ketuvot</i> 99b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 169b. While whether the corporation would be liable for any damages depends on the employee; a director, officer or shareholder would be exempt from personal liability. See supra n. 87.</i>
In effect, the implications of the plea, “I sent you for my benefit,” encourage shareholders, as principals, to file derivative suits against their agents, the directors who are undermining their interests. This would not necessarily be a beneficial result, as it would lead to third parties being circumspect regarding corporate decisions relating to themselves, always fearful that these decisions potentially would be subject to litigation and possibly overturned. Additionally, directors would likely become excessively cautious, aware that decisions that are subsequently determined to have been wrong could expose them to personal liability. In short, without a business judgment rule of some sort, the day-to-day affairs of the corporation would be difficult to sustain.
Consequently, Halakhah invokes an <i>umdana</i>, an appraisal of the intention of the parties. There exists an expectation that the shareholders will assume responsibility for all the managerial decisions of its directors lest third parties refrain from conducting business with the corporation. This appraisal of intention is grounded upon the determination that the director’s conduct is assumed by the corporate entity, and should there be any negligent behavior by its members, the corporation will assume responsibility. Alternatively, the assumption of the firm’s liability either is based upon the provisions of the corporate charter or individual members of the corporation obligating the enterprise to assume liability for their co-members’ behavior from corporate assets rather than the shareholders’ personal assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 114a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shekhenim</i> 12:7; <i>SA</i>, YD 334:43; Avraham Sheinfeld, <i>Torts</i>, 362; Sinai Levy, “The Liability of a Corporation Towards Third Parties” [Hebrew], 26 <i>Tehumin</i> (5766), 362, 366. In the absence of such an agreement or <i>umdana</i>, the burden of proof is upon the principal, i.e., the shareholder, to demonstrate that his mandate was “only for his benefit.” See <i>SA</i>, HM 182:4.</i> Consequently, even if the directors or officers engage in <i>issurim</i> such as false misrepresentation, lying, and the like, any monetary claims for damages engendered by this improper conduct are satisfied by filing suit against the corporation, rather than the employees.
The practical ramifications of the corporation’s assumption of liability are that officers and directors will be encouraged to serve a corporation and the corporation will allow them sufficient leeway in managing the business. The legal consequences of this assumption of liability will vary depending upon a legal system’s view regarding the scope of the business judgment rule. According to American law, such liability reinforces the business judgment rule as an abstention doctrine developed by the courts to refrain from scrutinizing directors’ decisions. On the other hand, although Halakhah looks askance at the director’s or officer’s improper conduct and would require scrutiny of their decisions, barring any grounds (such as commission of fraud) for piercing the corporate veil should they fail to comply with basic halakhic norms, corporate liability may ensue pursuant to their duties as an employee.
In short, regardless of whether halakhically we construe a corporation as an independent legal entity or a joint effort of individuals employed by a corporation, they must comply with their obligations as members of a covenant-faith community. Whereas, the business judgment rule will shield a director or officer who owns shares in the corporation from liability in certain derivative suits, Halakhah would scrutinize their decisions and look askance at their improper conduct and mandate liability. Nevertheless, barring any piercing of the corporate veil, any monetary liability would be satisfied from corporate assets.
<b>B. The Business Judgment Rule in the Not-for-Profit Sector</b>
In the absence of sources directly relating to the modern charitable institution, such as a synagogue or Jewish day school, in the corporate context, in order to address whether the best judgment rule operates in the not-for-profit sector, we will examine the halakhic institution known as “<i>hekdesh</i>,” which may serve as an appropriate analogue to the modern not-for-profit institution.
This institution known in the sources as “<i>hekdesh</i>” originally referred to an administrative body which collected animals and money earmarked as donations for the maintenance of and the sacrificial service in the Holy Temple. These assets, which were originally the donor’s, were consecrated to the Temple, with the new owner being God. Although management of these assets was in the hands of the <i>gizbar</i>, who represented the interests of the Temple, similar to the modern corporate analogue,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Berle and Means were among the first commentators to note this distinguishing characteristic of a corporation. See Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, <i>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</i> (NY:1932), 2–5.</i> <i>hekdesh</i> was an independent identity with a separation between ownership and management.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Aharon Kirschenbaum, “Legal Person,” in Menachem Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem: 1975), 160–4; Reuven Ungar, <i>The Law of Trusteeship</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem: 2008) [Hebrew], 13–15.</i>
Thus, interpreting the biblical verse addressing the laws of bailment, “When a person gives his friend money or objects to guard …” the <i>Mehilta</i> notes, “The verse states ‘his neighbor’ – his neighbor and not <i>hekdesh</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mehilta</i>, <i>Shemot</i> 22:6; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 57b.</i> Thus, if a bailment has been donated to <i>hekdesh</i>, the laws of bailment are inapplicable to this asset. Whether, a <i>gizbar</i> would be liable for acts of negligence is subject to debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Perishah,</i> HM 301:5; <i>Tumim,</i> HM 66:67; <i>Shakh,</i> HM 66:126; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i> 122.</i>
Following the destruction of the Temple, many <i>Poskim</i> expanded the institution of <i>hekdesh</i> to encompass all associations, including communal bodies, which perform and/or facilitate the performance of a mitzvah through the furnishing of religious, educational, health, or social services or providing charity to the respective Jewish communities established in Israel and the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshdam</i>, YD 17; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i>, YD 61. Despite the destruction of the Temple, post-Talmudic authorities referred to charitable foundations as examples of <i>hekdesh</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:152; <i>Rema,</i> YD 258:1.<br>Whether a family foundation is to be subsumed under the rubric of a “<i>hekdesh dati</i>,” a religious foundation such as a synagogue or yeshiva board and the like, is subject to debate. See Tzvi Weinman, “A Family Foundation is not <i>Hekdesh</i>” [Hebrew] 21 <i>Tehumin</i> (2001), 238.</i> Dating back to the Talmudic period, there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether a communal association such as a charity fund should be equated with <i>hekdesh</i>, which is an independent entity, or viewed as a joint-effort of partners. Writing on behalf of the Supreme Rabbinical Court, <i>R. Shlomo Daichovsky</i> states, “A religious foundation is a legal personality separate from its trustees.”<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Appeal 900031565-44-1, <i>Musaioff Shlomo Foundation v. Bucharian Foundations et al., Rabbinical Court Decisions</i>, <i>Shurat Hamishpat,</i> 2009, 1, 32. R. Daichovsky cites R. Samson Raphael Hirsch, Commentary on the Torah, <i>Vayikra</i> 27:14; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Ridbaz</i> 1:261. For an overview of the varying opinions regarding this issue, see <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, 524–61.<br>The majority of sources that we cite in this section have been gleaned from Baruch Kahane, <i>Shomerim</i>, 559–69, 1346–8 and Reuven Ungar, <i>Laws of Trusts</i>, <i>Section 17</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem: 2009) [Hebrew].</i>
During the post-Talmudic period, these communal institutions continued to be managed by a <i>gabbai tzedakah,</i> a charity manager. Just like <i>hekdesh</i> during Temple times, when there was no individual who was the owner of the Temple assets, charity, synagogue, and <i>yeshiva</i> funds have no owners.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 36b, 93a; <i>Hullin</i> 130b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:656, 669, 1256; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 465; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:152, 303; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yaakov</i>,YD 67. For exceptions, see <i>SA,</i> HM 301:6. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 31; <i>Havot Da’at, SA,</i> YD 160:10; <i>Rema</i>, YD 258:5.</i> Given the association’s independent identity, one would expect that managers would be exempt from liability regarding their negligent behavior vis-à-vis the organization. As <i>Rambam</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>An individual who received the money of poor as a bailment … and he was negligent … he is exempt … it is money with no determinant plaintiffs.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot She’eilah u-Pikadon</i> 5:1.</i></small></span>
Numerous legists have endorsed <i>Rambam</i>’s posture.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Perishah,</i> HM 301:5; <i>Sma,</i> ad loc. 301:9; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:71; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Perah Matteh Aharon</i> 2:78.<br>There are some decisors who contend that <i>dinei Shamayim</i>, heavenly law, mandates that there is a Jewish-moral duty, to remit funds to a charitable organization for damages, although this requirement is not enforceable in <i>beit din</i>. See <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 301:6 in the name of <i>Havot Ya’ir</i>; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, HM 14; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> HM 301:9.</i> Therefore, should a member of the community of the poor advance a claim for monies, the bailee may respond, “I want to give these monies to other poverty-stricken individuals.”<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzofnat Panei’ah</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 93a.</i> Analogously, monies earmarked for educational, health, or religious services have no determinate group of beneficiaries. Addressing contributions to an educational institution, <i>Rashba</i> notes, “This money has no specific owners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:669; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 222<i>; Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 465<i>.</i></i> <i>R. Ya’akov Breish</i>, focusing on the identity of a bank, similarly informs us that “the community has no determinate owners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 115.</i>
As a result, in the absence of the existence of actual owners, claims against a manager of a communal institution – including those relating to torts – generally cannot be advanced.
Others, however, argue that even though the funds are not designated for any particular individual, once the assets are under the manager’s control, the poor assume ownership.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havot Da’at</i> 160:10; <i>Teshuvot le-Horot Natan</i> 3:116.</i> According to this view, one may advance a claim against a manager who acted negligently.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 130b; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 16.</i>
In some situations, many authorities contend that a <i>gabbai tzedakah</i> would be liable for his negligent conduct because he is construed as a bailee. Assets of the community which are earmarked for a school, synagogue, cemetery, or the like are examples of “money which has determinate plaintiffs”; as a result, the manager has tort liability should he cause damage. Alternatively, should a manager or employee of the organization negotiate an agreement with a third party predicated upon an understanding regarding the association’s assumption of risk, and issues regarding the body’s liability subsequently arise, the address to advance such issues is to the association. In short, adopting the approach of <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, “Clearly, these are community funds, and it as if they are determinate plaintiffs.”<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat,</i> HM 301:6, endorsed by <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 301:10; <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> (Walkin) 1:98; <i>Teshuvot Naharei Afarsamon</i>, HM 3; <i>Teshuvot Shivat Tzion</i> 99; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Tzedakah u-Mishpat</i> 10:8. Cf. <i>Erekh Shai</i>, HM 301:6.</i> Or as <i>R. Ephraim Navon</i> observes, “All the members of the community are considered owners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 16.</i> Thus, in these cases, there are grounds for filing suits against a manager’s alleged misconduct.
Some have explained this position in the following fashion: Generally, a manager is exempt from bailment liability. However, an association construed as a halakhic entity is empowered to control the disbursement of funds and has an economic interest in maximizing the financial integrity of the organization by modifying the recipients of these funds. Therefore, the individual in control who has an economic interest – in our case, the manager or employee – is potentially personally liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Reuven Ungar and Eliezer Miller, <i>Trusteeship: The Liability of a Trustee: Section 7</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem: 2007) [Hebrew], 7.</i> In fact, <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> argues that the manager controls these assets, selling and acquiring the funds in the name of the community charity foundation. He is thus the appropriate address for filing a suit against the communal association.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 149:48 and <i>Bi’urim</i>, HM 149:15. See also <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 149:37.</i>
Given the manager’s liability, however, would a <i>beit din</i> choose to scrutinize his alleged misbehavior? Addressing a charitable foundation, such as a communal charity fund, the Talmud states: “We do not calculate the disbursement of the funds of the charity collectors.”<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 9a. For an attempt to prove that there is a halakhic duty to provide an accounting, see Ungar and Miller, supra n. 125, 8–9.</i> According to the medieval legists, the absence of the requirement to submit a detailed accounting of the foundation’s activities is due to the fact either that the association is busy with hiring employees to service their activities and therefore cannot devote time to prepare records or due to our implicit trust in the honesty of the directors, who would only act properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Bava Batra</i> 9a, s.v. <i>she-ein</i>; <i>Tosafot, Bava Batra</i> 9a, s.v. <i>she-ein</i>. However, should circumstances indicate that the directors are untrustworthy, there is a duty to furnish an accounting<i>.</i> See <i>Yad Ramah, Bava Batra</i> 9a; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 173.</i> Clearly, however, times have changed; foundations are increasingly capable of multitasking, and the presumed integrity of directors is no longer implicitly valid. It is thus unsurprising to find that <i>Rema</i> invokes “the duty to account”:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>To be innocent in the eyes of God and Israel, it is proper to submit a record, and this refers to trustworthy collectors. However, one who is nefarious … must produce a record, and this equally applies to all communal officers …<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, YD 257:2; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, YD 257: 1.

In cases in which the documentation submitted by a trustee is missing information, a <i>beit din</i> will request either the appointment of a forensic accountant to review the records and/or additional information from the foundation.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharach Or Zarua</i> 65; <i>be-Sha’arei Beit ha-Din: Collection of Judgments Regarding Communal Institutions</i>, 74, 115, 270.</i> As noted by <i>R.

There is an ongoing concern that orphans’ assets will be protected from potential loss.

Clearly, then, the halakhic system identifies with the business judgment rule in situations in which there is a need for procedural monitoring of a guardian’s judgment call.
Does the halakhic system equally endorse judicial scrutiny of a manager’s decision in cases of gross negligence as propounded by the business judgment rule? As we have shown earlier, a manager’s tort liability when he is viewed through the prism of bailment is subject to debate. If, however, we view a manager as an <i>apotropos</i>, a guardian, perhaps we can reach a stronger conclusion. Although the guidelines discussed above relate to guardianship of orphans’ assets, they equally apply to managers of communal foundations.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 465; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 366; <i>PDR</i> 1:353, 359–60; 8:240. See Reuven Unger and Eliezer Miller, <i>The Law of Trusteeship, Section 6</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem: 2006) [Hebrew], text accompanying n. 26.</i> As <i>Rashba</i> notes, “Trustees are akin to guardians of the community.”<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashba</i>, cited in <i>Beit Yosef</i>, YD 169 (end).</i> <i>Rema</i> similarly observes, “The community … is akin to guardians of orphans.” <sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema,</i> YD 169:17. For additional sources equating the two institutions, see <i>Hokhmat Adam</i> 147:19, 23; <i>be-Sha’arei Beit ha-Din</i>, supra n. 130, 301–2; <i>PDR</i> 8:240. The underlying premise is that one can appoint a guardian to oversee the assets of adults; see <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 235:6.</i>
The question that remains is whether a manager qua <i>apotropos</i> is responsible for damages caused by his behavior. An individual is liable for injuries that he or his property causes to someone else. Thus, if an ox causes damage three times, it becomes a forewarned ox (<i>shor mu’ad</i>), and the owner or bailor must compensate full damage for the incurred injury. If the ox belongs to an orphan, it is incumbent upon the <i>beit din</i> to appoint an <i>apotropos</i> who will monitor the ox’s activities and ensure that it will not cause injury or damage property. Is an unpaid <i>apotropos</i> personally liable if he allows the orphans’ ox to become a <i>shor mu’ad</i>, or are the damages collected from the orphans’ assets? The Talmud rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>R. Yohanan stated: Payment must be made from the … estate of the orphans; because if … it is out of the estate of the guardians, people would certainly refrain from accepting this office.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 39a–b.</i></small></span>
On this basis, <i>R. Hayyim ha-Kohen</i> rules that if a court-appointed <i>apotropos</i> conducts himself negligently with the orphan’s assets, he is exempt from liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 39a, s.v. <i>de’i amaret</i>. The assumption in our presentation is that a manager of a charitable foundation or communal association is equivalent to a court-appointed guardian, rather than one appointed by a minor’s father. See <i>Teshuvot Shevat Tzion</i> 99.</i> Others, however, including <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, rule that in such a situation, an unpaid <i>apotropos</i> would be liable for negligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">R. Shlomo of Vardon, <i>Tosafot</i>, ibid.; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5:7; <i>SA</i>, HM 290:20; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 72:34, 290:24.</i> Although the rationale for the latter position is unarticulated, it is possible that these decisors maintain that the guardian’s desire to assist orphans trumps his fear of being subject to potential litigation for negligent conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, <i>Rashba</i> mentions this factor regarding public servants; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 5:101.</i>
At first glance, according to <i>R.

Hayyim ha-Kohen</i>’s position to be applicable to only the case at hand, which dealt with a guardian overseeing the affairs of orphans who were minors. In cases of a guardian monitoring the activities of adults, even <i>R. Hayyim ha-Kohen</i> may concur that there are grounds for liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:52.</i> Should we accept this conclusion, there is a consensus that a guardian or a <i>gabbai tzedakah</i> who works as a volunteer is liable for judgment calls entailing financial mismanagement or negligent misrepresentation; he will not be shielded from immunity by invoking the business judgment rule within the context of a <i>beit din</i> proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:101.</i>
In the wake of a derivative suit against a non-profit director, does Halakhah endorse the invoking of the business judgment rule as defined by American law? As we have seen, the business judgment rule in both the for-profit and non-profit contexts is invoked in order to encourage a board to take risks, to create an incentive for directors to serve, and to allow directors sufficient latitude in managing the corporation. Similar to American law, Halakhah endorses the utilization of the business judgment rule vis-à-vis a for-profit board for the above reasons; this is based on an <i>umdana</i>, the expectation that the shareholders will assume responsibility for all the managerial decisions of its directors lest third parties refrain from conducting business with the corporation. This appraisal of intention is grounded in the determination that the director’s conduct is assumed by the corporate entity; it then becomes the communal association’s right to advance claims against their employees.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Maharam di Boton</i> 51; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:169; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:32; Hayyim Zippori and Michael Wygoda, <i>Law of Agency, Section 6</i> (Ministry of Justice, Jerusalem: 2008) [Hebrew], text accompanying nn. 290–295. Additionally, see <i>Teshuvot Devar Avraham</i> 2:19.</i> However, under certain conditions, the <i>beit din</i> will scrutinize managerial decisions which fail to comply with the norms of Halakhah.
As we have shown, the business judgment rule is invoked within the framework of the for-profit corporate sector to determine whether a board decision is rational, made on an informed basis, and is not an instance of gross negligence. Does Halakhah endorse this rule within the non-profit sector? Based upon our review of the norms of <i>apotropos</i> and general civil procedure, the system will endorse the business judgment rule with certain limitations. On the one hand, decisors will agree that judicial review is to encompass the monitoring of a director’s decision to determine whether it is an informed and reasoned judgment. On the other hand, whereas the invoking of the business judgment rule by an American judge will generally result in an abstention from scrutinizing a director’s decision except in cases of gross negligence, a halakhic arbiter will review any and all decisions which entail even instances of simple negligence. However, as noted above, should a review of a decision of a for-profit or not-for-profit corporation mandate an award of damages to a third party, barring any grounds for piercing the corporate veil, relief will be satisfied from corporate assets.
<b>Conclusion</b>
We will sharpen our analysis by placing our topic within the context of the two conflicting visions of for-profit corporate governance addressing the stakeholder debate. One view, nurtured by proponents of political liberalism and possessive individualism, has been described in the following terms:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The individual is not only viewed as independent and separate from others, but to the extent that the existence of God or some other Ultimate Reality is acknowledged, the individual is also viewed as separate from that God/Ultimate Reality … If the individual is perceived as separate and apart from others, the individual’s concern will be the preservation and promotion of the self … The law and economics model, a dominant model for thinking about the corporation and the appropriate role of law in regulating the corporation, is a logical, natural byproduct of this secular view of the person … The secular view of the person discourages thinking of people in communal terms, viewing them solely as atomized, individualized beings … Law here merely ensures procedural fairness, creating a system of equal consideration of the needs and desires of individuals to pursue their individual conception of the good.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Susan Stabile, supra n. 28, 856–8.</i></small></span>
If we adopt the approach, conceptualizing the corporation as representing various contractual relationships which sets the rights and duties of various parties who produce goods or services of the company,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">R. H. Coase, “The Nature of the Firm,” <i>Economica (N.S.)</i> 4 (1937), 386; Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel, “The Corporate Contract,” 89 <i>Columbia L. Rev.</i> (1989), 1416; Stephen Bainbridge, “Participatory Management within a Theory of the Firm,” 21 <i>J. Corp. L</i>. (1996), 657, 663–4.</i> there are no grounds for imposing any additional duties on the firm other than those recorded in its web of explicit and implicit contracts. This conclusion equally applies to directors. Although it is subject to debate whether a director is hired by the employees or vice versa,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Margaret Blair and Lynn Stout, supra n. 8, 280.</i> clearly directors are not under the control of anyone, including shareholders; their activities are circumscribed by contract law and the explicit project approval by the stockholders.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Blair and Stout, ibid., 290.</i> Fiduciary duties mandate that directors promote shareholders’ interests and thereby maximize profits, subject to legal directives which require factoring into consideration the interests of stakeholder interests only insofar as those interests increase corporate profits.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">However, there are thirty states where the law gives directors discretion to sacrifice profits in the public interest. See Elhauge, supra n. 27, 737. No state has passed legislation which mandates that directors maximize shareholder wealth. See ibid., 738.</i>
Consequently, it is surprising to discover that in <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 10.</i> the business judgment rule was invoked, in effect shielding a corporate director who chose to promote social interests instead of profits from liability. Unconcerned whether Wrigley was motivated by public interest concerns rather than corporate profits, since there were no allegations of fraud, illegality, or conflict of interest, the court abstained from reviewing the director’s decision.
Similarly, in <i>Theodora Holding Corp. v. Henderson</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">257 A. 2d 398 (Del. Ch. 1969).</i> and <i>A.P. Smith Manufacturing Co. v. Barlow</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">98 A. 2d 581 (N.J. 1953).</i> the courts argue that directors may factor into consideration non-shareholder interests. Again, absent allegations of fraud, illegality, or conflict of interest, these courts abstained from scrutinizing a director’s decision that did not treat wealth maximization as the sole objective. In short, although the intent of the business judgment rule is to promote wealth maximization, the effect of the doctrine as reflected in these judicial decisions is to insulate a director’s liability regarding a decision which promotes non-shareholder interests.
Rejecting this conception of a corporation as advocating shareholder wealth maximization, there is a religious conception which offers a communitarian vision of the corporation. Developing the image of a corporation as a human community, one commentator writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>As a social being, the person is not merely an autonomous bearer of rights, but part of a community that should be ordered toward the common good … In this vision, the corporation is an institution: (1) that must be dedicated to the flourishing of its employees as human beings; (2) in which the shareholders’ rights of ownership are constrained by duties to others within the corporate community, (3) whose managers must be concerned with the common good; and (4) which … must produce not just wealth, but the conditions under which human persons may flourish spiritually.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Mark A. Sargent, “Competing Visions of the Corporation in Catholic Social Thought,” <i>Villanova University School of Law</i>, <i>School of Law Working Paper Series</i> (2004), 3. For a similar perspective, see Stabile, supra n. 28, 865, 873–5.</i></small></span>
Pursuant to this approach, which has been advanced by religious thinkers and corporate scholars alike, directors should adopt a more expansive view of their corporate duties to employees and consider the interests of non-shareholder interests, such as suppliers and local communities in which the business operates. The pursuit of shareholder-maximization values stems from social norms rather than from law and should be replaced by core religious beliefs which are marked by a communitarian vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">See ibid., and infra n. 168; Lyman Johnson, “Faith and Faithfulness,” 56 <i>Catholic Law Review</i> (2007), 1.</i> According to such a perspective, the business judgment rule properly understood empowers directors to engage in trade-offs between shareholder and non-shareholder interests and undermines the norm of shareholder maximization of returns.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">See Blair and Stout, supra n. 8, 303.</i>
How does Halakhah address the notion of regulation of corporate governance which promotes social interests unrelated to profitability? Does Halakhah identify with “the religious outlook,” which is grounded on reciprocal responsibility, or with “the secular perspective,” which subscribes to the profit maximization norm?
A cursory review of the sources would indicate the importance of exhibiting acts of <i>hessed</i> (kindness) and <i>tzedakah</i> (charity and aid). As Professor Isadore Twersky notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The Jewish theory of philanthropy … has often been discussed … Its centrality in Jewish life and its concomitant importance in Jewish literature … is documented. Many rabbinic statements which stress … the axial role of <i>chessed</i> are frequently quoted … For example, the dictum that “charity is equivalent to all the other religious precepts combined” … A study of the laws of charity yields paradoxical conclusions. On the one hand, it seems that the central figure is the individual … [who] is enjoined to engage unstintingly in charity work, and assiduously to help his fellow man … On the other hand, … Halakhah has assigned an indispensable, inclusive role to the community … Responsibility for the care of the needy – sick, poor, aged, and disturbed – is communal …<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Isadore Twersky<i>, Studies in Jewish Law and Philosophy</i> (NY: 1982), 110, 116.</i></small></span>
At first glance, one might conclude that a religious climate which promotes individual obligations of charity and fosters the establishment of public assistance programs should serve as grounds for advocating a position for corporate social responsibility. The managers of the corporation must address the social consequences of their actions; an individual is proscribed from operating a business solely on the calculation of self-interest and wealth maximization. In fact, Professor Walter Wurzburger, a rabbi and Jewish philosopher, identifies with such an approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Walter Wurzburger, “Covenantal Morality in Business,” in Aaron Levine and Moshe Pava (eds.), <i>Jewish Business Ethics</i> (NY: 1999), 27, 30–43.</i>
In replying to the notion that Halakhah imposes certain social responsibilities upon each and every individual, Professor Aaron Levine writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>These duties do not suddenly disappear within the context of a business entity … Shareholders cannot use organizational structure and chain of command as a mechanism to reduce or abrogate what Halakhah requires of them as principals. In a similar vein, as the agent of the shareholders, the manager must conduct himself with the stakeholders of the firm as Halakhah requires, whether or not the specific situation at hand was covered by his mandate.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron Levine, supra n. 75, 285–6. This conclusion regarding the inability of shareholders to mandate that the corporation become socially responsible applies even according to the decisors who argue that a shareholder is an owner of some portion of the corporate assets. For authorities who endorse the view that a voting shareholder has an ownership interest in the corporation, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Elef Lekha Shlomo</i> 238; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 3:1; 7:26; <i>Teshuvot Mishnah Halakhot</i> 6:277. Numerous authorities reject this position and argue that a shareholder is bereft of ownership interests. See <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:124; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 1:54; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:7.</i></small></span>
It is evident that a corporate environment must be governed by the systemic norms of halakhic business law, including but not limited to labor relations, pricing, selling, advertising, and trading policies, as well as environmental safeguards. However, Professor Wurzburger argues that there is an individual mandate to act with beneficence towards one’s fellow man and affirm local custom which promotes philanthropic initiatives. It would therefore be laudable for a corporation to be socially responsible and fund public assistance programs and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Wurzburger, supra n. 158.</i>
In our view, Professor Wurzburger’s objection to the shareholder wealth maximization norm is in actuality a broader attack on capitalism and on economic self-aggrandizement in particular, reflecting unawareness of the continuous halakhic affirmation of profit maximization, albeit within the constraints set by the system.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Wurzburger, ibid., 29, 42. A cursory review of the following secondary works written in English on the interface of Halakhah and economics corroborates our conclusion. See Yehoshua Lieberman, <i>Business Competition in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew] (Ramat Gan: 1989); Aaron Levine, <i>Case Studies in Jewish Business Ethics</i> (NY: 2000); idem., <i>Moral Issues of the Marketplace in Jewish Law</i> (NY: 2005).</i> Consequently, whereas some proponents of shareholder wealth maximization would argue that subsistent wages and substandard working conditions, environmental pollution, workplace toxicity, unsafe products, and employment discrimination based upon race and sex may be beyond the purview of corporate and shareholder concerns, Halakhah would argue that these matters are required to be addressed and regulated by the corporation.
On the other hand, many halakhic legists would agree with proponents of shareholder wealth maximization that advocacy and funding of social programs are beyond the province of the corporate venture. Participants in the corporate form of business have chosen to enter an entity which pursues the goal of maximizing profits, a legitimate activity. Hence, corporate altruism is appropriate only if it is likely to furnish direct benefits to the corporation and profits to its shareholders. However, funding such projects for the sake of advancing the common good is beyond the ambit of corporate life and thus beyond halakhic reproach. Whereas American law, as expressed in <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley</i> and other holdings, would shield a director’s decision for invoking corporate altruism as grounds for judicial scrutiny, Halakhah would argue that such behavior undermines the corporate interest in maximizing profits and therefore would pass judgment upon such activity.
Without delving in a systematic fashion to prove our position, we can reinforce our view based upon halakhic partnership law. Since partners are construed as agents, <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i> notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>There is an important principle regarding business partnerships: As long as no one deviates from commercial practice in matters that were not agreed upon and one is not negligent in engaging in business, one can negotiate for his partner no different than if it was his own business.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 176:31.</i></small></span>
In short, a cardinal rule of operating a partnership is that it is predicated upon how the partners conceived of the enterprise. If the raison d’être of the enterprise was to maximize profits, then a partner cannot unilaterally decide to embark on furnishing scholarships to the children of employees or donating funds to an educational institution. Such projects undermine the accepted agency law of “<i>li-tekuni shedartikh ve-lo le-avati</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 42b; <i>Ketuvot</i> 99b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 169b.</i> “it is for my benefit that I have commissioned you to act, not to my detriment.” As a partner, he serves as a <i>shomer</i> (bailee),<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA,</i> HM 176:8.</i> and as such, his diversion of funds to such projects without prior authorization is an act of <i>shelihut yad</i>, misappropriation. Clearly, if a deviation from details may subject a partner to liability, a fortiori a substantive modification of the mandate, such as the introduction of social programming, will fail to pass muster. Analogously, a corporate manager or an executive is proscribed from deviating from the shareholder mandate to maximize profits and begin to initiate such social programs. If proponents of corporate social responsibility want to reform the activities of the corporation, they should seek redress and implement their objectives through the political process.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel Fischel, “The Corporate Governance Movement,” 35 <i>Vand. L. Rev.</i> (1982), 1259, 1271.</i>
Alternatively, as we explained earlier, the corporation entails a network of private contractual relationships. As such, should recent legal commentary become law empowering shareholders to initiate decisions which amend the corporate charter and intervene in corporate decision-making,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Lucian Bebchuk, “The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power,” 118 <i>Harvard L. Rev.</i> (2005), 833; Elhauge, supra n. 27.</i> then the shareholders, who are owners of the firm,<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Maharshag</i>, YD 3; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 3:1; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 1:90, 4:54. Secular law clearly views shareholders differently. Should the firm incur any financial loss, the shareholders will be exempt from liability; at best, the value of their shares will depreciate.</i> may vote to approve such social activities.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">However, pursuant to default provisions in many state jurisdictions, should there be a “class vote” of preferred stockholders which argues that such social goals adversely affect them, such an amendment may fail to pass muster. In fact, many charter provisions of preferred stockholders are negotiated and may entitle them with express voting rights. Absent such actions, shareholders are not empowered to commence corporate action and their voting rights are limited to electing board directors, corporate charter approval, sales of corporate assets, mergers and dissolving the corporation. See Michael Dooley, <i>Fundamentals of Corporation Law</i> (1995), 174–177.</i> Pursuant to the amended charter, the directors would be obligated to initiate social programs unrelated to profitability. However, in the absence of such a mandate, Halakhah would have found that the director’s actions in <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley, Theodora Holding Corp. v. Henderson</i>, and <i>A.P. Smith Manufacturing</i>, which placed the interests of non-shareholder constituencies ahead of those of shareholders, were grounds for the director’s liability.
In short, the stakeholder debate has argued that “the religious outlook” inexorably leads one to a communitarian vision and therefore advances the notion of corporate social responsibility unrelated to profitability; the halakhic legal system, although imbibing a religious communitarian vision, nevertheless concludes that the shareholder maximization of wealth remains subject to certain halakhic legal constraints, such as imposing liability on a director who renders decisions which implement non-shareholders’ interests.
Thus, whereas the implementation of the business judgment rule by an American court implicitly promotes the profit maximization norm<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Robert Charles Clark, <i>Corporate Law</i> (1986); Dooley, supra n. 168, 97; Stephen Bainbridge, <i>Corporation Law and Economics</i> (2002), 419–29; Kent Greenfield, <i>The Failure of Corporate Law</i> (Chicago, 2006), 224, 230. Cf. others who argue the rule empowers directors to consider non-shareholder interests; see Blair and Stout, supra n. 8, 303.</i> and serves to insulate the directors and officers from liability for their corporate decision-making as long there is no illegality or conflict of interest, halakhic decisors will scrutinize the actions of directors in corporate as well as non-profit settings, and if the facts deem the behavior improper, will look askance at such conduct and may pierce the corporate veil.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Nonetheless, Halakhah will agree with the American legal stance that judicial review is proper in cases involving the monitoring of a director’s decision to determine whether it is an informed and reasoned judgment. On the other hand, in cases of a director’s malfeasance or making a decision based upon a non-shareholder interest, although halakhically their behavior would be protected by the corporate shield, the limited liability rule, their behavior would be violative of Halakhah.</i> At the same time, unless the corporate charter and/or a statute permit the factoring of the public interest into a corporate decision, Halakhah, unlike American law, will affirm the obligation of corporate employees to maximize profits even at the expense of non-shareholder interests.
As we have demonstrated, the scope of halakhic intervention is far more expansive than that of an American court. In situations in which American courts abstained from scrutinizing a derivative suit based on the business judgment rule, Halakhah would have mandated an inquiry. Whereas in American law, by dint of its secular nature, the scope of justiciable disputes is more circumscribed, Halakhah, as a religious legal system, mandates judicial inquiry of such disputes. As the former Deputy President of Israel’s Supreme Court, Menachem Elon, observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The system (as a whole, which includes the legal and the religious part of Halakhah) is a system of prohibitions and permissions, and the system does (in this sense) relate to all activities of man … There is no such thing as a “Jewish legal vacuum.” The system of Halakhah, by its very essence, embraces all interpersonal and societal relations; all ethical, social, national issues or legal questions find a place within the system of Halakhah … However, the legal world, as our world exists today, is a limited world … limiting itself to those actions that have normative legal ramifications; contrasted with those are the numerous varied activities which are organized in accordance with social and ethical norms that exist outside the legal spectrum.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Jerczewski v. Prime Minister Yitzchak Shamir</i>, 45(1) <i>Piskei Din</i> of <i>Beit Mishpat Elyon</i> (1991), 749.</i></small></span>
We can sharpen our conclusion by adopting a jurisprudential framework suggested by a contemporary legal scholar of corporate law. He distinguishes between legal norms and social norms:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>I use the term social norm to mean all rules and regularities concerning human conduct other than legal rules and organizational rules. By legal rules, I mean the principles and rules of a legal system. By organizational rules, I mean formal rules adopted by private organizations … I now turn now to the role of social norms in corporate law. I use the term corporate law here in a broad but standard sense to mean those areas of conduct that are within the scope of corporate law … Often, the operation of social norms is at or near the surface of corporate law. For example, some corporate law doctrines explicitly ­incorporate social norms. Thus, the ALI’s Principles of Corporate Governance provides that a corporation may take into account ethical considerations, even if corporate profit and shareholder are not thereby enhanced.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Melvin Eisenberg, “Corporate Law, Social Norms and Belief Systems,” <i>Berkeley Program in Law and Economics</i>, <i>Working Paper Series</i> (1999), 1, 4, 20.</i></small></span>
Applying this framework, our focus here is the factoring of non-shareholder interests in a corporate director’s decision, which is an illustration of social norm that is not explicitly incorporated into corporate legal rules. Clearly, a director is not obligated to promote public interest at the expense of shareholder profits. On the one hand, the corporation conceived as a nexus of agreements entailing legally enforceable promises is governed by legal rules. However, on the other hand, these reciprocal arrangements do not mandate compliance with social norms, such as the promotion of non-shareholder interests.
The stakeholder debate involves a debate regarding whether to adopt a social norm into corporate life. In other words, what is the goal of the corporation – the pursuit of profits or the pursuit of social needs unrelated to wealth maximization? Due to the dispute regarding the incorporation of a social norm into the corporate world, the court in <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley</i> abstained from addressing this matter. A secular court will only address issues of noncompliance with legal rules, such as fraud, or certain potential non-compliance with legal rules, such as conflicts of interests and uninformed corporate decisions. Other social norms are beyond the purview of the court, and the business judgment rule is therefore invoked regarding such matters. On the other hand, Halakhah, as a religious legal system, advances a more expansive conception of legality. Thus, certain activities which may be labeled as social norms in a secular system, and are therefore considered non-justiciable, will be viewed by Halakhah as legal norms, and their infraction will therefore be subject to legal scrutiny and possible sanction.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">For grounds for piercing of the corporate veil, see <i>Teshuvot Mishnah Halakhot</i> 6:277; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i>, vol. 8, HM 306; File No. 379/63, <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i>, <i>helek</i> 9, 419. Implicit in halakhic corporate piercing is the notion that the corporate network including but not limited to managers and employees are personally liable for certain halakhic infractions such as negligent misrepresentation. In other words, even if one assumes that a corporation is halakhically an artificial being, liability resides with the members of the corporate network even though they are not the owners of the business. See <i>SA</i> HM 395:1.</i>

Chapter 3; Recovery for Infliction of Emotional Distress; Toward Relief for the Agunah

<big><strong>Recovery for Infliction of Emotional Distress: Toward Relief for the <i>Agunah</i></strong></big>
In 1994, Avraham and Sarah Cohen were married in accordance with the Halakhah. Children were born to them. After five years of marriage, tensions between the spouses began to surface, and the couple began to live separately under the same roof. Though the wife desired to engage in conjugal relations with her spouse, her husband willfully and unjustifiably refused to engage in sexual relations with her. For the sake of their children, both husband and wife remained outwardly married, but in actuality lived separately in the marital home for five years.
Given the moribund state of her marriage, in 2004 Sarah Cohen sought a bill of divorce (<i>get</i>) from Avraham Cohen, her husband of ten years. Both spouses, being observant American Jews, considered them­selves bound as much by Jewish as by civil law. Both appeared before a <i>beit din</i>, a rabbinical court, and it was resolved that it was proper that the parties divorce. However, the husband initially refused to give his wife a bill of divorce. According to the Halakhah (Jewish law), dissolution of the matrimonial bond requires the voluntary agreement of both spouses, and failure of one party to assent to the divorce action precludes execution of the divorce. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> produces a divorce that is arguably invalid (<i>get me’useh</i>)<i>.</i> Without a valid divorce or rabbinic dispensation (in the case of a recalcitrant wife), neither party may remarry without violating the norms of Halakhah.
As a result, in the case at hand, the wife became an <i>agunah</i>, a “chained woman,” unable to remarry because of her husband’s refusal to grant her a <i>get</i>. If she remarries without having received a <i>get</i> from her husband, she is, in the eyes of Halakhah, an adulteress. Any children born to her from a new relationship will be <i>mamzerim</i>, that is, offspring of a prohibited sexual relationship, and thus unable to marry most other Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:4; <i>Hilkhot Issurei Bi’ah</i> 15:7, 21; Ben Tzion Schereschewsky, “Divorce,” in M. Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem: 1975), 414–15. A <i>mamzer</i> may marry another <i>mamzer</i> or a convert.<br>Once a <i>beit din</i> issues a divorce judgment, can a husband stipulate that he will grant a <i>get</i> upon the <i>beit din</i>’s resolution of certain financial matters regarding their marriage? This issue is beyond the scope of our presentation; however, according to one position, which is adopted by numerous <i>batei din</i>, such a request will be entertained. Hence, only once all the financial issues have been addressed by the <i>beit din</i> does the husband become obligated to grant his wife a <i>get</i>. Should there be any delay in addressing and resolving these issues due to the husband’s intentional stonewalling of the process, as will be shown in our presentation, the <i>beit din</i> may assess damages for the wife’s emotional stress for withholding conjugal relations during this period of the husband’s recalcitrance. Pursuant to the other view, the <i>get</i> must be delivered immediately upon the issuance of a divorce judgment. Therefore, should the husband procrastinate due to certain outstanding financial issues relating to the marriage, he will be deemed a recalcitrant husband from that the date of the issuance of a divorce judgment by a <i>beit din</i>, and therefore subject to damages for his wife’s mental anguish. For a lively exchange regarding this matter, see R. Menashe Klein and R. Shimon Ya’acobi, Esq., “The Giving of a <i>Get</i> and Financial Arrangements: Which Precedes the Other?” [Hebrew], 22 <i>Tehumin</i> (5762), 157.

Outraged and emotionally distraught due to her husband’s intolerable behavior during their marriage, Sarah Cohen wants to file a rabbinical court claim against her husband for the infliction of emo­tional distress during the five years of separation prior to the court’s directive recommending divorce. Her experience of mental anguish, she argues, was not the ordinary stress attendant on living in an imperfect world, but severe mental injury. Despite her emotional dis­tress, however, she never utilized the services of a therapist, and thus did not submit a claim for therapeutic expenses. Although not a victim of spousal violence, her husband’s insensitivity to her feelings and outrageous behavior inflicted severe emotional distress, she argues, and this distress ought to be sufficient grounds for recovery of dam­ages.

Can a psychologically-injured person recover damages when no physical harm accompanies the mental anguish? Prior to the granting of a <i>get</i>, can this <i>agunah</i> submit a claim against her husband in a rab­binical court for the period of their marriage during which she was precluded from engaging in conjugal relations, or might such a course of action be taken as constituting a form of duress that could taint any subsequent <i>get</i>?
In the absence (to the best of my knowledge) of any <i>hiddushin</i> (­novella), <i>sefer psak</i> (restatement), <i>teshuvah</i> (responsum,) or <i>psak din</i> (published rabbinical court ruling) addressing this question, deciding between competing arguments is the decisor’s prerogative. As I will show, a fourteenth century <i>teshuvah</i> (responsum) by <i>R. Yitzhak ben Sheshet</i> (<i>Rivash</i>) recognizes such a claim in a ruling authoritatively cited by <i>Rema</i>. I will show that a present-day rab­binical court’s authority to address the claim of spousally-inflicted emotional distress can be grounded in various codified rulings and numerous <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa) that address defamation of character and broken engagements, particularly a 1965 rabbinical court decision handed down by <i>R. Yosef Elyashiv</i>, widely acknowledged to be one of the generation’s greatest Torah scholars. To establish the legitimacy of accepting a wife’s claim for damages due to emotional distress without running afoul of the strictures against coerced divorce (<i>get me’useh</i>), the positions of <i>R. Shlomo Daichovsky, R. Elyashiv, R. Moshe Feinstein,</i> and <i>R. Shilo Rafael</i> will be adduced. The spectrum of views on this matter attests to the vibrancy of the halakhic process, which does not require us to gloss over differences and force disparate approaches into a Procrustean bed for the sake of forging a neat, coherent, and per­suasive position. This article will examine the relative strength, effectiveness, and plausibility of each argument applicable to our case, in the hope that these arguments will be tested within the framework of future rabbinical court decisions.
How does the Halakhah address liability for mental anguish in gen­eral, and its emergence due to a husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations in particular? With these questions in mind, let us consider the following passage from Tractate <i>Kilayim</i> of the Talmud Yerushalmi:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If the owner struck opposite the eye [of his Canaanite slave] and blinded him, opposite the ear and deafened him, the slave does not go free … The slave could have escaped [before the blow]. The proof that this is correct is that it is stated: If he held him [preventing him from escaping], he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi <i>Kilayim</i> 8:2. See I. Haut, “Recovery for Fright, Shock and Emotional Dis­tress under Jewish Law and Some Comparisons to Common Law,” 14 <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (2003), 121, 129.</i></small></span>
The rule of non-liability in the case of fright and shock is predicated on the fact that the slave did not attempt to escape the consequences of the blow. As such, if he is held down by the injurer (<i>mazik</i>) and cannot escape the blow’s impact, the injurer is liable. Commenting on this passage, <i>R. Moshe Margaliot</i> concludes that if the owner holds him and frightens him, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pnei Moshe</i>, ibid., s.v. <i>teida she-hu ken.</i> In fact, Yerushalmi <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6 provides for recovery for embarrassment (absent physical impact) if the injured party is a great scholar. Such a provision is not found in the Bavli.</i> In his opinion, although frightening is equiva­lent to physically holding him down, liability for the ensuing mental anguish is incurred only if the injurer holds down the slave, and not if he merely frightens him. <i>R. Meir Halevi Abulafia</i> (<i>Rama</i>), disagrees, arguing that if the injury could not have been prevented, there is liabil­ity for fright and shock even absent direct physical contact.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91a, s.v. <i>u-le-inyan psak.</i></i>
On the other hand, the Talmud Bavli states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Come and hear. If he hit him in the eye and blinded him or on his ear and deafened him, the slave goes out free thereby. If he struck an object that was opposite his eye and blinded him [e.g., pounded on the wall opposite the slave’s eye, causing him to become blind] or if he struck an object that was opposite his ear and deafened him, he does not go out free. Is not the reason for this rule that assessment [of the plausibility that injury was caused by the blow] is required [and it is assumed that the said activity might not have caused the injury to the slave]? No. The absence of tort liability is predicated on the fact that he [the slave] frightened himself. As it was taught: If one frightens another, he is not liable by the law of man, but he is liable by the law of heaven. If he blew [with a trumpet or the like] into his ear and made him deaf, he is not liable. But if he held him and blew into his ear, and made him deaf, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 91a; see also <i>Bava Kama</i> 56a; <i>Kiddushin</i> 24b. The disparate approaches of the two Talmuds are noted in <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 6:5.</i></small></span>
Absent physical contact and physical damage, one who frightens another does not thereby incur liability. Relying on the Talmudic rationale that the one who is frightened is a rational person and scared himself, <i>Rif</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rif</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 9a.</i> <i>Ran</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 9a, s.v. <i>keivan de-bar da’at</i>.</i> <i>Rashi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 24b, s.v. <i>shani adam</i>.</i> <i>R.

Feinstein</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 1:98.</i> all conclude that every indi­vidual who ventures out into the world assumes the risk of injury, exposes himself to unexpected trauma,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Though this rationale is offered by <i>Rama</i>, as quoted in <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 277, nevertheless, as the <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91a, s.v. <i>lo</i> aptly note, Tosefta <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:26 contends that non-liability for mental anguish in the absence of physical impact is rooted in a <i>gezeirat ha-katuv</i>, i.e., a Torah decree, and is not due to the victim’s lack of self-control.</i> and should try to be more thick-skinned rather than burden others with responsibility for his emotional weaknesses; failure to inure oneself to the routine stresses of existence bars recovery for any ensuing psychological injury. Translating this position into contemporary legal terminology, non-liability is due to contributory negligence. Hence, unless the fright and shock was caused by physical impact, the injurer is exempt from liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 56a, s.v. <i>ha-mavit</i>; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 2:7; <i>Tur</i>, HM 420:22; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:25.</i> <i>Maharshal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:38.</i> and <i>Ra’avad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ra’abad</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> (Atlas edition), 223.</i> argue that the fright and shock could not have caused the injury, since the generally accepted assessment (<i>omed</i>) is that that fright and shock do not suffice to cause emotional scarring. Others, such as <i>Rosh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 2:17.</i> <i>Tur</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tur</i>, n. 13 above.</i> <i>Mordekhai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91a, sec. 95.</i> and <i>R. Meir mi-Rotenburg</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Prague edition) 300.</i> argue that there is no liabil­ity for an injury that is caused indirectly. In Talmudic parlance, this is a case of <i>gerama</i>, and the principle is, “<i>gerama be-nezikin patur</i>” – that is, there is no liability for indirectly-caused damage.
What emerges, then, from the Talmud Bavli is that non-liability for emotional stress is based on one of the following rationales: It falls into the category of <i>gerama;</i> there is no connection between the act and the injury; one must exercise emotional self-control with regard to the stresses of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For an elucidation of these views, see Haut, supra n. 2, 121.</i> A minority view, reflected in Yerushalmi <i>Kilayim</i> and <i>Rema</i>’s position, claims that even without physical contact, there may be liability for emotional stress.
The common denominator of all these approaches is that shouting that engenders fright and shock in and of itself is an act (<i>ma’aseh</i>) that generates legal liability if accompanied by physical contact. In the absence of physical contact, the act of shouting only generates liability for fright and shock according to the laws of heaven. Hence, although a husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations with his spouse may generate feelings of emotional stress, the absence of an act causing these feelings precludes liability even according to the laws of heaven. Thus, with respect to indirect injury (<i>garmi/gerama</i>), the strict law of damages does not mandate recovery for emotional stress.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Liability by the law of heaven for indirectly-caused damage is predi­cated on an act’s having been carried out; see <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:114; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 509. Hence, absent any act, there are no grounds for putting forward a claim. However, it could be argued that a claim could be put forward by adducing other principles relevant to damages, such as “indiscernible damage” (<i>hezek she-eino nikar</i>)<i>.</i></i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small><b>II.</b></small></span>
Having discussed the black-letter law concerning damages, and having attempted to delineate the rules governing recovery for mental anguish, let us consider another dimension of recovery for mental anguish. Though the Halakhah mandates that those who decide legal questions do so in compliance with rules rather than on the basis of whim or bias, it countenances and indeed encourages the exercise of judicial discretion. Judicial discretion, a familiar notion in both hala­khic and western legal thought, can be defined as the judge’s “power to choose between two or more courses of action each of which is thought of as permissible.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Henry Hart, Jr. and Albert Sacks, <i>The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law</i> (Cambridge, MA: 1958), 162. See also Aharon Barak, <i>Judicial Discretion</i> (New Haven: 1989), 7–9.</i>
Addressing this second layer of halakhic law of damages, Professor Aaron Schreiber declares:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Halakhah, with its emphasis on rules, might mistakenly be understood as being positivistic and ignoring policy. It might be thought that a legal decision, especially by a court or other religious legal authority, is (and should be) reached on any issue of law simply by determining the applic­able legal doctrines and principles. These would then be analyzed logic­ally and deductions would be made therefrom until a “legal” decision would be reached. The legal decision would be dictated solely by the application of deductive logic to these <i>a priori</i> legal rules and principles, without regard to policy … Policy, societal conditions and context would be overtly ignored.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Aharon Schreiber, “Positivism, Policy, Morality and Discretion in Jewish law,” 19 <i>Dine Israel</i> (5757/5758), 5, 9.</i></small></span>
In fact, however, as we will show, the decisors sought to address the issue of recovery for emotional stress by moving beyond the formal rules of damages and invoking the arbiter’s discretionary capacity, and specifically the capacity to exercise “emergency powers.”
Compensation is paid to an injured party for five elements of dam­age: <i>nezek</i> (loss of capacity to work), <i>tza’ar</i> (pain), <i>ripui</i> (“healing,” medical expenses), <i>shevet</i> (loss of income during convalescence), and <i>boshet</i> (shame and embarrassment) — as assessed by the arbiter. Imposition of these payments is conditional on the injury’s having been caused by a physical act.
Prior to the mid-fourth century CE, arbiters who had received ordination (<i>semikhah</i>, “the laying on of hands”) were authorized to resolve both ritual and civil matters, including damages by individuals. After the lapse of the ordination process, non-ordained arbiters, namely, community leaders and lay arbiters (<i>beit din shel hedyotot</i>), were granted authority to resolve cases involving common injuries that caused the injured party a financial loss. However, the compensation for such bodily injuries that could be imposed by the said arbiters was limited to two elements – loss of income and medical expenses.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 1:1–2; <i>Bah</i>, HM 1; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 1:7. Cf. <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:2.</i> By law, then, claims of liability due to shame and embarrassment (<i>boshet</i>), for example, though arising from bodily damage ensuing from a physical act,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 83:1. In cases of assault in which no injury resulted, there may be liability for <i>boshet</i>, but there is no legal liability in the absence of a physical act of assault; see <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6; <i>Rema</i>, HM 420:43.</i> could not be submitted to a non-ordained arbiter for adjudication, since there was no loss of income.
Although certain matters are excluded from the jurisdiction of non-ordained arbiters, nevertheless, pursuant to normative Halakhah, ordained and non-ordained arbiters are empowered to exercise exi­gency jurisdiction both in matters of civil damages, such as <i>boshet</i>, and in matters involving capital punishment,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:612; 3: 109; <i>SA</i>, HM 2:1; <i>Rema</i>, HM 2:1. Numerous responsa that take this position are cited in Aharon Schreiber, <i>Jewish Law and Decision-Making: A Study through Time</i> (Philadelphia: 1979). However, cf. <i>Nimmukei Yosef</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 96b, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 52a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 46a; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, HM 2:2, which maintain that given the demise of ordination, the court’s jurisdiction is limited to imposing non-capital punishment.</i> under the Talmudic rubrics of “<i>beit din makin ve-onshin she-lo min ha-din</i>” (a court may mete out punishment not prescribed by the Torah),<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 90b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 46a.</i> “<i>le-migdar milta</i>” (protective measures),<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 90b.</i> and “<i>ha-sha’ah tzerikhah le-kakh</i>” (the times demand it).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. The phrase “<i>hora’at sha’ah</i>” (temporary measure) is often invoked in such a situation; see Menachem Elon, <i>Jewish Law: History</i>, <i>Sources</i>, <i>Principles</i> (Philadelphia: 1994), 533–6; H. Ben-Menahem, <i>Judicial Deviation in Talmudic Law</i> (Chur, Switzerland: 1991), 173–9.</i> The arbiters’ punitive powers are not limited to criminal matters, then, but encompass civil matters as well. To promote broader policy goals, arbiters are authorized, in certain circumstances, to deviate from the letter of the law and impose actual and/or punitive damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">There is ongoing debate among contemporary scholars as to whether this extra-halakhic capacity is legislative or judicial in nature. My view is that the latter approach is the correct one; see H. Ben-Menahem, ibid., 146–8. Cf. Menachem Elon, ibid., 515.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Some of the basic policy goals in Halakhah as expressed in broad classifications at a high level of abstraction, are: to bring the spirituality and holiness to God down to earth and, through operative principles, to incul­cate them into mundane matters and conduct in the finite world; to sanc­tify God’s name … to preserve life and the law … to act for the benefit of individuals and society, by not harming them and making life pleasant; to preserve modesty and morality … to improve society by correcting inequities … to maintain public order …<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Schreiber, supra n. 23, 10. See also J. David Bleich, <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</i> (NY: 1995), vol. 4, xv–xix.</i></small></span>
Granting the arbiter discretion allows his decisions to be shaped by the aforementioned goals. In effect, the halakhic system encompasses exigency law, a juristic technique for effectively resolving problems for which the strict law has no efficient solution, so that the covenantal faith community’s basic objectives can be realized.
But what constitutes an “exigency situation?” Three approaches to its definition can be found in the writings of the Later Authorities:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Falk,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, HM 2:2.</i> in his commentary on Karo, attempts to delineate express guide­lines. He states if all the people are not dissolute as to certain matters, an individual may not be punished under this authority unless he is a habit­ual wrongdoer … Shakh<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, HM 2:2.</i> views this analysis as an appropriate restate­ment of the principles as derived from the Talmud and as codified by the <i>Tur</i>. Falk’s approach is cited with approval by … Netivot,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>SA</i>, HM 2:1.</i> and Beer Hagola.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be’er ha-Golah</i>, SA, HM 2.</i><br>Shaar Ephraim<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i> 72.</i> … held that only if many people in the community are engaging in this type of conduct may an individual be punished.<br>This opinion … is in conflict with the holding of Falk and Maharam.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Lublin</i> 138. See also <i>Kenneset ha-Gedolah</i>, HM 2:2.</i> For Falk holds that even where the majority of the people are not dissolute, if the individual is dissolute he may be punished by the court invoking its extrajudicial power. And Maharam holds that even if the community is not dissolute or the individual is not dissolute, if a court feels that failure to punish this person may cause other people to feel that they might act in a similar manner with impunity, the court may impose extrajudicial sanc­tions on the individual. In short, as enunciated by Maharam, extrajudicial authority may be invoked by a court in any situation when it feels that sanctions are necessary to deter potential misconduct. Shaar Ephraim, by contrast, would limit the court’s authority to situations where the com­munity has, in fact, engaged in such misconduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Emanuel Quint and Neil Hecht, <i>Jewish Jurisprudence: Its Sources and Modern Applications</i> (Chur, Switzerland: 1980), 174–5.</i></small></span>
On all three views – namely, the views of <i>R. Yehoshua Falk</i>, <i>Sha’ar Ephraim</i> (R. Ya’akov Katz, 1616–1678), and the <i>Maharam of Lublin</i> – if the individual is a habitual wrongdoer with regard to a certain practice, or has frequently committed a transgression in public,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:136.</i> and many mem­bers of the community, by engaging in this misconduct, have shown themselves to be dissolute (<i>parutz ba-aveirot</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used in <i>Tur</i>, HM 2 and <i>SA</i>, HM 2:1. According to R. Ya’akov Katz, if the community is not dissolute, a court may not exercise such sanctions against a habitual wrongdoer; see <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i> 72 (43b).</i> an emergency exists if the individual will continue violating the halakhic norm unless he is pun­ished. Under these circumstances, a rabbinical court may exercise extrajudicial authority (<i>le-migdar milta</i>) as a deterrent, to forestall the danger that others will emulate the wrongdoer’s behavior if it goes unpunished.
Who is authorized to impose such extrajudicial sanctions? What types of non-ordained arbiters possess such authority?

Indeed, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in the Spanish provinces of Catalonia, Majorca and Valencia, Jewish communities had an institution known as the “board of inquiry into transgressions” (<i>berurei aveirot</i>)<i>.</i> Authorized by the king of Spain, these lay courts would contract com­munal loans, sell communal property, render decisions regarding financial matters (such as taxation and wills) and personal status claims, and in certain communities even had the power to administer oaths to litigants and witnesses and to excommunicate offenders. More­over, as numerous <i>teshuvot</i> by <i>Rashba</i>, <i>R. Yitzhak ben Sheshet</i>, and others attest, the <i>berurei aveirot</i>, as custodians of religious rectitude and order, were authorized to mete out criminal and monetary sanctions for ritual and moral offenses that were eroding the communal fabric. As grounding for the institution of <i>berurei aveirot</i>, the halakhic author­ities invoked the classic Talmudic sources that provided for exigency authority in these matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:385, 393; 4:311; <i>Teshuvot ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 279; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 265; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 41.</i> Indeed, no rabbinical discussion of the legitimacy of criminal sanctions and fines for civil injuries so levied was deemed necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1187; 3:318.</i> Following in this tradition, <i>R.

Whether a contemporary rabbinical court has the extrajudicial authority to impose a criminal or monetary sanction, such as punitive damages, on a habitual wrongdoer who is part of a dissolute com­munity where many engage in the same improper behavior will depend on whether a non-ordained panel of arbiters has the jurisdic­tion to wield this type of authority. The authority of a non-ordained panel of arbiters is predicated on both parties’ willingness to submit their claims to this body.

Let us now revisit our hypothetical case of a husband’s denying his wife conjugal relations and thereby causing her mental anguish. Assuming a contemporary rabbinical court is empowered to have recourse to extrajudicial authority in exigency situations, it must be decided if the circumstances in question indeed constitute an exigency situation. Does a husband’s refusal to engage in sexual relations consti­tute wrongdoing of the sort that creates an exigency situation that may entitle the victim to damages? Consider the following Talmudic dictum:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>R. Eliezer ben Ya’akov said: A man must not marry a woman if it is his inten­tion to divorce her, as it is said, “Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he lives securely by you” (Proverbs 3:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 37b; <i>Gittin</i> 90a.</i></small></span>
As the <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i> explains, in such a situation, the wife is con­sidered a married woman, yet the husband views her as a divorcee.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 455.</i> Entering into a marital agreement requires both spouses to have the same mental intent vis-à-vis the marriage, viz., the intention to remain married to each other. A marriage that is factually dead, that is, in which the spouses do not engage in conjugal relations, yet the husband either remains under the same roof, moves out of the marital home while remaining formally married for the sake of the children (or other reasons), or refuses to grant a <i>get</i>, is deemed a violation of the law by <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulhan Arukh.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Issurei Bi’ah</i> 21:28; <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:21; <i>Tur</i>, EH 119; <i>SA</i>, EH 119:1–2; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, EH 119:1; <i>Taz</i>, EH 119:2.</i> <i>R. David ben Shmuel ha-Levi</i> interprets the aforementioned Talmudic dictum as follows: “Even though it is permissible to ‘devise evil,’ that is, to divorce one’s wife, in accordance with the law … he who desires to do so should do so [soon], and not delay the divorce. Therefore the verse states, ‘he lives securely with you’ – this is the essence of the prohibition.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taz</i>, ibid.</i>
That is, a husband’s unwillingness to have sexual relations with his wife, whether due to a personal vendetta, sheer hatred of his wife, or a desire to gain financial concessions with respect to a divorce he is contemplating, involves a violation of the injunction “devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he lives securely by you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:21; <i>Tur</i>, EH 119; <i>SA</i>, EH 119:1.

Denying one’s wife conjugal relations during an ongoing marriage in which no divorce is impending or she is unaware of any contemplation of divorce on her husband’s part prevents her from engaging in sexual relations with someone else, as she remains a married woman. The mental anguish involved in this situation to some extent parallels that facing the <i>agunah</i>, the “chained” woman who is prevented from remarrying because of her husband’s refusal to grant a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">On defining <i>tza’ar</i> as emotional anguish, see infra n. 72. Causing such anguish also constitutes violation of the prohibition against causing pain to living creatures (<i>tza’ar ba’alei hayyim</i>), which applies to human beings as well as to animals. See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 32b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1: 252, 256, 257; <i>Drishah</i>, HM 272:15; <i>Sma</i>, HM 272:13; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhmah</i> 4:125; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hakhamim</i>, YD 1.<br>In addition to the psychological consequences of a husband’s unwillingness to have relations with his wife, the court may declare him a rebel (<i>mored</i>), a possible consequence of which is that his wife may be granted an increase in the amount due her from her <i>ketuba</i>; see <i>SA</i>, EH 77:1; <i>Rema</i>, ad loc.</i>

Implementation of a <i>kinyan</i> to establish matrimonial ties articulates the parties’ willingness to assume the duties and rights associated with marriage and by no means constitutes evidence that the husband has acquired title to his wife; see <i>Birkat Kohen</i>, 101–123; <i>Torah Temimah</i>, <i>Vayikra</i> 22:11.</i> the <i>Netziv</i>, <i>R. Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin</i>, writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Reason tells us that man is so duty bound. It is, as we all know, for this purpose that a bride enters into marriage … Hence, if he denies her sex­ual relations, she is deprived of her right. Sexual fulfillment is primarily the husband’s duty and the wife’s entitlement. Sexual relations are the essence of marriage and depriving a woman of this right creates “<i>tza’ar gufa</i>,” that is, emotional pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Birkat ha-Netziv</i>, <i>Mekhilta de-Rabbi Yishmael</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i> 3 (Horowitz-Rabin edition), 258–9. See also <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 63a. In fact, should a husband initially fail to address her desire for conjugal relations and then dutifully engage in relations, his behavior is construed as a fulfillment of a religious obligation by way of a transgression (<i>mitzvah ha-ba’ah ba-aveirah</i>), namely, transgression of the precept “her conjugal rights he shall not diminish” (<i>Shemot</i> 21:10); see <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 62b, s.v. <i>ve-katvu.</i> Moreover, the withholding of conjugal rights is construed as theft; see <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahdura Kama</i>, OH 35; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Hayyim</i>, vol. 1, EH 18.

She is, however, entitled to change her mind and reinstate her right to conjugal relations; see <i>Lehem Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 15:1; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 1. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 2:44.<br>Many decisors have ruled that a husband’s failure to engage in sexual relations involves contravention of a biblical prohibition (“her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he shall not diminish” [<i>Shemot</i> 21:10]); see <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 12:2; <i>Tur</i>, EH 69; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, ad loc. Accord­ing to R. Shimon Shkop, the status of the violation – biblical or rabbinic – determines whether abstinence from conjugal relations is deemed to create severe emotional distress for the wife. R. Shkop’s contention has been explained as follows: “All biblical prohibitions are proscribed because higher wisdom recognizes that this is as bad for Israel as poison, and the fact is that the prohibition and the warning exist because the matter is bad … And rabbinic prohibitions are the exact opposite. The matter is good … and the proof is that given the Torah did not proscribe it, it isn’t bad – but rather, the Torah mandated that we listen to the rabbis” (<i>Rabbi Hayyim Shmuelevitz Memorial Volume</i> [Hebrew] [Jerusalem: 1979], 285). See also <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 1, ch. 10. Cf. <i>Sefer Yerei’im</i> 191 and <i>Smag</i>, negative pre­cept 81, which maintain that failure to fulfill this duty violates a Rabbinic prohibition. On the view espoused by R. Shkop, such a violation does not cause the said harm to the wife.</i></small></span>
Withholding sexual intercourse (<i>onah</i>) causes emotional scarring and may have repercussions for the future of the marriage. This aware­ness of emotional hurt is underscored in other contexts. For example, the Talmud debates whether, given the tension and mental anguish that arises from spousal conflict, the execution of a divorce is a boon for the wife, or whether, notwithstanding marital tensions, the wife none­theless prefers the gratification of her bodily desires (<i>niha de-gufa</i>) to divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 118b. The initiation of conjugal relations by the husband is for the wife’s pleasure (<i>simhat ishto</i>), while a husband’s pleasure is a beneficial consequence of imparting pleasure to his wife; see <i>Devarim</i> 24:5 and <i>Rashi</i> ad loc.; <i>Pesahim</i> 72b; <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Ba’alei ha-Nefesh</i>, <i>Sha’ar ha-Kedushah</i>; <i>Smak</i>, positive commandment 285. This need to instill joy applies to a pregnant and/or barren wife as well. As R. Moshe Feinstein notes, “Conjugal relations do not depend on the possibility of conception, but are part of a husband’s obligation toward his wife, to give her pleasure and not cause her pain;” see <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:102. See also <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 15:1. Regarding whether a husband is obligated to sleep in a <i>Succah</i> on <i>Succos</i> without his spouse and the implications of this issue for <i>simhat ishto</i>, see <i>Taz</i>, OH 639:9; <i>Bikurei Ya’akov</i>(Ettlinger), <i>Aruch la-Ner</i> Succah(end), OH 639:18.<br>The halakhic literature suggests that the proscribed pain is not only physical pain, but rather emotional anguish as well. The subtext to the duty to engage in sexual relations is reflected in the requirement that a husband refrain from sexual relations with his wife when intoxicated, angry at her, or intending to divorce her; see <i>Yevamot</i> 37b; <i>SA</i>, OH 240:3, 10. Similarly, the notion of bringing joy to one’s wife entails recognition of the wife’s right to emotional integrity and equanimity. Hence, the with­holding of sexual relations, unless requested by the wife, is deemed to cause mental anguish, and serves, according to some decisors, as potential grounds for compelling a divorce. In <i>Rambam</i>’s formulation, it is grounds for the claim, “My husband is repulsive to me (<i>ma’is alai</i>);” see <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 14:8. For others who endorse <i>Rambam</i>’s position, see Yuval Sinai, “Coercion of a <i>Get</i> as a Solution for the Problem of Agunah,” 20 <i>Jewish Law Association Studies</i> (2010), 246, which records a substantial number of heretofore unknown decisors who subscribe to <i>Rambam</i>’s view. See R. Avraham Gatinieu’s review of the <i>Poskim</i> concerning this matter and his conclusion that most <i>Rishonim</i> endorse <i>Rambam</i>’s view. See <i>Teshuvot Tzel ha-Kesef</i> 13–14.<br>Although some decisors do not endorse this position as grounds for compelling a <i>get</i>, my proposal to recognize claims for <i>tza’ar boshet</i> in cases of spousal refusal of conjugal relations (see below at nn. 109–118) may have the indirect effect of encouraging recalci­trant husbands to grant a <i>get.</i></i> The Talmudic conclusion is, “<i>tav le-meitav tan du mi-le-meitav armelu”</i> (It is better for two to dwell together than to dwell alone). The underlying idea here is that a woman has a compelling desire for mar­riage, such that she will even accept a degree of routine quarreling and marital strife. The assumption is that given that a woman’s need for sexual relations through the husband’s fulfillment of the “conjugal rights” precept is an existential fact and not conditioned by contingent social or cultural factors, a woman prefers to remain married.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This understanding of the <i>“tav le-meitav tan du”</i> dictum was developed in a talk by R. Joseph Soloveitchik, “Surrendering to the Almighty,” summar­ized in <i>Light</i> (17 Kislev, 5736 [1976]), 11–15, 18. Cf. <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, vol. 4, EH 83. This is, however, a halakhic presumption, and not applicable to every marriage; see Bleich, supra n. 70, 102–8. Whether the “<i>tav le-meitav tan du</i>” presumption assumes the need to engage in sexual relations or can refer to a woman’s desire for companionship and security merits further analysis. On the notion of mental torment (<i>inui nefesh</i>) as denoting, in certain contexts, abstention from conjugal relations, see <i>Bereishit</i> 31:50; <i>Vayikra</i> 16:29; <i>Yoma</i> 76a, 77b.</i> Hence, a husband’s refusal to engage in sexual relations undermines his wife’s ongoing emotional stability.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the emotional harm ensuing from a wife’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations is likewise deemed infliction of emotional distress on the husband, and is likewise a violation of Halakhah; see <i>Teshuvot Ri Migash</i> 186; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 14:9, 11–12; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 73a, s.v. <i>ve-ha-amar rav</i>; <i>Hatam Sofer</i> on <i>Taz</i> OH 639:9.</i>
However, a wife may seek to opt out of a deteriorating relationship when the spouses do not engage in conjugal relations though residing under the same roof, or while de facto separated from each other. The husband’s withholding of a <i>get</i> under these conditions results in an untenable situation:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The daughters of Avraham remain grass widows with living husbands. They are left starving, thirsty, and destitute. And we should be apprehen­sive lest they become involved in objectionable conduct … Moreover, these women are young and nubile [and will not be able to wait indefinitely].<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ginat Veradim</i>, EH 3:20. Although this description relates to a case in which the husband disappeared, it also applies to the present-day <i>agunah</i> whose husband refuses to grant her a divorce.</i></small></span>
The Rabbis likened the situation of such a woman to that of a moribund individual in imminent danger of death (<i>goses</i>)<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 122a. Clearly, the analogy to someone about to die (<i>goses</i>) is metaphorical. Although the withholding of sexual relations generally does not lead to death, both the wife and the <i>goses</i> will likely experience emotional distress as a result of their respective conditions. In both cases, there is objective pain that is not self-induced; see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a, s.v. <i>tirda de-reshut.</i></i> While withholding a <i>get</i> does not constitute murder per se, in the eyes of <i>R. Yosef Henkin</i>, the prohibition against it is a stricture ancillary to the prohibition against murder (<i>avizrayhu de-retziha</i>)<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kitvei ha-Gaon Rav Yosef Henkin</i>, vol. 1, 115. R. Henkin describes a recalcitrant husband as a thief. As Prof. Berachyahu Lifshitz observes (in a personal com­munication to this author), given that the husband is obligated to have relations due to his <i>shi’abud</i> vis-à-vis his wife (see supra nn. 70–72), R. Henkin’s characteriza­tion is apt. On emotional abuse as grounds for divorce in rabbinical writings and contemporary Israeli rabbinical court judgments, see Shochetman, supra n. 1; 54/168, Supreme Rabbinical Court (SRC) (Jerusalem), Nov. 17, 1994; 1-2-016788168 SRC, May 10, 2001.</i>
Moreover, the husband may compound the injury by dismissing the harm, arguing that one who suffers emotional pain has only herself to blame, and that emotional distress is a transient psycho­logical and/or culturally conditioned behavioral pattern rather than an existential fact.
Given the wife’s emotional distress, we are dealing with a husband who, in keeping his spouse from engaging in sexual relations, is a habitual wrongdoer who will continue to violate the law unless he is punished. If many in the community are dissolute (<i>parutz be-aveirot</i>), in that they engage in similar misconduct, or are at risk of doing so, an exigency situation can be said to exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 40.</i> Under these circumstances, can a rabbinical court today exercise extrajudicial authority to forestall the danger that, should the behavior of the husband in question go unpunished, others will emulate the offender? Let us first analyze the emotional distress being perpetrated by the husband.
Above, we noted that according to the strict law (<i>dinei nezikin min ha-din</i>), there are five aspects of personal injury for which compensation is paid: 1. <i>nezek</i> (loss of capacity to work due to the permanent loss of a limb); 2. <i>tza’ar</i> (pain resulting from physical contact); 3. <i>ripui</i> (healing, viz., medical expenses); 4. <i>shevet</i> (loss of income during convalescence); 5. <i>boshet</i> (shame and embarrassment).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See above n. 24; <i>Bava Kama</i> 91a; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:3.</i>
Under which category of damage does infliction of emotional dis­tress fall? Though, according to the strict law of torts, the term <i>tza’ar</i> is associated with physiological pain rather than emotional distress, in the context of exigency jurisdiction, it can be taken to have its ordinary sense, that is, to encompass emotional distress.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 85a; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1; <i>Tur</i>, HM 420:17 and <i>Beit Yosef</i> ad loc.; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:16. The position of R. Ya’akov Blau on this point is unclear; see <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 6, 313, n. 32.</i> Alternatively, mental anguish could be categorized as <i>boshet.</i> In the psychological and philosophical literature, shame is intimately connected to the victim’s sense of self and the presence of those who confirm one’s self-esteem.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">John Rawls, “Self-Respect, Excellence, and Shame,” in R. Dillon (ed.), <i>Dignity</i>, <i>Character and Self Respect</i> (NY: 1995), 128; Gabriele Taylor, <i>Pride</i>, <i>Shame</i>, <i>and Guilt</i> (NY: 1985), 64.</i> The Halakhah defines shame as the consequence of an injury generated by physical contact<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 91a. Cf. Yerushalmi <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6, which provides for recovery for humiliation absent physical impact only if the victim is a great scholar.</i> witnessed by a third party.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 420:7; <i>Rema</i>, HM 420:8; <i>Teshuvot Rivevot Ephraim</i> 6: 453; <i>Teshuvot Az Nidberu</i> 8: 63. But cf. <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b, s.v. <i>be-zman</i>, which argues that the presence of a third party who witnesses the injury is not required.</i> On this view, shame is not simply the humiliated party’s subjective feeling, which was generated by physical contact (such as a slap, spitting, and so on) between the parties, unrelated to any third party’s awareness of the act. Rather, shame is the feeling of humiliation accompanied by the knowledge that others are aware of the event causing the victim’s discomfiture, and the resulting diminution of his sense of worth. The Talmud asks whether, if the victim is unaware of the humiliation (as for instance, if, while asleep, someone disrobed him, and he subsequently died in his sleep, unaware of the incident), other parties who have been indirectly humiliated, such as family members of the directly humbled party, can sue for <i>boshet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 86b.</i> Can the heirs sue for family humiliation? If liability depends on third party awareness, there should be no liability in such a case; if liability is grounded in the victim’s feelings of shame, then given his unawareness, the injurer should be exempt. The Talmud’s view is that though family members were indirectly humiliated, a <i>boshet</i> claim arises only if the victim himself experiences shame, and in the case of the disrobed sleeper, the injurer is exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>’s ruling, endorsed by <i>Rema</i> and <i>Sema</i>, is that the victim’s heirs cannot sue for <i>boshet</i>; see <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 27 (cited by <i>Beit Yosef</i>, YD 343:7–8); <i>Rema</i>, HM 420:35; <i>Sema</i>, HM 420:43. Others contend that the Talmud did not take a definitive stance; hence, we must refrain from extracting money from the tortfeasor. See <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 3:3; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:35.</i>
But shame has a broader sense than that addressed by the black-letter Halakhah, as it can extend to the humiliated party’s subjective feelings even in the absence of physical contact between the injurer and the victim, or where there are no third party witnesses. By law, some­one expectorating mucus or phlegm that comes in contact with some­one else’s skin is liable to pay for <i>boshet</i>; if, however, the expectoration damages only the other party’s clothing, he is exempt from paying compensation for <i>boshet.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 420:38. See D. Feldman, <i>The Right and the Good</i> (NY: 2005), 1–5.</i> In the absence of physical impact, the court cannot hold the offender liable. Note that this is in line with the principle that holding someone down while shouting in his ear establishes liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 405:1. Hence, some authorities maintain that the law of damages does not mandate imposition of fines when an engagement is broken; see <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 207:7; <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> (2nd edi.) 75; E. Shochetman, “More About Damages of Breach of Promise to Marry” [Hebrew], 9 <i>Mishpatim</i> (1978), 109, 120. But cf. <i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 90b and 91a, where it is argued that there is liability for <i>boshet</i> absent physical impact.</i> Damages for expectoration of mucus that comes in contact with someone’s clothing generates liability, not on the basis of the strict law, but on the basis of exigency law.
Yet breaking an engagement, which likewise does not entail physical contact, may conceivably generate liability for <i>boshet</i>. This has been argued for not by adducing the jilted party’s embarrassment that people are aware of what happened, but rather on the grounds that breaking an engagement leads to a decline in the jilted party’s social status, and reduced prospects for finding a spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PDR</i> 3:205, 210; however, it was left an open question there.</i> A different argu­ment was put forward by <i>R. Yosef Shaul Nathanson</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Shame is that which touches one’s body. Therefore, when it does not touch his body, he is exempt. Yet an engagement has impact on the rational soul and is much worse than physical injury, hence with regard to broken engagements, even in the absence of physical contact, there is liability. And one who verbally embarrasses his friends will not have a share in the world to come, even though he did not physically injury him.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i> (2nd ed.) 4:69. See also <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 207:7. But cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, root 29. On emotional anguish as a form of <i>boshet</i>, see also <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b, s.v. <i>be-zman</i>; <i>Nedarim</i> 27b, s.v. <i>asmakhta</i>; <i>Kiddushin</i> 8b, s.v. <i>maneh</i>.</i></small></span>
On this view, <i>boshet devarim</i> (verbal embarrassment) is not limited to verbal insults or defamation of character.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 420:38; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 3: 480; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 181.</i> It also encompasses emo­tional distress unaccompanied by physical contact and unrelated to third party awareness, such as the emotional fallout generated by broken engagements.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:112, which claims that a broken engagement encompasses not just verbal embarrassment, but a physical act (if, upon breaking the engagement, the party who terminates the relationship becomes engaged to someone else). <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 207:7, argues that obligating oneself by executing an engagement document (<i>shtar shiddukhin</i>), generates liability for <i>boshet</i>.</i>
Antecedents for this type of <i>boshet</i> can be found in a Jerusalemite practice from Talmudic times: If someone entrusted preparation of a meal to someone else, who spoiled it, the latter had to compensate the host for the insult to him and to his guests.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 93b. The fact that the act in question generates <i>boshet</i> liability according to the laws of heaven (<i>dinei Shamayim</i>), if not according to the laws of man, entails that the Halakhah recognizes embarrassment that does not ensue from physical contact.</i> Liability for the host’s embarrassment ensues from his being publicly embarrassed by the spoiled meal. Liability for guests’ embarrassment is grounded in their mental anguish for the host who wanted to serve a delicious meal; the Talmud identifies these “third-party” feelings as <i>boshet</i> too.
Analogously, the husband’s misconduct may be taken to cause the wife distress that, from the halakhic perspective, gives rise to liability for <i>boshet.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Assuming that the husband intended to embarrass his wife. Lack of intent would exempt him from liability for <i>boshet</i>; see <i>Bava Kama</i> 27a; <i>SA</i>, HM 421:1, 11; <i>Beit Meir</i>, EH 66:6.</i> Just as a broken engagement by its very nature generates feel­ings of mental anguish, that is, <i>boshet</i>, unrelated to any physical contact or verbal remarks,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Meir</i>, EH 7.</i> a husband’s denying his spouse conjugal relations generates emotional stress, that, though there is no accompanying physical contact or verbal insult, should be categorized as <i>boshet.</i>
Given that intentional infliction of mental anguish is akin to <i>boshet devarim</i>, can this claim be resolved by a rabbinical court? While, accord­ing to the strict law, there is no remedy in cases of <i>boshet</i> involving no physical contact, a rabbinical court, whether or not its members are ordained judges, does have the extrajudicial power, “in every locale and at all times,” to benefit the community by imposing criminal sanc­tions and holding the wrongdoer liable for damages for <i>boshet devarim.</i>
At first glance, such a conclusion might seem unfounded. The <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules that only ordained arbiters residing in the Land of Israel can assess a specified penalty established by the Torah (<i>kenas katzuv</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Halakhah distinguishes between cases in which the offender is liable to pay monetary compensation (<i>mamon</i>), and cases of offenses that incur fines (<i>kenas</i>). Whereas one who confesses to an act commission of which incurs liability for monetary restitution is obligated to pay, this is not so with regard to fines. Here, admitting to an act does not render one liable to payment of the fine; see <i>Bava Kama</i> 64b, 75a. Since a litigant’s con­fession regarding humiliation is admissible in evidence, <i>boshet</i> payments fall into the category of <i>mamon</i>; see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 42a; <i>Tosafot Rid</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 41a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nedarim</i> 8:3. Nevertheless, in some Tal­mudic and post-Talmudic sources, <i>boshet</i> is arbitrarily designated a fine; see <i>Sma</i>, HM 1:5; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 1:3. Given that non-ordained arbiters may adjudicate only matters that occur frequently and involve a loss of money, injuries such as <i>boshet</i>, if they that do not occur frequently and do not entail a loss of money, are deemed to fall under the category of offenses incurring fines, and as such, cannot be adjudicated; see <i>Teshuvot Rav Natronai Gaon</i> (Brody edition) 329, 363; <i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 64–68; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 84b; <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 5:6; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 1; Amihai Radzyner, “Foundations of ‘<i>Dine Qena­sot</i>’ in Talmudic Law” (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Bar Ilan University, 2001), 229–36.</i> for personal injuries, and today, all arbiters are non-ordained and hence lack the authority to mete out such penalties.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 1:1.</i> How, then, can a rabbinical court today award damages for <i>boshet</i>? As we have explained, on the strength of exigency law, even non-ordained arbiters are empowered to mete out penalties known as “fines imposed by the Rabbis” (<i>kenas hakhamim</i>), such as payments for <i>boshet</i>-related injury.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 4:41; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 384. See Radzyner, n. 95 above, 281–2. In our presentation, we have focused upon the exigency jurisdiction of a contemporary <i>beit din</i>’s authority to address a wife’s claim for tort damages; see <i>SA</i>, HM 2 and supra, text accompanying nn. 26–59 and infra, text accompanying nn. 98–101. A <i>beit din</i> is empowered to render an award for two types of damages: compensatory damages and punitive damages. Compensatory damages represent the financial equivalent of the loss or harm suffered by the victim, to restore the injured victim to the position he was in prior to the <i>nezek</i>. The scope of the compensatory damages includes economic damages, such as <i>nezek</i>, and non-economic damages, such as <i>boshet</i>; see <i>SA</i>, HM 420:15–18, 24. Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages consist of an assessment of damages above and beyond compensating the victim for the harm suffered. The goal of punitive damages is to punish the <i>mazik</i> for his or her conduct, deter the <i>mazik</i> from repeating his or her improper act, and prevent others from engaging in similar behavior. For a contemporary application of the imposition of punitive damages in a case of physical assault, see File no. 9326-35-1, SRC, Aug. 25, 2008. Regardless of whether the award is compensatory or punitive in nature, the justification of the award is based upon the exigency jurisdiction of a <i>beit din</i>, namely the assessment that the community must deter such improper behavior rather than satisfying a claim due to the fact that the wife is personally entitled to such relief.<br>Should a <i>beit din</i> today deem it necessary to award damages for <i>boshet devarim</i>, it has the option to either award compensatory damages calculating the shame based upon the societal status of the offender and the offended or award punitive damages that would exceed a compensatory damage award. See <i>SA</i>, HM 420:24, 35, 43; <i>Sma</i>, HM 420:25. Since the calculation of the compensatory damages for <i>boshet devarim</i> is subjective, should a <i>beit din</i> determine to render such an award, the panel must be careful to render an assessment that reflects a compensatory damage award, lest one blur the lines between a compensatory damage award and a punitive damage award. Regarding a contemporary <i>beit din</i>’s authority to render an award for <i>boshet devarim</i>, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 101:1, 8, 9; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:38; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 3:480; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 181.<br>Regardless of whether the damages are compensatory or punitive in nature, the awarding of such damages is viewed as a vehicle to appease the victim and is grounded in the <i>beit din</i>’s exigency jurisdiction. See <i>Tur</i>, HM 1:11; <i>Rema</i>, HM 1:2, 5; <i>SA</i>, HM 420: 38; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1: 93; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 4:1291.</i>
The actual implementation of these powers concerning <i>boshet­</i> related injuries is not limited to Talmudic era rabbinical courts, but has been applied in contemporary times.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">On rabbinical courts that imposed criminal sanctions on those who insulted and defamed their fellow-Jews, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, rule 71:1, 8, 9; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 240; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 62; <i>Teshuvot Tumat Yesharim</i> 1:160. On the imposition of <i>boshet devarim</i> fines for broken engagements, see <i>Shakh</i>, HM 207:24, 333:49; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tanina</i>, YD 146; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Givat Pinhas</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 134; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, vol. 2, EH 3; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, YD 102-103; <i>Teshuvot va-Yomer Yitzhak</i> 1:161; <i>Teshuvot Peri Yitzhak</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Zekhut Avot</i> 31; <i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 8:6; Shochetman, supra n. 1, 120 n. 49.</i> For example, in 1965, invoking their exigency authority, members of the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem, <i>Rabbis Abudi</i>, <i>Elyashiv</i>, and <i>Goldschmidt</i>, marshaled numerous responsa to support the position that damages for <i>boshet</i> can be awarded in the case of a broken engagement.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 5:322.</i> In the words of <i>R. Elyashiv</i>, who authored the <i>psak din</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>There is a consensus that a rabbinical court is empowered to impose cor­poral punishment or social shunning (<i>nidui</i>) until he assuages the [hurt] feelings, yet this will not be accomplished through <i>boshet</i> payments pursu­ant to the law, but rather, everything is resolved in accordance with the specifics of the matter, the times, and the arbiters’ discretion.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 327, reprinted in Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, <i>Collected Teshuvot</i> 2:129. Whether R. Elyashiv’s justification for invoking this exigency power rests on the court’s status as a community court (see above at nn. 45–50) or a non-ordained panel of arbiters (see above at nn. 51–58), or is based on the signing of an arbitration agreement (see supra n. 59) is unclear from the ruling in question. But given that in other decisions, R. Elyashiv ascribes to the view that the Israeli rabbinical courts are communal courts, mandating submission to their authority (see <i>PDR</i> 7:225, 227 and E. Shochetman, <i>Civil Procedure in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew] [Jerusalem: 1988], 169, n. 34), it is clear that he deems the exercise of such authority by community courts fully legitimate. Moreover, given that a community court is a non-ordained panel of arbiters, R. Elyashiv would presumably conclude that any lay panel may exercise such powers. But cf. <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yoel</i>, YD 35:4.</i></small></span>
Adopting <i>R. Elyashiv’</i>s position, subsequent Israeli rabbinical courts have invoked their extra judicial authority and imposed <i>boshet</i> pay­ments for broken engagements.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:209–10; 6:117, 119.</i>
It remains to identify the specific reason infliction of emotional distress by refusal to engage in conjugal relations serves as grounds for awarding <i>boshet</i> damages. Is it a “<i>le-migdar milta”</i> (a protective measure) or is it due to “the needs of the time?” Is the emotional fallout from spou­sal refusal of conjugal relations like the mental anguish resulting from a broken engagement? On the one hand, this type of distress does not result from any physical injury or impact. Is it, then, like being spat on (where the spittle lands on one’s clothing and does not touch one’s skin), being called derogatory names, or being jilted by a fiancé? On the strength of a court’s authority to invoke its exigency jurisdiction in all these aforementioned situations, the injurer can be fined.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 420:38.</i> It would seem that this should apply to our scenario as well.
The Talmud and halakhic authorities, however, exhort us to refrain from making rules that impose a fine in one realm on the basis of laws pertaining to a fine in another realm. The halakhic authorities do have recourse to analogical reason­ing to identify similarities and differences between cases (<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 130b and supra 53–57.</i> so as to address new situations, but does this allow us to establish a new rule governing a particular fine from a rule pertaining to another fine? For example, the Mishnah gives examples of liability for imperceptible damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 5:4.</i> The question then arises whether the laws governing the specified sorts of imperceptible damage can encompass other sorts of imperceptible damage. One school of thought argues that since monetary penalties are involved, the list cannot be added to, as this would constitute establishing a new penalty. Despite putative similarities between two situations, arbiters are not to derive new pen­alties by analogical inference from existing penalties. On this view, though absence of physical contact appears to be a common feature of spitting on someone else’s clothing, defamation, and emotional distress due to spousal refusal to engage in conjugal relations, this putative analogy cannot serve as a basis for expanding the sphere of exigency law to encompass the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yad Malakhi</i> 550–551; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 385:1; <i>Tosfot Yom Tov</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5:4.</i>
On another opinion, however, the Talmud’s rejection of analogical inferences from one penalty to another is applicable only in the context of black-letter Halakhah. With respect to matters falling under the rubric of <i>le-migdar milta</i>, however, analogical inferences are permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Yaakov</i> 1:145.</i> On this view, if the injury caused by a broken engagement can be subsumed under the category of <i>boshet devarim</i> by analogical inference, so too emotional distress due to spousal refusal to engage in conjugal relations can be classed as falling under <i>boshet devarim.</i> The question, then, is whether breaking an engagement in a manner that humiliates the aggrieved party constitutes <i>boshet devarim.</i> One responsist argues that breaking an engagement should be on a par with all types of <i>boshet</i>, including <i>boshet devarim</i>, and the arbiter should handle it accordingly as a “protective measure.”<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i>, supra n. 98.</i> Another contends that it is analogous to the case of spitting on someone’s cloth­ing. If a rabbinical court can invoke its extrajudicial powers to resolve a spitting incident even absent contact with the defendant’s body, surely, on breaking an engagement in a manner that generates emotional scarring of the aggrieved party, liability should ensue.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shoel Umeishiv</i>, supra n. 89.</i>
Having considered this debate, it is my opinion that, given that emotional distress due to spousal refusal to have conjugal relations may have more severe psychological impact than a physical act of injury, it should indeed be handled like <i>boshet devarim</i> and spitting on clothing. The court’s discretion to impose extrajudicial fines can provide monetary relief for this type of emotional anguish.
We saw that a husband’s denying his wife conjugal relations contravenes the biblical directive, “Devise not evil against your neigh­bor, seeing he lives securely by you” (Proverbs 3:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 60.</i> A husband’s deny­ing his spouse sexual relations occurs when the spouses reside under the same roof, and either have an ongoing marriage in other respects, or are de facto separated from each other and the marriage is factually “dead,” but the husband is delaying the granting of a divorce. The lack of conjugal relations causes <i>tza’ar</i> (mental anguish) as well as injury to the wife’s sense of self (<i>boshet</i>), the latter not necessarily being a func­tion of the public’s perception of her worth. (As we saw above, by the strict law, damages for <i>boshet</i> are a function of public perception of an individual’s social standing.) Contemporary rabbinical courts, by virtue of their power to exercise exigency authority, can adjudicate claims for such damages.
Moreover, the consequences of violating the prohibition against delaying the granting of a divorce extend beyond the halakhic recogni­tion of <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i>, and indeed, beyond the realm of domestic relations. The distress generated by denial of conjugal relations also constitutes a kind of deception:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Just as there is deceitfulness in buying and selling, so there is deceitfulness in verbal exchanges. One should not ask how much something costs if he dos not wish to buy it … If someone is the descendant of converts, he should not admonish, “remember your ancestors’ deeds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 4:10.</i></small></span>
Causing unnecessary mental anguish is prohibited in both social and commercial contexts. Inquiring about a price when one has no intention of purchasing the object is termed <i>ona’ah</i> (deception)<i>.</i> Lest the biblical prohibition against deception (Lev. 25:14) be construed as applying only to <i>ona’at mamon</i> (fraudulent business transaction), the Mishnah explicitly states that deception occurs in the realm of conver­sation as well (<i>ona’at devarim</i>)<i>.</i> The Mishnaic examples are edifying: The distress caused by needless verbal insensitivity in conversation is simi­lar to the distress caused to a merchant whose hopes of making a sale are needlessly built up and then dashed.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 58b. See also <i>Sefer Yerei’im</i>, 180; <i>Smag</i>, negative com­mandment 171; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 4:22; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, YD 4: 80, Y.

Tosefta <i>Bava Metzia</i> 3:25; <i>Sifra</i>, <i>Behar</i> 3:2; and <i>Ra’avad</i> on <i>Sifra</i> ad loc., which take the concept of “verbal deception” to apply only to objectionable verbal inquiries.</i> In the halakhic literature, verbal deception has been characterized as the infliction of “dread and fear” and “pain and distress.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i> 251; <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 58b; R. Yonah Gerondi, <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah</i> 3:24; R. Samson Raphael Hirsch, <i>Commentary on the Torah</i>, <i>Vayikra</i> 25:14–17. Cf. J. David Bleich, “<i>Ona’at Devarim</i>,” [Hebrew] 35 <i>Hadarom</i> (1972): 140–1. Others argue that not any insensitivity, but only deceptive speech constitutes <i>ona’at devarim</i>; see <i>Or ha-Hayyim</i>, <i>Vayikra</i> 25:17; <i>She’iltot Rav Ahai Gaon</i>, <i>Behar</i>, <i>She’ilta</i> 113; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 337. See also <i>Tur</i>, HM 228; <i>SA</i>, HM 228:3.</i> The individual’s emotional persona must be protected from unjustified verbal assault.
The open-ended nature of the prohibition against <i>ona’at devarim</i> is articulated in <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh:</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It is impossible to provide specific details of every type of behavior that causes emotional distress … One who transgresses this prohib­ition and behaves contrary to the directives propounded by the halakhic scholars violates a precept.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 341 (338).</i></small></span>
Over 700 years later, <i>R. Ya’akov Blau</i> introduces his exam­ination of <i>ona’at devarim</i> by describing the many acts subsumed under this prohibition:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>One who creates noise in his home or in the street while the neighbors are sleeping … [and] one who resides on an upper floor and disturbs his neighbor on a lower floor is deemed to be causing pain … If one needs to move or remove beds, it should be done during the day … and during the evening hours, one should walk with light footwear and not run elec­tric saws or washing machines and the like … In this book, he discusses whether students in a study hall or <i>yeshiva</i> in a residential area can learn aloud … There is also discussion about eating food that produces a vile odor that may cause bad breath that is offensive to someone one is conversing with.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 4, 15:3.</i></small></span>
On <i>R. Blau</i>’s view, when one party to a relationship is deliberately inconsiderate of the other, he may be liable for <i>ona’at devarim.</i> In inter­personal relations, such as relations between neighbors, the respective parties’ sense of self-worth is to be secured and enhanced, and care must be taken to avoid giving offense or creating mental anguish. There is a special prohibition against <i>ona’at devarim</i> vis-à-vis one’s wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 228; <i>SA</i>, HM 228:3.</i> A fortiori, a husband’s denying his wife conjugal relations, a direct assault on her sense of self-worth, is an instance of <i>ona’at devarim.</i>
With regard to <i>ona’at devarim</i>, no act has been committed, but rather, the offense is merely verbal, and hence not justi­ciable according to the strict law.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sema</i>, HM 420:49. Articulating words is not deemed an act; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 240 regarding the legal import of a blasphemer’s words.</i> It is thus exigency law that empowers a rabbinical court to impose fines for <i>ona’at devarim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 1:12; <i>Darkei Moshe</i>, HM 2:5; <i>Rema</i>, HM 2:1, 420:38.</i> Though our hypothetical scenario falls under the category of <i>boshet</i>, it also constitutes a violation of the prohibition against <i>ona’at devarim</i>. Shaming someone verbally entails “verbal deception.”<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashbatz</i>, <i>Magen Avot</i>, <i>Avot</i> 3:15; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 420:49.</i> In effect, a rabbinical court applying exigency law to a case of spousal denial of conjugal relations is at the same time addressing contraventions of the prohib­ition against <i>ona’at devarim.</i>
Given that every decision related to awarding damages for emo­tional scarring can be characterized as a <i>hora’at sha’ah</i> (emergency directive), the rabbinical court must realize that the contemplated rulings are ad hoc determinations arising from exigency situations, and as such call for cool-headedness. As <i>Rashba</i> formulates it:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>With patience, deliberation, and consensus, the community will be directed toward [fulfilling the will of] heaven. Every major act and mighty hand requires vigilance and the elimination of anger. The arbiter must worry that his fervent zeal for God will inflame his innards and do away with the correct and proper [judicial] comportment.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 6:238.

Applying this to our scenario, the panel must first ascertain whether the husband is indeed a wrongdoer. Let us first consider the question of when a husband is deemed to be refusing to divorce his wife (<i>mesarev get</i>), and at what point his wife is deemed to be an <i>agu­nah.</i> If a married couple have been living in separate rooms in the marital home for three months and appear in front of a rabbinical court for the purpose of executing a divorce, what is the court’s mandate? As long as there are prospects of reconciliation,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, YD 3:4; <i>PDR</i> 12:199–204.</i> it is the court’s responsi­bility to promote <i>shalom bayit</i> (domestic tranquility)<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 10:310, 313. In instances in which it is clear that the husband’s claim for <i>shalom bayit is</i> intended only to stretch out the rabbinical court proceed­ings, the court must issue a divorce judgment; see <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 6, EH 15; <i>PDR</i> 21:333, 362.</i> But if there is little likelihood that domestic harmony will prevail, a rabbinical court decision to rule with a view to fostering <i>shalom bayit</i> only serves to unduly lengthen the divorce proceedings. Unless the specifics of the marital situation dictate otherwise, the court should set a maximum time of eighteen months to restore marital tranquility.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">R. Hayyim Palagi, <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:35, 112. Some decisors contend that separation is not akin to divorce, but its purpose is rather to ease spousal tensions and facilitate reconciliation; see <i>Teshuvot u-mi-Tzur Dvash</i>, EH 8; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, EH 6: 25, 45; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, EH 3:89; <i>PDR</i> 4:267, 274.

Whether marital breakdown due to irreconcilable differences culminating in a “dead” marriage allows a court to compel a divorce is subject to debate; see <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:145; <i>PDR</i> 1:161, 162; 6:13; 9:200, 211, 213; 10:168, 173; 9:149, 153; 20:239, 275.</i> If a spouse moves out of the marital home and the couple is continuously separ­ated for the entire eighteen months, or if the spouses are legally separ­ated, the marriage is functionally over, and it becomes the court’s task to persuade the couple to divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">R. Palagi’s stance, ibid., is intended to persuade rather than coerce the parties to execute a divorce; see <i>PDR</i> 12:198, 206. Cf. <i>PDR</i> 9:200, 211–212; 10:168, 173. Legal separation or de facto separation is a prerequisite for a rabbinical court ruling recommending that the spouses divorce. Living under the same roof in different bedrooms is not deemed separation in this context; see Z. Warhaftig (ed.), <i>Collected Rulings of the Rabbinical High Court of Appeals</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1950), 30. Nevertheless, Israeli rabbinical courts have at times recommended separate bedrooms in order to facili­tate reconciliation in the hope of the couple’s eventual return to shared quarters; see <i>PDR</i> 4:267, 274.</i> This is done by issuing a divorce judgment that it is “proper” or “recommended” that “the parties divorce each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Although in the period of the <i>Rishonim</i>, such judgments were for­mulated in terms of an “obligation to divorce” (<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>) rather than “compelling” divorce (<i>kofin le-garesh</i>), Kaplan argues that today, rabbinical courts, in particular in Israel, use even weaker terms, saying that divorce is “recommended” or “a mitzvah.” See Yehiel Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment: Principles of Jewish Law,” <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> 15 (2004), 57, 77–80, 134–8. A cursory glance at recent cases indicates that courts do in fact use the term “obligation to divorce” (<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>); see Jerusalem District Rabbinical Court, 1-21-9918 and 2-21­764; Tel Aviv District Rabbinical Court, 038416327-21-1; Petach Tikva District Rabbinical Court, 4927-21-1; Netanya District Rabbinical Court, 1-24-4564; Haifa District Rabbinical Court, 8952-21-1. On the need to avoid the locution “obligation to divorce,” see <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 2, EH 10.</i> Once the judgment has been issued, the parties are to arrange for execution of the divorce (<i>sidur ha-get</i>)<i>.</i> Should the husband refuse to give the <i>get</i> due to a personal vendetta, desire to use the <i>get</i> as a bargaining chip for financial concessions, or sheer hatred of his wife, at that juncture he is deemed a <i>mesarev get</i>. As noted, at this point, there are grounds for providing monetary relief for the wife, who is deprived of conjugal relations, and suffers the attendant emotional distress.
However, prior to addressing and awarding such a claim for infliction of emotional distress, the court must engage in mediation, so that either the victim may be assuaged with words of appeasement or the injurer can voluntarily offer monetary recompense.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 1:5.</i> Adducing a Geonic precedent, various halakhic authorities argue that there should be recourse to appeasement “according to the issues at hand, the status of the one who perpetrated the humiliation, and the status of the victim of the humiliation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rav Natronai Gaon</i>, <i>supra</i> n. 95, 329; see R. Sherira Gaon, <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzedek</i>, part 4, gate 1, no. 19; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:3; <i>Perishah</i>, HM 1:12; <i>Levush</i>, HM 1:5. Relying on the Geonic precedents and <i>SA</i>, HM 1:6, there is the option of imposing a ban or social shunning (<i>nidui</i>); after calculation of the approximate damages to be paid, the injurer is released from the ban, regardless of whether he has appeased his wife.</i> Depending on the circumstances of the case and the religious and/or social status of the parties, the court will attempt to mediate an appeasement. Should attempts at mediation be unsuc­cessful, and assuming the standards for invoking exigency Halakhah have been met, the court will proceed to assess the damages caused by the husband’s infliction of emotional distress.
Given that the injuries are imperceptible, how does the court assess these damages? Post-Talmudic sources indicate that the court does so by exercising judicial discretion. Defining this discretion in a negative fashion, some characterized the assessed damages as fines (<i>kenasot</i>) that have no rationale, one decisor even saying, “I am astonished that the sages found any basis for arriving at these assessments.”<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 212, 65; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzedek</i>, part 4, gate 1, no. 7; <i>Ra’abad</i>, quoted in <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91b. According to R. Yisrael Isserlein, there is no prescribed formula (<i>middah kavuah</i>) for estimating this type of award; see <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 2:212.</i> Others, among them R. Yosef Elyashiv, describe the court’s discretion in exigency situations in positive terms: “Everything is resolved in accordance with the specifics of the matter, the times, and the arbiters’ discretion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 5:327, and see above at n. 100. A similar formulation is found in <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pealim</i>, vol. 2, EH 3; <i>Kenneset ha-Gedolah</i>, HM 1:35.</i>
I am not, of course, claiming that the court decides on the basis of whim; rather, there is an authoritative decisional standard. <i>Boshet</i> is determined by the principle of proportionality, that is, in accordance with the relative status of the perpetrator and victim of the humiliation. In effect, defendants pay damages commensurate with their wrongs, and plaintiffs recover damages commensurate with their losses. A secular legal system might ask: Ought not the husband to have foreseen the injury that would result from his conduct? Did the wife have an “eggshell personality,” resulting in unforeseeable mental injury? The halakhic system does not ask these questions. The doctrine that a hus­band’s denying his spouse conjugal relations is a violation of the prohibitions against <i>ona’at devarim</i> and <i>boshet</i> enables the court to assume that long term abstinence from conjugal relations engenders anguish in every wife, and does not reflect psychological fragility, but is rooted in the very essence of her humanity. Similarly, the forseeability of the harm ensuing from the husband’s failure to engage in sexual relations need not be proven in order to establish liability.
The <i>boshet</i> generated by spousal denial of conjugal relations cuts across all economic and social strata. It is incumbent upon the husband to be aware of his spouse’s rights and his own marital obligations, and to be aware of the injury that will ensue from failure to fulfill his obligation to engage in conjugal relations (<i>onah</i>) while preventing his wife from severing the marital bond. Failure to be aware of these duties is grounds for liability for his wife’s foreseeable emotional distress.
Although a court is to be guided by the relative religious and/or social status of the parties in assessing <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> payments, such imperceptible injuries cannot be readily quantified and will result in wide variations in monetary awards.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 86a, s.v. <i>ke’ilu.</i> This conclusion also applies to com­mon law; see C. McCormick, <i>Handbook on the Law of Damages</i> (St. Paul, MN: 1935), 88, 318–19; S. Atiyah, <i>Accidents</i>, <i>Compensation and the Law</i> (London: 1980), 213.</i> Ought the court implement a policy of minimizing or maximizing these awards? The black-letter Halakhah sets a fixed <i>boshet</i> payment for certain injurious acts that are accompanied by physical contact: “If he spat and the spittle reached him, if he stripped his cloak from him … he gives him four hundred zuz … all in accordance with his dignity [viz., his status].”<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6.</i>
The Mishnah notes that an individual is deemed poor if he cannot pay for food and clothing for a year, which at the time came to 200 zuz.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pei’ah</i> 8:8–9; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Matnot Aniyim</i> 9:13. Cf. <i>Or Zarua</i>, <i>Hilkhot Tzedakah</i> 14; <i>Tur</i>, YD 253:2. Some argue that the value of the <i>ketubah</i> should be equal to one year’s support; see <i>Sma</i>, HM 88:2; <i>Avnei Me’luim</i> 27:1 (in the name of <i>Rashi</i> and <i>Ritva</i>);<i>Teshuvot Beit Avi</i> 3:137 and R. Daichovsky, <i>PDR</i>, 1-213655, Feb. 22, 2005.</i> In 2008, in New York City, using the Consumer Price Index, the 200 zuz amount would be equivalent to an annual outlay of $55,000 for food and clothing. Hence, the statutory Mishnaic compensatory damages for spitting or stripping off a cloak are $110,000 per occurrence, depending on the relative status of the parties. As understood by Talmud and later authorities, these monetary awards are the maximum sums that can be awarded for the said injurious acts.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 91a; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:43.</i> The law adopts a policy of restraint (<i>le-kulah</i>) vis-à-vis compensation for damage claims, including those of <i>boshet</i>, limiting the compensation paid out.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 58b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 5:16.</i>
Though the goal of the law <i>stricto sensu</i> is to compensate the victim while keeping the perpetrator’s monetary liability within reasonable limits, exigency law is resorted to for punitive purposes and deter­rence. Applying exigency law in cases where there is a claim of emo­tional distress due to the withholding of sexual relations serves two goals. As we saw, it imposes liability for a type of injury not covered by the strict law, namely, non-physical injuries unaccompanied by direct physical contact. But optimally, the system should not only compen­sate deserving victims, but also deter halakhically reprehensible behavior in the future. Referring to exigency rulings in terms of such rubrics as “protective measures” and “the times requires it,”<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 26–30.</i> conveys the idea that the system is focusing on an immediate problem, and the imposition of sanctions is punitive. But deterrence is also critical. In the words of <i>R. Natronai Gaon</i>: “One may penalize monetarily at a minimum or at a maximum in order to prevent the increase of perpetrators in Israel. This is the tradition of rabbinic courts, and we learn from them; and this is our judicial practice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">R. Natronai Gaon, n. 95 above. The discretionary nature of the assess­ment, the fact that there is no mention of a policy of limiting awards, is stressed in <i>PDR</i> 3:131, 151; 5:322, 327, as well as in the <i>teshuvot</i> cited in n. 98 above. Some of these sources emphasize that the fine should be calculated on the basis of the status of the perpetrator and the status of the victim.</i>
Given that the damages are not just compensatory, but punitive and deterrent, the amount of the award will be proportionate to the transgression in question. Taking into account the range of possible scenarios, awards for similar injuries may vary considerably from case to case. As the amount of the award is discretionary, wide variations in monetary awards will result. This variation in award is not unique to the halakhic system. In American law, for example, awards for spousally-inflicted emotional distress have ranged from $15,000 to as much as $500,000.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Twyman v.

We have assumed that a court can hear a claim for infliction of emotional anguish prior to a wife’s receiving her bill of divorce (<i>get</i>)<i>.</i> But would submission of such a claim while her husband was refusing to grant the divorce render the divorce, when ultimately granted, unlawfully coerced (<i>get me’useh</i>)<i>?</i> In our scenario, the wife lived, de facto, apart from her husband during five years of marriage, and subsequently was denied a divorce by her recalcitrant husband for over three years. Can she proceed to submit a claim for emotional distress she suffered during the five years of separation prior to seeking a divorce?
We will address this through the lens of some medieval <i>teshuvot</i> and contemporary rabbinic writings. <i>R. J. David Bleich</i> summarizes some early views and the normative Halakhah on the question of <i>kefiyat get</i> (coerced divorce) in other contexts:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Rashba maintains that any coercion relating to execution of a <i>get</i>, even if self-imposed in the form of a voluntarily assumed penalty for non-execution, renders a <i>get</i> invalid … This view is disputed by R. Simon ben Zemah Duran, <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbats</i> (<i>Tashbats</i>), II, no. 68, who declares, “One who says, ‘I will give 100 gold pieces to the king if I do not divorce my wife’ may divorce his wife and there is no question in the matter, for since this obligation came of his own accord, he divorces of his own will.”<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, “Indirect Coercion in Compelling a <i>Get</i>,” 5 <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (1985), 66–67. Though according to <i>Rashba</i>, any voluntarily assumed penalty related to the execution of a <i>get</i> constitutes a forced <i>get</i>, some decisors maintain that even a self-imposed penalty unrelated to the execution of a <i>get</i> will render the <i>get</i> invalid; see <i>Teshuvot Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 15. Cf. <i>Torat Gittin</i>, EH 134:4; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i> (2nd ed.), EH 73; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> 2:33:1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, EH 99.</i></small></span>
In essence, <i>Rashba</i>’s position is that a <i>get</i> is invalid when executed under duress even if such duress is indirect. Hence, duress compelling a person to fulfill a perfectly binding undertaking to pay compensation for failure to execute a religious divorce invalidates the <i>get</i>, since it is simply an indirect means of securing compliance in executing the <i>get</i>. Those who disagree with <i>Rashba</i> maintain either that self-imposed duress does not constitute duress or that since the enforceable demand is for financial compensation rather than for a <i>get</i>, a <i>get</i> executed under such circumstances is not to be regarded as executed under dur­ess. So long as satisfaction of a lawful claim remains a viable option in order to avoid execution of the <i>get</i>, execution of the <i>get</i> in order to avoid payment of a just debt is regarded as a voluntary act motivated by the self-interest of the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</i> (NY: 1989), vol. 3, 337. Obviously, a voluntary monetary obligation assumed by the husband in exchange for granting a <i>get</i> is valid. For example, a few years ago, the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem validated a spousal agreement stipulating that in exchange for monetary payment, a husband would grant his wife a <i>get.</i> See 011588860-21-1, SRC, Mar. 6, 2005.</i>
<i>Rema</i> cites both conflicting opinions and rules that a <i>get</i> should be executed in the absence of prior forgiveness of the penalty for non-execution, but adds that if a <i>get</i> has been executed under such circumstances, it is valid even in the absence of prior for­giveness of the penalty, provided that the penalty was assumed voluntarily.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, EH 134:5. See Bleich, ibid., 96. Cf. <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:10.</i>
O<i>nsa de-nafshei</i> (self-imposed duress) is the subject of much debate among the decisors. However, even under the sorts of circumstances in question, the <i>get</i> is valid ex post facto. The question we must address, however, is whether a wife can initiate such a claim prior to receiving her <i>get</i>. To be sure, there are certain types of monetary fines or incarcer­ation that do not raise concerns about <i>get me’useh</i>. As <i>Rivash</i> points out, certain kinds of pressure are not sufficiently coercive to render a divorce invalid, provided the coercive element arises from circumstances that are independent of the divorce.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The case … involved a person cast into debtor’s prison for nonpayment of a debt. His wife’s relatives offered to satisfy the debt on his behalf and thereby obtain his release from prison on the condition that he divorce his wife. <i>Rivash</i> finds no objection to execution of a <i>get</i> under such circum­stances, “for he was not seized in order to [compel] him to divorce [his wife] but on account of his debt; the <i>get</i> is not coerced but [the product] of free will.”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Bleich, n. 137 above, 67. This conclusion presumes that the sanctions are themselves legitimate; see <i>Teshuvot Mabit</i> 2: 138; <i>Teshuvot Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 15; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, EH 99:3; I. Breitowitz, <i>Between Civil and Religious Law: The Plight of the Agunah in American Society</i> (Westport, CN: 1993), 26. Some argue that even if the husband was incarcerated due to a financial obligation not deemed a debt in the eyes of Halakhah or the incarceration was impermissible in the eyes of a Halakhah, the divorce would be proper; see <i>Teshuvot Rivash</i> 127; H. Izirer, “Duress in Monetary, Criminal, and Divorce matters” [Hebrew], 5 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (1999), 309–15.</i></small></span>
<i>Rivash</i>’s argument is that the husband was imprisoned for default­ing on a debt rather than as a means of compelling him to execute a divorce. Hence, his release in exchange for executing a divorce does not constitute duress, and the <i>get</i> is not regarded as unlawfully enforced.
<i>Rivash</i> takes the same approach in another <i>teshuvah</i>. A wife attempted to prevent her husband from leaving their locale lest she be denied her right to conjugal relations. Here, the coercion unrelated to execution of the divorce pertains to the husband’s refusal – in effect – to have conjugal relations:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>We put him under <i>nidui</i> [a ban], or flog him until he agrees to cohabit with her. If he, of his own [free will], divorces her, in order to save himself from those [measures], it is not an unlawfully enforced <i>get</i>. For the court did not compel him at all to give the <i>get</i>, but rather, to fulfill his conjugal obligation to the best of his ability, just as he is obligated by law to fulfill the [other] commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127 (transl. from Kaplan, supra n. 124, 102), accepted by <i>Rema</i>, EH 154:21. Rema extends Rivash’s conclusion, arguing that a rabbinical court can even indirectly coerce a husband and tell him, “either resume conjugal relations or divorce your wife.” Whereas Rivash contends that a court’s power of compul­sion is limited to the restoration of conjugal ties, Rema argues, pursu­ant to his understanding of Rivash’s position, that the court may, in articulating its “coercive” directive, allude to divorce. Note that in the case addressed in the Rivash’s <i>teshuvah</i>, the woman is seeking to remain married, and there is no concern about a coerced divorce. Here, the “coercion by way of choice” (<i>kefiyah be-derekh bereirah</i>) differs from that applic­able in the more typical case, in which the coercive choice offered to the husband would be, “either support your wife or divorce her,” a form of coercion which would not invalidate the subsequent execution of a divorce. See <i>Beit Yosef</i>, EH 134 in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Beit Meir</i> 117; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 154:4, 8; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:137; <i>PDR</i> 1:15, 19; 9:1542, 1551.</i></small></span>
Many authorities subscribe to the idea that <i>kefiyah li-devar aher</i> (coercion vis-à-vis another matter) is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 232; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:63. On why <i>kefiyah li-devar aher</i> does not constitute coercion that renders a divorce invalid, see <i>Hazon Ish</i>, EH 99:1; <i>Teshuvot Bigdei Yesha</i>, 36:5; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i> (2nd ed.), EH 1:73.</i> However, <i>Rabbis Hayyim Zimbalist</i> and <i>Avraham Azulai</i> added a caveat in a ruling handed down when they sat on the bench of the Tel Aviv District Rabbinical Court:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A young woman had married a man who was serving a four-year prison term in Israel for drug offenses. The wife petitioned for a divorce on the grounds of nonsupport and loss of consortium. The Rabbinical Court of Tel Aviv … directed the husband to execute the <i>get</i> but did not find any grounds … that would mandate the direct imposition of coercive sanctions, such as additional imprisonment or fines. The issue before the court was whether it was … proper to recommend parole or reduction of sentence in exchange for the husband’s executing a <i>get .</i> . . On the one hand, the <i>get</i> is the mechanism by which the prisoner may obtain his freedom, and if a person is told, “Sign the <i>get</i> or stay in jail,” this resembles duress. Yet because the imprisonment was for completely unrelated offenses, the failure to give a <i>get</i> does not, in and of itself, result in direct coercion, but simply removes the … benefits of parole that would otherwise ensue.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Breitowitz, supra n. 140, 24.</i></small></span>
Under these circumstances, though the imprisonment was unrelated to the delivery of the <i>get</i>, any recommendation of parole would render the subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> tainted by duress. The linkage of the parole recommendation to compliance with a rabbinical court’s direct­ive to grant a <i>get</i> is regarded by these decisors as coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">They cite <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, YD 134:11, which invokes <i>Torat Gittin</i>, as the source for their ruling. See also Bleich, n. 147 above, 99. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Mishnah la-Melekh</i>, <i>Hilkhot Geirushin</i> 2:20; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:26; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 132:6. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1: 63; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshua</i> 75 and <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i> (2nd ed.), EH 1: 73, who argue that mention of divorce does not invalidate any subsequent execution of <i>a get</i>.</i>
Others, including <i>Rabbis Daichovsky</i>, <i>Elyashiv</i>, and <i>Rafael</i>, see no objection to executing a divorce under such circumstances, since the husband was imprisoned for failing to repay a debt rather than as a means to compel him to divorce his wife. Since the imprisonment was unrelated to the husband’s recalcitrance in giving a <i>get</i>, a release from prison in exchange for the execution of a <i>get</i> is not, they argue, to be construed as a form of coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">3763/38, <i>PDR</i> 11:300, 302–307 (R. Daichovsky); <i>PDR</i> 16:271, 272–279 (R. Rafael), 275–276 (R. Elyashiv).</i>
A similar approach is upheld by <i>R. Feinstein</i>. As Professor Breitowitz summarizes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>In a <i>teshuvah</i> dated 5719 (1959), R. Feinstein dealt with the following situation: a husband and wife were civilly divorced and the husband was ordered by a court to pay alimony. Failing to meet those obligations, the husband was imprisoned. The wife then agreed to drop her alimony claim (for arrearages) and procure his release if he would execute a <i>get</i>, which he did. Was this a <i>get me’useh?</i> R. Feinstein ruled that it was not, and such a <i>get</i> could be executed even <i>ab initio.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Breitowitz, supra n. 140, 135, n. 391. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1: 37. See also <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshua</i> 2:75.</i></small></span>
Thus <i>R. Feinstein</i> validates a <i>get</i> granted in exchange for escaping a monetary obligation unrelated to the execution of the <i>get</i>, namely, pay­ing maintenance (<i>mezonot</i>).
<i>Rabbis Daichovsky</i>, <i>Elyashiv</i>, <i>Feinstein</i>, and <i>Rafael</i> concur in sub­scribing to the view expressed by <i>R. Moshe of Trani</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A <i>get</i> is only considered unlawfully enforced when [the husband] is coerced with regard to the divorce. But if he is coerced with regard to a different matter, and in order to free himself from that coercion he divorces his wife, [the <i>get</i>] is not regarded as unlawfully enforced.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:22 (translation from Kaplan, supra n. 124, 104–5). Based on this <i>teshuvah</i> as well as <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76, this con­clusion applies whether the husband is unwilling to pay the debt or incapable of paying it. See the reading of <i>Mabit</i>’s position advanced in <i>Teshuvot Simhat Kohen</i>, vol. 2, EH 9.<br>On the consistency of these <i>teshuvot</i> by <i>Mabit</i> with other <i>teshuvot</i>, he wrote on the matter (2:138 and 206), see R. Zvi Gartner, <i>Kefiyat Get</i>, 376–77. R. Gartner’s conclusion differs from my own. He contends that <i>Mabit</i>’s true position, expressed in 2:206 and 3:212, is that a husband’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy an independent financial claim does taint any subsequent execution of a divorce; see R. Gartner, ibid., EH 134, 379. Though the <i>teshuvot</i> on which R. Gartner bases his conclusion reflect a minority view and stand in con­tradiction to <i>Mabit</i>’s <i>teshuvot</i> 1:22 and 76, on which I base my own reading of <i>Mabit</i>, and though R. Gartner, in a written com­munication to this author, acknowledges that this minority view is not supported by other <i>Aharonim</i>, some contemporary decisors nonetheless concur with R. Gartner’s understanding of Mabit’s position. See Bleich, supra n. 138, 339; Izirer, n. 140 above, 312; Yosef Goldberg, “Duress Unrelated to Divorce” [Hebrew], 7 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (2002): 353; <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Tehorim</i>, EH 15; Uriel Lavi, “Arranging a <i>Get</i> after the Husband has Been Obligated to Pay His Wife Monetary Damages” [Hebrew], 26 <i>Tehumin</i> (2006), 160, 165. In endorsing R. Gartner’s interpretation of <i>Mabit</i>’s view, these decisors argue that we must show deference to the minority view due to the seriousness of the halakhic consequences of an invalid divorce. See J. David Bleich, “Monetary Agreement for the Purpose of Avoidance of <i>Get</i> Recalcitrance” [Hebrew], 41 <i>Or ha-Mizrach</i> (1992), 272–80.<br>In light of the internal contradictions in 2:138 as well as its inconsis­tency with two of <i>Mabit</i>’s other <i>teshuvot</i>, as well as the fact that other <i>Aharonim</i> reject this position or uphold the reading of <i>Mabit</i>’s pos­ition I have endorsed, I see no reason to factor it into decision-making on this matter. Indeed, neither R. Feinstein nor R. Rafael invoke this view. Though <i>argumenta ex silentio</i> of this sort are inconclusive, this silence of major authorities does serve to support the lenient position.</i></small></span>
As long as the sanctions applied are, from the outset, intended to address a breach of an independent claim that is halakhically legitim­ate, and are not simply a means of pressuring the husband to grant the divorce, any subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> will be valid. Just as accord­ing to <i>Rivash</i>, social shunning of one who fails to have conjugal relations with his wife does not create a <i>get me’useh</i>, so too compensating the wife for mental anguish engendered by denial of conjugal relations does not taint any subsequent divorce.
What about a sanction that is ostensibly independent of the <i>get</i>, but employed for purposes of compelling the <i>get?</i> Is the <i>kavanah</i> (intent) to introduce an independent claim at a particular point in time relevant in determining whether a divorce is coerced? How is intent to be ascertained – by noting whether anything is said about divorce when the independent claim is made, by judging the wife’s actions, or by inference from the circumstances? Some argue that even if divorce is merely mentioned, this indicates that the intent of the independent financial claim is to induce the husband to grant the divorce. If divorce is not mentioned, we can assume that the intent of advancing the finan­cial claim is to have it settled, rather than for it to serve as leverage toward procuring a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:137, s.v. <i>veto muvan</i>; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i>, EH 2:33:1–6; Gartner, ibid., 379, 386.</i>
Others contend that the focus must be the claim itself. Emotional distress generated by refusal to grant a divorce, financial coercion and blackmail on the part of the husband in the course of the negotiations, and the anguish arising from years of divorce litigation cannot serve as grounds for a monetary award. Claims for compensation for these injuries are related to the <i>get</i> and therefore contravene the requirement that the <i>get</i> be freely given. However, mental anguish due to the absence of conjugal relations is an independent claim, and therefore may be grounds for granting an award. The point in time at which the wife submitted the claim or her verbal remarks linking the claim to receiving a <i>get</i> need not be considered by the court. As we have seen, such a claim may be advanced even where divorce is not contemplated.
In our scenario, a couple had been living separately under the same roof for five years. Though the wife would have liked to engage in conjugal relations with her spouse, her husband willfully refused to have rela­tions. For the sake of their children, the couple remained outwardly married while in actuality living separately. In principle, at any time during this period of separation, the wife could have chosen to submit a claim against her husband for intentional infliction of mental anguish. For various reasons, she chose to refrain from advancing such a claim prior to deciding to be divorced, but the grounds for such a claim did exist throughout the five years of de facto separation. In other words, this claim is inextricably linked to the emotional stress engendered due to the absence of conjugal relations within their mar­riage, and not introduced merely for the sake of pressuring her hus­band to grant the divorce. The fact that subsequent to her years of anguish, the wife is being held hostage by her husband’s recalcitrance, financial coercion, and blackmail ought not impact the legitimacy of her claim, and should not serve to invalidate any subsequent execution of a divorce. Her intent in advancing the claim at this time, three years after the court’s issuance of a divorce directive, is halakhically insignificant.
Others disagree, and invalidate any <i>get</i> executed subsequent to the wife’s recourse to such a claim for damages. They maintain that even though a self-standing claim, such as a claim for payment of a monet­ary debt or the amount specified in the <i>ketuba</i>, is not linked to a request for execution of a divorce, nevertheless, if there is an established pre­sumption (<i>umdena de-mukhah</i>) that these claims were put forward pri­marily to procure a divorce, any subsequent delivery of a <i>get</i> is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 63; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i> 2:3. In a recent decision handed down by the Jerusalem Supreme Rabbinical Court, R. Zion Algerbli states:<br>There is no reason for reluctance to submit to the court a claim for tort damages for <i>boshet</i> and the like due to one spouse’s neglect of the other … even if the claim is procedurally linked to [i.e., submitted along with] a claim for divorce. However, it must be clear that the tort claim was not submitted for the purpose of pressuring the husband to grant a <i>get .</i> . . Only a rabbinical court may determine whether this claim impacts the propriety of the <i>get</i>. (7041-21-1, SRC, Mar. 11, 2008)<br>If, in the eyes of the court, the claim is self-standing and not intended to coerce the granting of a divorce, any subsequent granting of the divorce is proper. On the other hand, <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:63; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, EH 1:73; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:22; and <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshua</i> 75 all contend that the intent is irrelevant and the subsequent divorce proper.</i> However, our situation is readily distinguishable from situ­ations in which such a presumption is warranted. In our case, even if the ostensibly independent claim for damages for emotional distress was motivated by the desire to procure a divorce, it is a claim, and not an existing obligation. In the other situations, the husband grants the divorce in exchange for the wife’s agreement to release him from a financial duty, in effect saying to him, “Pay up or grant a <i>get</i>.” Our case deals with the advancement of a claim that may or may not result in the awarding of damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Many decisors contend that a husband who gives a divorce due to a threat is deemed to have been forced to grant the <i>get</i>; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:276; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Teshuvot Shem Aryeh</i> 93–94; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, EH 178:2–3; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:15 in the name of the Ridbaz. But these rulings are readily distinguishable from our case, since all deal with situations of “clear and present danger” – that is, these are cases in which a husband is being threatened with harm, imprisonment, or death if he refuses to consent to a divorce, and hence all are indeed instances of unlawfully coerced divorce. By contrast, in our case, the husband is threatened by a monetary claim too remote to rise to the level of compulsion, and especially since the amount of the potential award to the wife is, as we saw, highly variable. As <i>Tashbetz</i> comments, “If he has a remote fear of financial loss and therefore desires to give a <i>get</i>, ought one label this a coerced <i>get</i>?” See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:69. Indeed, the wife may threaten to submit a claim and never follow through with her threat; see <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 395; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i> 185; <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, gate 7, no. 18. But cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:883; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 27 and 32; and <i>Teshuvot Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 15, which argue that even a mere threat constitutes duress. See also Kaplan, supra n. 124, 98.<br>Obviously, if the rabbinical courts do begin to award damages for this claim, and it becomes a “clear and present danger” akin to the threat of imprisonment, the threat that such a claim will be submitted may render execution of the <i>get</i> coerced. However, even were such an award to become commonplace, the amount of the compensation would not be known in advance, and hence the threat remains remote; see Breitowitz, supra n. 140, 248. Moreover, if a wife threatens to cause her husband financial loss out of spite, and the husband, of his own initiative, decides to give her a <i>get</i>, her threat is not deemed duress, and the <i>get</i> is valid. See <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:11; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 1:137. A fortiori, in our case, a wife’s submission of an independent claim for damages unrelated to the divorce ought not impugn the validity of a subsequent <i>get.</i> Similarly, if there has been no threat to submit such a claim, but the husband grants the divorce because he fears that such a claim will be made if he fail to do so, this is not deemed to be duress; see <i>Teshuvot Bnei Hayai</i>, HM 2:81.</i> Since the consequences of the suit are not spelled out in advance, the putative “coercion” is too remote to rise to the level of duress. Whereas the said authorities invoke an established presumption in the context of an existing independent outstanding debt, which does entail coercion of a <i>get</i>, in our case there is no such existing debt, but only the threat that a claim for damages may be presented to the court.
Moreover, on its face, the advancement of her claim for monetary damages in order to coerce her husband to grant a <i>get</i> is analogous to the case of a husband who receives money in exchange for a divorce, which does not render the resulting divorce a <i>get me’useh.</i> As <i>R. Rafael</i> elucidates:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>One is allowed to release from imprisonment someone who is serving time for contempt of the rabbinical court [failing to produce information requested by the court], and condition his release on his giving his wife a <i>get</i>. For his imprisonment is not related to his recalcitrant refusal to grant the <i>get</i>, but is, rather, punishment for contempt of court, and he is redeeming himself by giving the <i>get</i>. And at the time, R. Elyashiv agreed with me.<br>One can promise a prisoner that his term of imprisonment will be reduced by a third in exchange for giving a <i>get .</i> . . and I hear from R. Elyashiv, long may he live, that it is clear that this is not considered a coerced divorce, and it is like [the case of] a wife who purchases her <i>get</i> for a certain sum of money – such a <i>get</i> is entirely acceptable (<i>kosher le-mehadrin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 16:271, 275–276. Whether R. Elyashiv and R. Rafael would agree that a husband’s failure to heed the rabbinical court’s ruling that he should divorce his wife constitutes contempt of the rabbinical court that may be punishable by imprisonment, and whether they would agree to a release in exchange for his granting a <i>get</i>, is an open question. The logic of their positions would seem to imply such a conclusion, but they have not specifically addressed the question of whether failing to heed a court’s divorce judgment constitutes denigration of the court; see infra at nn. 159, 170, and 176.</i></small></span>
In various rabbinical judgments “obligating divorce,” <i>R. Elyashiv</i> permits a husband whose wife does not wish to accept a bill of divorce to appease his recalcitrant wife by offering money in exchange for her accepting the <i>get</i>; the ensuing divorce is not deemed to be unlawfully coerced.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 7:111; 8:36; 9:65. R. Avraham Sherman, a student of R. Elyashiv, subscribes to his position; see 2337, SRC, Dec. 27, 2004. See also <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 35:2; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo</i>, EH 80(2); <i>Teshuvot Tzemah Tzedek</i> 262–263; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, EH 10. For a contemporary exposition, see the advisory opinion of R. Shimon Ya’acobi, legal advisor for Israel’s Rabbinical Courts Administration, in Bagatz 2609/05, <i>Plonit v. Supreme Rabbinical Court et al.</i></i> <i>Teshuvot</i> in <i>Tashbetz</i>, <i>Torat Gittin</i>, and <i>Noda be-She’arim</i> (R. Dov Berish Ashkenazi) attest to the not-uncommon phenomenon of wives absconding with their recalcitrant’s husband’s assets and releas­ing them only upon receiving a <i>get</i>. It is hardly, if ever, claimed that these were improper inducements that rendered the divorces coerced.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 4:35; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 134:4; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-She’arim</i> 6. See also <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:11 in the name of <i>Rashbatz</i>. Some authorities argue that if the wife has stolen large sums from her husband and is willing to return the money in exchange for a divorce, the sub­sequent execution of the divorce is indeed coerced; see <i>Teshuvot Tzemah Tzedek</i>, EH 262:3.</i> Financial inducements, whether to appease a recalcitrant husband or a recalcitrant wife, do not contravene the strictures against coerced divorce.
<i>R. Ezra Batzri</i>, a Jerusalem rabbinical court judge, analyzes the dynamics of such a situation as follows:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Should a rabbinical court be aware that the husband is interested in divorcing his wife, his intent to extort monies from her … constitutes coercion by way of unjustified extortion of money from the wife. Essen­tially, [any steps the court takes] do not coerce him to divorce her, since he desires to divorce his wife. He is employing the divorce as a means to achieve things improperly … As long as the husband is not interested in peace and the court is aware that the purpose of delaying the <i>get</i> is not to foster peace with his wife, but on the contrary, to cause pain and take revenge on her or extort from her monies that do not rightfully belong to him – in such a situation, there is no apprehension that the divorce is coerced.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 18:71, 81. See also <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 158; <i>Teshuvot Tiferet Tzvi</i>, EH 102; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 3:44; Gartner, n. 147 above, 244; <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, EH 15:3; Haifa District Rabbinical Court, 050562289-13-1. The same rationale is given in the context of a wife har­assing her loving husband to grant her a divorce; see <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, EH 134:22; Haifa District Rabbinical Court, 061391348-21-1.</i></small></span>
In short, financial inducements to procure a divorce do not render the divorce coerced. In effect, a wife’s willingness to waive an award for mental anguish in exchange for her <i>get</i> is no different than forgiving a debt or transferring cash for a delivery of a <i>get</i>. Hence, a wife’s claim for damages for mental anguish due to her husband’s denying her conjugal relations during the years the two were living under the same roof prior to the divorce ought to be permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Note that those authorities who argue that any discussion and/or arrangement to waive this claim in exchange for delivery of the <i>get</i> would render execution of the <i>get</i> coerced would insist that there be no discus­sion of the <i>get</i> when the claim is submitted.</i>
Given that such a claim can be put forward, how does the court proceed? Once both the husband and the wife obligate themselves to submit to the court’s resolution of the wife’s claim for mental anguish,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The parties’ signing of an arbitration agreement (<i>shtar borerut</i>) gives the court the authority to resolve this matter; see <i>Rema</i>, HM 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 12:18; Yoezer Ariel, “The Halakhic Need for a <i>Shtar Borerut”</i> [Hebrew],14 <i>Tehumin</i> (5754),147, 152; <i>Mishpatekha le-Yaakov</i> 2:405–406; Zvi Lifshitz, “Compensation for Verbal Embarrassment” [Hebrew], 17 <i>Tehumin</i> (5757), 381, 388. Assuming this decision complies with the rules of secular arbi­tration procedure, it would be legally enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States; see <i>Uniform Arbitration Act</i>, sec. 1.<br>To address claims for emotional distress, an arbitration agreement that will be halakhically binding on both parties as well as legally enforceable in civil courts should include the following clause:<br>The parties acknowledge that the <i>beit din</i> is authorized to resolve all disputes, including, but not limited to, a spouse’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations, coercion of the other spouse to engage in con­jugal relations, distribution of assets, spousal support, child support, child custody and a spouse’s refusal to give the other spouse a Jewish divorce or receive a Jewish divorce from the other spouse.<br>Signing off on this clause can be construed as a threat that either spouse may in the future assert a claim for mental anguish due to having been denied conjugal relations during the period the divorce was withheld. As we have seen, this type of threat will not impair the legitimacy of the sub­sequent execution of a <i>get</i> in order to stave off this claim or payment of an award for this claim. The divorce is valid provided that any monetary award, such as damages for <i>tza’ar-boshet</i>, is self-standing and independent of the <i>get</i>. See Daichovsky, supra n. 169, 300, and idem., “Monetary Steps of Enforcement Against <i>Mesarvei Get</i>” [Hebrew], 26<i>Tehumin</i> (5766), 173–7.</i> the court proceeds to address the claim on the merits. Upon deliberation, should the court rule in the wife’s favor and hand down an award, it will direct the husband to pay this award. Should the husband refuse to pay the <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> award, the award can be enforced in civil court. On the other hand, should the husband accept the rabbinical court’s decision, he has the option of suggesting to his wife that in exchange for a divorce, she waive her entitlement to the monetary damages awarded her by the court; the resulting <i>get</i> will not be tainted by coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">See supra at nn.153–155. See also <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, vol. 3, EH 73 (288a-b); <i>Teshuvot Zera Anashim</i>, 36; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo</i>, EH 80.</i> However, to avoid any concerns that the divorce will be deemed coerced, the monetary award should not be “excessive” and should be tenable given the husband’s financial situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Yitzhak Herzog, a <i>get</i> executed in order to escape an exorbi­tant support obligation would run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>. However, if the stipulated sum is within the husband’s ability to pay, his decision to grant a <i>get</i> is considered voluntary; see <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:1, 2. Analogously, as long as the <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> award is nei­ther unreasonable nor exorbitant, it will not render the divorce coerced.</i>
What happens if a husband refuses to proceed to <i>beit din</i> concerning a wife’s claim for mental anguish due to denial of conjugal relations? Upon the court’s determination that the husband’s refusal to comply is unwarranted, the <i>beit din</i> will issue a “contempt of court” order (<i>shtar seruv</i>), with all its attendant consequences,<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Refusal to comply with a court decision or being declared in contempt of court (<i>mesarev le-din</i>) makes one subject to being placed under a ban (<i>nidui</i>); see <i>SA</i>, HM 11:1; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, YD 3: 142:2; <i>PDR</i> 11:168–181; <i>SA</i>, YD 334:43; <i>Teshuvot Maharil Diskin</i>, rulings, 52; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 177.</i> and a dispensation for the other party to initiate proceedings in civil court (<i>heter arkha’ot</i>)<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 26:2; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 26:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 52; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 4:105. Others contend that generally or under certain condi­tions, a dispensation is not even required; see <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>Gidulei Terumah</i>, gate 62:3; <i>Tumim</i>, HM 26:7; <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, HM 26; <i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am va-Da’at</i> 3: 261; <i>Teshuvot Maharil Diskin</i>, rul­ings,13. Though some decisors will allow a person to approach a rabbi for a <i>heter arkha’ot</i>, the customary practice today is to request permission from the court; see Asher Weiss, “Permission to Litigate in Civil Court” [Hebrew], 5 <i>Kovetz Darkhei Hora’ah</i> (2006), 99, 102. Whether one requires permission from a panel of three <i>dayanim</i> or it suffices to receive permission from the presiding head of the court (<i>av beit din</i>) or a single <i>dayan</i> appointed by the community is subject to debate; see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 4:105; <i>Orah Mishpat</i>, HM 26:2; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhmah</i> 4:37. Whether one approaches a court or one’s own rabbi, it behooves the authority to hear both sides of the matter prior to issuing any dispensation to litigate in a secular court; see <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 67:5; <i>Sefer Meishiv ba-Halakhah</i>, 38–40.</i> Alternatively, prior to the wife’s request to have the <i>beit din</i> address this claim, she may ask a rabbi who has expertise in <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> and <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> whether she can proceed to civil court without a <i>beit din’s</i> permission, or, if a <i>heter arkha’ot</i> is required, whether she may approach the <i>beit din</i> that dealt with her claim or whether she is allowed to approach another <i>beit din</i> to request permission to have her claim heard in civil court. Note that a <i>heter arkha’ot</i> does not mean that the wife has a <i>carte blanche</i> to advance any and all claims in civil court. Only if the claim is legitimate in the eyes of the Halakhah can it be asserted in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Should a party recover money in civil court that he would not have been awarded in a rabbinical court, it is viewed as stolen and must be returned to the other party; see <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:290; <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Me­shulash</i> 1:19; <i>SA</i>, HM 28:3; <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, HM 26:1. There is an opinion that in cases of <i>boshet</i>, one can recover a civil monetary award which would exceed the amount awarded by a <i>beit din</i>; see <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, HM 26:2. According to most authorities, this <i>heter arkha’ot</i> is granted whether we are dealing with a claim that is provable (<i>hov barur</i>), e.g., by a creditor’s producing an authenticated document of indebtedness, or whether the claim is dis­puted, e.g., a claim for injuries. See <i>Teshuvot Imrei Bina</i> 27; <i>Yeshuot Yisrael</i> 26:2; <i>Teshuvot Orah Mishpat</i> 26:2. In the opinion of <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, which argues that a disputed claim cannot be resolved in civil court, a claim for damages for mental anguish may not be resolved there; see <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 26: <i>Hiddushim</i> (8) and <i>Bi’urim</i> (3). However, I would sug­gest that a claim for damages for mental anguish is to be subsumed under the category of provable claims, given that the abstention from sexual relations is a halakhic fact; see supra n. 73.</i>
On being summoned to the civil proceeding, can the wife assert a claim against her husband for recklessly causing her severe emotional distress in connection with their years of divorce litigation? In fact, there have been a few instances of Jewish wives lodging claims in American courts against their Jewish spouses who wrongfully refused to grant a <i>get</i>, thus inflicting emotional distress.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Roth v.

Addressing a French court’s award of compensation for a hus­band’s failure to execute a Jewish divorce, contemporary decisors, fol­lowing earlier authorities, have construed such an award as a classic example of financial compulsion (<i>ones mamon</i>), viz., indirectly securing compliance in executing a <i>get</i> by exerting financial pressure.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>D. v.

For a survey of civil jurisdictions worldwide that have awarded such compensation, see <i>Bruker v. Marcovitz</i>, 2007 SCC 54 (CanLII).</i>
The qualms expressed regarding the aforementioned claim do not apply to our claim for mental anguish due to denial of conjugal relations during marriage. As I have argued, such a claim is made solely to protect the wife’s emotional integrity. Hence, just as a rabbinical court may deliberate on the merits of such a claim, so too such a claim, submitted to a civil court, may be addressed on the merits.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), independent of physical harm or impact, has been recognized in all US states; see Robert D. Sack, <i>Sack on Defamation: Libel</i>, <i>Slander and Related Problems</i>, 3rd ed. (NY: 2005), §13.6, pp. 13–45. It appears that no action for damages for precluding a spouse from engaging in sexual relations has ever been brought before an American court. Whether American courts would rec­ognize such emotional harm is an open question. Many jurisdictions are increasingly recognizing IIED tort actions between spouses; see L. Karp, <i>Domestic Torts: Family Violence</i>, <i>Conflict and Sexual Abuse</i> (rev. ed. 2005), vol. 1, 116. New York does not allow such claims; see <i>Xiao Yang Chen v. Fisher</i>, 843 N.E. 2d 723 (N.Y. 2005). Some jurisdictions have concluded that the defendant’s conduct failed to be outrageous enough to allow the plain­tiff’s claim for IIED; see <i>Hassing v. Wortman</i>, 333 N.W. 2d 765 (Neb. 1983); <i>Nagy v. Nagy</i>, 210 Cal. App. 3d 1262 (Cal. 1989); <i>Alexander v. Inman</i>, 825 S.W. 2d 102 (Term. 1991); <i>Ruprecht v. Ruprecht</i>, 599 A. 2d 604 (N.J. 1991); <i>McCul­lob v. Drake</i>, 24 P. 3d 1162 (Wyo. 2001). Other states have held husbands liable for emotional distress, provided there was harassment or assault and battery; see Karp, 118–135. Recently, a court awarded damages for IIED to a wife whose husband refused to grant her a <i>get</i>; see <i>Tessler v. Zadok</i>, #2:08-cv-05695-R-RC (California District Ct., May 11, 2009).<br>Some states have, for public policy reasons, refrained from permitting such suits in general, and in particular those that emerge from marital differences; see Linda Berger, “Lies Between Mommy and Daddy: The Case for Recognizing Spousal Emotional Distress Claims Based on Domestic Deceit that Interferes with Parent-Child Relationships,” 33 <i>Loyola of Los Angeles Law Rev.</i> (2000), 459, 467–70; I. Ellman and S. Sugarman, “Spousal emotional abuse as a tort?” 55 <i>Maryland Law Review</i> (1996), 1269, 1285–89; B.

Orsinger, “Assert­ing Claims for Intentionally or Recklessly causing Severe Emotional Distress in Connection with Divorce,” 25 <i>St. Mary’s Law Journal</i> (1994), 1253, 1293–94. In a written communication, Marc Stern, formerly General Counsel of the American Jewish Congress, observes that given that certain states have a policy of precluding interspousal damage awards, a court may decline to enforce an arbitration award based on public policy grounds; see <i>Aleem v. Aleem</i>, 2008 WL 1945345 (MD 2008).<br>Numerous proposals for and against limiting recovery for emotional distress have been put forward. On the grounds for recognition of the tort, see <i>Restatement</i> (<i>Second</i>) <i>of Torts</i>, sec. 46, comments d, e, f and j (1965). As to the argument that First Amendment problems of entanglement of law and religion preclude the possibility that a civil court will offer relief to a recalci­trant spouse in the context of a Jewish divorce, it has been argued that there is a compelling secular interest to afford such relief; see S. Friedell, “The first amendment and Jewish divorce: A comment on <i>Stern v. Stern</i>,” 18 <i>Journal of Family Law</i> (1979–1980), 525; Redman, 416–25; David Cobin, “Jewish Divorce and the Recalcitrant Husband: Refusal to Give a <i>Get</i> as Inten­tional Infliction of Emotional Distress,” 4 <i>Journal of Law and Religion</i> (1986), 405, 425–29; Michelle Greenberg-Kobrin, “Civil Enforcement of Religious Prenuptial Agreements,” 32 <i>Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems</i> (1999), 359. On the other hand, Marc Stern contends that entertaining such claims entails entanglement of law and religion on two separate grounds: (a) Awarding such a claim involves addressing the threshold issue of whether the Halakhah mandates the grant­ing or receiving of a <i>get</i>; (b) The granting of such an award amounts to the state’s coercing an individual to comply with a religious act.<br>In Israel, given that the dissolution of Jewish marital ties is effected via execution of a Jewish divorce, the constitutional issue of establishment of religion does not arise. In fact, commencing with 2001, four judges have awarded tort damages against a recalcitrant spouse; see 19480/05, Jerusalem Family Court, Apr. 30, 2006. For additional cases after 2006, see Addendum A.</i> Furthermore, even if it can be demonstrated that the civil court will award more damages than a rabbinical court would, the wife may retain the entire award handed down by a civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, HM 26:2. In the view of Rabbis Daichovsky, Elyashiv and Z. Goldberg, prior to accepting an award from a civil court, one must ascertain the appropriateness of the amount of the award. Generally speaking, one must ask his rabbi whether the amount of the award would have been granted in a rabbinical court. If a rabbinical court would have awarded a smaller amount, then only that amount may be accepted; see M. Ralbag, “Litigating in Civil Court with the Rabbinical Court’s Permis­sion,” [Hebrew] 25 <i>Tehumin</i> (5765), 249, 251–52. However, in our case, given that it is permissible to accept a civil court award for an amount larger than may have been awarded in a rabbinical court, there is no requirement that one’s rabbi be consulted about the propriety of accepting the civil award.</i>
<b>V. Concluding Remarks</b>
We have focused on a particular type of contemporary <i>agunah</i>: the wife who seeks damages for mental anguish caused by her husband's refusal to engage in conjugal relations while a divorce is being withheld. This raises a question: given that the primary emotional trauma is due to her husband’s recalcitrance in granting a divorce rather than the denial of conjugal relations, may the wife put forward a claim for damages for this period without rendering a subsequent divorce unlawfully coerced (<i>get me’useh</i>)? More broadly, may a con­temporary <i>agunah</i>, even one who shares a domicile with her husband, but decides to seek a divorce due to irreconcilable differences or spou­sal abuse, and is met by intransigence on the part of her husband, advance a claim for mental anguish incurred during the period of her husband’s recalcitrance? In effect, may an <i>agunah</i> seek claims for emotional stress from her husband for the period of her inability to remarry and engage in conjugal relations with her husband?<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">This claim may be grounds for an award in one of the following ways. First, there is a woman’s compelling desire to be married. Alternatively, an individual who prevents another individual from performing a mitzvah can receive damages <i>min ha-din</i> (black-letter Halakhah) rather than as a <i>kenas</i> (fine). For a discussion of these claims, see the addendum at the end of this chapter.</i> We have argued that as long as the monetary obligation is not linked to the divorce, but independent, and the penalty will remain in place after the <i>get</i> has been granted, execution of the <i>get</i> will be deemed proper. In the words of <i>Torat Gittin</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he obligated himself with a penalty, should he fail to divorce her by a specific date, and he retracted and refused to divorce her until after the stipulated date, once the stipulated date passes he becomes obligated to pay the penalty even if he divorces her … And the court can mandate the penalty, and it is akin to coercing someone to pay his debt, and if he divorces her in order to free himself from paying the debt, the <i>get</i> is not deemed a forced <i>get</i>, as noted by <i>Rashbatz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Torat Gittin</i>, EH 134:4.</i></small></span>
The reasoning is that while monetary pressure is improper if the granting of the <i>get</i> will free the husband of his monetary obligation, if the penalty will have to be paid regardless of the giving of the <i>get</i>, then financial pressure is not the motivating factor in his granting the <i>get</i> and will not taint its execution. The wife may be willing to waive her right to the money in exchange for the <i>get</i>. Such a waiver is proper and no different from what transpires when the court has mandated that a husband pay a debt unrelated to the divorce, such as the <i>ketubah</i> pay­ment, and the couple mutually agree to waive payment of the <i>ketubah</i> in exchange for the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">See Bleich, supra n. 147, 272–6.</i>
In light of <i>teshuvot</i> dating back to <i>Rivash</i>, and in light of <i>Torat Gittin</i>’s exposition of the Halakhah, <i>R. Daichovsky</i> argues that a wife may collect <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> damages for the mental anguish caused by her hus­band’s conduct. As these damages relate to the husband’s conduct in the past, even if he decides to grant his wife a divorce, the damages stand and must be paid. And even if the wife waives her right to these damages, this decision will in no way impair the fitness of the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">S. Daichovsky, “Rabbinical Courts and Civil Courts: Thoughts on Their Overlapping Boundaries in Family Matters” [Hebrew], 4 <i>Moznei Mishpat</i> (2005), 261, 295–98; idem. 2006, supra n. 156, 173–7. But cf. <i>Shevet ha-Levi</i> and <i>Minhat Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 163, who argue that secular legislation mandating an award for a husband’s recalcitrance in granting a <i>get</i> is improper monetary pressure that would taint subsequent execution of the <i>get</i>. Recent Israeli rabbinical court rulings have refused, on similar grounds, to mandate delivery of a <i>get</i> in the face of such tort claims presented by women in the Israeli civil courts. See Tel Aviv District Rabbinical Court, 031783426, Aug. 4, 2005, 02786214-2, Dec. 6, 2006; Netanya District Rabbinical Court, 054568514, Jan. 29, 2007. These decisions and others can be found in <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> 19 and 27. For the most recent decision, see Netanya Rabbinical Court, 272088/6, Jan. 23, 2011. (In a situation in which it is clear that the husband is voluntarily delivering a <i>get</i> to his wife, the presence of a tort claim for <i>get</i> recalcitrance will not impact the validity of the <i>get</i>. See Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court, 364836/1, Nov. 24, 2009). However, given that the award is based on a free-standing obligation to compensate the wife for <i>tza’ar-boshet</i>, these decisors may well concur with R. Daichovsky’s view. On other potential challenges to R. Daichovsky’s position, see Daichov­sky, op. cit., 299–301.</i> Should a husband refuse to submit to the rabbinical court’s authority, a claim for damages due to <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> may be submitted to a civil court, and given the husband’s failure to heed the rabbinical court’s recom­mendation that he divorce his wife, R. Hadaya suggests that monetary penalties may be imposed on the husband for contempt of court.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96. In addition to being in contempt of court (<i>mesarev le-din</i>), the husband is also violating proscriptions against deni­grating a Torah scholar and <i>dayan</i>; see <i>SA</i>, YD 243:6–7, 334:47; HM 27:1–2. In fact, in serving as a <i>dayan</i> in the Israeli rabbinical courts, R. Daichov­sky has, pursuant to Jewish and Israeli law, directed the civil authorities to imprison recalcitrant husbands. See S. Daichovsky, “Divorce Enforce­ment” [Hebrew], 25 <i>Tehumin</i> (5765),132, 138–43. The underlying premise of this position is that imprisonment in contemporary prisons does not render a divorce unlawfully coerced; see <i>Amud ha-Yemini</i> 19 (R. Yitzhak Herzog’s opinion); <i>Mishpetei Shaul</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, EH 3:20:34.</i>
What is the purpose of providing an award for emotional distress to this present-day <i>agunah</i>? First, it is an opportunity to bring an action that provides public recognition of the intrinsic value of human dignity by formally acknowledging its violation. By invoking exigency Hala­khah, the rabbinical court is attempting to mitigate the emotional suffer­ing, and particularly the humiliation, of a vulnerable victim who is denied conjugal relations and whose husband’s intransigence pre­vents her from in receiving a divorce and remarrying.
The avoidance of shame and psychological torment is a central principle of other realms of Jewish living.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">See Alfred Cohen, “The Valance of Pain in Jewish Thought and Practice,” 53 <i>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> (2007), 25, 30–35, 47–50.</i> For instance, despite the proscription against hurting and endangering oneself, to avoid shame and relieve mental discomfort, certain types of cosmetic and plastic surgery are permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefot</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 50b, s.v. <i>bishvil; Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i> 3:11; <i>Teshuvot Mishnah Halakhot</i> 2:246–247; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 6:105:2.</i> Protec­tion of a woman’s dignity should also be extended to her emotional persona. The awarding of these damages for mental anguish gives symbolic recognition to the significance of a wife’s bodily and emo­tional integrity. Though monetary damages may not be equivalent to the emotional injury experienced, they can serve as a symbolic means of restoring a sense of personal security and autonomy.
Furthermore, a successful suit can publicly reprimand and eco­nomically penalize a recalcitrant husband who unjustifiably withholds conjugal relations (<i>onah</i>) and/or a <i>get</i>, thereby deterring other members of the community from committing the same offenses. Realizing that there may be a suit filed for this action, a husband may think twice before refusing to engage in sexual relations with his wife or withhold­ing a <i>get</i>. Finally, if the suit is successful, the award will compensate the wife to some degree for the emotional loss caused by the said assaults on her psyche.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">The primary function of tort damages is to compensate the victim for injuries, restoring him to the position he occupied prior to the tortious act; see <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Hayyim ha-Levi</i>, <i>Hilkhot Toein ve-Nitan</i> 5:2; Yisrael Gustmann, <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i>, <i>shiur</i> 6. Com­pensation for medical expenses falls under this rubric; see <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 2:16; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:23. In contrast, <i>tza’ar and boshet</i>, which are non-physical injuries, are compen­sated by imposing a monetary penalty; see <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 3:3. Clearly, given that there is no possibility of restoring the wife’s emotional persona to its state prior to the hus­band’s denial of conjugal relations, the only compensation can be a mon­etary penalty.</i>
For all these reasons, prior to endeavoring to resolve a divorce situation, the court should inform the parties that adjudicating spousal claims for emotional distress is within its purview.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the claim or the possibility of a future claim will be incorporated into the arbitration agreement accompanied by a provision empowering the rabbinical court to obligate the parties to deal with a husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations; see supra at n.156.</i> Indeed, rabbinical courts should insist that resolving end-of-marriage issues includes addressing spousal claims for mental anguish. Should a party refuse to arbitrate such a claim, a court should decline to address the other issues pertaining to termination of the marriage. Failure to insist on an all-or­ nothing approach simply encourages the already pervasive phenom­enon of shopping around for the “right” rabbinical court – namely, one that serves the husband’s needs rather than addressing all the issues in an honest and forthright fashion. Just as the court should insist on hearing all claims associated with the end of marriage, a woman should insist that all of her claims be heard in court.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">If the decisional standards have failed to establish that there is “an exigency situation” in order for a <i>beit din</i> to hear claims for <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> (see supra, text accompanying nn. 22–59), an arbitration agreement (as well as a prenuptial agreement; see supra n. 156) may be drafted to entail the undertaking of an obligation (<i>hithayvut</i>) by the parties to advance such claims. In effect, the parties obligate themselves to pay tortuous damages such as <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i> based upon a <i>hithayvut</i> rather than the laws of damages. Such a stipulation would not necessitate the need to address the systemic issue of meting out damages in contemporary times. See Avraham Sheinfield, <i>Torts</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1991), 362–3 (R. Zalman N. Goldberg’s opinion). For the underpinning of such a view in the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>’s rulings, see <i>SA</i>, HM 55:1; 175:40; <i>Rema</i>, HM 386:3; 388:2. For additional sources, see Sheinfeld, ibid., 74–75, 246, 377.<br>In principle, such an obligation may be executed via a mutual verbal commitment of the parties; see <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> 1: 42; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:168. In practice, to preempt the possibility of a potential future challenge to the authenticity and veracity of this commitment, this mutual obligation should be recorded into writing. The text of such an arbitration agreement or prenuptial agreement would include the following:<br>The parties acknowledge that the <i>beit din</i> is authorized to resolve all disputes related to a spouse’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations, coercion of the other spouse to engage in conjugal relations against her will, and a spouse’s refusal to grant or receive a Jewish divorce from the other spouse according to their discretion, pursuant to the circumstances, and obligate themselves now (<i>meshabed nafshei mei-achshav</i>) to pay tortuous damages such as <i>nezek</i>, <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i>, should they be imposed by <i>beit din</i>.”<br>In effect, the parties obligate themselves to pay tortious damages on the strength of this undertaking (<i>hithayvut</i>), rather their covenantal duty to comply with the laws of damages. See <i>Aruch ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 1:13; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Bina</i>, HM 2; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda</i> 1; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:32:3; R. Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg, <i>Yeshurun</i> 11 (2002), 602–3; and text accompanying n. 3 in Addendum B below.<br>Cf. <i>Sha’ar ha-Mishpat</i> 1:1; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i> 1:3; <i>Zeit Ra’anan</i> 2:46:1; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i>, HM 1.</i>
On the other hand, a court’s refusal to hear the claim – and if justi­fied, to award damages – effectively bestows on the injurer a kind of “halakhic entitlement” to cause the injury. The perceived weakness of the rabbinical courts can only lead to increased violation of the law, because others are seen to violate the law with impunity. Given the prevalence of the phenomenon of chained wives in contemporary soci­ety, it is not surprising that twentieth century decisors such as <i>Rabbis Herzog</i> and <i>Hadaya</i> stress the obligation to heed the words of Torah scholars (<i>mitzvah li-shmo’a le-divrei hakhamim</i>) regarding compliance with a court’s issuance of a divorce judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:1:5; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96.</i>
These words of admonishment should be applicable to our situ­ation as well. Failure to adjudicate a claim of spousally-inflicted dis­tress (assuming the conditions elaborated on above are obtained) may undermine a community’s trust and confidence in rabbinical authority in general and rabbinical courts in particular.
Hopefully, the following incident recorded in the Talmud could not transpire in our day:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>R. Rehumi who was [studying at the school] of Rava at Mahoza, used to return home on the eve of every Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Ketuvot</i> 62b, those studying Torah may leave their wives for a two- or three-year maximum. While at home, the frequency man­dated for sexual intercourse was once a week. Today, the minimal fre­quency mandated for conjugal relations is twice a week; see <i>Ketuvot</i> 61b; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 3:28.</i> On one occasion, he was so engaged in his studies [that he forgot to return home]. His wife was expecting [him any moment, saying,] “He is coming soon, he is coming soon.” As he did not arrive, she became so depressed that tears began to flow from her eyes.

Though our presentation focuses upon the right of an <i>agunah</i> to advance a claim for emotional stress against her husband who withholds a <i>get</i>, such a right equally exists for a husband who is unable to receive a <i>get</i> from his wife. However, our discussion focuses on the more frequent situation of the abusive husband.<br></i>

Addendum A

<big><strong>The Propriety of Submitting and Awarding a <i>Nezikin</i> Claim in <i>Beit Din</i> on Behalf of an <i>Agunah</i></strong></big>
<b>I.</b>
On August 17, 2011, Judge Esther Stein of the Rishon Letzion Family Court, an Israeli civil court, awarded compensation in the amount of NIS 680,000 (approximately $182,850) to a Jewish woman whose husband refused to give her a <i>get</i> (a Jewish divorce).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1This addendum is adapted from my essay, “The Propriety of Awarding a <i>Nezikin</i> Claim by Beth Din on Behalf of an Agunah,” 45 <i>Tradition</i> (Fall 2012).<br>. File No. 9877/02, Rishon Letzion Family Court.</i>
In her lawsuit, filed with a rabbinical court, the wife argued that she was physically abused and abandoned by her spouse. At times, the husband would hit her and slam her head against the wall and furniture. Additionally, he cursed her and their children. Subsequently, he ceased having relations with her and eventually abandoned the marital home.
A 2003 rabbinical court ruling recommended that a <i>get</i> should be forthcoming; subsequently, a 2004 rabbinical court decision stated that the husband was mandated to give his wife a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A full discussion of the ramifications of the distinction between a <i>beit din</i> coercing, obligating or recommending that a husband deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife, including its impact upon a recognition of the legitimacy of a <i>nezikin</i> claim, is beyond the scope of this presentation. For our purposes, in the absence of a <i>beit din</i> actually obligating a husband to give a <i>get</i>, any tort award in favor of the wife rendered by a civil court will result in a coerced <i>get</i> should a Jewish divorce be arranged. See File No. 000766955-21-1, Jerusalem Regional <i>Beit Ein</i>, 25 Iyar 5764; S. Daichovsky, “Monetary Enforcement Steps Against Recalcitrant Husbands” [Hebrew], 26 <i>Tehumin</i> (5766), 173, 176.</i> Despite these two <i>beit din</i> rulings, the husband refused to give his wife a <i>get</i>. Subsequently, the <i>beit din</i> rescinded these directives due to the husband’s insistence that the division of marital assets be addressed by the <i>beit din</i> prior to the deliverance of the <i>get</i> and due to the wife’s unwillingness to drop her civil damage suit, which she had filed in Rishon Letzion Family Court.
The Family Court held that refusal to divorce constitutes a violation of the values protected by the Israeli “Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom,” which includes freedom of choice and the right to dignity and self-fulfillment. Invoking this governing Israeli statute as well as other arguments, the Family Court awarded the wife compensation for the husband’s recalcitrance during a period of eight years in failing to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. This decision follows in the footsteps of various earlier decisions handed down by other Israeli Family Courts, which have awarded civil damages in cases of <i>get</i> recalcitrance (in which either a husband refuses to give or a wife refuses to accept a <i>get</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">File No. 6743-02, Jerusalem Family Court; File No. 19270-03; File No. 19480/05, Kfar Saba Family Court; File No. 30560-07, Rishon Letzion Family Court; File No. 18561-07, Jerusalem Family Court; File No. 24782-98, Tel Aviv Family Court. For an overview of these cases, see Benjamin Shmueli and Ayelet Blecher-Prigat, “The Interplay between Tort Law and Religious Family Law: The Israeli Case,” 26 <i>Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law,</i> (2009), 270.</i>
In this context, we will not address the halakhic propriety of the wife’s decision to file a civil claim for <i>nezikin</i> (damages) in civil court. Our focus is rather on how the <i>beit din</i> would have received such a claim for <i>get</i> recalcitrance had it been advanced before them. Essentially, the question is whether awarding monetary damages due to <i>get</i> recalcitrance can serve as a vehicle to coerce the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife, who would waive her right to the award under those circumstances. If such is the case, is the resulting divorce an instance of a <i>get me’useh</i>, a coerced – and thus invalid – <i>get</i>?
According to numerous authorities, if monetary fines are leveled against a recalcitrant husband, any subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> is unlawful.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:40; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:68–69; <i>Meiri, Beth ha-Behirah Gittin</i> 8:1; <i>Rema,</i> EH 134:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 15; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i> 38; <i>PDR</i> 15:145; 16:260.</i> Consequently, the advancement of a monetary claim to compensate for damages due to a husband’s recalcitrance in delivering a <i>get</i> is without halakhic foundation. Should such an award be forthcoming and the husband decides to give the <i>get</i> in exchange for being released from paying this debt, the subsequent execution of the <i>get</i> constitutes a <i>get me’useh</i>.
In a case similar to the one at hand, a Jewish husband was ordered by a French court to pay his wife 25,000 francs to compensate her for his refusal to deliver a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>D. v. France, 35 Eur. Comm. H. R.D.R.</i> 199 (1983).</i> In responding to the merits of this judgment, <i>R. Yitzhak Weiss</i> and <i>R. Shmuel Wosner</i> ruled that such an award is a classic example of financial compulsion (<i>ones mamon</i>), indirectly procuring a <i>get</i> by exerting financial pressures.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 8:136; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i>, vol. 5, EH 210.</i>
It is therefore unsurprising that numerous Israeli rabbinical courts require that any monetary damage claim by the wife must be withdrawn from the <i>beit din</i>’s consideration prior to deliberation regarding the propriety of a husband giving a <i>get</i> and arranging its execution. Furthermore, while a <i>beit din</i> is addressing the matter of a <i>get</i>, it will insist that any monetary damage claims being filed and/or advanced in a civil court proceeding be withdrawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See the series of Israeli <i>batei din</i> decisions found in <i>Hadin ve-ha-Dayan</i> 19 and 27.</i> In addition to the essential problem that awarding compensation may result in the <i>get</i> being tainted by compulsion, if <i>batei din</i> were to render such awards, the mere advancement of such a claim in <i>beit din</i> might motivate the husband to divorce his wife out of fear of possible financial loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:69.</i> Moreover, if the <i>beit din</i> were to impart validity to such an award and permit a wife to submit a claim even after the delivery of a <i>get</i>, a husband might feel coerced to give the <i>get</i> out of fear of a possible impending suit, resulting in a <i>get me’useh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), EH 212; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, EH 178:2–3.</i>

Given the foregoing presentation, is there any monetary claim that can be advanced by an <i>agunah</i> within the context of a <i>beit din</i> that will avoid the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In our discussion in chap. 3, we focused upon a marriage in which the wife desired to remain married and her husband refused to engage in sexual relations, and we examined a wife’s right to advance claims for her inability to have conjugal relations. Here we are dealing with “a dead marriage” where the wife who requires a <i>get</i> wants to remarry and the husband refuses to grant her a <i>get</i>.</i> Although we have seen that some authorities view any monetary duress as grounds for invalidating a subsequent execution of a <i>get</i>, other <i>Poskim</i> distinguish between different types of monetary and non-monetary coercion. Certain forms of duress will taint the subsequent execution of a <i>get</i>, while others are considered free of compulsion.
<i>Rabbeinu Tam</i> enumerates various social measures that may be imposed upon a husband under certain circumstances in order to compel the issuance of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i> 24; <i>Sefer Etz Hayyim</i> 2:198; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 88; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 102.</i> Pursuant to one account of these measures<b>, </b><i>Rema</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>They may mandate upon all individuals who are members of the community of Israel to refrain from granting him any benefit, nor engage in business with him, nor to circumcise his son, nor to bury him, until he gives her a <i>get</i> …<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema,</i> EH 154:21.</i></small></span>
As aptly characterized by <i>R. Yitzhak Herzog</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>[These measures] are not so severe that he would divorce his wife if he was in love with her, and if he divorces her, he has not acted under duress.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:1; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i>, 468–469. Cf. R. Yosef ibn Lev, who claims that “withholding benefit” is to be construed as coercion; see <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:18, 79, 3:120.</i></small></span>
These restrictions are moderate coercive measures that minimally affect the husband’s free will.
Thus, for example, <i>R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson</i> issued the following ruling regarding a wife who stole 515 silver rubles from her husband and returned 400 rubles so that her husband would give her a <i>get</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Not all monetary duress constitutes duress … 115 rubles in comparison to 515 rubles is not a lot of money, and this is not an instance of full-fledged duress (<i>ones gamur</i>). It is not worse than the <i>harhakot</i> of Rabbeinu Tam, which are not viewed as full-fledged duress.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i>, EH 262.</i></small></span>
If a man is prepared to divorce his wife for 115 rubles, a relatively small amount of money, this is indicative that he is ready to divorce her and that he is utilizing the refusal to grant a <i>get</i> as a bargaining chip to extort her for money or out of spite. In such a situation, any ensuing <i>get</i> would not be tainted by compulsion. This approach was similarly adopted by <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, and <i>R. Feinstein</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Torat Gittin</i> 143:4; <i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> EH 1:134.</i>
In our case, the civil judge of the Rishon Letzion Family Court awarded the wife approximately $182,850. Would such an award, had it been rendered by a <i>beit din</i>, constitute <i>ones gamur</i>, or if it is only a moderate form of coercion to pressure the husband to give a <i>get</i>? In accordance with <i>R. Schneerson</i>’s approach, the answer to this question is contingent upon the financial situation of the husband. In a case in which such an award would wreak financial havoc in his life, the award would be construed as coercion; in a case in which that amount would not be financially threatening, it would be valid. Coercion is measured proportionally by the <i>beit din</i>, factoring into consideration the husband’s ability to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For others who subscribe to this approach, see <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, <i>Mahadura Tanina</i>, EH <i>1:</i>70; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i> 38-41; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak,</i> EH158.<br>Subsequently, in contemporary times, R. Amar and R. Probar who serve as <i>dayanim</i> on <i>batei din</i> which are under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate, and R. Daichovsky, director of this network of <i>batei din</i> and a former <i>dayan</i> of Jerusalem Supreme Rabbinical Court have adopted this approach. See <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, EH 11; S. Daichovsky, “Rabbinical Courts and Civil Courts: Thoughts on Their Overlapping Boundaries” [Hebrew], 4 <i>Me’oznei Mishpat</i> (2005): 261, 295–8; idem., “Proportionality in Coercing a <i>Get</i>” [Hebrew] 27 <i>Tehumin</i> (5767), 300–2; Nahum Probar, “The Obligation to Give a <i>Get</i>, Return of Gifts, A Justifiable Claim – Regarding a Couple who do not Want to Remain Married,” [Hebrew], <i>Kenas ha-Dayanim</i> (5768), 109, 112.</i> Since we are unaware of the financial ability of the husband in the Israeli case, we cannot determine whether this would have been a legitimate award for a <i>beit din</i> that would not subsequently impact upon the propriety of the <i>get</i>.
Furthermore, as we mentioned in chapter 3, numerous authorities, including <i>Rivash</i>, <i>Tashbetz</i>, <i>Ranah</i>, <i>Mabit</i>, <i>Rema</i>, and <i>R. Feinstein</i>, as well as <i>R. Elyashiv</i>, <i>R. Daichovsky</i>, and <i>R. Rafael</i>, while serving on the Israeli Rabbinical Courts have argued that <i>kefiyah le-davar aher</i>, in which the coercive element emerges from circumstances unrelated to the divorce, does not constitute coercion that invalidates a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1: 63; <i>Rema,</i> EH 154:21; <i>PDR,</i> 11:300, 302–307; 16:271, 272–279, 275–276.</i> “<i>Kefiyah ke-din</i>” (legitimate coercion) avoids the problem of a <i>get me’useh</i>.
It is possible to argue that a <i>nezikin</i> claim can be advanced by the woman unrelated to divorce. As the Talmud Bavli states, “<i>tav lemeitav tan du mi-lemeitav armalu</i>” (it is better for two to live together rather to live alone), or as the Talmud Yerushalmi conveys in more strident terms, “she claims to desire marriage” (<i>tova’at le-hinasei</i>) in order to transcend her personal loneliness.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, <i>Bava Kama</i> 110b; Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Ta’anit</i> 4:6; <i>Korban ha-Eidah</i>, ad loc. The parameters of this presumption are beyond the scope of this presentation.</i> A woman has a compelling desire to be married rather than experience a life of spinsterhood. Regardless of whether this compelling desire for marital ties relates to the desire to engage in sexual relations or for the sake of companionship and security,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, “<i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i>: Annulment as a Solution to the <i>Agunah</i> Problem,” <i>Tradition</i> 33 (1998), 102, 121, n. 18. See also <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 221.</i> an inability to marry causes emotional scarring that engenders feelings of <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> (emotional stress).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">For the scope of <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> as well as how these injuries are assessed, see our discussion in chap. 3, text accompanying nn. 80–126.</i> The husband may compound the injury by dismissing the harm, arguing that one who suffers emotional pain has only herself to blame, and that such feelings are a transient psychological and/or culturally conditioned behavior pattern rather than an existential fact is open to challenge. Specifically addressing the <i>hazakah</i> (presumption) of “<i>tav lemeitav tan du mi-lemeitav armalu</i>,” <i>R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik</i> contends:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>This has absolutely nothing to do with the social and political status of the woman in antiquity. The <i>hazakah</i> is not based upon sociological factors but on a [verse] in <i>Bereishit</i>, “And thy desire shall be to thy husband” … She suffers incomparably more than the male while in solitude … It is not a psychological fact, it is an existential fact …<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This understanding of this presumption was developed in a talk delivered by R. Soloveitchik to a convention of the Rabbinical Council of America in Nov. 1975, entitled “Surrendering to the Almighty”; see the summary in <i>Light</i> (17 Kislev 5736 [1976]), 11–15, 18.</i></small></span>
Even if one would argue that <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> feelings are conditioned by psychological or cultural phenomena, Halakhah recognizes that the inability of a woman to marry may serve as grounds for a <i>nezikin</i> claim. The same can be said for a woman who wishes to have children and is emotionally distressed because her spouse’s recalcitrance in delivering a <i>get</i> makes this impossible. Halakhah recognizes the right of an injured party to file such claims. Throughout different periods of Jewish history, from medieval times until to the contemporary period, arbiters have meted out compensatory awards based upon <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> claims for defamation of character and broken wedding engagements.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 101:1, 8, 9; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 240; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:204; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 3:480; <i>Shakh,</i> HM 207:24, 333:49; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tanina</i>, YD 146; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 134, HM 181; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, YD 102; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, vol. 2, EH 3; <i>PDR</i> 3:151.</i> In 1965, invoking their power of <i>le-migdar milta</i> (protective measures, also referred to as <i>hora’at sha’ah</i>), the members of the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem, <i>Rabbis Abudi</i>, <i>Elyashiv</i>, and <i>Goldschmidt</i>, marshaled numerous <i>teshuvot</i> to support their position that damages for <i>boshet</i> can be awarded in the case of a broken engagement.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 5:322, 327.</i> Accordingly, if we posit that this is a situation of <i>le-migdar milta</i>, a wife desiring to remarry may advance a <i>nezikin</i> claim against her recalcitrant husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Implicit in one contemporary approach to this question is that <i>“migdar milta”</i> is inapplicable to the <i>agunah</i> situation. See R. Uriel Lavi, “The Arrangement of a <i>Get</i> after a Husband’s Monetary Compensation Award to his Wife” [Hebrew], 26 <i>Tehumin</i> (5766), 160, 164.</i> To state it differently, if an individual is a habitual wrongdoer with regard to a certain practice and many members of the community by engaging in this misconduct have shown themselves to be dissolute, an emergency situation exists if the individual will continue violating the halakhic norm of being compliant regarding the giving of a <i>get</i> unless he is punished.
Alternatively, if an individual prevents another individual from performing a mitzvah, the individual so precluded is entitled to receive monetary damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ktav Sofer,</i> HM 26; <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah,</i> OH 482:1; A. Sheinfeld, <i>Nezikin</i>, 306–307, n. 112.<br>This damage claim due to the inability to perform a mitzvah has been applied without explanation to the <i>agunah</i> situation by others. See Yosef Sha’rabi and Yuval Sinai, Halakhic Advisory Opinion, Netanya Academic College, June 23, 2011. The grounds for justifying such a claim is presented here.</i> Thus, if the husband prevents his wife from fulfilling the mitzvah of populating the world by having children, she may seek an award for damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Although women are exempt from the mitzvah of procreation (see <i>Rambam, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 15:2), some <i>Poskim</i> argue that the mitzvah of populating the world is incumbent upon a woman; see <i>Rashi, Yoma</i> 9b; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 110b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 32; <i>Birkhei Yosef,</i> EH 1:16; <i>Teshuvot Binyan Tzion</i> 23.</i> Even in the absence of a desire to have children, the act of marriage per se entails the performance of a mitzvah;<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 539 (Chavel edition), following in the footsteps of <i>Rambam.</i></i> should her attempts to engage in this mitzvah be thwarted<i>,</i> there are grounds for submitting a claim for damages.
In sum, a wife may submit a <i>nezikin</i> claim for <i>tza’ar</i>- and/or <i>­boshet</i>-related feelings based upon her right to marry due to her wish to engage in sexual relations and experience companionship or due to being unable to remarry and/or engage in the mitzvah of bringing children into this world. Arguably, each of these claims is unrelated to divorce and therefore halakhically legitimate as <i>kefiyah le-devar aher</i>. Although the submission of a damage claim grounded in the right to marriage clearly assumes that a <i>get</i> must be forthcoming prior to remarrying, we may still focus on the merits of the claim without linking it to a divorce procedure.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Others agree with this conclusion. For example, one contemporary posek has suggested that a <i>beit din</i> is empowered to impose monetary penalties upon the recalcitrant husband for the embarrassment and psychological pain engendered due to his intransigence in delivering a <i>get</i> to his wife. In other words, the fact that a <i>get</i> was withheld does not invalidate the right to advance various <i>nezikin</i> claims. We only construe it as financial coercion if the giving of the <i>get</i> will exempt him from the financial burden. However, if he has to pay the financial debt even if he delivers a <i>get</i>, in such a situation the financial pressure is not the cause for giving the <i>get</i>. Subsequently, should his wife waive the debt in exchange for delivery of the <i>get</i>, we are dealing with <i>kefiyah le-devar aher</i> and therefore the halakhic issue of <i>get me’useh</i> does not arise. See Daichovsky, supra n. 2, 176–8. See also <i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 17; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 134:4. The same rationale applies in our situation.</i> As long as the wife sincerely desires to remarry<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This cannot be assumed to always be the case. In many instances, upon receiving her <i>get</i>, an ex-wife will not desire to remarry. In fact, her experiences with her husband may cast doubt on her inability to identify “the right man to marry” or may generate negative feelings to the institution of marriage in general. As a result, marriage and having children no longer remain an option for her.</i> and her claim is not simply a means of pressuring the husband to deliver a <i>get</i>, any subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> will be valid, as her claims are halakhically legitimate.
What is the status of a claim that is ostensibly independent of the <i>get</i>, but employed for purposes of compelling a husband to give a <i>get</i>? Is the <i>kavanah</i> (intent) to initiate such a claim in <i>beit din</i> relevant in determining whether a divorce is coerced? How is intent to be ascertained – by noting if anything is mentioned about delivery of a <i>get</i> when the <i>nezikin</i> claim is submitted, by assessing the wife’s behavior, or by inference from the circumstances?
Many contend that the mere mention of the matter of a <i>get</i> indicates that the claim is in actuality submitted to persuade the husband to become divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 17; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 63; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshua</i> 1:26; <i>Mishnah le-Melekh</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:6.</i> The moment the <i>get</i> is mentioned, it is clear that although he is obligated to pay due to his wife’s inability to remarry, the wife is willing to waive the debt in exchange for receiving her <i>get</i>; if she is not granted the <i>get</i>, she will not waive the debt. Since the withholding of benefit is a form of compulsion,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i>, EH 41:7 in the name of R. Hananel; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rif</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:14.</i> this creates a situation of a <i>get me’useh</i>. However, if the matter of the <i>get</i> is not mentioned in the claim, we can assume that the wife’s intent is to have the <i>beit din</i> address the merits of her plea, rather than for it to serve as leverage to procure her <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak,</i> EH 2:33 (1–6); Tzvi Gartner, <i>Kefiyat Get</i>, 379, 386.</i>
Others argue that withholding of a benefit is not an act of volition,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 32; <i>Teshuvot Darkhei No’am</i>, EH 53.</i> and therefore the mention of a <i>get</i> in the <i>nezikin</i> claim will not taint any subsequent delivery of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ranah,</i> supra n. 17; <i>Teshuvot Beit Efraim</i>, EH 1:73.</i> R. Yosef Goldberg, an expert regarding the grounds for <i>kefiyat get</i>, concludes that withholding benefit should not be construed as coercion. Consequently, the mention of the <i>get</i> will not taint any subsequent deliverance of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Goldberg, “Withholding Benefit from a Man: Does it Result in a <i>Get Me’useh</i>?” [Hebrew], 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5763), 409, 433.</i>
Others contend that even a self-standing claim that is not linked to a request for the execution of a divorce is problematic if there is an <i>umdena de-mukhah</i> (a proven presumption) that this claim was put forward primarily to procure a <i>get</i>, in which case any subsequent delivery of a <i>get</i> would be invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 30; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, supra n. 22.</i>
Addressing a <i>nezikin</i> claim related to a husband’s conduct during marriage, <i>R. Tzion Algrabli</i>, in a recent decision handed down by the Jerusalem Supreme Rabbinical Court states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>There is no reason for reluctance to submit to the court a claim for monetary damages for <i>boshet</i> and the like due to one spouse’s neglect of the other … even if the claim is procedurally linked to [i.e., submitted along with] a claim for divorce. However, it must be clear that the <i>nezikin</i> claim was not submitted for the purpose of pressuring the husband to grant a <i>get</i> … Only a rabbinical court may determine whether the claim impacts upon the propriety of the <i>get</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">File No. 7041-21-1, Supreme Rabbinical Court, March 11, 2008.</i></small></span>
Yet, there are other <i>Poskim</i> who argue that the wife’s intent in advancing such a plea is irrelevant and any ensuing delivery of a <i>get</i> is proper.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ranah</i>, supra n. 17; <i>Beit Efraim</i>, supra n. 34; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yehoshua</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:22. For an understanding of <i>Mabit</i>’s view based upon an examination of his various rulings regarding <i>get me’useh</i>, see our discussion in chap. 3, n. 147.</i> Claims related to the emotional stress engendered by the husband’s refusal to give a divorce or financial coercion and blackmail on the part of the husband in the course of the negotiations, or claims relating to the anguish resulting from years of divorce litigation, cannot serve as grounds for a monetary award, as these injuries are related to the divorce. In contrast, <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> due to the woman’s desire to be married or the husband’s precluding her from performing the mitzvah of getting married and/or having children is an independent claim that ought to be validated. These rights are self-standing, independent and unrelated to her feelings linked to her existing marriage and the need to dissolve the relationship.
The woman’s <i>nezikin</i> claim proceeds either when both spouses voluntarily appear before the <i>beit din</i> or after the <i>beit din</i> issues a <i>hazmanah</i> (a summons) to the husband at the wife’s request. Once both the husband and wife obligate themselves to the <i>beit din</i>’s jurisdiction<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The parties’ signing of an arbitration agreement (<i>shtar borerut</i>) gives the <i>beit din</i> authority to resolve this matter. See <i>Rema,</i> HM 12:7; <i>Sma,</i> HM 12:18. Assuming this decision complies with the rules of secular arbitration procedure, it would be legally enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States; see Uniform Arbitration Act, sec. 1.<br><i>Should the husband fail to agree to submit to a beit din’s jurisdiction, then the wife should optimally receive permission from the beit din to litigate the nezikin claim in civil court or alternatively receive permission from a rabbinic authority who has expertise in Even ha-Ezer and Hoshen Mishpat to proceed to file a claim in secular court. See SA, HM 26:2; Teshuvot Maharil Diskin 13; Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi 4:183. Cf. Teshuvot Mishnah Halakhot, 4th ed., HM 202. For the receptivity of such a claim in civil court, see our discussion in chapter 3.</i><br><i>Here again, a monetary claim advanced in civil court would equally have to based upon the parameters outlined in our presentation rather than a claim based upon get recalcitrance. Should someone receive permission to commence a civil suit, it is extremely important that the individual consult with a rabbinic authority who has expertise in Even ha-Ezer and Hoshen Mishpat and possesses legal and jurisprudential education in order to receive competent advice in preparing a claim statement and submitting expert testimony in civil court that will avoid the strictures of a get me’useh.</i></i> to address the grounds for the divorce, the wife’s claim for either a non-excessive monetary award for <i>get</i> recalcitrance, mental anguish due to violation of her right to marry and/or have children, or her inability to perform the mitzvah of marriage and/or having children will be heard. Upon deliberation, should the <i>beit din</i> rule in the wife’s favor,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Whether a <i>beit din</i>’s willingness to render such an award requires a <i>beit din</i> to coerce, obligate, or only recommend that the parties dissolve their marriage is beyond the scope of this presentation.</i> it will direct the husband to pay damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">We leave as an open question whether a monetary award given based upon a wife’s right to marriage and/or having children should be limited lest an exorbitant amount be viewed as financial coercion resulting in a <i>get me’useh</i>.</i> Should the husband refuse to remit compensation, the award can be enforced in civil court.
On the other hand, should the husband accept the rabbinical court’s decision, he has the option of suggesting to his spouse that in exchange for giving a <i>get</i>, she waive her entitlement to the monetary damages; the resulting <i>get</i> will not be tainted by coercion. Under such circumstances of a private exchange transaction, such financial inducements, whether to appease a recalcitrant husband<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 1:67, 2:129; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo,</i> EH 80; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek,</i> EH 262–263; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer,</i> EH 167; <i>Hazon Ish,</i> EH 99:2; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 3:44.</i> or a recalcitrant wife who refuses to accept a <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Kelal</i> 35:2; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 4:35; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 143:4; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-She’arim</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak,</i> EH 1:9; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, EH 10.<br>In a series of rabbinical court decisions, R.

See <i>PDR</i> 7:111; 8:36; 9:65.</i> do not contravene the stricture against a coerced divorce in situations of “a dead marriage” in which the couple wishes to divorce.
Following in the footsteps of <i>Rivash</i>, <i>Mabit</i>, <i>R. Feinstein</i> and others, <i>R. Rafael</i> observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>One is allowed to release from imprisonment someone who is serving time for contempt of the rabbinical court [failing to produce information requested by the court], and condition his release on his giving his wife a <i>get</i>. For his imprisonment is unrelated to his refusal to grant the <i>get</i>, but is rather punishment for contempt of court, and he is redeeming himself by giving the <i>get</i>. And at the time R. Elyashiv agreed with me.<br>One can promise a prisoner that his term of imprisonment will be reduced by a third in exchange for giving a <i>get</i> … and I hear from R. Elyashiv, long may he live, that it is clear that this is not considered a coerced divorce, and it is like [the case of] a wife who purchases her <i>get</i> for a certain sum of money. Such a <i>get</i> is entirely acceptable (<i>kasher le-mehadrin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 16:271, 275–276.</i></small></span>
What happens if the exchange is conducted by the husband and wife privately, not in the presence of a <i>beit din</i>? If the wife threatened to file a claim in <i>beit din</i> and subsequently the husband agreed to grant a <i>get</i> in exchange for his wife’s willingness to refrain from submitting such a claim, would the agreement run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>? There are indeed <i>Poskim</i> who contend that a husband who gives a <i>get</i> due to a threat is deemed to have been forced to grant the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:276; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Avnei Nezer</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Teshuvot Shem Aryeh</i> 93–94.</i>
However, these rulings are readily distinguishable from our case. These <i>Poskim</i> are addressing a situation of “a clear and present danger” – that is, instances in which a husband is threatened with harm, imprisonment, or death if he refuses to consent to a divorce. They are thus indeed instances of unlawfully coerced divorce. By contrast, in our scenario, the husband is threatened by a monetary claim too remote to rise to the level of compulsion, especially since a <i>beit din</i> may not agree that they are empowered to award such <i>nezikin</i> damages<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See our earlier discussion, chap. 3, at n. 59.</i> and the amount of the award is not known in advance even should such a decision be rendered. As <i>Tashbetz</i> asks rhetorically:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If he has a remote fear of financial loss and therefore desires to give a <i>get</i>, ought one label this a coerced <i>get</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, supra n.8.</i></small></span>
Indeed, the wife may threaten to submit a claim and never follow through with her threat.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 395; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 185. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:883; <i>Teshuvot Hadashot ha-Rivash</i> 27 and 32; <i>Teshuvot Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi,</i> supra n.4; <i>Avnei Nezer,</i> supra n.9, who argue that even a mere threat constitutes duress.</i> Consequently, a private exchange should not taint any subsequent delivery of a <i>get</i>.
Obviously, if our <i>batei din</i> begin to award such damages and it indeed becomes “a clear and present danger” akin to the threat of imprisonment, the threat that such a claim will be submitted may render execution of the <i>get</i> coerced. However, even were such an award to become commonplace, the amount of the award would not be known in advance, and hence the threat remains remote.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Irving Breitowitz, <i>Between Civil and Religious Law: The Plight of the Agunah in American Society</i> (Westport, 1993), 248.</i>
The foregoing presentation affords the basis of allowing an <i>agunah</i> to advance certain tort claims in the <i>beit din</i>, albeit noting in our discussion those who challenge the propriety of such claims. In the event that a <i>posek</i> and/or <i>beit din</i> decides to render such awards, it is clear that in their mind(s) the awarding of such monies will not create a situation of a <i>get me’useh</i>. Consequently, should other <i>poskim</i> reject such an approach, any subsequent <i>get</i> rendered by a beth din after an award is made ought to be recognized by all segments of our community. In other words, though a <i>get me’useh</i> administered by a <i>Jew</i> is <i>pasul</i>, i.e., invalid,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 88b</i> nonetheless, <i>be-diavad</i> (ex post facto) the execution of a <i>get</i> under duress is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:7,20; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 48a; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 2:174; <i>Teshuvot Ma’aseh Hiya</i> (Rofe), 24; <i>Hazon Ish</i> EH 99:1; T. Gartner, <i>Kefiyah be-Get</i>, 26, 139–141, 232–233.</i> Hence, <i>Poskim</i> who reject the right of a recalcitrant spouse to advance a tort claim, <i>be-diavad</i> a subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> ought to be recognized.
Deciding between the competing arguments relating to the propriety of the different types of <i>nezikin</i> claims for an <i>agunah</i> will be the sole prerogative of the posek. The relative strength of each argument applicable to a case will hopefully be tested within the framework and constraints of future <i>piskei din</i> [halakhic decisions].

Addendum B

In our discussion, we laid the foundation for utilizing a <i>dayan</i>’s exigency authority to address <i>nezikin</i> claims. In the absence of a <i>dayan</i>’s employment of “<i>migdar milta</i>” to resolve these matters, there are three additional avenues that may empower a <i>dayan</i> to address such claims:
(1) Generally speaking, there is a requirement to maintain a <i>beit din</i> composed of <i>mumhim</i> (<i>dayanim</i> who have received ordination handed down from Moshe Rabbeinu). Such <i>dayanim</i> are empowered to award <i>kenasot</i> (penalties) including but not limited to <i>nezikin</i>. In contemporary times in the absence of <i>mumhim</i>, the power of <i>beit din</i> stems in part from the parties’ willingness to accept their authority, and the awarding of <i>kenasot</i> is therefore permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubezet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 89b, s.v. <i>ve-gedolei ha-mehabrim</i>; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 3:1; <i>Tumim</i> 1:1.</i> In effect, through the acceptance of their authority via the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking the duty to abide by the <i>psak</i> of the <i>beit din</i>), the parties agree to obligate themselves to remit such monies should an award be rendered. This obligation is effective even though the parties do not explicitly state in the <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement) that the <i>dayanim</i> may issue a decision regarding a <i>nezikin</i> claim(s) that may entail a <i>kenas</i>. Moreover, since the parties empower the <i>beit din</i> to resolve their matters in accordance with <i>peshara</i>, the panel may resolve matters dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kenasot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:93; <i>SA</i>, HM 12:2; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda</i> (Landau), HM 1, cited authoritatively by <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 1:3; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:32; Ya’akov Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i>, 187; File No. 70029-1, Eretz Hemdah-Gazit Rabbinical Court, Oct. 31, 2011.</i>
(2) Usually the couple signs a <i>shtar borerut</i> (an arbitration agreement accompanied by the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>) that authorizes the <i>beit din</i> halakhically and legally to issue a ruling. The <i>shtar</i> should specifically authorize the panel to resolve claims relating to the five types of personal injury as well as <i>grama</i>, as we have described. Although contemporary arbiters are generally precluded from addressing these <i>nezikin</i> matters, should the parties obligate themselves to accept a <i>beit din</i>’s decision regarding these claims, such a <i>shtar</i> is valid. In other words, the authority to issue a judgment is grounded in the parties’ willingness to fulfill their respective obligations – as in the case of any contractual agreement – rather than based upon the judicial capacity of a <i>dayan</i> to render a <i>psak</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Z. Goldberg, 11<i>Yeshurun</i> (2002), 602–3. This conclusion was endorsed earlier by a follower of the <i>Hatam Sofer</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Imrei Binah</i>, HM 2.</i> Alternatively, such acceptance is no different than the imparting of validity to the litigants’ decision to accept a halakhically invalid individual (such as a relative) as an arbiter.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 1:13; <i>Beit Yehuda</i>, supra n. 52.

Eliazrov’s opinion); File No. 9326351 (Appeal Decision), Supreme Rabbinical Court, Aug. 25, 2008 (R. Sherman’s opinion).<br>Cf. <i>Sha’ar ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 1:1, 2:1, who casts doubt upon the validity of such a <i>shtar</i> with regard to punitive damages. However, regarding non-punitive damages such as <i>nezek</i>, <i>rippui</i> and <i>shevet</i>, <i>Sha’ar ha-Mishpat</i> will validate such a provision in a <i>shtar</i>.</i>
(3) Even in the absence of a provision in the <i>shtar</i> which allows a panel to render a decision in matters relating to personal injury or in the absence of conditions that would render the situation as “<i>le-migdar milta</i>,” in accordance with a <i>takanah</i> (legislation) enacted by the <i>Geonim</i> and “the minhag of <i>batei din</i>” (the practice of rabbinical courts), a panel is empowered to employ its discretion in determining the amount of the monetary award, and they will inform the batterer that this amount will appease the victim. This amount will be final even if the figure arrived at by the panel is unacceptable to the victim. As elucidated by the <i>Poskim</i>, the grounds for this award are to deter others in the community from emulating the batterer’s conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Geonim</i> (ed.

Part II; Rabbinic Authority; The Reality

Chapter 4; Decisions in Even haEzer

a) Division of Marital Assets upon Divorce

<b><i>A. Division of Marital Assets upon Divorce</i></b><br><b><i>Rachel Levy v. Reuben Levy</i></b>
On June 1, 2010, the above parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve this matter according to applicable portions of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Poskim</i>. A divorcing couple, Reuben Levy and Rachel Levy, residents of Los Angeles, California, submitted to this <i>beit din</i> their differences of opinion and disputes in reference to a family business which was unincorporated. Having given said matters due consideration and having heard all parties testify as to the facts of said disputes, this panel does decide and agree as follows:
<b><i>Tova’at</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tova’at</i> admits that she did not share equal decision-making powers in the day-to-day operations of the business, and on various occasions expressed opposition to the management policies of the company. In cases of disagreement between them, Rachel was compelled to accede to her husband’s decision. Moreover, there were periods when she was dedicated primarily to serving as a homemaker and raising their children and was completely uninvolved in the business.
Nevertheless, Rachel argues that she invested $50,000 into the business venture from monies received from a family inheritance and is entitled to a fifty percent share of the value of the family business partnership. Furthermore, given that her husband managed the business, the accrued debts of the business should be her husband’s responsibility. Moreover, although Rachel signed off on various commercial transactions, including but not limited to loan commitments, given her non-involvement in the day-to-day decisionmaking of the business, she should be exempt from any responsibility to pay-off these loans.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Counterclaims</b>
Reuben admits that his wife was the bookkeeper, as well as the individual who dealt with the suppliers while he engaged in the trade. In the minds of both parties, this was a family business.
Given that the majority of the required capital to start the business which totaled $300,000 was contributed from Reuben’s family inheritance, the value of the business should be divided up proportionate to the couple’s respective investment. Finally, given his wife’s co-signature on the various loan agreements, the <i>Nitva</i> claims that responsibility of the debts incurred by the business should be shared by both parties equally.
<b>Discussion</b>
The <i>beit din</i> must address two questions. First, is Rachel entitled to an equal share in the value of the business? Second, is she responsible to pay a portion of the debt incurred by the enterprise?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The implicit assumption here is that we are dealing with a commercial enterprise, such as a general partnership, in which there exists personal responsibility for debts.</i>
<b>1. Two Types of <i>Isha Noseit ve-Notenet Betokh ha-Bayit</i></b>
We will begin by addressing the issue of the wife’s responsibility for debt incurred in the operation of the family business in the context of the notion of “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit</i>,” “a wife engaging in business in the home.” The Mishnah in <i>Shavuot</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>And these take an oath, although there is no definite claim: partners, tenants, administrators, the wife who manages the affairs of the home …<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shavuot</i> 7:8.</i></small></span>
Even though the claimant does not advance a definite claim of fraud against them, but only suspects this group of individuals, the Mishnah states that they must take an oath to refute the charge. Some authorities explain the woman described in this Mishnah is engaged in a business,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>, ibid.; <i>Rashi, Shavuot</i> 48b<i>,</i> s.v. <i>ve-ha-isha ha-noseit</i>. In other words, the woman is running a family business rather than merely having “the run of the household.” See <i>Shavuot</i> 7:8; <i>Shavuot</i> 45a.</i> and in her commercial dealings she is acting as her husband’s agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Ha-Raban</i> 115; <i>Maharshal</i>, <i>Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 8:29; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 190; <i>Shakh,</i> HM 96:9; <i>Teshuvot Shoel u-Meshiv</i> (3rd ed.) 2:18, <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 96:8.</i>
Under such an arrangement, a merchant would extend credit and sell to a married woman, relying on the knowledge that should she refuse to pay, Halakhah would charge these purchases to the husband. Under such circumstances, the halakhic discussion revolves upon the extent that the husband is liable for his wife’s commercial dealings, included but not limited to loan transactions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rema,</i> EH 86:2 and 96:6, and <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 189, who reject a husband’s liability for his wife’s debts which were incurred due to her active involvement in commercial trade. Cf. <i>Shakh</i>, HM 62:8.</i> Adopting such an approach that “the wife who manages the household” is the husband’s agent may lead one to the conclusion that she is authorized only in executing small businesss deals and/or should her husband protest that he had never authorized her to act in his name, then she is not deemed an agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 13:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 189; <i>Maharshal</i>, supra n. 4.</i>
However, there may be situations where a wife may singlehandedly operate her husband’s affairs. <i>R. Ovadiah Hadaya</i>, a twentieth century Israeli <i>dayan</i>, addresses a situation in which a woman supported a Torah scholar with large sums of money and the scholar subsequently discovered that the disbursement of these funds was done without the permission of the woman’s husband. Here, we are dealing with a different type of “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit</i>.” Describing the wife as an owner rather than merely managing the husband’s property, <i>R. Hadaya</i> writes:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 5, YD 36.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It is clear from his actions that he allows her to be involved in trade and use the assets just as a person would use his own property. He brought the items to the store while she was the manager whom all the customers viewed as the owner. Therefore, his actions demonstrate that she was serving not merely in the capacity as a manager, but as a <i>ba’al ha-bayit</i> [owner], and since without her he could do anything in the businesss, she is permitted to use his property … He cannot object to what she has already done …</small></span>
In our scenario, the <i>Tova’at</i> was viewed by her customers as an owner in the business. Nevertheless, her absence from the business for an extended period of time, as well as her noninvolvement in the major decision-making of the business, approximates the first type of “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit</i>,” who serves as her husband’s agent in managing his business. Adopting this model of “a wife managing a business” would exempt the <i>Tova’at</i> from repaying the outstanding commercial debt<i>.</i> If we indeed adopt this perspective, the husband is solely responsible for debt repayment, even if the wife co-signed the loan.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 4. In case of a husband who is incapable of satisfying the debt, should a wife possess assets, the creditor may recover from her; see <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Sma</i>, and <i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 4. Some argue that a creditor’s ability to proceed against the wife is contingent upon the fact that she actually signed the loan agreement; see <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 77:11; <i>Beit Meir</i>, EH 102:2.</i>
<b>2. Marriage as an Economic Partnership</b>
Another approach to this question focuses on the nature of the marriage relationship. <i>R. Abraham Sharezee</i>, a contemporary <i>dayan</i> serving on the Rabbinical Court Sha’arei Mishpat in Netanya, Israel, observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Even though the act of establishing marriage has not changed, and it will never change … nonetheless, in monetary matters there are changes and continue to be major changes, due to a change in mentality and social mores … The unifying force of all these changes is the improvement of the position of women and the transformation of her being a wife to being a full partner, or almost a complete one … in sustaining the home, and the husband being transformed into a partner whose rights and monetary obligations have undergone a change.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mehalhei Mishpat</i> (Netanya), p. 95.</i></small></span>
Certain elements of the marriage agreement have not changed, despite changes in society. Thus, the creation of <i>kiddushin</i> remains a consensual agreement that designates a particular woman for a particular man and prohibits her to all others.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>SA</i>, EH 26, 37, 38, 39, 43 and 44; <i>Kiddushin</i> 2b.</i> Subsequently, the act of <i>nissu’in</i> instates the husband’s monetary obligations, such as spousal support.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Should the couple agree to waive this duty, however, the agreement would be valid, provided that it is formalized in accordance with Halakhah.</i> At the same time, financial elements of the marriage relationship have been effected by societal change. Thus, although many of a wife’s assets are halakhically owned by her husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See infra text accompanying n. 40.</i> the Halakhah allows spouses to determine their own business relationship provided that any agreements between the couple complies with the proper form (for example, entailing a <i>kinyan</i>) and does not violate any prohibitions, such as theft or the interdict against taking interest.
Consequently, if spouses decide to create a business based upon shared ownership of assets, that is their prerogative. Such an agreement is valid and binding not by the virtue of the act of marriage, but rather because the rule in all financial matters is that any individual “may stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, HM 344:1.</i>
Even in the absence of such an arrangement, <i>R. Sharezee</i> argues that <i>nissu’in</i> is an economic partnership and the following general ruling of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> therefore applies to it:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The partners who deposited in a common purse, one placed a manna, the other two, and the other three, and together they engaged in a business and they lost or profited … their profits or losses are shared equally according to their investment share, rather than according to the number of investors.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 176:5; see also HM 176:3. Clearly, a family business cannot be equated in every sense to a commercial partnership. Although some decisors argue that disputes between partners may be justification for partnership dissolution, only a mutual agreement between the spouses during marriage, a mutual agreement of the parties to divorce, or a <i>beit din</i> directive to the spouses to execute divorce would lead to dissolution of a family business.</i></small></span>
The position that a marriage may be viewed as a commercial partnership <i>under certain circumstances</i> has been subscribed to by <i>R. Isaac Herzog</i>, <i>R. Yitzhak Graubard</i>, <i>R. Yoezer Ariel</i>, <i>R. Uriel Lavi</i>, <i>R. Daichovsky</i>, and others.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 206; <i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>, vol. 9, HM 33; <i>Teshuvot Havalim ba-Nei’imim</i>, vol. 5, EH 34; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i> 1:48; Shlomo Daichovsky, “Liquidating the Partnership and Dividing the Assets of the Spouses” [Hebrew], <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> 16–17 (5750–5751), 501, 508; idem., “The <i>Halakhot</i> of Marital Partnership: The Law of the Kingdom?” [Hebrew], <i>Tehumin</i> 18 (5758),18; <i>PDR</i> 11:116; File No. 9061-21-1, Netanya Regional Rabbinical Court, Ploni v. Plonit, June 26, 2006; File No. 14850-1, Ashdod Regional Rabbinical Court, Plonit v. Ploni, Sept. 19, 2010; File No. 347562-1, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Rabbinical Court, Ploni v. Plonit, Sept. 13, 2011.<br>Some authorities argue that the spouses must sign an agreement that explicitly states that their marriage is based upon an economic partnership. See <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:23; Ya’akov Ariel, “The Modern Family Unit – Halakhic Implications” [Hebrew], 22 <i>Tehumin</i> (5762), 129, 145. In fact, sharing equally in profits is predicated upon the existence of a family business partnership; see <i>Rema</i>, HM 287:1. In other words, it is the explicit agreement of the spouses to engage in a business partnership, rather than the act of marriage per se, which creates the partnership. Addressing our halakhic matter of allowing a couple to create a partnership based upon a shared ownership of assets, Ben Tzion Schereschewsky, former Israeli Supreme Court Justice states, “The agreement is validly created and binding not by virtue of the act of matrimony, but rather because we are dealing with financial matters, and the principle in financial matters is that a stipulation is valid.” See Civil Appeal 514/76, <i>Demari v. Demari</i>, Israel Supreme Court Decisions 31(2), 505, 514.</i>
Based on such an understanding, should spouses create a family business, we neither seek to identify who infused the most capital into the venture nor who invested more time and effort in developing its growth. Upon dissolution of the family venture, whether during the time of the marriage or upon divorce, any profits and losses will be shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective investment in the venture and the net value of the enterprise will be distributed equally among the parties, unless there is a marital agreement which provides otherwise.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, the recovery of profits is to be subsumed under the category of <i>“davar she-lo ba le’olam</i>” (something which is not yet in existence) and therefore one cannot transfer such assets to a partner. Nevertheless, given that there are <i>Poskim</i> who will validate a verbal agreement between partners without undertaking a <i>kinyan</i> or recognize that the formation of a partnership is a <i>“kinyan situmta”</i> (a commercial practice) and commercial practice allows for the recovery of profits, therefore such recovery is valid. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 176:6; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, ad. locum.; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:380; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meshiv</i>, vol. 1 (2nd ed.), 2, 39; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 20, 66, 96, 99; <i>Teshuvot Bris Ya’akov</i> HM 99.<br>Lest one argue that the transfer of profits is “<i>davar shein-bo mamash</i> (something intangible) and therefore ownership cannot be halakhically-legally effective, nevertheless, there are <i>Poskim</i> who argue that if the <i>minhag</i> or secular law <i>(dina de-malkhuta dina</i>) allows such a transfer, the acquisition is valid. See <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i>, 3rd ed., 91, 141; <i>Hazon Ish, Bava Kama</i> 23:2; <i>PDR</i> 2:376, 382; 5:310, 316; 8:47, 52.</i>
<b>3. The <i>Tena’im</i> Contract</b>
There are additional grounds as well to argue that this family enterprise rests upon the foundation of halakhic partnership law. In some communities, it is customary to sign a <i>tena’im</i> document upon the occasion of an engagement (<i>shiddukhin</i>), which enumerates various parental obligations and the anticipated month of the wedding (or the actual wedding date). It stipulates that the parties have fulfilled all of their mutual obligations and should refrain from any fraudulent conduct. This “contract” concludes that “they will control their assets equally” and a monetary penalty will be paid should a party to the agreement default.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For differing formulations of this agreement, see <i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 7–8; <i>Tikkun Soferim</i> 11; <i>Zera Avraham</i> 11. For guidelines in drafting this document, see <i>Sma</i>, HM 243:12, 245:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 112 and 135; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzchak</i> 1:111; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, YD 236.<br>For the halakhic consequences of reneging on such an agreement, see my “Breach of Promise to Marry,” 17 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2007): 267 and this writer’s “The Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective,” in Aaron Levine (ed.), <i>The Oxford Handbook on Judaism and Economics</i> (NY: 2010), 340.</i> This clause has been interpreted to mean that all assets acquired during marriage, as well as all debts incurred during marriage, are to be shared jointly between the spouses.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Daichovsky, supra n. 15.</i>
Assuming the spouses originally signed a <i>tena’im</i> document, the agreement is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i>, YD 65; <i>Shulhan ha-Ezer</i> 1:51:4.</i> In fact, based upon such a contract, both <i>Mahari Weil</i> and <i>Maharik</i> ruled against a husband who fraudulently transferred his wife’s assets to a third party during the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 134; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 57.</i> Similarly, <i>Maharam Mintz</i>, <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Maharsham</i>, and <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> rule that in certain instances, a wife’s use of her husband’s assets for giving <i>tzedakah</i> may be construed as a misappropriation of another’s property and violation of the <i>tena’im</i>, which stipulates that such behavior constitutes a fraudulent use of her husband’s assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 7:3; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Tanina</i>, YD 158; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:45; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, vol. 2, EH 32.</i>
Given that these sources invoke the <i>tena’im</i> regarding the utilization of a husband’s assets for certain domestic and social needs, some have argued that one cannot expand the scope of the application to recognition of a full-fledged partnership of assets between spouses.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A. Sherman and S. Daichovsky, “The Law of Marital Partnership – Non-Recognition in Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 19 <i>Tehumin</i> (5759), 205, 209.</i> Others, however, maintain that the <i>tena’im</i> indeed creates an economic partnership. For example, <i>R. Avraham Menachem Steinberg</i>, a twentieth century <i>posek</i>, rules that pursuant to the above provision in the <i>tena’im</i>, if a wife receives a business from her husband and it is registered in her name, upon dissolution, she must give half of its value to her husband, while she may retain the balance for herself or give it to a third party.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahazeh Avraham</i>, vol. 2, HM 19. See also, Daichovsky, supra n.15. Subsequently, R. Daichovsky changed his mind and agreed with R. Sherman; see Daichovsky, supra n. 22, 216.</i>
Because the <i>tena’im</i> document is a bona fide halakhic-legal contract, should one of the spouses claim that he did not understand what he signed, he would remain liable for any of his infractions of the <i>tena’im</i>’s terms.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 45:3; <i>Teshuvot Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> 2:17:2; <i>Teshuvot Rash ha-Levi</i>, EH 14.</i> In modern times, only two witnesses sign the actual <i>tena’im</i>, while the content of the document is conveyed orally to the prospective spouses.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i>, YD 66; <i>Keter Shem Tov</i>, p. 596.</i> If this information was properly transmitted or the parties were familiar with the contents of the <i>tena’im</i>, the document is considered a valid contract and, in that sense, is no different from a <i>ketubah</i>.

In our case, prior to the signing of the <i>tena’im</i> by two witnesses, the prospective couple was duly informed regarding the import of the document. As such, the <i>tena’im</i> may serve as one of the potential grounds for dividing the marital assets equally between the spouses.
It is important to note, however, that some authorities reject the legal significance of the <i>tena’im</i>, given that the prospective couple does not sign it themselves and it is not drafted as a bona fide <i>shtar</i> mutually obligating the couple to recognize marriage as an economic partnership. These decisors argue that the phrase, “They will share their assets equally,” is simply a “<i>shufra de-shtarah</i>,” an embellished clause added for stylistic purposes that has no halakhic import.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am ve-Da’at</i> (3rd ed.) 181; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzchak</i>, EH 1:110.</i> However, in reply to this position, relying upon <i>Rosh</i>’s opinion, <i>R.

<b>4. <i>Umdana</i> and <i>Minhag Ha-Medinah</i></b>
Given the problematic nature of the effectiveness of <i>tena’im</i>, are there any other grounds for arguing that marriage can be predicated upon a model of partnership?
Halakhic decisors have debated the extent of the applicability of the principle of “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>,” “the law of the kingdom is the law.” Does this mean that civil law must be adhered to even if the Halakhah makes no such demand, or does it imply that civil law may override Halakhah when the two differ? In the opinion of <i>Rema</i>, civil law may govern all legal matters that are “<i>le-takanat bnei ha-medinah</i>,” for the benefit of the citizenry, understood by <i>Rema</i> as referring to any issues relating to social interaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, HM 369; <i>Rema</i>, HM 73:14, 369:11.</i> Vigorously disagreeing with <i>Rema</i>, <i>Shakh</i> argues, and <i>Hazon Ish</i> concurs, that if the particular secular law contradicts Halakhah, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> does not apply<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, HM 73:39; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1.

<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The law of the kingdom [civil government] determinates the expectation of people.

Interestingly, Hazon Ish finds precedent for his position in the Ra’avad’s ruling cited by <i>Shakh</i>, HM 73:36. However, a review of that ruling indicates that the invoking of the <i>umdana</i> is limited to instances in which the Halakhah fails to address a situation and the resolution of the situation can be realized by invoking an <i>umdana</i>, while Hazon Ish argues that it is inconceivable that there is any gap in Halakhah. Halakhah as a religious-legal system has the capacity to address all situations based on its own sources and rules of interpretation. As such, by citing Ra’avad’s position, Hazon Ish extends Ra’avad’s affirmation of the workings of an <i>umdana</i> even if the Halakhah provides a contrary solution! Others limit the Ra’avad’s ruling to situations in which the Halakhah regarding a particular matter is subject to diverse opinions; see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:128.</i></small></span>
For example, Israeli civil legislation dictates terms of tenancy (the Law for Tenant Protection). <i>R. Shlomo Karelitz</i> argues in the name of his uncle, <i>Hazon Ish</i>, that absent any agreement to the contrary between a landlord and tenant, there is implicit expectation, an <i>umdana</i>, that the terms of tenancy will be based on civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, p. 360.</i> However, in the absence of a clear indication that the parties wish to adopt civil law, the assumption is that Halakhah is the governing system.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1, 5, 9. The question of how non-observant divorcing couples should be treated is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i>
In effect, the implementation of Halakhah may be predicated upon the expectations of people to follow halakhic tenancy law. The fact that a secular law exists regarding the matter may cause a change in the expectation; although it was originally clear that halakhic tenancy law would be adhered to, there is now a desire to follow secular law. Consequently, the Halakhah changes due to the change in the <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinnei Boreruth</i>, 68. For an extensive list of contemporary <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to this view, see Dov Frimer, “The Influence of Israeli Law upon Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 39 <i>Jewish Studies</i> (1999), 133. R. Sherman challenges this conclusion, arguing that an <i>umdana</i> rooted in non-Jewish practices is ineffective; see Sherman, supra n. 22, 210–1. Cf. my “Varying Approaches Towards the Division of Matrimonial Property upon Divorce” [Hebrew], 71–72 <i>ha-Darom</i> (5761), 129, n. 46, which provides a list of <i>teshuvot</i> that affirm reliance upon non-Jewish practices in monetary matters. Despite his view of the validity of <i>umdana</i> in this context, R. Sherman legitimates adjudication in <i>beit din</i> according to secular law if the spouses agree that their monetary affairs will be resolved in this manner; see infra n. 21. Other Israeli <i>dayanim</i> view the civil legislation dealing with monetary relations between spouses as “<i>minhag ha-medinah</i>” (national custom), and a resident of Israel is obligated to comply with such legislation. See Netanya Regional Rabbinical Court, File no. 764411/1, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>, Oct. 3, 2010.</i> Invoking this <i>umdana</i> regarding tenancy law has been endorsed by other authorities as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:86; <i>PDR</i> 16:312.

See <i>Teshuvot Maharash</i> 6:19; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 1:72. Cf. R. Moshe Sofer and R. Z.

If the parties must know of the usage, if one party claims that he was unfamiliar with the expectation of following secular law regarding dividing up marital assets, then it becomes the other party’s responsibility to demonstrate that such an expectation in fact exists. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 42:36, 61:5, in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Erekh Shai</i>, EH 50:7; Michael Wygoda, <i>Agency Law: Section 5</i>, Israel Ministry of Justice [Hebrew], n. 390.<br>If everyone follows the <i>nohag</i>, claiming that one does not subscribe to it, will be no defense. However, in monetary matters, should there be a minority who fails to follow the <i>nohag</i>, such a claim will be accepted; see <i>Teshuvot Nahal Yitzhak</i>, vol. 1, HM 61.</i>
The underlying rationale for legitimizing this approach is that the parties essentially agreed to resolve their issues according to their expectations, which in our situation means following secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 30–32.</i> In the words of <i>R.

While Halakhah itself is immutable, the fact that an <i>umdana</i> can serve as a basis for adopting civil law over the Halakhah in monetary matters is essentially built into the Halakhah itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b.</i>
As such, absent any violations of <i>issurim</i>, which can never be overridden by civil law, this rule would equally apply to spousal property arrangements. In a civil system of community property, spouses own equally almost all property acquired during the marriage, regardless of in whose name the property is. In our case, the spouses are residents of such a state and therefore had expectations that its rules would be implemented. In other words, there is an <i>umdana</i> that should divorce occur, their marital assets would be divided up equally.
In bold contrast to <i>Hazon Ish</i> and <i>R. Feinstein</i> who define the <i>umdana</i> as the parties’ expectations emerging from secular law, <i>R. Herschel Schachter</i> contends that there is an <i>umdana</i> that the couple views the marriage as a partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">R. Schachter – oral communication with this author on Sept. 28, 2012.</i> For example, if the real estate title of a home is in the name of the husband, absent any extenuating circumstances to the contrary, the home belongs to both the wife as well the husband. The differing conceptions of the <i>umdana</i> has practical consequences. For the <i>Poskim</i> who view the parameters of the <i>umdana</i> through the prism of secular law, the result will be that the nature of the economic partnership as perceived by the couple will vary from state to state. Those couples who reside in a state which recognizes community property principles relating to the division of marital assets will expect that both spouses are entitled to an equal share of the marriage. Other couples who reside in a state which have adopted equitable distribution rules for dividing up marital assets will expect that both spouses are entitled to an equitable share of the marriage, each share being equal or a certain percentage of the value of the marital asset. And depending on the individual state law, the assets which are to be divided up may be limited to tangible assets such as a home, a car or a business to the exclusion of career assets. On the other hand, in accordance with <i>R. Schachter</i>’s understanding of the <i>umdana</i>, regardless of where the couple resides the partnership model of marriage may dictate that under all circumstances each spouse is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Adopting such a perspective does not mean that all monetary aspects of the marriage reflect an economic partnership. For example, absent any express agreement to the contrary, the husband is obligated to support his wife and provide any necessary medical care for his spouse. Similarly, though a husband will inherit his wife’s estate upon her death, the wife does not inherit his estate upon his demise.</i>
Some contemporary authorities have argued that <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, customary national practice, should govern the division of marital assets upon divorce, irrespective of <i>umdana</i>. Today, the notion of marriage being an economic partnership is ensconced in the American societal mindset; this concept is part and parcel of the legal fabric of every state which operates a system of equitable distribution or community property.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Lenore Weitzman, <i>The Marriage Contract</i>, (NY: 1981), 85–8; Caleb Foote, Robert Levy, and Frank Sander, <i>Case and Materials on Family Law</i> (Boston: 1985), 610–19.</i> In fact, women in observant Jewish families, like their counterparts in the general populace, are in many cases partners with their husbands in maintaining the economic stability of their family. In certain situations, the wife is actually the sole or major breadwinner. As such, the <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> is not only a reflection of or legal reality, but equally a mirror image of our social reality.
Although the halakhic matrimonial property system rejects this doctrine of economic partnership, <i>R. Daichovsky</i> and <i>R. Ariel Yanai</i> argue that a couple may opt to accept <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> in matters involving the division of marital assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 21, 217.</i> <i>R. Yanai</i> contends that <i>minhag</i> has the power to override Halakhah as long as the Halakhah is not completely nullified. Therefore, as long as the division of marital assets based upon the adoption of a community property or equitable distribution system will continue to provide the husband a share in the assets, such a division is acceptable. Only if adoption of one of these systems were to preclude the husband from receiving a share of the marital assets would it be tantamount to a <i>minhag</i> uprooting the halakhic matrimonial property system and it would then be prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Netanya Regional Rabbinical Court, File No. 764411-1, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>, Oct. 3, 2010. For precedent to this ruling, R. Yanai cites various <i>teshuvot</i> in the context of <i>yerushah</i> (inheritance law); see <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:292, <i>tikun</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 8, cited by <i>Rema</i>, HM 281:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 304; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 2:19; <i>Teshuvot Ridbaz</i> 1:545. It is difficult, however, to argue that the case of division of marital assets parallels that of <i>yerushah</i>. Regarding inheritance law, there is a biblical prohibition against a testamentary disposition that contradicts the Torah’s laws of inheritance, as the Torah states that it is “<i>hukat mishpat</i>” (<i>Bamidbar</i> 27:11). Thus, this is not entirely a monetary law, and <i>minhag</i> therefore does not have the power to override it entirely, as per <i>Ketuvot</i> 83a-84b. A <i>minhag</i> regarding inheritance is valid only if it does not entirely override the Halakhah. The division of marital assets, however, is entirely a monetary matter, and <i>minhag</i> should therefore have the power to override the halakhic system completely. R. Daichovsky concurs with this conclusion; see supra nn. 15 and 22.</i>
On the basis of recognizing the <i>tena’im</i> as a valid contract and invoking an <i>umdana</i> or <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, <i>R. Ariel</i>, <i>R. Daichovsky</i>, <i>R. Lavi</i>, <i>R. Avraham Schindler</i>, <i>R. Shlomo Shapiro</i>, <i>R. Sharezee</i>, and <i>R. Yanai</i> have resolved marital disputes based on the notion of the existence of an economic partnership between spouses. Accordingly, Rachel, a resident in a state governed by a community property system, must fulfill the expectations of that system. The debts incurred in a family venture during her marriage are therefore debts of the couple and the responsibility to pay them must be shared jointly.
<b>5. Monetary Award for a Wife’s Contributions to the Domestic Household</b>
Classically, rabbinic decisors dividing a couple’s assets upon divorce have been guided by a three-fold classification system. <i>Nikhsei tzon barzel</i> refer to the wife’s assets held by her husband; he is responsible to provide her with either the actual asset or its value upon divorce, while any appreciation or depreciation belongs to the husband. <i>Nikhsei melug</i> refers to the wife’s estate, of which the fruits belong to him without responsibility for loss or deterioration. These assets must be used by the husband for the benefits of the marriage. Finally, a wife may receive property as a present which the donor stipulates that the husband has no control over.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This three part division has been discussed by Ben Tzion Schereschewsky, former Israeli Supreme Court Justice and expert on halachic domestic relations, in Menachem Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem: 1975), 390–2.<br>Beyond her property rights, a wife receives certain monetary rights during marriage, including but not limited to support (including food, clothing, the cost of lodging, and reimbursement for medical care) and, upon divorce, the right to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i>
Based upon this matrimonial property regime, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, in our scenario, the wife would not receive any share in the value of the family business.
However, beginning in the late nineteenth century, culminating in a twentieth century <i>teshuvah</i> of <i>R. Ben Tzion Uziel</i> and a series of Israeli rabbinical court decisions spanning a period of over fifty years, <i>batei din</i>, utilizing their discretionary authority, have awarded monetary awards to a wife for her role as a homemaker and\or child caretaker, based on the financial capacity and economic future of her husband as well his current income.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Simcha la-Ish</i>, EH 5, 33; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, EH 96; Z. Warhaftig (ed.), <i>Ossaf Piskei Din shel ha-Rabbanut ha-Rashit le-Yisrael</i> (hereafter: <i>Ossaf Warhaftig</i>), File 1/6/705, 72; ibid., File 1/30/705, 83; ibid., File 1/12/704, 38; ibid., File 1/16/04, 39; <i>PDR</i> 1:129; 2:289; 7:157; 8:274; 12:124; File 1/22/1510 (Sept. 7, 2004), Supreme Rabbinical Court, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Almonit</i> (R. Daichovsky).</i> In fact, in two of the earliest Israeli Rabbinical court rulings regarding such matters, the <i>beit din</i> awarded a monetary share in a husband’s business due to a wife’s involvement in the development of the business and due to her contributions in childrearing and managing the household.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ossaf Warhaftig</i>, File 1/30/705, 83, 157; <i>PDR</i> 1:129, 138. In contrast, Rabbis Eliezer Goldschmidt, Ovadiah Yosef, Eliezar Waldenburg, and Avraham Sherman refrain from recognizing a spouse’s contribution to the home and/or business in dividing up marital assets. See <i>PDR</i> 1:113; 2:46; 4:131; 5:306; 6:257; 7:111; 8:17; 9:65; <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Almonit</i>, supra n. 45 (R. Sherman).</i>
Accordingly, due to her contributions to the household and business and her husband’s earning potential, Rachel should receive fifty percent of the value of the family business, regardless of the extent of her husband’s capital investment and contribution to the growth of the business. On the other hand, based upon the cumulative evidence, we view the marriage as an economic partnership rather than an example of an “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit”</i> who is the husband’s agent. The <i>Tova’at</i> is therefore obligated to share in paying off the outstanding commercial debt in proportion to her investment in the venture.
<b>Decision</b>
1. Reuben Cohen shall hereby pay Rachel Cohen fifty percent of the net value of the family business.
2. In accordance with the percentage of her capital investment in the business, Rachel Cohen is hereby responsible for a percentage of the debts incurred by the family business.
<b>A Final Thought</b>
The foregoing presentation, which is inspired by an actual <i>beit din</i> decision, demonstrates that the division of marital assets upon divorce may be resolved by adopting varying and opposing approaches.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For an earlier treatment of this topic from other perspectives, such as <i>minhag</i> and <i>dina de-malkhusa dina</i>, see my, “Varying Approaches,” supra n. 34, 129.</i> Invoking a particular perspective will ultimately affect how the marital assets and debts in the family venture will be distributed between the divorcing couple. While adopting one model of “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit</i>” leads one to the conclusion that a husband is solely responsible for any debt incurred even if his wife cosigned the loan, recognizing the notion that marriage is an economic partnership – based upon the validity of the <i>tena’im</i> or an <i>umdana</i> that the parties agreed to abide by secular law – indicates that the wife is responsible for half of the business debts, provided that the capital investment was the same for both spouses, and that she should receive half of the business’s net value. While recognizing the wife’s contribution to the business or as a homemaker leads to the conclusion that she should receive a fair portion of the business, adopting the tripartite marital property classification would entail awarding the entire net value of the business to her husband. <sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For an identical conclusion reached by a Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court regarding stock shares owned by a husband, see Avraham Sheinfeld, “Special Circumstances in Property Division” [Hebrew], 3 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5755), 136. Regarding joint ownership of financial instruments, including but not limited to bank accounts and stocks, see Rehovot Regional Rabbincal Court, File 057244238-24-1; Supreme Rabbinical Court, File 056130081, in 13 <i>Ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i>.</i>
Couples who appear before a <i>beit din</i> may choose to resolve their differences in one or two ways. One option, which was the one chosen by the Levys, is to sign an arbitration agreement empowering the <i>dayanim</i> to resolve this matter according to the applicable portions of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Poskim</i>. Alternatively, a couple may decide to resolve the conflict in accordance with secular law and sign an agreement empowering the <i>beit din</i> to do so (accompanied by a symbolic act confirming the binding nature of the agreement). Some <i>dayanim</i> will resolve division of marital assets according to civil law based on the signing of such an agreement.
Seemingly, the latter approach is fraught with perilous ramifications, as it seems to ignore the prohibition against recourse to <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>, litigating in non-Jewish courts. As <i>R. J. David Bleich</i> notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Recourse to a gentile forum is tantamount to a declaration by the litigant that he is amenable to allowing an alien code of law to supersede the law of the Torah … The litigant appears before the gentile courts because he accepts their authority, and if they administer the law of Moses he accepts that law not because he regards it as binding upon him by virtue of having been commanded by God, but because it has been endorsed and adopted by gentiles …<br>The prohibition … is not limited to bringing a suit before a gentile court … The prohibition includes any judicial proceeding that negates the Law of Moses. A judicial body composed entirely of judges who happen to be members of the Jewish community but who administer an alien system of law is undoubtedly to be classified as within the halakhic category of <i>arka’ot shel akum</i> for the simple reason that the laws such a court administers are not those of the Torah.<br>Since … acquiescence by both litigants does not serve to mitigate the prohibition … and since the prohibition applies even when the judges themselves are Jews, it follows that the parties are not entitled to accept the authority of a rabbinic court … but stipulate that the <i>beit din</i> shall apply the law of a secular state. Accordingly, if two parties … enter into a contract and stipulate that any dispute with regard to fulfillment of the terms of the contract is to be resolved by a rabbinic court in accordance with, for example, the laws of the State of Delaware, the stipulation is void by virtue of being inconsistent with biblical law (<i>matneh al mah she-katuv ba-Torah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">J.

Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 18:4 and <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:99, who interpret these <i>shtarot</i> differently.</i> Finally, an agreement by parties to have their differences resolved in accordance with secular law by a <i>beit din</i> ought to be valid; no different than Torah-observant Jews who decide to proceed to an attorney requesting that he draft a contract according to civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In the context of monetary matters, the operative principle is “an individual may stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah” including the right to have monetary matters resolved in <i>beit din</i> in accordance with secular law. <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; File no. 1-35-8935, Jerusalem Regional Rabbinical Court, Nov. 1, 2004, <i>Mosdot Plonim v. K.Y.U.V</i>.</i>
According to these authorities, spouses who enter into an agreement to resolve their financial matters according to civil law are merely withdrawing from the privilege granted by the halakhic legal system in order to avail themselves of some benefit in one particular situation; they are not indicating wholesale affirmation of the secular legal system, and the agreement is therefore binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Sma</i>, supra n. 53. Their discussion is implicitely based on the Talmudic discussion in <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b and <i>Makkot</i> 3b regarding the ability of an individual to execute agreements in monetary matters in variance with Halakhah. Alternatively, one may argue that one may not stipulate against what is written in the Torah only when one wishes to nullify what is written there. However, if one stipulates for himself that he does not want to avail himself of a benefit accorded by Halakhah, such a stipulation is understood to mean that the individual waives a privilege accorded to him by Halakhah, and therefore such an agreement is valid. See <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 3b, s.v. <i>le-dedei</i>; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 3b, s.v. <i>al menat</i>; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:94; <i>Tosafot Rabbeinu Elhanan</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 56a-b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i> in <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 56a. See also <i>Sma</i>, HM 97:28; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 212:4. Whether Sma would reject an agreement between individuals to accept secular law is subject to debate; see <i>Ulam ha-Mishpat</i> 26; <i>Lev ha-Mishpat</i>, supra n. 53.<br>Accordingly, individuals can make an agreement prior to marriage that their monetary affairs will be governed by civil law. See Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court, File 1-21-5035, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>. In fact, various prenuptial agreements relating to the division of marital property based upon secular law have been drafted by rabbinic authorities, such as R. Tzvi ben Ya’akov, a member of the Haifa Rabbinical Court.<br>Whether a community may agree to accept all the laws of a secular system rather than specific ones which benefit themselves in a particular matter is subject to debate and beyond the scope of our discussion. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 52; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:61.</i> Such an arrangement is no different than a case in which a woman consents to receive no support from her husband; although she waives her right to one of the privileges of <i>nissu’in</i>, the institution of <i>nissu’in</i> itself remains intact.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Shmuel</i>, EH 38:11.</i> Clearly, however, prior to executing such an agreement, the parties should seek the guidance of a rabbinical authority who has expertise in matters of <i>Even Ha-Ezer</i> and <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>.
Had the couple in this case agreed to have their affairs governed by secular law, the issue of how marital assets and debts would be divided between them would vary from state to state. Since this couple resided in California, which is governed by community-property principles, upon dissolution of the marriage, a <i>beit din</i> would likely have placed the husband and wife on equal footing regarding the sharing of debts and receiving the net value of the family business. If they had been residents of an equitable distribution system state, such as New Jersey and New York, where marital property is divided “fairly” based on a weighing of various factors, the <i>beit din</i> would have arrived at an equitable determination regarding how to address the matter of the outstanding debt and distribution of the net value of the venture between the divorcing couple.

b) Spousal Abuse as Grounds for Obligating a Get

<b><i>B. Spousal Abuse as Grounds for Obligating a</i> Get</b><br><b><i>Rochel Cohen v. Eli Cohen</i></b>
<b>Tova’at<i>’s Claims</i></b>
The <i>Tova’at</i> demands a <i>get</i> because her husband coerces her to perform sexual intercourse or other acts against her will, and she therefore detests him. Because of unnatural cohabitation, she argues her sex life has become a living hell. Her husband demanded that she lie with him during the day and night, leaving her intolerably sleepless and exhausted. Suffering real torment, she was unwilling to comply with such demands. Initially, she refused to have intercourse with her husband out of anger and torment. Now, she refuses to have intercourse because she no longer wants to remain married to him.
In addition to the acts of physical assault, spousal rape, and exaggerated sexual demands, the <i>Tova’at</i> is suing her husband, claiming humiliation due to the bestial manner in which she was treated during intercourse and as the victim of emotional abuse due to his verbal degradation. In addition, over a period of five years, the <i>Nitva</i> conducted extra-marital affairs, and is therefore a <i>ro’eh zonot</i> (adulterer). He has persisted in his activities despite the fact that she has warned him on at least two occasions that such behavior is improper and that she will seek a divorce. Consequently, the <i>Tova’at</i> left the marital home with their children, moved into a separate apartment, and now seeks a <i>get</i>.
Additionally, the <i>Tova’at</i> claims that she is entitled to spousal support until a <i>get</i> is delivered to her. Furthermore, her husband should reimburse her for the outlay of rent for the nine months she had to rent an apartment. Moreover, prior to her marriage, the <i>Tova’at</i> owned an apartment complex. During her marriage, the <i>Nitva</i> managed the buildings and collected the rent from the tenants. The <i>Tova’at</i> has discovered that $150,000 of the rental fees were used by the <i>Nitva</i> to fund his illicit affairs. As such, the <i>Tova’at</i> advances a claim for said monies.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
Invoking the Talmudic dictum that “a man may do whatever he wishes with his wife,”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 20b.</i> the <i>Nitva</i> argues that he has a right to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife in any shape and form, even without her consent. Moreover, he argues that generally speaking he did not physically assault his wife, and there are no perceptible marks on his wife’s body that would corroborate his wife’s claim. The few times that he physically abused her were due to his wife’s incitement, and he should therefore be exempt from responsibility for his behavior. Moreover, he apologized to her on various occasions and desires her forgiveness. Because she voluntarily left the marital home, the husband claims that he is exempt from paying her rent or spousal support from the time she vacated the home. Finally, although he admits to having engaged in illicit affairs, the <i>Nitva</i> wishes to reconcile with his wife and requests that the <i>beit din</i> issue a ruling of <i>shalom bayit</i>, the restoration of domestic harmony.
<b>Discussion</b>
The issue at hand is how the Halakhah addresses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as adultery. If, in fact, such behavior transpired and the wife warned her husband to desist from this behavior, does there remain grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to foster <i>shalom bayit</i>, or is it the <i>beit din</i>’s duty to compel, obligate, or recommend the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife?
<b>1. Respecting a Wife’s Dignity</b>
Unlike other secular legal systems, the Talmud emphasizes that a husband is obligated to honor his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 59a; <i>Yevamot</i> 62b. Many of the concepts in, and sources for this decision have been culled from Eliav Shochetman, “Violence against Women as Grounds for Divorce” in Aviad Hacohen (ed.), <i>Jubilee Volume in Honor of Menachem Elon</i> (forthcoming).</i> This position is articulated in a normative fashion by various authorities. <i>Rambam</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A man shall honor his wife more than his self and shall adore her as he adores himself … And he shall not intimidate her, and he shall speak gently with her …<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 15:19; see also <i>Hilkhot De’ot</i> 5:10.</i></small></span>
Subsequently, this ruling was incorporated by the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 228:3.</i>
Expressions of the requirement to respect one’s wife are found in the <i>tena’im</i>, the conditions of marital engagement, and in the <i>ketubah</i>, the marriage agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Cremona edition), 291; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 7:477.</i> Thus, one must work in order to support his wife in accordance with her social status.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i>, 50; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, EH 70:12.</i>
Moreover, wife-beating is a crime and punitive measures, including but not limited to imprisonment, have been imposed upon violent husbands.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 4:100.</i> In earlier periods of Jewish history, halakhic authorities in various European communities sanctioned different modes of excommunication in such cases, such as expelling the husband from the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Prague edition) 81; <i>Teshuvot Maharshah</i> 2:130; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 154.</i> The ruling that one who injures his friend is obligated to pay damages<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1.</i> applies equally to wife-beaters.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nizkei Mamon</i> 4:16; <i>Tur</i>, EH 83; <i>SA</i>, EH 83:2, HM 421:2, 424:10–11.</i> Since the duty of honoring one’s wife is greater than the obligation to honor oneself,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 4.</i> the punitive measures for noncompliance should be more severe.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharam</i>, supra n. 5.</i> In our case, the <i>Nitva</i> was incarcerated temporarily for his abusive behavior.
Even if the harm directed against the wife occurred during intercourse, a husband is liable for sexual battery.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 83:1; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nizkei Mamon</i> 5.</i> Furthermore, the <i>Nitva</i>’s representation that the Talmud permits a husband to do whatever he wishes to his wife is incorrect. Although the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 100b.</i> and post-Talmudic authorities permit any forms of unnatural intercourse, all forms of intercourse require a wife’s consent. As <i>Rambam</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>[The wife] is not his slave to be compelled to have intercourse with someone she hates.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MishnahTorah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 14:8.</i></small></span>
R. <i>Yosef of Trani</i> (<i>Maharit</i>) notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Certainly, she is not subject to him incessantly when she does not desire it.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 5:5.</i></small></span>
Hence, a wife is entitled to object to conjugal relations, such as when she has quarreled with her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, EH 154.</i> Coerced cohabitation in any shape or form is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ba’alei ha-Nefesh</i>, <i>Sha’ar ha-Kedushah</i>, 122–123; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Issurei Bi’ah</i> 15:17, 21:12; <i>Tur</i>, EH 25; <i>SA</i>, EH 25:2; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 6, EH 25. Others prohibit unnatural intercourse even with the wife’s consent; see <i>Sefer Haredim</i>, <i>Mitzvah ha-Teshuvah</i>, 2.</i>
<b>2. Marital Separation and the Duty of Continuing Spousal Support</b>
Clearly, if the <i>Nitva</i> refuses to desist from physical and sexual violence, his wife is not only entitled to leave the marital home,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tesuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 6, EH 35; <i>PDR</i> 11:327.</i> but <i>beit din</i> is halakhically empowered to issue restraining orders against him, directing him to leave the home.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:299, 319.</i> The grounds for such separation are the Talmudic guidelines of “a man cannot live with a serpent in the same basket” and “the purpose of our being is for life, not for pain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 61a, 72a.</i>
In the United States, a <i>beit din</i> is not legally empowered to issue such orders. Nevertheless, upon the request of the <i>Tova’at</i> and based upon corroborating information which attests to the <i>Nitva</i>’s behavior, had they been approached, the <i>dayanim</i> would have directed her to seek assistance from the civil authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Such an action is not a violation of the prohibition of <i>mesirah</i> (informing). See <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, vol. 4, 207–11, who cites <i>teshuvot</i> from Rabbis Auerbach, Elyashiv, and Waldenberg regarding reporting cases of child abuse. Their conclusion should equally apply to the reporting of spousal abuse.</i> Given that the <i>Tova’at</i>, on her own initiative, has left the marital home, there is no need to address this matter.
Lest one argue that Halakhah recognizes only the two options of marriage and divorce and rejects the possibility of marital separation,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Such a conclusion is forthcoming from a decision recorded in <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 6, EH 45.</i> <i>Rema</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>We neither coerce him to divorce her nor her to live with him. <sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, EH 77:3. See also <i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Prague edition), 946 (end); <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 102–103; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, EH 70:12; and numerous other sources.</i></small></span>
On the contrary, the purpose of separation is to ease the tensions between the spouses and give each spouse time and breathing room to hopefully resolve their differences.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See R. Hadaya’s opinion, supra n. 23.</i> Consequently, de facto, the separation was legitimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">For a precedent, see <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:55.</i>
Whether a wife who abandons the home is entitled to continuing support is dependent upon the reason for her departure. If she vacated the home due to the fact that her husband was delinquent in his marital duties, such as his duty of spousal support, the wife would not be entitled to such remuneration. On the other hand, if the wife separates because she was abused, she is entitled to ongoing maintenance, as well as reimbursement for lodging expenses.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 70:12; <i>Rema</i>, EH 154:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:113; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yehezkiah</i>, EH 14, 33; <i>PDR</i> 1:7, 238; 15:119; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 4:21; 18:58.</i>
Of course, this entitlement is contingent upon the fact that she can demonstrate that her husband is abusive.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Shmuel</i>, EH 70:34; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i> 70:42.</i> In our scenario, the <i>Nitva</i> argues that his wife incited him to act violently toward her and that there therefore was no justification for her to leave the marital home. However, the burden of proof is upon the husband to prove that his behavior was in response to his wife’s incitement.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 1:26; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 3, EH 15.</i> There is a presumption that women are faithful, and we therefore do not believe the husband that his wife provoked the assault.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, EH 154:3.</i> Moreover, <i>Rabbis O. Yosef</i>, <i>Betzalel Zolty</i>, and <i>S. Yisraeli</i> note that a single act of provocation does not legitimize the right of physical assault. Finally, since he frequently physically abused his wife, we are unwilling to believe that she provoked him on each and every occasion.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 11:327, 328; 15:122.</i>
Contrary to the <i>Nitva</i>’s claim, the <i>Tova’at</i> alleges that on numerous occasions, the <i>Nitva</i> abused her without provocation, a claim that the <i>Nitva</i> denies. In light of this denial and the absence of physical indications attesting to such assaults, is there sufficient basis for concluding that the husband is a wife-beater and abuser? This issue is complicated by the fact that the authorities debate whether a woman is believed regarding her allegation that her husband engaged in unnatural intercourse without her consent.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sedei Hemed</i>, <i>Gerushin</i> 1:12 and <i>Teshuvot Edut Ya’akov</i>, 36.</i>
Despite the fact that the husband does not admit his guilt, the testimony of third parties – including women, who are usually invalid witnesses – as well as medical records and advisory opinions of health professionals who interviewed and counseled the couple, serve as evidence of the <i>Nitva</i>’s proclivity to violence and antisocial behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the value of third party opinions, including professionals, see <i>Rema</i>, EH 74:10, 154:3; <i>PDR</i> 11:328; Netanya Regional Rabbinical Court, File No. 4564-24-1 (8 Shvat 5766); Tel Aviv Regional Rabbinical Court, File 3426-21-3 (Jan. 28, 2008), <i>Plonit</i> v. <i>Ploni</i>. Regarding the validity of women’s testimony, see <i>Rema</i>, EH 154:3; <i>PDR</i> 20:126, 133 (R. Z. Goldberg).<br>Other circumstantial evidence may be extrapolated from a man’s behavior in <i>beit din</i>. Should he exhibit moments of loss of self-control during a hearing, such conduct may be used to assess his character; see <i>PDR</i> 11:327 and my “Harnessing the Authority of Beit Din to Deal with Cases of Domestic Violence,” <i>Tradition</i> 45 (2012), 37.</i>
Thus, given that the wife’s abandonment of the marital home was justifiable, she is entitled to receive her maintenance and to be reimbursed for her outlay of rent.
<b>3. <i>Shalom Bayit</i> and the Requirement of Forewarning</b>
Prior to addressing whether there are grounds for issuance of a divorce judgment, it is the responsibility of a <i>beit din</i> to inquire whether the restoration of <i>shalom bayit</i> is a possibility. In a case of irreconcilable differences, the <i>beit din</i> would invoke the position of <i>Rabbeinu Yeruham</i> and support the issuance of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Whether such issuance is to be rendered as an obligation upon the <i>Nitva</i> or as a recommendation to the <i>Nitva</i> is subject to debate. See <i>Sefer Meisharim</i>, <i>netiv</i> 23, <i>helek</i> 8; <i>PDR</i> 6:13; 8:325; 11:95, 255; 13:264, 14:183; File no. 845682, Supreme Rabbinical Court, June 28, 2012, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>. For a detailed analysis of R. Yeruham’s position, see my <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, vol. 2 (forthcoming).<br>According to R. Tenenbaum, in such circumstances, one cannot compel the issuance of a <i>get</i>; see <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:145.</i> In the present case, however, the husband’s plea for <i>shalom bayit</i> may indicate that this is not a situation of irreconcilable differences, culminating in a “dead” marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Irreconcilable differences between spouses and the inability to restore <i>shalom bayit</i> serve as grounds for divorce; see <i>Sefer Meisharim</i>, supra n. 34; <i>Teshuvot</i> ha-<i>Ridbaz</i>, vol. 4, 89; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, YD, 4:15; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 2, EH 10; <i>PDR</i> 6:13; 8:323; 11:95 255; 14:183, 193; 19:57, 65.</i> Although husband and wife have been separated for over nine months, the husband argues that there still remain prospects for reconciliation. We must therefore make an attempt to examine whether, in fact, this marriage could survive and eventually become stable or if it is truly beyond repair.
<i>R. Avraham Sherman</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The concept of <i>shalom bayit</i> between the couple and among the family is not merely an expression of the individual emotional state between the couple and their children. Marriage between spouses was not designed only to grant privileges to each spouse. The fact of matrimony creates a legal situation which imposes duties upon each spouse vis-à-vis the other, and when children are born, their birth creates a state of parental obligations towards them …<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Supreme Rabbinical Court, File 5007-64-1 (July 19, 1999), <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit.</i></i></small></span>
Can we lay the groundwork for promoting tranquility between the spouses and engender a more suitable environment for raising their children? Can we facilitate the sustaining of an environment in which this father will be able to serve as a halakhic-ethical model for his children and inculcate within them Torah values?
It appears that we can extrapolate from a case posed to <i>Rivash</i> and <i>Maharashdam</i>. For ten months, a couple attempted to conceive a child, but it is apparent that the husband is impotent. Is his impotence sufficient grounds for acceding to the wife’s request for a <i>get</i>? According to <i>Rivash</i>, if the wife is insistent on the divorce, the <i>beit din</i> should issue such a judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Rivash</i> 127.</i> <i>Maharashdam</i> demurs, however, arguing that if there is a possibility that the husband may be cured, and for the sake of <i>shalom bayit</i>, we should direct the couple to wait and see if the medical matter resolves itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 103. For others who endorse this approach, see <i>Ritzba</i>, <i>Teshuvot Maimoniyot</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, EH, <i>Tanina</i>, 89.</i> If no cure is forthcoming, the <i>beit din</i> may then issue a divorce ruling. Pursuant to both views, if there is no hope for a cure and the wife is insistent on a divorce, the <i>beit din</i> must render a divorce judgment.
In our case, the <i>Nitva</i>’s frequent acts of wife-beating reflect the personality of a mentally deranged individual, and there is no hope for rehabilitating him. As a result, the rendering of a divorce judgment is appropriate. In fact, some professional studies have demonstrated that rehabilitation programs for male perpetrators of domestic violence appear to be less effective in reducing recidivism than programs for other offender groups.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Andrew Day, et. al., “Programs for Men who Perpetrate Domestic Violence: An Examination of the Issues Underlying the Effectiveness of Intervention Programs,” 24 <i>Journal of Family Violence</i> (2009), 203.</i> Hence, hope for <i>shalom bayit</i> does not appear to be on the horizon.
Had this marriage been marked by consensual sexual relations with isolated instances of physical abuse, we might have arrived at the conclusion that the <i>Tova’at</i> accepted her husband’s improper behavior and that there therefore may be a prospect for <i>shalom bayit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:139, 142; 10:3, 8.</i> Clearly, a one-time assault followed by a husband’s desire to appease his wife does not serve as grounds for divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 10:3.</i> Furthermore, <i>Rema</i> writes that it is necessary that the husband be warned regarding the consequences of his behavior before a divorce may be demanded.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, EH 154:3.</i>
In our case, however, the fact that the <i>Tova’at</i> consistently refused to engage in coerced sexual intercourse and warned her husband more than once to desist from his unacceptable conduct undermines this approach. If a husband persists in his behavior even after he has been warned – by his wife, <i>beit din</i>, or even the police<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, EH 15.</i> – clearly divorce is the only remaining option.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:303, 310.</i> Moreover, if the abuser has been convicted of abuse, if his one assault posed a danger to his wife’s life, or if his behavior is uncontrollable, there is no need to mandate a forewarning at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 15:145, 153; 8:216, 226; 6:221, 222–3; File 027295641-21-1, <i>Ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i>, <i>gilyon</i> 3 (Av 5763), 3.</i> Clearly, then, the <i>Tova’at</i> complied with the requirement of forewarning as mandated by <i>Rema</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 44.

<b>4. Physical Abuse as Grounds for Divorce</b>
Thus far, we have seen that the <i>Tova’at</i> was justified in leaving the marital home and is entitled to remuneration for maintenance and rental expenses. We have further concluded that the <i>beit din</i> has little reason to assume that <i>shalom bayit</i> is a likely outcome, and the <i>Tova’at</i> may therefore request a <i>get</i>. The question at hand is therefore whether the <i>Nitva</i> can be compelled to give her the <i>get</i>. In other words, does the husband’s physical abuse of his wife violate Halakhah and therefore constitute grounds for divorce? Should the <i>beit din</i> simply recommend that the parties divorce, obligate the husband to grant a divorce, or actually coerce him to grant a divorce (<i>kefi’at ha-get</i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Subscribing to the view of Rabbeinu Hananel, most authorities distinguish between two levels of enforcement of a <i>get</i> ruling: (1) <i>Kofin le-garesh</i> – compelling the <i>Nitva</i> to grant a <i>get</i> to his wife, and (2) <i>hiyuv le-garesh</i> – obligating a <i>Nitva</i> to divorce his wife. See <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 194, 205. While the issuance of the former judgment may result in certain criminal, monetary, and/or social sanctions, the latter involves verbal persuasion. See Zorach Warhaftig, “Coercion to Grant a Divorce in Theory and Practice” [Hebrew], 3–4 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> (1976–1977), 153. In contemporary times, in cases in which it is halakhically unclear whether the <i>Nitva</i> should be compelled or obligated to grant a divorce, many <i>batei din</i> employ the terminology that a divorce is “a mitzvah” or “recommended,” which has the connotation of a lower level of sanction than the other two types of enforcement.<br>In the United States, one type of coercion warranted is <i>kefiyah be-derekh bereirah</i>, which means directing a <i>Nitva</i> to fulfill his duty of spousal support or payment of the dowry and the <i>ketubah</i> or, by his choice, to relieve himself of this duty by executing a <i>get</i>. See <i>Beit Meir</i>, <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 154:8; <i>PDR</i> 1:15, 19, 77, 80.</i>
An abuser is viewed as a <i>poshei’a</i> (one who acts intentionally is negligent).<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimmukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 32a; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 2:10.</i> Therefore, if a man injures his wife, even while engaged in consensual sexual relations, if he had intent to injure her,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Should the injury be unintentional, the husband would be exempt from responsibility; see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:75; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 11:21.</i> he must compensate her for the damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 83:2; HM 421:12.</i> Moreover, engaging in conjugal relations without the consent of one’s wife (spousal rape)<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 100b; <i>SA</i> EH 25:2.</i> or when angry with her<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, OH 240:3.</i> are equally violations of Halakhah.
If there was forewarning, attempt for <i>shalom bayit</i> has been undertaken, and other quasi-legal sanctions – such as excommunication or social shunning – have been implemented, some authorities, such as <i>R. Yosef ibn Avitur</i> (eleventh century Spain), <i>Rabbeinu Simcha</i> (thirteenth century Ashkenaz), and <i>R. Yitzhak ben Moshe</i> (thirteenth century Vienna), would compel a husband to grant a <i>get</i> to his abused wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i>, paragraph 476; <i>Or Zarua</i> 3, <i>Bava Kama</i>, 161; <i>Teshuvot Maharach Or Zarua</i>, 127; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i>, vol. 1, EH 135. In cases of physical endangerment to her life, R. Waldenberg has compelled the <i>Nitva</i> to grant a divorce; see <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 6:41.</i> Other decisors, such as <i>Rashba</i>, <i>Ridbaz</i>, and <i>R. Avraham di Boton</i>, argue that a <i>beit din</i> may only obligate a husband to grant a <i>get</i> in such a case.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 5:264; 7:477; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i>, 4:1228; <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 31.</i>
In formulating his ruling on the matter, <i>R. Yosef Karo</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>One cannot rely on the opinions of the <i>Agudah</i> and Rabbeinu Simcha, and therefore we cannot coerce him to give a <i>get</i> due to the fact that these opinions have not been mentioned by the renowned decisors.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, EH 154.</i></small></span>
Contemporaneously and in response to <i>R. Karo</i>, <i>Rema</i> argues in his commentary to <i>Tur</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>I do not understand his position … There are grounds to rely upon these views. <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Maharam</i> agreed in their <i>teshuvot</i> on the matter of wife abuse and they adduced proofs for their words, and logic concurs with them. The reason why these authorities were not mentioned by the decisors is possibly due to the fact that it was so obvious.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, EH 154:17.</i></small></span>
Unsurprisingly, in his gloss to <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, <i>Rema</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If a man beats his wife, this is a sin and is akin to someone who assaults his friend. If he is accustomed to such conduct, <i>beit din</i> is empowered to punish him, excommunicate him, and flog him … And if he does not comply with <i>beit din</i>’s directive, some say we compel him to divorce his wife, provided that he has been forewarned once or twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, EH 154:3.</i></small></span>
According to <i>Rema</i>, should sanctions and an admonishment be ineffective, a husband who regularly beats his wife will be compelled by <i>beit din</i> to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife, despite the views to the contrary. Furthermore, it appears that had the views of <i>Rabbeinu Simcha</i> and <i>Agudah</i> been cited by the renowned decisors, <i>R. Karo</i> would have concurred with their position as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The comments of <i>Rema</i>, EH 154:21, require further explanation, which we leave for another occasion.</i>
Given that halakhic divorce is possible only if both parties agree to it, how is it possible to compel the husband, even an abusive one, to grant his wife a get? Ostensibly, such a <i>get</i> should be classified as a <i>get me’useh</i>, a coerced <i>get</i>, which is invalid. On what grounds, then, can the <i>beit din</i> compel, or even obligate, a recalcitrant husband to divorce his wife?
<i>Rambam</i> offers a famous answer to this question, explaining that every Jew essentially wishes to comply with the tenets of Halakhah; if he refuses to do so, it is due to his evil inclination overpowering his true will. The <i>beit din</i>’s coercion is simply a means to reinstate his “true will” – either to fulfill the Halakah or to provide the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MishnahTorah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20. For those who ascribe to one of these two rationales, see <i>Tosafot Rid</i>, <i>Or Zarua</i>, 654 and <i>Teshuvot Or Zarua</i>, 69, 127; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 205:1; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 28; <i>Or Same’ah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20; <i>Imrei Binah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Dayanim</i> 1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, EH 99:1-2.</i> For R. Karo and <i>Rema</i>, the abusive husband’s “true will” in this case is to fulfill the Halakhah and grant his wife a <i>get</i>.
Given that there is some dispute regarding whether an abusive husband should be compelled to grant a <i>get</i>, can a <i>beit din</i> compel him to do so? Echoing the words of <i>R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spector</i>, <i>R. Yitzhak Herzog</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Even though he [the husband] knew that there is some rule that he should not be compelled, he was reconciled because the court ruled that he should be compelled, because it is a mitzvah to obey the scholars of your generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:3. See also <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> 2:5, 35; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei De’ah</i> 1:119. Some contend that in cases in which the majority view is to coerce, a <i>beit din</i> can coerce a husband; see <i>PDR</i> 4:166.</i></small></span>
In other words, the true will of an observant Jew is to comply with the norms of Halakhah, including the granting of a <i>get</i>, as understood by the <i>beit din</i> that the husband has accepted to serve as the arbiter of his situation. Regardless of the fact that other legists may disagree with his arbiter, the husband’s “true will” is to follow his chosen arbiter; should the arbiter compel him to give a <i>get</i>, there is no element of compulsion, for he voluntarily acquiesces to the directive of his arbiter.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 62.</i> Pursuant to this view, the existence of controversy regarding whether one should coerce a <i>get</i> in the case of abuse would not preempt the possibility that an arbiter could render a ruling compelling the issuance of a <i>get</i>.
According to <i>Hatam Sofer</i> and others, however, a divorce can only be compelled when there is unanimous agreement among the authorities that a compelled divorce is valid under those circumstances. If there is controversy regarding the matter, the <i>beit din</i> cannot postulate regarding what the “true will” of the husband is.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 116; <i>Mishnah le-Melekh</i>, <i>Gerushin</i> 11:28; <i>Teshuvot Devar Yehoshua</i>, vol. 3, EH 30. Nevertheless, even those decisors who endorse <i>Hatam Sofer</i>’s view would contend that if the majority opinion argues for compelling a divorce, such a ruling would not generate a <i>get me’useh</i>; see <i>PDR</i> 4:164, 167.</i> In practice, this is the view adopted by many <i>batei din.</i> Consequently, given that it is subject to controversy whether wife-beating is grounds for compelling a divorce, the issuance of such a judgment would fail to reflect the husband’s true will; should a judgment be rendered to compel a divorce, the result would be a <i>get me’useh</i>.
Nonetheless, as we have seen, <i>R. Karo</i> concurs with <i>Rema</i> that in a situation of spousal physical abuse, a <i>beit din</i> will obligate the husband to grant a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:84, 92–93; Netanya Regional Beit Din, File 9465-21-1, <i>Plonit</i> v. <i>Ploni</i> (26 Shvat, 5767).</i> Therefore, although we cannot compel the <i>Nitva</i> to grant his wife a <i>get</i> in our case, we can obligate him to do so.
<b>5. Emotional Abuse as Grounds for Divorce</b>
We will now turn our attention to the question of whether the <i>Tova’at</i>’s emotional pain is grounds for granting a divorce judgment.
<i>R. Shimon bar Tzemah Duran</i> (<i>Tashbetz</i>) addresses a case in which a husband physically endangered his wife’s life by depriving her of food. In his attempt to determine whether this constitutes grounds for divorce, <i>Tashbetz</i> draws two analogies to psychological abuse:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If a husband declares, “I will neither feed nor provide for my wife,” he is compelled to grant her a divorce … If bad breath would be grounds for such compulsion [as stated in the Talmud Yerushalmi], her very soul is far more so!<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Gittin</i> 9:9.</i> … In this case, he should divorce her and pay the amount stipulated in the <i>ketubah</i>, because it is written that “she was to live with him and not to suffer with him” … If even concerning one who prohibits his wife from doing things which are not so painful for her, we rule that he should divorce her and remit the <i>ketubah</i> money … a fortiori when he causes distress on a regular basis that we should say that he should divorce her and pay the amount earmarked in the <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:8; see also <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:43.</i></small></span>
<i>Tashbetz</i>’s use of analogy to cases of psychological abuse in determining the status of physical abuse is not an isolated instance. In obligating a wife-beater to grant a <i>get</i>, <i>Rashba</i> finds support for his conclusion in the Mishnaic ruling obligating a husband to give a <i>get</i> in a case of a husband who attempts to prevent his spouse from associating with her family and/or friends.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 7:477.</i>
Thus, as counterintuitive as it appears, for both <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Tashbetz</i>, the level of enforcement of a divorce judgment relating to emotional abuse was clear and required no lengthy argumentation to defend. On the contrary, for these legists, the real issue for resolution lies in the realm of spousal battery; they determine the proper ruling in the latter case based on the conclusion in the former. Medieval legists thus clearly recognized the significance of emotionally abusive behavior and its implications for the health of a marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">For an additional decisor who treats both physical and emotional abuse as two sides of the same coin, see <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i>, 88.</i>
Addressing the case of a wife who was the victim of verbal and emotional abuse and who then fled her home to live in a shelter, an Israeli rabbinical court rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The truth of the woman’s words is clear and the pain she has articulated is sincere … Emotional violence by a husband is sometimes more serious than physical violence … The woman has a right to live and not to be in sorrow …<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> 1 (2003), 6. See also Netanya Regional Court, File 4637-29-1, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i> (June 27, 2006).</i></small></span>
As a result, the <i>beit din</i> decided to terminate the marriage and obligate the husband to grant a <i>get</i> to his wife.
Similarly, given the emotional scarring caused by the <i>Nitva</i> in our case, we obligate him to grant his wife a <i>get</i>.
<b>6. Adultery as a Grounds for Divorce</b>
Even had the husband acted completely normally in his relations with his wife, there would be grounds for issuing a divorce judgment in this case based upon the fact that he was an adulterer. Addressing such a situation, <i>R. Alexander Zuslin</i> (<i>Agudah</i>) argues along the same lines as <i>Tashbetz</i> that if the Talmud Yerushalmi directs the compulsion of a <i>get</i> in cases of foul breath, a fortiori, such a conclusion should apply to an adulterer.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">For additional reasons, see <i>Sefer ha-Agudah</i>,<i>Yevamot</i> 65b, no. 77.</i> Assuming that witnesses corroborate the husband’s behavior or the husband admits to being an adulterer and he has been forewarned to desist from this behavior,<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">A husband’s admission of adultery is not uncommon. In the four cases of adultery that appeared before a court on which I sat, the husband did not contest his wife’s allegation. For the evidentiary requirements, as well the need to demonstrate that he is a frequent adulterer and has been forewarned, see <i>Rema</i>, EH 154:1; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i>, 133.</i> a <i>get</i> should be compelled in such an instance.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The ability to coerce a <i>get</i> based upon the application of a <i>kal ve-homer</i> (a fortiori) argument has persuasive precedent. Based on such arguments, a number of authorities have expanded the grounds for coercing a <i>get</i> beyond the examples mentioned in the Talmud. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 7:19; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:8; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i>, 36; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:113; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 73.</i> This attests to the horrific nature of the act of adultery in destroying the family unit and the acute need to dissolve this marriage due to such conduct, rather than the sinful nature of the act itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:5, 13 (R. Eliezer Goldschmidt).</i>
<i>Agudah</i>’s ruling that adultery is grounds for coercion of a <i>get</i> was reaffirmed by <i>Rema</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 72<i>.</i></i> Depending on the particular facts of the case, various Israeli rabbinical court decisions have either coerced an adulterer to grant a <i>get</i> or have obligated him to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:5, 15; 8:254, 261; 12:24, 29; 14:183, 193–194.</i>
Given that the <i>Nitva</i> admitted to his frequent improprieties, we obligate him to grant a <i>get</i> to the <i>Tova’at</i>. Although the <i>Nitva</i> was not forewarned regarding this particular matter, in our estimation, given the psychological makeup of the <i>Nitva</i>, the frequency of his illicit behavior, and the emotional stress caused by his behavior, we may forego the requirement of a forewarning.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:8; <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:84; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:3; <i>PDR</i> 1:77–80; 3:221–222; 12:24, 26–27; 15:152–153.</i>
<b>7. A Husband’s Dissipation of Family Assets</b>
Finally, let us address the <i>Tova’at</i> entitlement to recoup $150,000 from her husband due to his dissipation of the family assets to finance his adulterous behavior. In some communities, on the occasion of a <i>shiddukhin</i> (an engagement), it is customary to sign a <i>tena’im</i> enumerating various parental obligations and the anticipated month of the wedding (or the actual wedding date). The document attests that the parties have fulfilled all of their mutual obligations and should refrain from any fraudulent conduct, and stipulates a monetary penalty should a party to the agreement default.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">For differing formulations of this agreement, see <i>Nahalat Shiva</i>, 7–8; <i>Tikkun Soferim</i>, 11; and <i>Zera Avraham</i>, 11. For guidelines in drafting this document, see <i>Sma</i>, HM 243:12, 245:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, EH 112, 135; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i> 1:111; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, YD 236. For the halakhic consequences of reneging on such an agreement, see my “Breach of Promise to Marry,” 17 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2007), 267.</i>
Because the prospective couple does not sign the <i>tena’im</i> and because the content of the <i>tena’im</i> is not drafted as a bona fide <i>shtar</i> mutually obligating the couple to engage in their financial affairs with transparency and accountability, some decisors reject the halakhic-legal significance of the <i>tanna’im</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am ve-Da’at</i>, <i>Mahadura Tanina</i>, 181; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:110.</i> Nevertheless, numerous decisors, such as <i>Mahari Weil</i>, <i>Maharik</i>, <i>Maharsham</i>, <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, and <i>Rav Pe’alim</i>, invoke this premarital clause as governing the monetary ties between spouses during their marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i>, 134; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 57; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:45; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Tanina</i>, YD 155; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, YD 448:2; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, vol. 2, EH 32.</i> Consequently, if such a document were signed, the <i>Nitva</i>’s siphoning of family funds for illicit affairs entails fraud and is a violation of this premarital obligation.
Because some may argue that this conclusion is based on a questionable halakhic position and at best should only be construed as a <i>senif</i> (an appendage) to buttress a more persuasive stance, we will present a more feasible explanation for the <i>Nitva</i>’s liability as well.
Classically, rabbinic decisors dividing a couple’s assets upon divorce have been guided by a three-fold classification system of assets. <i>Nikhsei tzon barzel</i> refer to the wife’s assets held by her husband; he is responsible to provide her with either the actual asset or its value upon divorce, while any appreciation or depreciation belongs to the husband. <i>Nikhsei melug</i> refers to the wife’s estate, of which the fruits belong to him without responsibility for loss or deterioration. These assets must be used by the husband for the benefits of the marriage. Finally, a wife may receive property as a present which the donor stipulates that the husband has no control over.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">This three-part division has been discussed by Benzion Schereschewsky, former Israeli Supreme Court Justice and expert on halachic domestic relations, in Menachem Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem,1975), 390–2.<br>Beyond her property rights, a wife receives certain monetary rights during marriage, including but not limited to support (including food, clothing, the cost of lodging, and reimbursement for medical care) and upon divorce the right to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i>
Based upon this matrimonial property regime, the apartment complex owned by the <i>Tova’at</i> is to be subsumed under the category of “<i>nikhsei melog.</i>” As such, any accrual of profits, such as rent, must be used for the benefit of the domestic household.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, <i>Ketuvot</i> 6:3; <i>Ketuvot</i> 80b; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, EH 85:17; <i>PDR</i> 2:101–102.</i> Since the <i>Tova’at</i> was able to prove that the rental receipts were diverted to fund her husband’s improper activities, it is clear that the <i>Nitva</i>’s use of the assets actually undermined the family unit, and the <i>Tova’at</i> is therefore entitled to recoup such monies.
In short, the <i>Nitva</i>’s absconding with these assets was both a violation of a premarital agreement recorded in the <i>tanna’im</i> and an undermining of the matrimonial property regime.

Based on the facts presented, the panel finds as follows:
1. Eli Cohen is <i>hayav</i> (obligated) to give a <i>get</i> to Rochel Cohen.
2. Eli Cohen is obligated to hereby immediately pay $150,000 to Rochel Cohen.

c) A Father's Duty of Child Support towards His Estranged Children

<b><i>C. A Father’s Duty of Child Support towards His Estranged Children</i></b><br><b><i>Ya’akov Levy v. Miriam Levy on behalf of Yerucham and Talya Levy</i></b>
Pursuant to the terms of a divorce agreement, the father Ya’akov Levy (<i>Tove’a</i>) is obligated in child support until his children reach the age of 18. Physical and legal custody of the two children – his 12-year old son, Yerucham, and 10-year old daughter, Talya – was awarded to Miriam Levy (<i>Nitva’at</i>), the mother, and the father was awarded visitation privileges. The <i>Tove’a</i> subsequently remarried and within three years had two children with his second wife.
The relationship between the father and his children was tense due to the divorce and his subsequent remarriage. The parties mutually agreed to see a psychologist. Nevertheless, after a series of sessions spanning a period of nine months, the therapist was unable to lay the groundwork for reconciliation. Eventually, the children became totally estranged from their father and refused to visit him.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that his children are minors and that their wishes regarding participation in a visitation agreement should therefore be irrelevant. Moreover, given that the divorce agreement grants him visitation privileges, the <i>Tove’a</i> contends that since his children do not want to spend time with him, he is no longer duty-bound to support them.
<b><i>Nitva’at</i>’s Claims</b>
Because the majority of the children’s leisure time is spent in their mother’s home and their father has a new family, the <i>Nitva’at</i> contends that the children are estranged from their father and no longer have a relationship with him; they therefore do not want to visit him in his home with his new family. In response to the <i>Tove’a</i>’s argument that the cessation of visitation is a violation of their divorce agreement and that he is therefore exempt from child support, the <i>Nitva’at</i> claims that the agreement does not stipulate that maintenance is contingent upon visitation. Thus, although the children decline to visit him, the support obligation continues to be operative.

Because they lack <i>da’at</i>, the rational capacity for decision-making, <i>ketanim</i> may not be litigants before <i>beit din</i>, even regarding matters relating to them. Consequently, minors are represented by their parents, who serve as their <i>apotropsim</i> (guardians) and are entrusted to manage their children’s interests, including appearing before <i>beit din</i> on their behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">The father serves as <i>apotropus</i> on the grounds of his legal standing as a natural guardian; the mother serves as <i>apotropus</i> by virtue of her appointment by a <i>beit din</i> or because she lives with her child. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 82:2, 87:4, 96:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:49.</i> It is only upon reaching majority that a child can be a <i>ba’al din</i>, at which point no issue relating to him can be resolved before <i>beit din</i> in his absence.
Thus, for example, if a father obligates himself to support his daughter and subsequently becomes divorced, the mother, in her capacity as <i>apotropos</i>, is mandated to advance any and all claims on behalf of her child. In this case, the mother appeared at the hearing as the <i>Nitva’at</i> on behalf of her minor children in an attempt to ensure that the <i>Tove’a</i> would not renege on his commitment, the <i>hov</i> (duty) of support he has to fulfill towards his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, EH 114; <i>SA</i>, EH 114:1; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, ad loc. 4.</i>
Although a minor is halakhically considered bereft of <i>da’at</i>, this only affects the efficacy of his or her legal acts, such as buying and selling,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">There are some instances in which minors do possess <i>da’at</i> and their transactions are therefore valid; see <i>Gittin</i> 5:7; <i>Gittin</i> 59a, 64b; Yerushalmi <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:3; Yerushalmi <i>Gittin</i> 5:7.</i> and his or her accountability for sins committed.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">For example, if a minor girl voluntarily engaged in an illicit relationship, she is considered as having committed the act under duress. Since <i>da’at</i> is a prerequisite for being liable for adultery, she is neither liable for punishment nor prohibited to her husband, as she would have been were she an adult. See <i>Yevamot</i> 61b.</i> This does not mean, however, that the child’s wishes are entirely irrelevant. Child placement is not a legal action predicated upon the notion of <i>da’at</i>, and a child’s wishes relating to custody or visitation placement are therefore pertinent.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Addressing an action of a minor, <i>Maharam Padua</i> notes that this is not a matter of <i>kinyan</i>, <i>kiddushin</i>, or punishment, legal actions contingent on the presence of <i>da’at</i>; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Padua</i> 53; Eliav Shochetman, “Taking into Consideration a Minor’s Wishes Regarding the Laws of Child Placement” [Hebrew], <i>Me’oznei Mishpat</i> 4 (5765), 545, 547.</i> On the contrary, in order for the <i>beit din</i> to determine the placement that is in the best interests of the child, it is certainly prudent to hear from the child himself. In fact, since children are often used as pawns in divorce proceedings and are manipulated by one or both of their parents, it is the <i>beit din</i>’s responsibility to discover the child’s true wishes, rather than to blindly accept what a parent wants the child to communicate to the <i>beit din</i> panel.
The late <i>R. Eliezer Goldschmidt</i>, a renowned Israeli <i>dayan</i>, aptly notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The child is the litigant regarding his placement during the time of the divorce, and he is a litigant after the divorce, he and nobody else … The child is always a litigant and he is plaintiff, and the mother is the guardian who represents him in his claim and advances a claim in his name.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Beit Mishpat Elyon</i> 15, 1/60 <i>Winter</i> v. <i>Be’ari</i>, 1457,1485–6.</i></small></span>
In fact, a child’s needs are not necessarily determined by a divorce agreement executed between his parents. A child may advance any claim, independent of what has been documented in the divorce agreement, and he may challenge any provision of the agreement that is detrimental to his welfare.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mishpetei Shaul</i>, 175; <i>Edut be-Yehosef</i>, 141–3.</i>
Viewing the child as the plaintiff reflects the idea that a child is a person who must live in an environment that will serve his best interests, rather than as an object for the benefit of one of his parents. The minor’s input regarding his placement and visitation, among other things, contribute towards discerning what environment will provide optimally for his growth and personality development.
For example, the majority of <i>Poskim</i> have ruled that in the case of a daughter, regardless of her age, the welfare of the child is best served by placing her with her mother, so that she will be properly instructed in the ways of modesty and halakhic-moral propriety.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 102b; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 308; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:263.</i> However, should the minor daughter prefer to reside with her father, we respect her wishes, if the <i>beit din</i> determines that this reflects her best interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Padua</i> 53.</i> Similarly, the <i>Rashbash</i> discusses a case in which a widow wished to take her minor daughters with her to Israel and some of their relatives opposed the move. The <i>Rashbash</i> rules that if the daughters are intelligent and agree to the move, the mother’s decision is upheld.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 116.</i> The <i>Mabit</i> rules that even if a mother consented to having her daughters live with their father, if the girls are uncomfortable with the arrangement and wish to return to their mother, they may do so, as we must consider the children’s wishes and personal welfare.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 2:62.</i>
Taking a child’s wishes into consideration applies equally to a minor son.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17.</i> For example, <i>R. Moshe Alsheich</i> discusses a case of a father who disappeared and was presumed dead. A <i>beit din</i> entrusted his son to an <i>apotropos</i>. Subsequently, the mother wanted to move to Israel with her minor son, and the <i>apotropos</i> objected, arguing that the son should remain with the father’s parents. The child expressed his wishes to remain with his mother. Ruling that the child’s wishes are paramount and that the guardian’s appointment related solely to the child’s monetary matters, <i>R. Alsheich</i> concludes that the child should move to Israel in order to reside with his mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i> 38.</i>
Thus, in our case, although the children are minors, their wishes regarding participation in the visitation agreement must be taken into consideration. The children’s feelings communicated to this panel – relating to, among other things, their father’s decision to divorce their mother, his verbally abusive behavior towards their mother, and his desire to begin a new life with a new family – explain their estrangement from their father. Hence, we affirm the right of the children to decline to visit with their father.
<b>2. The Nature of a Father’s Child Support Obligation</b>
A father is primarily liable for <i>mezonot yeladim</i> (child support) by virtue of his paternity,<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4. Others maintain that a father’s obligation in child support stems from his spousal duty to maintain his wife. See <i>Ran</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 5; <i>Bah</i>, EH 71; <i>Mishnah le-Melekh</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 12:14; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 106.</i> irrespective of whether the marriage has been terminated by divorce or death<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 82:7 and commentaries ad loc.</i> or whether the child was born out of wedlock.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 22a; <i>SA</i>, EH 71:4, HM 276:6; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 87:57; <i>PDR</i> 1:145, 154; 7:136, 144, 146, 152.</i> Until they reach the age of six, by dint of being a father, he is obligated to support his sons and daughters,<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4:14; <i>Tur</i>, EH 112; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, EH 112; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, EH 112:12.</i> even if the child has his financial means for self-support.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, ibid., in the name of <i>Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i>; <i>Tur</i>, EH 1; <i>SA</i>, EH 1:1; <i>PDR</i> 3:299, 307; 8:325, 33. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:391.</i> From the age of six until a child reaches majority, a father is obligated as a relative, pursuant to the laws of <i>tzedakah</i> (charity) or <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> (national custom), rather than as a father.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, EH 71; <i>SA</i>, EH 71:1.</i> Consequently, only a wealthy father may be compelled to support a child between the age of six and the age of maturity, while a father of limited means is not subject to compulsion.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 49b. If the child has financial means to support himself, the father is exempt from supporting him; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i> (Blau edition) 1:69; <i>Bah</i>, EH 71; <i>PDR</i> 2:65, 92. Cf. <i>Taz</i>, EH 1:2.</i>
As duly noted by a contemporary rabbinical court:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>There is no privity between an individual who is duty-bound by dint of the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>tzedakah</i> and the beneficiary [of the tzedakah], since he [the giver] does not owe him [the beneficiary] a debt; he is obligated in <i>hilkhot tzedakah</i>, rather than [in giving] to a specific person. <sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:145, 155.</i></small></span>
Thus, although a father can be compelled to provide for his child until the age of six regardless of his means, after that point, only halakhic-moral persuasion is possible if the father is not wealthy. Thus, a child over the age of six must demonstrate that his father has the means to support him and that the child does not have the wherewithal to support himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:292; <i>Mishpetei Uziel</i>, EH 74 and 116.</i>
In the present case, the children are above the age of six, and their father is therefore obligated to support them pursuant to <i>hilkhot ­tzedakah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">If the divorce agreement mandated child support until the age of 13, had the parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve this matter in accordance with civil law or if the <i>dayanim</i> at their discretion chose to adhere to customary practice, the obligation to support the child prior to the age of six would extend until the child attains majority.</i>
<b>3. The Rules of Child Placement</b>
The majority of decisors argue that the welfare of a child of tender years is normally best served by placing him with his mother, provided that the father has visitation privileges in order to fulfill his educational duties vis-à-vis his child.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 82:7; <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17; <i>Derishah</i>, EH 82:2.</i> Above the age of six, a son must reside with his father, since from this age onwards, the child requires intensive educational guidance from his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i> 435; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17.<br>Although a father is obligated to teach his son certain skills, including Torah study, he may delegate this responsibility to a third party, such as a teacher or <i>yeshiva.</i> In Ge’onic times, Torah education was imparted by the father, and the <i>Ge’onim</i> therefore ruled that a 6-year old boy should be placed with his widowed father rather than his grandmother because of the paternal duty to educate one’s son. In modern times, however, education is imparted primarily in formal school settings. Should a father choose to delegate his responsibility to teach his son to others, there is no reason that would mandate that his son live with him, barring the mother’s unfitness as a parent. See the <i>teshuvah</i> of R. Yitzhak de Molena, cited in Avraham David, “R. Yitzchak de Molena” [Hebrew], 44 <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> (5729), 553. Today, <i>batei din</i> generally allow a son who attends <i>yeshiva</i> to remain living with his mother even after he has reached the age of six, while allowing his father to have visitation privileges.</i> Regardless of her age, a daughter remains with her mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, n. 9.</i>
As we saw above, however, these rules are legal presumptions; given evidence that a different arrangement is in the child’s best interest, the <i>beit din</i> may determine that such an arrangement is the better course of action. <i>Rema</i> observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It seems to the <i>beit din</i> that it is good for the daughter to live with her mother. However, if it seems to the <i>beit din</i> that it is better for her to be placed in her father’s home, the mother cannot force the father to relinquish custody.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 82:7.</i></small></span>
<i>R. Mordekhai ben Yehuda ha-Levi</i> (seventeenth century Egypt) similarly states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Generally speaking, the Sages of the Talmud said that a daughter should be placed with the mother, as should the son in his earlier years, and later [he should] be with his father … All this is for the benefit of the child … But if the <i>beit din</i> determines that the child’s well-being is not served with this arrangement, but rather is detrimental, they should alter their decision in accordance with the child’s well-being, as it appears to the arbiters.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Darhei No’am</i> 26.</i></small></span>
Numerous authorities have endorsed this notion, maintaining that the rules of child placement are not set in stone and the child’s best interests should determine whether to apply a particular rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">See my “Child Custody: A Comparative Analysis,” 14 <i>Israel Law Review</i> (1978), 480.</i>
In certain cases, the arbiter operates based on his own discretion and common sense, without applying any rules. For example, the <i>Ge’onim</i> discuss a case in which an infant’s mother died and his father moved away, and both sets of grandparents sought custody of the child:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It seems that one ought to enquire what will be the good of the baby (<i>tivuta de-tinok</i>). If he is accustomed to one set of grandparents, recognizes them, and is happy with them, they ought to take the baby, since his mind will be more comfortable with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i> 434.</i></small></span>
<b>4. The Relationship Between Child Support and Child Placement</b>
The Talmud does not address the <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim that a father’s support obligation is contingent upon the child’s willingness to live with or visit his father. <i>Rambam</i>, however, does address the relationship between child maintenance and child placement:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>After the child is six years old, the father may say, “If the child stays with me, I will support him, but if he remains with his mother, I will not pay for support.” And the daughter remains always with her mother, even beyond six years.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17.</i></small></span>
Various interpretations of this statement have been suggested. According to one interpretation, a father cannot coerce his six-year old son to leave his mother and to live with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, EH 82:7. Others argue that the father can, in fact, force his 6-year old son to reside with him; see <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 1:165.</i> whether the son refuses because he is personally uncomfortable living with his father or because his mother has convinced him to remain with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 23.</i> Others construe <i>Rambam</i> as stating that one cannot remove the son from his mother’s home against her will. According to both interpretations, should the boy remain with his mother, the father is exempt from his support duty.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, EH 82:11; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 1:12 (74); <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i>, supra n. 14.</i>
Because a daughter always remains with her mother, regardless of her age, it is apparent from <i>Rambam</i>’s ruling that a father cannot deny her support if she does not wish to live with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">However, the daughter has a right to insist on residing with her father if she so wishes; <i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, supra n. 33; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, EH 82:9–10.</i> However, <i>Rambam</i> is silent regarding a case in which a father is denied visitation rights with his daughter. Is the father’s responsibility to support his daughter contingent on his ability to have a relationship with her?
<i>Maharival</i> discusses a case in which a mother desires to move to another city, thereby depriving the father of visitation privileges. He rules that the daughter may nonetheless remain with her mother, even if her best interests seem to indicate otherwise.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Yosef ibn Lev, the child’s welfare is relevant only when she reaches majority age.</i> In contrast, <i>R. Shmuel de Medina</i> (<i>Maharashdam</i>) argues, among other reasons, that if the daughter’s best interests dictate that she remain with her father, she must remain with him;<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 123.</i> if she remains with her mother, even if this is in the daughter’s best interest, the father is exempt from child support because his daughter is not accessible to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Yosef</i>, EH 86; <i>Teshuvot Shufra de-Ya’akov</i> 60; <i>PDR</i> 13:17, 21, 27–28.</i>
In effect, whereas according to <i>Rambam</i>, the paternal obligation of maintenance is contingent upon placement of the child, for <i>Maharashdam</i>, the support duty is dependent upon the ability to exercise visitation privileges. Most authorities – including <i>R. S. Yisraeli</i>, <i>R. E. Waldenburg</i>, <i>R. O. Yosef</i>, and <i>R. S. Daichovsky</i> – concur with <i>Maharashdam</i>’s view and maintain that a father’s preclusion from visitation of his daughter exempts him from maintenance.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i> 2:89; <i>Teshuvot Tosafot Re’em</i> 114; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> 1:23; <i>Teshuvot Perah Mateh Aharon</i> 2:110. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 16:44; <i>PDR</i> 13:3, 12; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 8, EH 22; S. Daichovsky, “Support of Children – Special Legislation in the Laws of <i>Tzedakah</i>” [Hebrew] 16 <i>Tehumin</i> (5756), 87, 100.</i>
A number of rationales have been suggested for this position. For example, the obligation of <i>tzedakah</i>, the basis for the maintenance duty, does not apply if the recipient will be spiritually harmed. Since the father is responsible for teaching his children Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhata</i> (Jerusalem: 5725), 306–8.</i> their denial of access entails a spiritual detriment, and he is therefore entitled to refrain from furnishing material support. Moreover, the father’s obligation to give <i>tzedaka</i> to his son is based on the principle of “<i>karov karov kodem</i>,” that one’s closest relatives should be given priority in receiving <i>tzedaka</i>. If the son is estranged from his father, he cannot be labeled a “<i>karov</i>” and therefore loses his right to support.
Other authorities, however, maintain that the issue of child support should be addressed on its own grounds, independent of whether a child resides or visits with his father. One Israeli rabbinical court addressed a scenario in which this question was relevant. In the case at hand, a woman separated from her husband without the execution of a <i>get</i> and subsequently cohabitated with another man and had a daughter with him. Eventually, the woman separated from the father of the child, and the father advanced a claim in <i>beit din</i> demanding that a visitation schedule be established with his daughter. In the midst of proceedings, the <i>beit din</i> discovered that the woman was actually still married to her first husband and that the girl was therefore a <i>mamzeret</i>, a child born from an illicit relationship. The mother argued that since the father had revealed the illicit relationship publically and their daughter refused to visit her father, he should not be entitled to visitation rights.
Writing on behalf of the panel, <i>R. Goldschmidt</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The laws regarding child placement are not laws relating to the good of the parents, but rather laws for the benefit of the children; a son or daughter is not an object subject to the rights of a father or mother. The father and mother have no rights, only duties … [as] they are obligated to raise and educate their children. When a <i>beit din</i> is determining the placement of a child, concerning the ties between the child and his parents, there is only one factor … the good of the child, where he will be and under what conditions. However, the rights of the father and mother do not exist at all …<br>When dealing with visitations of the plaintiff with his child, we are not adjudicating an issue of his rights or the rights of the defendant … There is only a discussion of the welfare of the child.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:145, 157–158.</i></small></span>
Many years later, addressing a child custody case under discussion in the Israeli Supreme Court, <i>R. Yosef Kapah</i> addressed the above decision:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It is difficult for me to agree completely with this ruling [that parental rights do not exist at all]. It is clear that parents are not inanimate objects. Even parents are composed of body, soul and emotions … Parents have a right to seek emotional satisfaction, seeing their children grown and develop properly and succeed in their studies …<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Beit Mishpat Elyon</i> 39 (1), 1/81 <i>Nagar</i> v. <i>Nagar</i>, 365, 412.</i></small></span>
Clearly, Halakhah grants parental right and privileges vis-à-vis one’s children when it comes to monetary matters. Thus, for example, if a boy finds an object, it belongs to his father as long as the child is still dependent on him, even if he is older than the mandatory age of support.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 12a-b; Yerushalmi, <i>Ketuvot</i> 6:1; <i>SA</i>, HM 270:2. If a daughter finds an object, it belongs to her father even if she is not dependent on him.</i> Some authorities further maintain that a son’s earnings equally belong to his father as long as his father is supporting him.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 79b; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 64b. See <i>SA</i>, HM 270:2 and commentaries, loc. cit.</i> <i>R. Goldschmidt</i> does not deny that there are certain halakhic-legal parental rights in the realm of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (monetary law); he simply argues that the parents have no rights in the context of child placement. In that context, a child is not related to as an object belonging to the parent. As <i>R. Ben Tzion Uziel</i> writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Neither sons nor daughters of a person are his acquisitions, like his possession of his monetary assets or animals … They are the inheritance of <i>Hashem</i> … to raise and educate them in Torah, commandments, and the way of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, EH 91.</i></small></span>
Since only parental duties are relevant in this context, <i>R. Goldschmidt</i> contends that in resolving visitation issues, a <i>beit din</i> must establish whether a parent can fulfill those duties by being accessible to his child on a periodic basis. Parental feelings and the need to develop a bond with one’s offspring cannot be ignored, but the child’s welfare is given priority. <i>R. Yitzhak Herzog</i> similarly wrote that the <i>beit din</i> should not be concerned with “compassion for the parents … but rather the welfare of the daughters …”<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>, vol. 7, 521–2.</i>
<i>R. Kapah</i>’s argument that visitation and placement should be contingent upon a father’s rights has been rejected by many earlier legists. <i>Maharashdam</i>, for example, explicitly acknowledges a father’s monetary rights vis-à-vis his children, but concludes that placement is to be resolved based on the child’s best interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 38; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i>, supra n. 40.</i>
The panel in the case regarding which <i>R. Goldschmidt</i> wrote determined that it was in the daughter’s best interest to deny the father visitation privileges. The child support obligation is completely unrelated to visitation (or, for that matter, placement), and the panel therefore obligated the father to continue supporting his daughter (as that obligation is not affected by whether or not the child is a <i>mamzer</i>). Although the particular case involved a daughter, <i>R. Goldschmidt</i> argues that the same would apply to a son; if the son’s best interests were to be undermined by visitation, he would be exempt from visiting his father, but the father would remain responsible to provide his son with support.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 42, 158.</i> In short, whereas, the placement of the child is based upon which parent will promote the child’s best interests, the mandating of child support is grounded in the fact that a particular man is the father of a child.
In a recent decision of the Haifa Regional Rabbinical Court, it was noted that the common practice on the rabbinical courts under Israel’s Chief Rabbinate is to follow <i>R. Goldschmidt</i>’s approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 586034/4 (Jan. 16, 2011), <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>.

<b>5. The Validity and Relevance of the Divorce Agreement</b>
Prior to any divorce, the parties negotiate and settle all issue of conflict regarding how to divide up financial assets and address the placement of their children. A secular divorce agreement thus reflects the compromises and vested interests of each party, rather than the <i>halakhot</i> of family law. A number of decisors have noted that a divorce agreement reflects <i>minhag ha-soherim</i> (commercial practice); as such, no symbolic act of undertaking an obligation (<i>kinyan</i>) is necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:353, 368–369; 4:275, 279; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 16:53; <i>Minhat Avraham</i>, supra n. 50. In <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>, <i>kinyan situmta</i> (an undertaking recognized in commerce) suffices; see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a.</i> Once there has been such an exchange of mutual obligations, there is no longer room for invoking an <i>umdana</i> (the expectations of a given party), as the provisions of the agreement govern any further discussion.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah le-Melekh</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiya</i> 6:1. Although the paternal support obligation is for the children and the children have not undertaken any obligation to their father, nonetheless, since the wife consented to comply with the divorce agreement subject to this duty, we construe this obligation as a mutual obligation between the father and the mother of the children.</i>
However, in our case, we are faced with an <i>umdana gedolah</i> or an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> (circumstantial evidence) that at the time of signing off on the divorce agreement the father never anticipated that he would support his children until the age of eighteen without having visitation privileges. In such a case, despite the fact that the agreement fails to stipulate that support is contingent upon visitation rights, <i>R. Elyashiv</i> and <i>R. Sherman</i> assume that the father’s expectation was that the two matters were interdependent. Hence, should the children decline to visit him, he ought to be exempt from continuing to maintain them.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">A. Sherman, “The Nullification of a Monetary Obligation in an Agreement” [Hebrew], 2 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> (5756), 316, 326.</i>
<i>Rema</i>, <i>Taz</i>, and the late Israeli Chief Rabbi <i>R. Avraham Shapiro</i> disagree with this conclusion, insisting that the terms of the divorce agreement are probative regarding the parties’ expectations; one cannot infer any expectation beyond what is recorded in the actual agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 60; <i>Taz</i>, HM 70; <i>Minhat Avraham</i>, supra n. 50.</i> Consequently, the children’s abstention from visitation with their father will not result in exempting their father from maintenance.
Accordingly, the question of whether the father’s child support duty is contingent upon visitation privileges in our case appears to be dependent upon whether we follow the written word of the divorce agreement or the father’s expectation. If the latter is determinant, the <i>Tove’a</i> should be exempt from maintenance; if we adhere to the former, he should be obligated to continue to pay child support.
A third perspective would argue that the <i>beit din</i> is empowered to seek the situation that suits the best interests of the child regardless of the provisions of the divorce agreement. As we saw above, <i>batei din</i> have consistently emphasized that child placement and visitation entail the fulfillment of a parental duty to raise a child in a proper environment, rather than an entitlement to have a child live or visit a parent.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharashdam</i> terms this the “<i>zekhut ha-ben</i>,” the child’s right to be raised in the most suitable environment; supra n. 38. See <i>PDR</i>, 1:75, 147.</i> Thus, <i>Mabit</i> argues that if a mother initially agreed that her daughter should remain with her father and then changed her mind, the child should be returned to her mother if that is in her best interest. The initial agreement is not construed as relinquishing the mother’s right to custody.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 12.</i> In the words of one <i>beit din</i>, children are not “merchandise, so that agreements are executed regarding them;”<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 11:158.</i> placement and visitation arrangements that will undermine their best interests are therefore invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 7:3, 9; 11:153, 159, 163.</i> Thus:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>In ruling regarding child placement … our first and primary concern is the child’s welfare … Parents are prohibited from compromising regarding the body or soul of their child, and any agreements do not obligate us. Any time a concerned party will appear in <i>beit din</i> and will prove that the child’s welfare is best served with him, <i>beit din</i> will not hesitate to rule that the terms of the agreement dealing with child placement are inapplicable and void, and will resolve the matter according to the evidence submitted during the proceedings, without factoring into consideration the agreement executed by the parents.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 11:163; 3:353, 359.</i></small></span>
Other <i>batei din</i> have also endorsed the idea that the <i>beit din</i> may modify divorce agreements in order to promote the child’s best interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 1:157.</i>
Based on the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, including speaking to the children privately (with the written permission of their parents) and a review of the therapist’s conclusions, we find that the children are estranged from their father. Even if one would construe the divorce agreement or assess the father’s expectation that child support would not be forthcoming if his children do not visit him, we find that the children’s best interests dictate that they may choose not to spend time with their father. We hereby direct the <i>Tove’a</i> to continue to furnish child support until the children respectively reach the age of eighteen.
If circumstances change in the future, this panel will revisit this ­matter.
<b>Decision</b>
1. Pursuant to the terms of the divorce agreement, the <i>Tove’a</i> is hereby obligated to pay child support to his children until they reach the age of 18.
2. The children may choose not to visit their father.
3. Any request for modification of this award by the arbitration panel shall be submitted to this panel.

a) Tenure Rights and Severance Pay

<b><i>A. Tenure Rights and Severance Pay</i></b><br><b><i>Avraham Cohen v. Yeshiva Har Tzvi</i></b>
In 1995, Yeshiva Har Tzvi hired R. Avraham Cohen as a third grade rebbe commencing with the school year of 1995–1996. He continued to serve in that capacity until the non-renewal of his contract at the end of the school year 2008–2009. Prior to his dismissal, the <i>Tove’a</i> stole funds from the <i>yeshiva</i>. Within two months of his non-renewal, R. Cohen summoned the <i>yeshiva</i> to <i>beit din</i>. In September 2009, this panel was convened to hear this case and a <i>psak din</i> was issued in January 2010.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> admits that he stole funds from the <i>yeshiva</i> but argues that the non-renewal of his contract is a violation of both Halakhah and <i>minhag</i> (common practice). Pursuant to the rulings of <i>R. Feinstein</i>, <i>R. Shlomo Z. Auerbach</i>, and <i>R. Y. Weiss</i>, the <i>Tove’a</i> claims that a teacher’s contract for one year must be renewed, and if the <i>yeshiva</i> feels that there are grounds for non-renewal of the contract, the <i>yeshiva</i> must allow a <i>beit din</i> to serve as the final arbiter regarding the matter. Moreover, he argues, cases of dismissal that received rabbinical sanction are limited to employers who were acting in an individual capacity, rather than as communal representatives. Consequently, as <i>R. Feinstein</i> notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> HM 2:34.</i> the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to receive his salary from the period of the non-renewal of his contract until the <i>beit din</i>’s ruling that the termination was justified.
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that even if one were to contend that the common practice is not to renew teachers’ contracts, Halakhah would not validate this <i>minhag</i>, even though it relates to monetary affairs (<i>dinei mamonot</i>), because it is neither endorsed by a rabbinic authority nor based upon an ordinance approved by the leaders of the community. Moreover, whereas the <i>yeshiva</i> argues that a teacher can be requested to leave “at-will,” according to <i>R. Feinstein</i>, the <i>halakhah</i> that one cannot fail to renew a labor contract or terminate without cause cannot be overridden by a <i>minhag</i> that provides otherwise.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> HM 331:5; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 1:72, 75. In effect, R. Feinstein construes this <i>halakhah</i> as an “<i>issur.</i>” Since a <i>minhag</i> cannot nullify an <i>issur</i> (as per <i>Rosh ha-Shanah</i> 15b), an employee cannot be terminated without cause.</i>
Third, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that the appointment of a <i>melamed</i> (teacher) is a sacred appointment (<i>minui shel kedushah</i>), and he therefore cannot be dismissed except in cases of “<i>peshi’a</i>” (gross negligence).
Although the <i>Tove’a</i> admits that his employment agreement explicitly stipulates that he is not entitled to any post-employment benefits, including severance pay,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Severance is a monetary allowance paid by the employer to his employees, generally upon permanent termination of employment or non-renewal of a contract. These payments may be either distributed as a lump sum or as a series of periodic payments. The amount of remuneration is dependent upon the length of employment of the worker.</i> he argues that he originally agreed to waive these benefits because he was financially comfortable at the time. Since the <i>Tove’a</i> lost the majority of his assets in the 2008 market meltdown, however, he is now in dire need of these resources. Furthermore, since the <i>yeshiva</i> provided severance pay for six dismissed rebbes in the past, a <i>minhag</i> has been established and ought to be grounds for awarding severance, overriding the provisions of the employment agreement. Finally, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that the <i>yeshiva</i> should recognize his unstinting dedication and therefore provide him with severance benefits. His act of thievery was unrelated to his educational contributions to the <i>yeshiva</i> and ought not nullify his right to receive severance pay.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Counterclaims</b>
The <i>Nitva</i> argues that the <i>Tove’a</i> was an “at-will employee,” and as such was not contracted for life. Towards the end of every school year, the <i>Tove’a</i>, like all other faculty members of the <i>yeshiva</i>, received a contract for the forthcoming school year. In total, the <i>yeshiva</i> and <i>Tove’a</i> signed ten employment contracts. Consequently, at the end of any given year, the <i>Tove’a</i> had the right to decide whether to renew his contract for the upcoming year. When the facts indicated that the <i>Tove’a</i> stole funds from the <i>yeshiva</i> during the 2008–2009 school year, the <i>Nitva</i> notified the <i>Tove’a</i> in a timely fashion that the <i>yeshiva</i> would decline to offer him a contract for the 2009–2010 school year.
Finally, the <i>Nitva</i> argues that since the <i>Tove’a</i> only became aware that other teachers had received severance packages after the <i>yeshiva</i>’s notification of dismissal and given the circumstances surrounding his dismissal, the <i>Nitva</i> should not be entitled to such benefits. Moreover, the employment agreement precludes the awarding of severance, and as such the contract should override the <i>minhag</i> of the few instances in which severance was provided to others. Finally, the <i>Tove’a</i>’s present economic situation should not affect the question of whether he is entitled to a severance package.
<b>Discussion</b>
The <i>beit din</i> must address two questions. First, is the <i>Tove’a</i>’s employment considered a tenured position, in which case termination or non-renewal of a contract requires prior <i>beit din</i> authorization? Second, is the <i>Tove’a</i> entitled to severance benefits?
<b>1. The Tenured Position</b>
We will begin by addressing the question of tenure and the role of <i>beit din</i> in cases of employment termination or non-renewal of a contract. According to <i>R. Feinstein</i>, a teacher – like any other type of employee – retains his position for life, subject only to removal for cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 1:75–8; 2:34.</i> This ruling applies even when the <i>yeshiva</i> and teacher agreed to a fixed term of employment in the contract. In effect, a term contract conveys the notion that the employee is not “an indentured servant”; it is not a device empowering an employer to dismiss his worker at the expiration of the term.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, OH 205–206.</i>
<i>R. Feinstein</i> suggests that if the agreement provides that a teacher’s contract may not be renewed even in the absence of just cause, the provision may be invalid, as such action would be contrary to the halakhic rule that a teacher may only be dismissed with good reason. Moreover, prior to dismissal of an employee, a <i>beit din</i> must determine that there are grounds for termination or non-renewal of a contract. Until such <i>beit din</i> determination, R. Feinstein contends that the employer is obligated to pay the worker’s salary.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> HM 1:77.</i>
Notwithstanding the view of <i>R. Feinstein</i>, the consensus of most decisors recognizes a <i>yeshiva</i>’s right to refuse to offer a new contract, without any requisite need for a <i>beit din</i>’s approval.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities invoke the need for <i>beit din</i> determination prior to termination in limited circumstances, such as an employee who is suspected of being a thief or a pedophile. See <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:603; <i>Teshuvot Hikekei Lev</i>, vol. 1, OH 47; <i>Dinei Mamonot</i> 3:34; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:152–153; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 232:5. Others argue that absent <i>beit din</i> determination, the evidence must demonstrate that he is a thief prior to termination. See <i>Ra’avad</i> and <i>Rashba</i>, <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 28a; <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 28a; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:174; <i>Erekh Shai</i>, HM 421; <i>Teshuvot Ohel Yitzhak</i>, HM 53.</i> In fact, it is difficult to find statements in support of <i>R. Feinstein</i>’s position in the Talmud, codes, and <i>teshuvot</i> literature.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 109a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 10:7; <i>Ra’avad</i>, ad loc.; <i>Tur</i>, YD 245:17–18 and HM 306:8; <i>SA</i>, HM 306:8, 333:2; <i>Rema</i>, HM 421:6; <i>Teshuvot Asher le-Shlomo</i>, no. 63; <i>Milei de-Nezikin</i> (in the name of R. Moshe Stern), 50–51,133; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:151; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:132.</i> <i>Rema</i> explicitly states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If someone has a maidservant and he is suspicious that she will steal from him, he may dismiss her prior to the expiration date of her employment. <sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 421:6.</i></small></span>
A fortiori, in our scenario, in which the <i>Tove’a</i> already had stolen from the <i>Nitva</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> was authorized to refuse to renew a contract with the <i>Tove’a</i> without the prior approval of <i>beit din</i>.
There is certainly precedent for rabbinically sanctioned dismissal of teachers by communal institution without recourse to a <i>beit din</i> judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Torat Moshe</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 141; <i>Teshuvot Ohel Yosef</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 4; <i>PDR</i> 14:101.</i> In legitimating an employer’s right to terminate a teacher for inappropriate behavior, <i>R. Ya’akov Emden</i> invokes the rule of “<i>avid inish dina le-nafshei</i>,” taking the Halakhah into one’s own hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishnat Ya’avetz</i> 2:38.</i> Under certain circumstances, to prevent potential financial damage, an individual is empowered with the authority of a <i>beit din</i> to judge his case for himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding viewing the plaintiff as assuming the role of <i>beit din</i>, see <i>Dibberot Moshe</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 18.</i> In <i>R. Emden</i>’s view, this empowerment equally extends to an employer’s right to dismiss a teacher in cases of negligence. A similar conclusion is arrived at by <i>Hazon Ish</i> concerning the right to demand that an employee leave his work upon the expiration date of the contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 23:2.</i>
The <i>Tove’a</i> further alludes to the rulings of <i>R. Auerbach</i> and <i>R. Weiss</i>, which mandate recourse to a <i>beit din</i> prior to termination, but those rulings are limited to cases involving a teacher’s right to strike<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 1:87.</i> and conflicts between a principal and teacher regarding differing educational philosophies.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 4:75:12.</i> Hence, these rulings are inapplicable to our situation of alleged malfeasance.
Halakhah recognizes the ability of parties to enter into contractual agreements, including labor contracts.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 38:5, HM 207:1; 241:9; 291:17; 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, HM 207:1.</i> At the expiration of the term of a contract, both parties have free rein regarding whether to renew.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 21a; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 112; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 4, YD 18; <i>PDR</i> 3:91; 8:129, 143–144.</i>
The question of whether employment generates tenure rights for the employee is governed by <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, the custom of the region.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 18:94; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 10:11, n. 35. Pursuant to <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i>, no. 23, if the prevailing practice is that employment is a tenured position, then one can only dismiss such an employee for cause; see <i>PDR</i> 3:91, 93. Whether a congregational rabbi who receives a contract with a fixed-term is subject to dismissal without just cause after the expiration of the term is a question that is beyond the scope of this presentation.</i> Thus, absent a provision in the contract to the contrary, if a particular community construes a labor contract as generating employee tenure rights, then the employee cannot be terminated. On the other hand, absent a provision in the contract to the contrary, if another community views him as “an at-will employee,” then the employer can terminate him at-will or after the expiration date of the contract. The customary practice of a particular community thus will determine whether an employee enjoys tenure or not.
To have binding force, the <i>minhag</i> must be clear, widespread in the particular locale, and have been followed at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 79:4; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 475; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 342; <i>Rema</i>, HM 331:1.</i> Although there is a long-standing halakhic dispute regarding whether a monetary custom practiced by the community on their own has any authority or whether a custom requires endorsement by rabbinical authority or approval of communal leaders, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, <i>Rema</i>, and others have either explicitly or implicitly ruled that a monetary custom has independent status, even if this result in extraction of money from <i>muhzakim</i> (those in present possession of the assets).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 176:10, 218:19, 229:2, 230:10, 232:6, 330:5, 331:12; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 19-20; <i>Rema</i>, HM 72:5.</i>
The common practice of the <i>Nitva</i> and the other local <i>yeshiva</i>s is to offer one-year renewable contracts to its teachers. This <i>minhag</i> is valid, even if unaccompanied by rabbinic or communal sanction, either because the <i>Tove’a</i> is viewed as an at-will employee or pursuant to the normative position reflected in the rulings of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema.</i> In effect, today, a <i>melamed</i> is appointed pursuant to the provisions of <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, similar to any other employee, rather than being viewed as a “<i>minui shel kedushah</i>” (a sacred appointment).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i>, p. 260, n. 35. Others do view a <i>melamed</i> as a “<i>minui shel kedushah</i>”; see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 12b, s.v. <i>halakhah</i>; <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Perush ha-Mishnah</i>, <i>Menahot</i> 13:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i> (Blau edition) 1:111; <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, negative command 316; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i>, 3:200; <i>Rema</i>, YD 245:22; <i>Teshuvot Shlomo le-Beit ha-Levi</i>, YD 8; <i>Teshuvot Ya’akov le-Beit ha-Levi</i> 5:50; <i>Kerem Shlomo</i>, YD 50; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OC 50, YD 3:100; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i> 312:34; <i>Orhot ha-Mishpatim</i> 4:10–11. For an example of a halakhic justification for termination, see Yosef Yedid Halevi, <i>Kuntres u-le-Levi Amar</i> (Jerusalem: 5753).<br>Others contend that a rabbinic post is an example of <i>serarah</i> (communal authority). Since a communal position can be inherited by a member of his family, the right of inheritance affirms that a rabbi holds a tenured position. See <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Kelei ha-Mikdash</i> 4:20, <i>Hilkhot Melakhim</i> 1:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 271; <i>PDR</i> 10:38–60.</i>
Upon review of the evidence presented by the parties and the applicable Halakhah, the <i>beit din</i> accepts the <i>Nitva</i>’s position that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s employment was term employment, as recorded in writing. As such, the <i>Nitva</i> was empowered to dismiss the <i>Tove’a</i> without receiving initial approval from a <i>beit din</i>.
<b>2. Entitlement to Severance Pay</b>
We will now turn our attention to the question of whether the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to a severance package.
As is the customary practice in contemporary <i>batei din</i>, both parties to this hearing signed an arbitration agreement (<i>shtar borerut</i>) empowering this panel to resolve their dispute.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 12:18.</i> One of the terms of the agreement is that the <i>beit din</i> has the authority to resolve the matter according to <i>din</i> (Halakhah) or through <i>pesharah kerovah le-din</i> (court-ordered settlement in accordance with Halakhah). Our discussion of the awarding of severance will be addressed on these two functionally and conceptually different planes, in addition to the plane of <i>lifnim meshurat ha-din</i>, a sub-category of <i>pesharah</i> that entails going beyond the demands of Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban</i>, <i>Commentary on the Torah</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 6:18; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 2:132; <i>Teshuvot Giv’at Pinhas</i> 68. For an approach towards understandin this notion, see Lichtenstein, infra n. 38.</i>
The right of an employee to receive compensation upon dismissal is not mentioned in the Torah or Talmud, nor in the overwhelming majority of post-Talmudic sources. <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i> finds moral basis for such remuneration based on analogy to the laws of an <i>eved ivri</i>, a Jew bereft of funds and in need of gainful employment who is indentured to work for six years.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 16a. Cf. <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Avadim</i> 3:12, who contends that there is no duty to give a gratuitous gift to an <i>eved ivri</i>. As a result, some authorities refuse to invoke the <i>halakhah</i> of <i>ha’anakah</i> as grounds for awarding severance; see <i>Teshuvot Yam ha-Gadol</i> 22.</i> Just as an <i>eved ivri</i> receives a parting, albeit gratuitous gift – “<i>ha’anakah</i>” – from his employer upon the completion of six years,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 15:12–14.</i> a dismissed laborer should receive a severance package:

This position was endorsed by <i>Ri</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 15a, s.v. <i>ve’idach</i> and <i>Teshuvot Even ha-Shoham</i>, HM 120 and attributed to R. Moshe Feinstein. See the letter dated 15th of Adar 5763 from R. Dovid Feinstein to R. Friedman (a copy of the letter is on file with author).</i></small></span>
Following in the footsteps of <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, numerous <i>Poskim</i> endorse the view that the giving of severance is a halakhic-moral obligation rather than a halakhic-legal duty,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For the interaction between a halakhic-legal obligations and halakhic-moral obligations, see my “The Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective,” in A. Levine (ed<i>.</i>), <i>Oxford Handbook on Judaism and Economics</i> (NY: 2010), 340, 344–48.</i> and as such is unenforceable by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh,</i> HM 86:3; <i>Sma</i>, HM 86:2; <i>Tumim,</i> HM 86:3.

Zalman N. Goldberg, <i>Shivhei ha-Pesharah</i>, sec. 5 (letter to Kollel Mishpetei Aretz, Ofra, Israel). Nonetheless, in this situation, we refrained from invoking <i>pesharah kerovah la-din.</i></i>
Israeli rabbinical courts have preferred to base the duty to pay severance upon the existence of <i>minhag</i> to do so. Accordingly, whether an employee would be entitled to severance pay would depend on whether this is the practice in his community, his profession, and/or in his place of employment.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:330, 331; 3:92–94, 272, 287; 4:127–129, 8:78–81. See also <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 7:48:10.</i> As we explained above, for a custom to be binding upon the employer, it must be clear that the compensation awarded to the worker was severance and that it is common practice. Even though the <i>Tove’a</i> only became aware of the <i>yeshiva</i>’s custom to award severance after the <i>yeshiva</i>’s notification of non-renewal of his contract, the halakhic power of the <i>minhag</i>, independent of the parties’ knowledge of its existence, establishes the employer duty’s to award compensation and the employee’s right to receive it.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 2, 315; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i>, p. 149, n. 18.

However, in our scenario, the parties originally agreed that severance would not be awarded upon termination or non-renewal of the contract. In monetary matters, parties are permitted to design their own business relationship, provided that the arrangement complies with a proper form (for example, involving a <i>kinyan</i>) and is not a violation of any prohibitions, such as theft or the prohibition of taking interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, HM 344:1.</i> Consequently, the parties’ agreement is valid and binding, even if it is in conflict with a <i>minhag</i> that mandates the award.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 331:1; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ga’on Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a; <i>PDR</i> 8:7; Yisrael Yifrach, “A Labor Agreement in Variance with Local Custom” [Hebrew], 3 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5758), 278.

One of the primary objectives of compromise is to promote <i>shalom</i>, peace between litigious parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b (R.

As this is the case in the situation at hand, <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i> does not mandate that the <i>Nitva</i>’s funds be transferred to the <i>Tove’a</i>, even for the sake of fostering peace.

Y. Weiss</i> discusses a case in which an Argentinean Jewish butcher owed a tremendous sum of money to the local Jewish community. Was the community authorized to issue injunctive relief in the form of seizing some of the butcher’s machinery, such as a refrigerator, electric meat carver, and scales, for purposes of satisfying the outstanding debt? Although the community was impoverished, <i>R. Weiss</i> concluded that they should act <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i>, invoking the concept of “the community is not poor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 5:121. See Yerushalmi<i>, Gittin</i> 3:7; R. Shmuel ha-Sefardi, <i>Commentary on Horayot</i> 10b. See also Y. Herzog, <i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>, vol. 9; <i>Teshuvot</i>, HM 88. For these and other sources, see R. Kleinman, “The Community is Not Poor” [Hebrew], 20 <i>Sidra</i> (5765), 195.</i> This principle applies even if the communal institution in question will incur a financial loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Binyan Av</i> 1:38, sec. 3, in the name of R. Shmuel Salant.</i>
Other authorities have argued that a public institution must conduct itself <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i> due to its status as an <i>adam hashuv</i>, a distinguished individual. In the words of one rabbinical court:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>[A communal institution] has a greater duty to appease complaints and arguments … and it is duty bound to deflect criticism from its institution …<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem Supreme Court of Appeals, Z.

In effect, invoking considerations of <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i> upon a communal institution, based either on the concept of “the community is not poor” or its status as an <i>adam hashuv</i>, would create a new line of liability, leading to a result different from what would have occurred under the rubric of <i>din</i>.
The question remains, however, if there are grounds for invoking <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i> in the present context of awarding severance pay in general and the economic situation of the <i>Tove’a</i> in particular. The financial situation of either of the parties is entirely irrelevant in terms of <i>din</i> and <i>pesharah</i>; in fact, we are explicitly and repeatedly exhorted to ignore such factors in resolving a dispute.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra</i> 19:15; <i>Ketuvot</i> 84a; <i>SA</i>, HM 17:10.</i> On the level of <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i>, however, the <i>Tove’a</i>’s financial situation may be taken into account. For example, <i>R. Hayyim ben Baer Rapaport</i> (nineteenth century Russia) ordered a community to pay compensation to a dismissed <i>shohet</i> (ritual slaughterer) due to the fact that he was destitute with dependents.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mayyim Hayyim</i>, OH 6, cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 333:3.</i> A thirteenth century <i>teshuvah</i> states:

Weiss, <i>Kovetz Darkhei Horo’ah</i>, vol. 5, 97.</i></small></span>
At first glance, it would seem plausible to argue that the <i>Nitva</i> in this case should be viewed as a communal institution, which is halakhically considered to have “deep pockets” and should therefore be compelled to dispense the severance package to the <i>Tove’a</i>, especially given his financial state. However, in considering resolution according to <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din</i>, the <i>beit din</i> must take all surrounding circumstances into consideration. This panel concludes that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s act of thievery of the <i>Nitva</i>’s assets precludes the issuance of such a mandate.
<b>Decision</b>
1. The <i>Nitva</i>, as a communal educational institution, had the authority to terminate a teacher’s employment at the expiration of the term of the contract without first receiving a definitive ruling of a <i>beit din</i> that there are halakhically acceptable grounds for dismissal. Hence, we may choose to refrain from adjudicating whether the grounds for dismissal were justifiable or not.
2. Nevertheless, we have decided to address the merits of the <i>yeshiva</i>’s failure to renew his contract. Upon review of the evidence presented by the parties, the <i>beit din</i> recognizes the talents of R. Cohen as an educator, which are attested to by the Yeshiva Har Tzvi administration. His educational credentials and pedagogical achievements notwithstanding, however, a teacher must be simultaneously aware of the Torah values espoused by the <i>yeshiva</i> in which he teaches, as well as the values promoted in the homes of his students. The <i>Tove’a</i>’s improper behavior relating to theft of the <i>yeshiva</i>’s assets undermines the <i>yeshiva</i>’s mission and subverts his ability to serve as a halakhic-ethical model for the students to emulate.
Given the facts of the case, we find that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s removal by the <i>Nitva</i> due to his malfeasance was justifiable. Consequently, there are neither grounds for reinstatement, nor for reimbursement for “lost wages” accrued between his termination date and convening this <i>beit din</i> hearing. Furthermore, there is no basis for the awarding of severance.
3. In summary, all of the claims of the <i>Tove’a</i> are hereby dismissed.
The obligations set forth herein shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the arbitration agreement.
<b>Final Thoughts</b>
Some contemporary <i>dayanim</i> refrain from awarding severance pay to any employee, absent an explicit provision in the labor agreement, as such an entitlement is not mentioned in the Talmud or codes. When severance pay is awarded, contemporary decisors invoke at least two grounds for doing so.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PDR</i> 1:330–332; 4:127–129; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 6:167; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i>, 7:48:10; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 3:473.</i> Nevertheless, I am aware of a number of <i>dayanim</i> who have awarded severance pay to teachers even when the <i>minhag</i> of the particular <i>yeshiva</i> or community was not to do so. Such an award is in contravention of Halakhah, which dictates that such an award is forthcoming only as a form of “<i>ha’anakah</i>” based on the common practice or as a form of <i>lifnim me-shurat ha-din.</i>
Should severance be awarded, the amount is based either on the practice of the particular economic sector or up to the <i>beit din</i>’s discretion. The Israeli Rabbinical Courts have adopted a formula of 8.333% of the employee’s salary per year of employment (<i>hodesh le-shanah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PDR</i> 1:332; 3:272, 287; 4:126; 8:162; <i>Teshuvot Be-Tzel ha-Hokhmah</i> 3:100; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 6:167; <i>Yam ha-Gadol</i>, supra n. 24.</i> In the absence of a prevailing practice in a particular economic sector, in the institution wherein the individual is employed, or in the local community, <i>dayanim</i> in the New York metropolitan area who endorse the propriety of rendering such an award will also grant severance based upon the formula of <i>hodesh le-shanah</i>.

b) The Status of a Promissory Note

<b><i>B. The Status of a Promissory Note</i></b><br><b><i>Ya’akov Silverstein v. Shimon Cohen</i></b>
On or about February 22, 2006, Shimon Cohen issued to Ya’akov Silverman (<i>Tove’a</i>) a promissory note dated May 22, 2008 in the principal amount of $1,000,000. The maturity date was May 22, 2009. As of May 19, 2010, the business loan remained unpaid. The note provides for interest at the rate of 10% per annum (prior to default) and 12% per annum and liquidated damages of $75,000 after default.
Finally, for a half year, the <i>Nitva</i> was employed by the <i>Tove’a</i> and to date he is owed $25,000 salary.
Both the <i>Tove’a</i> and the <i>Nitva</i> are observant Jews. There is no clause in the original agreement addressing whether Halakhah or secular law should resolve any differences between the parties or ambiguities in the note’s provisions. The <i>Tove’a</i> has requested that the decision be grounded in secular law, while the <i>Nitva</i> has requested that Halakhah serve as the basis for our decision.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> claims that he is entitled to the principal amount of the note, as well as the accrued interest of 10% per annum (prior to default) and 12% per annum after default. Since the note was not repaid on its maturity date, the note has been in default since its maturity date. The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he was entitled to demand interest (<i>ribbit</i>) on the principal because the funds were originally advanced as investment money, rather than a loan.
In an e-mail sent by the <i>Nitva</i> to the <i>Tove’a</i>, dated December 28, 2010, the <i>Nitva</i> writes that he hopes soon to “honor my commitment” to the <i>Tove’a</i> and reiterates that “I am sorry I have not been unable to pay you back yet.” On the basis of this communication and the fact that he signed the written promissory note, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that the <i>Nitva</i> acknowledges the above commitments, and that to date he has been derelict in his duty of repayment.
Based upon the terms of the written promissory note and applicable civil law governing the oral promise, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he is entitled to payment of the principal and accrued interest. Moreover, given the default on the loan, the <i>Tove’a</i> is advancing a claim for liquidated damages (compensation for breach of the agreement) due to the loss of interest income.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Counterclaims</b>
The <i>Nitva</i> argues that a promissory note is only a promise, and according to Halakhah, only obligations are enforceable. Therefore, a <i>beit din</i> cannot obligate him to repay his loan. Moreover, the interest accruals are a violation of the interdict against taking <i>ribbit</i> (interest). Although the <i>Tove’a</i> admits that he voluntarily agreed to pay the interest, he argues that the <i>Tove’a</i> should be penalized for lending money accompanied by interest payments.
Furthermore, the <i>Nitva</i> argues that a default interest provision in the form of liquidated damages should be unenforceable under the Halakhah’s rules of obligation. For an obligation to be halakhically binding, there must be firm resolve to finalize an agreement (<i>gemirat da’at</i>). For example, if Reuven agrees to rent a field for the price of a portion of the crop he cultivates and he obligates himself to pay 1,000 <i>zuz</i>, an unreasonable amount, should the land remain fallow, no liability for this amount would ensue. Because he never expected to pay this amount, the agreement would be labeled an <i>asmakhta</i>, the absence of firm resolve, and his liability would be limited to the field’s potential productivity.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 104b; see Aaron Levine, <i>Economics and Jewish Law: Halakhic Perspectives</i> (NY: 1987), 195.</i> The <i>Nitva</i> argues that liquidated damages are uncertain and cannot be determined by any known rule, and there therefore cannot be <i>gemirat da’at</i> in any such agreement. Accordingly, the <i>Nitva</i> should be exempt from paying the liquidated damages.
Regarding the outstanding salary owed to him by the <i>Tove’a</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> is requesting his outstanding salary as well as interest due to the economic loss of the use of the funds.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Application of Secular Law in a <i>Beit Din</i> Proceeding</b>
The first issue to be resolved is whether this matter will be adjudicated based upon Halakhah or secular law.
Seemingly, the proposal to resolve this matter pursuant to secular law is fraught with perilous ramifications. To suggest this posture seems to ignore the prohibition against recourse to <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>, litigating in non-Jewish courts. As <i>R. J. David Bleich</i> notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Recourse to a gentile forum is tantamount to a declaration by the litigant that he is amenable to allowing an alien code of law to supersede the law of the Torah … The litigant appears before the gentile courts because he accepts their authority, and if they administer the law of Moses he accepts that law not because he regards it as binding upon him by virtue of having been commanded by God, but because it has been endorsed and adopted by gentiles …<br>The prohibition … is not limited to bringing a suit before a gentile court … The prohibition includes any judicial proceeding that negates the Law of Moses. A judicial body composed entirely of judges who happen to be members of the Jewish community but who administer an alien system of law is undoubtedly to be classified as within the halakhic category of <i>arka’ot shel akum</i> for the simple reason that the laws such a court administers are not those of the Torah.<br>Since … acquiescence by both litigants does not serve to mitigate the prohibition … and since the prohibition applies even when the judges themselves are Jews, it follows that the parties are not entitled to accept the authority of a rabbinic court … but stipulate that the <i>beit din</i> shall apply the law of a secular state. Accordingly, if two parties … enter into a contract and stipulate that any dispute with regard to fulfillment of the terms of the contract is to be resolved by a rabbinic court in accordance with, for example, the laws of the State of Delaware, the stipulation is void by virtue of being inconsistent with biblical law (<i>matneh al mah she-katuv ba-Torah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, “Litigation and Arbitration before Non-Jews,” 34 <i>Tradition</i> (2000), 58, 65–67. For an earlier treatment of this issue by the same author, see <i>Be-Netivot ha-Halakhah</i> [Hebrew] (NY: 1998), vol. 2, 170–1.</i></small></span>
As noted above, individuals are empowered to make agreements contrary to Halakhah provided that these agreements do not violate ritual law. An agreement to adjudicate in a <i>beit din</i> but according to secular law would thus seem to be invalid. Indeed, such arrangements have met with trenchant criticism from the <i>Aharonim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Taz</i>, HM 26:3; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 61:23; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 529.</i> and a number of contemporary <i>dayanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See supra chap. 4 – Division of Marital Assets upon Divorce, nn. 48–50.</i>
Nevertheless, there is a coherent and persuasive halakhic tradition, commencing with <i>Rashba</i>, that supports the acceptance of this type of arrangement. According to these authorities, two individuals who enter into an agreement to resolve their financial matters according to civil law are merely waiving the privilege granted by the halakhic legal system in order to avail themselves of some benefit from the secular system in one particular situation. Since they are not indicating wholesale affirmation of the secular legal system, the agreement is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See ibid., nn. 51–54.</i>
Thus, there are grounds for the <i>Tove’a</i> to request that he benefit from the norms of secular law that relate to his claims provided that course of action is agreed to by the opposing party (accompanied by the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>). However, since that the <i>Nitva</i> insists that this matter be resolved according to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>, this matter will be adjudicated accordingly.
<b>2. The Promissory Note</b>
<b><i>a. The Binding Nature of the Note</i></b>
A promissory note, sometimes referred to as a “note payable,” is a contract in which one party (the “maker” or “issuer”) makes an unconditional promise in writing to pay a sum of money to the other party (the “payee”), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms.
The terms of a note usually include the principal amount, the interest rate if any, the parties, the date, the terms of repayment (which may include interest), and the maturity date. The provisions of the submitted promissory notes in this case include all of these elements.
As the <i>Nitva</i> notes, a promise is not enforceable in <i>beit din</i>, as it lacks the two critical components of a halakhic obligation – <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of acquisition) and <i>gemirat da’at</i> (concrete articulation of the parties’ resolve to undertake the obligation). According to the <i>halakhot</i> of obligations (<i>hithayvut</i>), in order for a loan agreement (or any agreement) to be legally effective, the payee must undertake the obligation to repay the loan by declaring, for example, “I obligate to pay Reuven such and such,” “I undertake to pay Reuven such and such,” or “I admit that I am obligated to Reuven such and such.” Such language is <i>meshabed nafshei</i> – it “enslaves” the payee in the present by transforming him into a debtor.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 60:6; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 60:13; <i>Rema</i>, HM 60:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 3:173; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 29.</i> Since a promise entails executing an obligation in the future (for example, a promise to sell goods) or to transfer title of something that is not yet in existence (<i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>), it is legally unenforceable.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad loc., s.v. <i>kinyan devarim hu</i>; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>SA</i>, HM 245:1. Although a promise is not enforceable on the level of <i>din</i>, according to the strict dictates of the law, it constitutes a halakhic-moral obligation that can be enforced based upon the norms of <i>pesharah</i>. See <i>Maharsha</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; Z. Goldberg, “<i>Shivhei ha-Pesharah</i>,” [Hebrew] 1 <i>Mishpetei Eretz</i> (5762), 78, 82.</i>
Despite the lack of a legal obligation to fulfill one’s promise, however, there remains a moral obligation to do so. Accordingly, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>When one conducts and concludes commercial transactions using words only [the negotiation and agreement not being completed by a formal act of acquisition], that person should stand by his word, even though none of the purchase price has been taken, nor a buyer’s mark made on the goods … Whoever withdraws from this type of transaction, whether buyer or seller, is deemed a faithless person.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 204:7.</i></small></span>
<i>Rema</i> adds:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A person should stand by his word, even though no act of acquisition has been performed, only mere words have passed between the parties …<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 204:11.</i></small></span>
If a seller articulates an oral commitment to sell realty or other property to a prospective buyer, either party may technically withdraw from consummating the sale, as no <i>kinyan</i> has been executed between them; since enforceability depends upon a <i>kinyan</i>, a promise cannot be enforced by legal action. Nevertheless, should either party renege on the agreement, he is stigmatized as a <i>mehusar amana</i> (lacking faith). A promise is binding because of the halakhic need to keep one’s word, even if the <i>beit din</i> cannot enforce it. As I have articulated elsewhere:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Halakhah views promise-keeping as aligning oneself with the fulfillment of a religious norm rather than compliance with a norm of natural law, institutional moral norm, or moral norm established by social convention.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See my “The Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective,” in A. Levine (ed.), <i>The Oxford Handbook on Judaism and Economics</i> (NY: 2010), 340, 344–6.</i></small></span>
In our case, the promissory note states, “I promise to pay.” Whereas American law would construe such a note as binding,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">E. Allan Farnsworth, <i>Contracts</i> (Boston: 1982), 756, n. 12.</i> Halakhah would seem to disregard the possibility of enforcing such a promise, as it creates no obligation in the present but only one in the future. However, the fact that the money was transferred to the payee at the time that the promise was made transforms the payee into a debtor at the time the note was executed. By dint of the exchange of money, the promise to pay is transformed into an obligation to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 10:363, 377.</i>
Moreover, although this agreement did not involve a halakhic <i>kinyan</i>, a number of authorities have validated contracts (such as real estate, surety, and divorce agreements) based upon <i>kinyan situmta</i>, transferring an object according to commercial practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 66; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:79, sec. 7; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), YD 233; <i>PDR</i> 6:202, 216; 9:16, 40; 16:133, 138.</i> Accordingly, a promissory note should be valid provided that it was drafted properly and enforceable according to secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:279, 291; 18:108, 112.</i>
As such, the written promissory note in our case creates an obligation upon the payee to repay the principal to the issuer either due to the money transfer at the time of making the promise or due to the provisions of secular law.
<b><i>b. Payment of Interest during the Term of the Loan</i></b>
The prohibition against taking interest, <i>ribbit</i>, applies even when it was a provision of the original agreement (<i>ribbit ketzutzah</i>). Any interest provision that is structured to increase with time and payable prior to the maturity date of a note is a form of <i>ribbit</i>, and therefore cannot be collected,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, YD 167:16.</i> regardless of whether the borrower is wealthy or not or if he is willing to pay the <i>ribbit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, YD 160:1.</i>
Although the <i>Tove’a</i> claims that he is entitled to collect interest on the principal due to the fact that this sum was originally advanced as investment money rather than a loan, Halakhah mandates that once these monies were transformed from an investment to a loan, the parties are considered a lender and a borrower, and the halakhot of <i>ribbit</i> are therefore applicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berit Yehuda</i> 35:6.</i> Accordingly, the <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to receive interest on his investment.
<b><i>c. The Validity of a Promissory Note with Ribbit Provisions</i></b>
Does the incorporation of <i>ribbit</i> provisions in the original agreement nullify the note entirely, thus denying the lender his right to collect the principal? In other words, does the halakhic illegality of one provision nullify the other provisions of the agreement, which are acceptable on their own?
The Talmud addresses this question directly:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If a <i>shtar</i> (legal document) provides for <i>ribbit</i>, we penalize him and he cannot collect either principal or interest; this is the position of R. Meir. And the Sages state: He collects the principal, but not the interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 72a.</i></small></span>
According to the <i>Sages</i>, the stipulation of <i>ribbit</i> does not nullify the agreement, and the principal is therefore collectible. While <i>R. Meir</i> essentially concurs, he maintains that we penalize the lender for executing a document with interest provisions, and therefore deny him even the principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">According to most commentators, in the view of R. Meir, the loan is treated as an oral agreement and the lender may only recover his debt from the borrower’s unencumbered assets. See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 72a, s.v. <i>shtar</i>; <i>Ramban</i>, <i>Hiddushim</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 72a, s.v. <i>shtar</i>. Cf. <i>Tosafot Ri</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 30b, s.v. <i>shtar</i>, who argues that no recovery is possible.</i> According to the rabbinic consensus, the view of the <i>Sages</i> is adopted by Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> and <i>SA</i>, HM 52:1, YD 161:11.</i> Thus, as long as the document clearly differentiates between the principal and the interest, the lender can collect the principal. Therefore, in our case, the incorporation of <i>ribbit</i> provisions in the note does not nullify the validity of the note, and the principal is collectible.
If the distinction between the principal and interest in the note is arguably unclear, the lender could collect the principal based on the borrower’s acknowledgment of the debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 52:1; <i>Sma</i>, ad loc., sec. 2.</i> This method would be effective even according to <i>R. Meir</i>, who would ordinarily penalize the lender for the <i>ribbit</i> provision. Accordingly, in our case, the <i>Tove’a</i> may collect based upon the <i>Nitva</i>’s admission that he owes the money; there is no need to rely upon the note itself.
<b><i>d. Liquidated Damages Clause</i></b>
As noted above, Halakhah dictates that agreements are binding as long as the parties voluntarily consent to their terms and there is a firm resolve (<i>gemirat da’at</i>) to execute and comply with the terms of the agreement. Should a party have no expectation to pay the monies upon default, that part of the agreement is termed an “<i>asmakhta</i>,” the absence of firm resolve to comply with the clause.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 380; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:278, 452; <i>Teshuvot Tuv Tam va-Da’at</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 269. See also Berachyahu Lifshitz, <i>Asmakhta</i> [Hebrew], (Jerusalem: 5748); Itamar Warhaftig, <i>Ha-Hithayivut</i> [Hebrew], (Jerusalem, 5761).</i> For example, if the promisor obligates himself to pay more than the actual loss caused by him, the amount is considered a <i>guzma</i>, an exorbitant sum. According to many authorities, the promisor is undertaking to pay a penalty that he has no real intention to ever remit, and as such, the <i>asmakhta</i> is unenforceable in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:212; <i>Rashba</i> cited by <i>Shitah Mekubezet</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 168a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 72:7; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 207; <i>Rema</i>, HM 207:13; <i>Minhat Petim</i>, HM 32. <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, EH 50:14, notes that payment for <i>boshet</i> (embarrassment) that results as a breach of a <i>shiddukhin</i> agreement (a promise to halakhic engagement and marriage) may exceed the actual damage caused. Nevertheless, the amount cannot be exhorbitant; if it is, it is an <i>asmakhta</i> and unenforceable. See <i>SA</i>, HM 207:16; <i>Sema</i>, HM 207:47; <i>Beit Meir</i>, EH 50:6.</i>
In our case, is the provision for liquidated damages in the sum of $75,000 an example of <i>asmakhta</i>? One might argue that the default on the loan caused only indirect damages (<i>gerama</i>) to the lender, such as loss of interest income and profits from other business opportunities. Perhaps, then, the demand for such a sum is not justified and should be deemed an <i>asmakhta</i>. It may be further argued that since the agreement to pay for liquidated damages was not accompanied by a classical <i>kinyan</i> and was not written in the proper “language of obligation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 207:14; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 207:18; <i>Sma</i>, HM 243:12; and text accompanying notes 12–13 above.</i> nor was it executed in the presence of a <i>beit din</i> or any witnesses, the <i>Nitva</i>’s claim that he never intended to pay the liquidated damages is well-founded.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i> 11:7; <i>Tur</i>, HM 131:4; <i>SA</i>, HM 207:14; <i>Rema</i>, HM 207:14–15; <i>Sema</i>, HM 207:42.</i> Nevertheless, the <i>Nitva</i> is liable to pay it for a number of reasons. First, as long as the amount of liquidated damages is reasonable, as in our case, an agreement to pay for indirect damages is binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rif</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 104b; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 8:13; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 27b, s.v. <i>hilkhata</i>; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 3:29, 42. Furthermore, even in the absence of a provision for liquidated damages, if the commercial practice is to incorporate such a provision for liquidated damages in such agreements, we construe the agreement as if such a clause exists. In other words, we assume that everyone knows and expects that such damages will be remunerated, and Halakhah assumes that the party has obligated himself to pay such damages should they materialize. See <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 9:3; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 168.</i> Second, Halakhah recognizes the execution of a promissory note by virtue of <i>situmta</i> which imparts validity to contractual agreements recognized as <i>minhag ha-soherim</i> (commercial practice).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 3:8; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 66; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 194:2; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:79. The basis of imparting validity to <i>kinyan situmta</i> is the implied <i>gemirat da’at</i> (firm resolve of the parties) to undertake an obligation in accordance with customary practice. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 55:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:268; <i>Teshuvot Maharasham</i>, HM 380; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, YD 314, HM 66; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meshiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Kama</i> 2:39.</i> By dint <i>of situmta</i>, the problem of <i>asmakhta</i> is avoided and the <i>Nitva</i> cannot claim that he never intended to pay the liquidated damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 66a; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 31; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 1:12. Cf. <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i> 11:18.</i> Moreover, even if the amount of damages in this case were to be deemed unreasonable or even exorbitant, the provision is binding due to the fact that commercial practice would uphold such a clause and mandate payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 66a, s.v. <i>u-menume</i>; <i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Berlin edition), 354; <i>Rema</i>, EH 61:5, 50:6, HM 207:16; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 66; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 201:3; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:11; <i>PDR</i> 14:334, 343–344 (R. Z. N. Goldberg). Most decisors, however, argue that secular law cannot serve as grounds towards validating <i>asmakhta</i> clauses. See <i>Hazon Ish</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Heishiv Moshe</i>, HM 90; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 413, 457, 530. Cf. R. Yitzhak Herzog, <i>Teshuvot Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>, HM 59; <i>PDR</i> 5:74.</i>
Finally, in the view of <i>R. Aharon ben Yosef ha-Levi</i> (<i>Ra’ah</i>), the agreement need not explicitly stipulate that consequential damages are recoverable, as the lender relied on the promisor’s commitment to repay the loan and pay him for damages. Because of the benefit to the borrower generated by the induced reliance that established a surety relationship between the two parties, he undertakes an obligation, and payment is therefore enforceable in case of breach. In this sense, the promisor is similar to an <i>arev</i> (guarantor), who assumes liability because the creditor parted with monies on the strength of his assurance. The promisor is similarly liable due to the fact that the promisee relied upon him to remit payment for damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b.</i>
<b>3. The Recovery of Economic Loss of Funds</b>
The <i>Nitva</i> claims that in addition to reimbursement for unpaid salary, he is entitled to payment for economic loss of funds. This issue will be addressed on two planes – that of <i>din</i> (strict law) and <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i> (court ordered settlement in accordance with Halakhah) – as stipulated in the arbitration agreement.
According to some authorities, in a non-loan transaction – such as cases of unpaid salary, unpaid bailment, or unpaid rent – there are grounds for mandating pre- and post-judgment interest relating to loss of the economic use of funds (in <i>Beit Hillel</i>’s words, “<i>peseida de-shuka</i>”). Accordingly, the demand that the <i>Tove’a</i> pay interest on the unpaid salary to the <i>Nitva</i> would not constitute a violation of <i>hilkhot ribbit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, YD 160 in the name of R. Eliezer of Toille; <i>Beit Hillel</i>, YD 170:1; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i> 5:144, 6:26; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:149(2), 2:33; <i>Darkhei Teshuvah</i>, YD 161:12 in the name of <i>Marbeh Torah</i>; <i>Teshuvot Havazelet ha-Sharon</i>, HM 2:29; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Kodesh</i> 2; <i>PDR</i> 15:240–253.</i>
However, the majority of authorities rejects this position and argue that the payment of interest for the economic loss of funds in the context of debt grounded in non-loan transactions is not a legal obligation. In other words, pursuant to the dictates of <i>din</i>, a <i>beit din</i> cannot mandate such an award. While an individual may choose to repay economic loss of funds in such a case, such repayment is a halakhic-moral obligation (“<i>din Shamayim</i>,” the laws of heaven), and is unenforceable by a <i>beit din</i> adjudicating the matter according to <i>din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">As understood by <i>Brit Yehuda</i>, 26–36, the following decisors view repayment as a halakhic-moral duty: <i>Sefer Ravyah</i> 916; <i>Bah,</i> YD 161; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:84; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 222; <i>Teshuvot Massat Binyamin</i> 37; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Tanina</i> 4:123; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:33. A review of these positions indicates otherwise – that is, that there is a halakhic-legal duty to repay such unpaid monies. Some argue that even on a halakhic-moral level, there exists no obligation to reimburse for the economic loss of such funds. See <i>Ohr Zaru’a</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 181; <i>Beit Yosef,</i> supra n. 31<i>; Shakh</i>, YD 173:8; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 190; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Binah</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhmah</i> 3:51.</i> Accordingly, this <i>beit din</i> is not able to mandate payment for the economic loss of funds on the basis of <i>din</i>.
Since, however, this <i>beit din</i> is empowered to resolve the dispute at hand in accordance with <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i>, we may mandate that the parties comply with their halakhic-moral obligations.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; Z. Goldberg, <i>Shivhei ha-Pesharah</i>, sec. 5 (letter sent to Kollel Mishpetei Aretz, Ofra, Israel).</i> Such a resolution has the effect of advancing one of the primary objectives of mandated compromise – the promotion of peace between litigious parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b (R. Yehoshua ben Korcha’s dictum); <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:145.</i> In fact, R.

A <i>beit din</i> implementing <i>pesharah</i> is mandated to render a decision that it deems fair and equitable under the circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 2:133.</i> Applying a rate of 6% simple interest per six-month rate, we find that the <i>Tove’a</i> suffered an economic loss of funds in the amount of $1,500.

1. The <i>Nitva</i> is hereby obligated to immediately remit $1,000,000 to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
2. The <i>Tove’a</i> is hereby exempt from paying the accrued interest on that amount.

c) Rabbinic Contracts

<b><i>C. Rabbinic Contracts</i></b><br><b><i>R. Yisrael Rabin v. Congregation Beth Ya’akov</i></b>
The synagogue’s initial contract with R. Yisrael Rabin (<i>Tove’a</i>) for his services as its spiritual leader was for three years, from July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2003. Prior to the expiration of the third year, Congregation Beth Ya’akov (<i>Nitva</i>), a Modern Orthodox congregation, entered into negotiations for a second contract. Subsequently, a second contract was executed for three years, from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006. A similar contract was then negotiated and approved, with an expiration date of June 30, 2009.
Pursuant to its constitution and by-laws, all three contracts were negotiated and approved by the <i>Nitva</i>’s Board of Trustees. However, the decision to employ and renew the rabbi’s contract was made at congregational meetings expressly called in order to vote on this matter. During the general membership meeting’s discussion of the prospective third contract, the <i>Nitva</i> promised to remit a bonus of $25,000 should the <i>Tove’a</i> increase the synagogue membership by 10% by June 30, 2009. Although the membership increased by 10% by the agreed-upon date, the <i>Nitva</i> refused to remit the bonus to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
On April 1, 2009, the <i>Nitva</i> notified the <i>Tove’a</i> that the Congregation would not continue to employ him after June 30, 2009.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that as a rabbi engaged in spiritual matters, his position has <i>hazakah</i> (tenure) and he therefore cannot be removed from office without just cause. Thus, once attaining his position, the High Priest in the Holy Temple could not revert to his former role as an ordinary priest, as “we ascend in matters of sanctity, but we do not descend.”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 12b. This concept was equally applied to rabbinical positions; see <i>Berakhot</i> 27b–28a.</i> A rabbi similarly cannot be removed from his position.
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that this halakhic principle overrides the contract executed between the parties. Thus, once the <i>Tove’a</i> accepted and undertook the position as rabbi, the Congregation could only terminate him for just cause. In the wake of the <i>Nitva</i>’s admission that there were no grounds for his termination, the <i>Tove’a</i> demands that he be reinstated to his position.
Additionally, the <i>Tove’a</i> claims that $25,000 is due to him as a result of the increased membership of the congregation. Due to his present economic situation, he entreats this panel to mandate that the <i>Nitva</i> remit these funds.
Finally, should this panel fail to reinstate him to his former office, the <i>Tove’a</i> is suing for $100,000 for psychological trauma due to the <i>Nitva</i>’s termination without just cause.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Nitva</i> concedes that had the <i>Tove’a</i> been given a life contract, he would be tenured and it would be impossible to terminate his employment without just cause. In this case, however, the <i>Tove’a</i>’s employment was based upon three contracts, and their provisions do not make any reference to employment beyond the date of expiration recorded in each. In fact, each contract explicitly states that there is an expiration date for his services, “unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.” As such, the <i>Nitva</i> was empowered to terminate his employment even though the <i>Tove’a</i> was not found to be negligent in the performance of his duties.
The Congregation admits that it pledged to pay the <i>Tove’a</i> a bonus, but since that promise was never recorded in their written agreement, the Congregation is not obligated to remit those funds, as prevailing practice is to comply only with the provisions written in the contract.
The <i>Nitva</i> asserts that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s monetary claim for emotional stress is unfounded, as he is no different from any other employee who is subject to discharge, even if his work entails spiritual matters.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. Is Rabbinic Office a Tenured Position?</b>
Halakhic authorities have consistently argued that a rabbinic position is a <i>minui shel kedushah</i> (a sacred appointment); since, as the <i>Tove’a</i> argues, “we ascend in matters of sanctity, but we do not descend,” a rabbi essentially has tenure for life.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 12b, s.v. <i>halakhah</i>; <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Perush ha-Mishnah</i>, <i>Menahot</i> 13:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i> (Blau edition) 1:111; <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, negative mitzvah 316; <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 3:200; <i>Rema</i>, YD 245:22; <i>Teshuvot Shlomo le-Beit ha-Levi</i>, YD 8; <i>Teshuvot Ya’akov le-Beit ha-Levi</i> 5:50; <i>Kerem Shlomo</i>, YD 50; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 50, YD 3:100; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i> 312:34; <i>Orhot ha-Mishpatim</i> 4:10–11. See also Yosef Yedid Halevi, <i>Kuntres u-le-Levi Amar</i> (Jerusalem: 5753).<br>Others contend that a rabbinic post is an example of <i>serarah</i> (communal authority). Since a communal position can be inherited by a member of his family, the right of inheritance affirms that a rabbi holds a tenured position. See <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Kelei ha-Mikdash</i> 4:20, <i>Hilkhot Melakhim</i> 1:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 271; <i>PDR</i> 10:38–60.</i> Nevertheless, following in the footsteps of <i>Rivash</i>, authorities traditionally mandated that the rabbi sign a <i>ketav minui</i> (a rabbinical appointment), or what is termed today a rabbinic contract, to ensure that he would not abandon his congregation prior to the expiration date of the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 271; <i>Teshuovot Divrei Rivot</i> 224; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> 1:78; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 3:31; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, OH 53; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, YD 3:99, HM 2:24.</i> Just as a rabbi cannot choose to forfeit his position,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, OH 18; <i>Teshuvot Kapei Aharon</i>, YD 2:6–7. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Tzur Ya’akov</i> 74.</i> his congregation cannot terminate his services. So that the strictures of the contract would not turn the rabbi into a sort of indentured slave, fixed-term rabbinic contracts were executed with a term service that did not exceed three to six years.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 333:3; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, OH 205–206.</i>
In the nineteenth century, halakhic authorities consistently viewed rabbinical office as a <i>minui shel kedushah</i>. Accordingly<i>, R. Aharon Azriel</i> observes, “We never heard in the cities of Turkey … that a rabbi was discharged.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Kapei Aharon</i> 2:7.</i> In the same period in Hungary, <i>Hatam Sofer</i> notes that although the nature of the rabbinate has changed since the time of the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, OH 12: “Certainly, a <i>nasi</i> of Torah during the time of our Sages was akin to a sacred appointment … However, nowadays he is under the tutelage of the community, receiving compensation for his services.”</i> a rabbi still has a right to tenure.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid<i>.</i>, 206. Elsewhere, however, <i>Hatam Sofer</i> rules that if there is a stipulation that the rabbi can be terminated at the expiration of the term of the contract, such a provision is valid; see ibid., 205.</i> <i>R. Malkiel Tenenbaum</i>, a Polish decisor of the same period, ruled that the notion of “<i>minui shel kedushah</i>” is not limited to a rabbi who is formally appointed by a community, but rather applies equally to a rabbi who the people perceive as their authority and whom they consult regularly.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:82. In the case under discussion there, both an Ashkenazic and Sephardic rabbi served in one town. Upon the death of the Sephardic rabbi, his son wished to succeed his father, but R. Tenenbaum ruled that since the majority of the community solicited rabbinic counsel from the Ashkenazic rabbi, he was de facto rabbi of the Sephardic community as well, and the post therefore belonged to him.</i>
Nevertheless, in the United States today, it is accepted that a congregation may execute an agreement with their rabbi stipulating the conditions of his employment, including the termination of his service on a particular date. Should the congregation deem it appropriate to continue his employment, a new contract will be drafted thereafter. If there is a custom to offer fixed-term contracts with the understanding that the congregation may discharge the rabbi at the expiration of the term, the congregation may terminate his employment at the end of that term.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, YD 99; <i>Rema</i>, YD 245:25 (end); <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 5:283 (as understood by <i>Rema</i>, ibid.).</i> Even in the absence of a prevailing custom to offer fixed-term contracts, many Modern Orthodox congregations rely on various precedents<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 13a; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, OH 53 (end); <i>SA</i>, OH 53:26; <i>Rema</i>, YD 245:22; <i>Kenneset ha</i>-<i>Gedolah</i>, OH 53:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Elef Lekha Shlomo</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:436. <i>Pnei Moshe</i>, Yerushalmi <i>Ta’anit</i> 4:2; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo</i>, OH 7.</i> that perceive a rabbi as no different than a cantor, who occupies public office, or any other employee who can be terminated upon the expiration date of a contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast, many Hasidic, Yeshiva, and Sephardic communities continue to construe a rabbinical appointment as a “<i>minui shel kedushah.</i>” Nonetheless, the nature of the rabbinic contract and the prevailing custom in each community may vary from one congregation to another. Hence, prior to a <i>beit din</i> determination, each situation must be scrutinized individually.<br>Similarly, the <i>beit din</i> is obligated to scrutinize the facts in every case, even regarding a Modern Orthodox congregation, to ascertain whether, in fact, the congregation is treating the rabbi like any employee regarding termination.</i>
In the case at hand, the explicit provision, “unless extended by mutual agreement between the parties,” is found in all three contracts, clearly attesting to the fact that neither the <i>Tove’a</i> nor the <i>Nitva</i> construed the rabbinic office as a tenured position.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 2:26.</i> As such, the <i>Nitva</i> had the right to terminate the <i>Tove’a</i>’s employment after June 30, 2009.
<b>2. The Validity of a Communal Promise</b>
The question of whether the <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to remit a bonus to the <i>Tove’a</i> in recognition of his efforts to increase the synagogue’s membership will be addressed on two functionally and conceptually different planes, as mandated by the arbitration agreement – the level of <i>din</i> (strict law) and that of <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i> (court ordered settlement in accordance with Halakhah).
A promise is not enforceable in <i>beit din</i>, as it lacks the two critical components of a halakhic obligation – <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of acquisition) and <i>gemirat da’at</i> (concrete articulation of the parties’ resolve to undertake the obligation). Since a promise entails executing an obligation in the future (for example, a promise to sell goods) or to transfer title of something that is not yet in existence (<i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>), it is legally (halakhically) unenforceable.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad loc., s.v. <i>kinyan devarim hu</i>; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>SA</i>, HM 245:1. Although a promise is not enforeceable on the level of <i>din</i>, according to the strict dictates of the law, it constitutes a halakhic-moral obligation that can be enforced based upon the norms of <i>peshara</i>. See <i>Maharsha</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; Z. Goldberg, “<i>Shivhei ha-Pesharah</i>,” [Hebrew] 1 <i>Mishpetei Eretz</i> (5762), 78, 82.</i>
Despite the lack of a halakhic-legal obligation to fulfill one’s promise, however, there remains a halakhic-moral duty to do so. Accordingly, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>When one conducts and concludes commercial transactions using words only [the negotiation and agreement not being completed by a formal act of acquisition], that person should stand by his word, even though none of the purchase price has been taken, nor a buyer’s mark made on the goods … Whoever withdraws from this type of transaction, whether buyer or seller, is deemed a faithless person.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 204:7.</i></small></span>
<i>Rema</i> adds:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A person should stand by his word, even though no act of acquisition has been performed, only mere words have passed between the parties …<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 204:11.</i></small></span>
As I have noted elsewhere:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Halakhah views promise-keeping as aligning oneself with the fulfillment of a religious norm rather than compliance with a norm of natural law, institutional moral norm, or moral norm established by social convention.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See my “The Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective,” in A.

Although promises are generally legally unenforceable, <i>Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> suggests that a promise made by a group or community differs. In the case under discussion, a group of people hired a teacher and enquired of <i>Maharam</i> if they were permitted to retract their offer prior to the commencement of his employment. <i>Maharam</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The law is clear … Any matter resolved before the seven elders of the town … one cannot retract given that the behavior of many is unlike the conduct of one individual … and the customary practice is that any matter resolved among many does not require the <i>kinyan</i> which is usually required when dealing with an individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i>, quoted in <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i>, 457–458.</i></small></span>
<i>Rema</i> indeed rules that communal matters do not require a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 163:6. See also <i>Sema</i>, HM 22:12.</i> Thus, although a <i>kinyan</i> is necessary in order to legally validate an obligation between individuals, no <i>kinyan</i> is necessary when a community obligates itself towards an individual. In the latter case, the community is legally – not only morally – obligated to comply with its promise, even in the absence of a <i>kinyan</i>. It would certainly seem that this ruling would extend to a synagogue body and its governance.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur Halakhah</i>, OH 153:7; <i>Mishpetei ha-Torah</i> (Spitz), 34.</i> Accordingly, this <i>beit din</i> could obligate the congregation to fulfill its word to the rabbi.
Other authorities disagree with this conclusion, however. <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Some say that if a group said to an individual that he would receive a gift, they cannot retract, even if it is a large gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 204:9.</i></small></span>
According to some commentators, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> implies that there is a halakhic-moral obligation for the public to give the gift, but the public cannot be halakhically-legally coerced to remit it.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 94; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 204:9.</i>
Others argue that the irrevocability of a community’s promises is contingent upon the fact that there is a prevailing <i>minhag</i> in the community to fulfill promises without an accompanying <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 6:5. Others contend there is an implicit understanding that there is a <i>minhag</i> to implement public undertakings without a <i>kinyan</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 2:63.</i> Consequently, in locales where no such practice persists, the absence of <i>kinyan</i> allows the public to revoke their offer.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Perah Matteh Aharon</i> 123.</i>
Thus, the question of whether a community is halakhically-legally obligated to fulfill its promises is subject to debate, and even if such a duty exists, it may be contingent upon the presence of a <i>minhag</i> to act in such a fashion. Given the difference of opinion regarding this issue and the congregation’s <i>minhag</i> of only complying with what is recorded in the contract, we are unable to obligate the <i>Nitva</i> to remit the promised bonus to the <i>Tove’a</i> according to the dictates of <i>din</i>.
One of the primary objectives of <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i> is to promote <i>shalom</i>, peace between litigious parties,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b (R. Yehoshua ben Korcha’s dictum); <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:145.</i> and the need to foster compromise for the sake of peace equally applies in communal matters, such as our case.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 2:10; <i>Teshuvot Ha’amek Davar</i> 3:10.</i> However, Halakhah proscribes us from implementing a compromise if this means remitting funds due to the economic situation of a litigant; the injunction “do not be compassionate in <i>din</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 84a.</i> applies equally to the realm of <i>pesharah</i>. Thus, in our case, the <i>Tove’a</i>’s financial status is irrelevant to the question of whether the <i>Nitva</i>’s funds should be transferred to him. It is possible that these funds are rightfully the <i>Nitva</i>’s and therefore ought to remain in the congregation’s possession.
Nonetheless, pursuant to <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i>, this panel finds a basis for mandating that the <i>Nitva</i> remit the funds to the <i>Tove’a</i>. At the very minimum, there exists a halakhic-moral obligation for the <i>Nitva</i> to fulfill its promise, even if that promise is unenforceable according to the conventional norms of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (<i>dinei adam</i>). The <i>Nitva</i> is responsible according to <i>dinei Shamayim</i> (the laws of heaven) to comply with its halakhic-moral duties.
Addressing an agreement between three political parties regarding an upcoming municipal agreement which was invalid because it concerned a <i>davar she-lo ba le-olam</i> (a future event), a contemporary rabbinical court notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>We must add and say to the litigants that as public servants and when acting in this capacity, they should not argue that the obligations which they undertook are not binding because their validity can be disputed under law. Promises and obligations, especially in communal affairs, are holy and must be fulfilled to capacity, in accordance with their original intent, wording, and spirit. Public servants shall not go back on their word and bring ruin on the public by insisting on the strict letter of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:173, 181; translation culled from Menachem Elon, “Power and Authority,” in Daniel Elazar (ed.), <i>Kinship and Consent</i> (Washington, D.C.: 1983), 204.</i></small></span>
In accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> that govern <i>pesharah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the enforcement of halakhic-promissory duties via the means of <i>pesharah</i>, see <i>Maharsha</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; Goldberg, supra n. 14, 82.</i> and in light of the fact that <i>pesharah kerovah la-din</i> should be fair and equitable,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 2:133.</i> it is this panel’s opinion that it is incumbent upon the <i>Nitva</i>, as a communal organization, to keep its word. The congregation is therefore obligated to pay the promised bonus to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b>3. Grounds for Reimbursement for Infliction of Emotional Stress</b>
Finally, we must address whether there are grounds for the <i>Tove’a</i> to file a claim for emotional stress against the <i>Nitva</i> after the congregation terminated his employment without just cause after nine years in the position.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">This portion of the decision is based upon my, “Recovery for Infliction of Emotional Distress: Toward Relief for the <i>Agunah</i>,” 18 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2009), 213, reprinted in an expanded form in chap. 3 of this volume.</i> The Talmud teaches us:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If one frightens another, he is not liable by the law of man, but he is liable by the law of heaven. If he blew [with a trumpet or the like] into his ear and made him deaf, he is not liable. But if he held him and blew into his ear and made him deaf, he is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 91a. Cf. Yerushalmi <i>Kilayim</i> 8:2.</i></small></span>
Absent physical contact and physical damage, one who frightens another does not thereby incur liability. <i>Maharshal</i> and <i>Ra’avad</i> argue that fright and shock could have not caused injury, since the generally accepted assessment (<i>omed</i>) is that fright and shock do not suffice to cause emotional scarring.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:38; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ra’avad</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> (Atlas edition), 223.</i> Others, such as <i>Rosh</i>, <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i>, and <i>Tur</i>, contend that injury caused by fright is an instance of <i>gerama</i> (indirect damages), and “<i>gerama be-nezikin patur</i>” – there is no liability for an injury that is caused indirectly.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 60a. See <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 2:17; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91; <i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Cremona edition), 300; <i>Tur</i>, HM 420:25.</i> According to all opinions, however, emotional stress in the absence of physical contact generates liability according to <i>dinei Shamayim</i>, the laws of heaven.
Decades ago, <i>R. Avraham I. Kook</i> applied this principle to the case of a rabbi who was discharged from his position,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">A. Kook, “<i>Hasagat Gevul be-Rabbanut</i>” [Hebrew], 5 <i>Tehumin</i> (5744), 285.</i> and such psychological stress is certainly compounded in our case, in which the removal was without just cause. Nevertheless, <i>Ran</i>, <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Tashbetz</i>, and <i>R. Feinstein</i> conclude that every individual who ventures out into the world assumes the risk of emotional injury, exposing himself to unexpected trauma. One should try to be more thick-skinned rather than burden others with responsibility for his emotional weaknesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 9a, s.v. <i>keivan debar data</i>; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 24b, s.v. <i>shani adam</i>; <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 56a; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:114; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 1:98.</i> Failure to inure oneself to the routine stresses of existence bars recovery for any ensuing psychological injury.
Thus, on the level of strict <i>din</i>, Halakhah does not mandate recovery for emotional stress, which constitutes indirectly-caused damages that an individual should be able to confront and address without compromising his psychological integrity.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The question remains as to why indirectly-caused damages create liability under the laws of heaven (<i>dinei Shamayim</i>).</i>
However, there is a second plane of the halakhic law of damages that is predicated upon the fact that under certain prescribed conditions, an arbiter may exercise his judicial discretion regarding whether or not to award damages. After the lapse of the ordination process in the fourth century C.E., non-ordained arbiters – communal leaders and <i>beit din shel hedyotot</i> (lay arbiters) – were granted authority to resolve cases involving common injuries that caused the injured party a financial loss. The compensation that these arbiters could impose, however, was limited to reimbursement for loss of income and medical expenses;<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 1:1–2; <i>Bah</i>, HM 1; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 1:7.</i> claims of liability due to <i>boshet</i> (shame and embarrassment) although arising from bodily damage ensuing from a physical act, could not be submitted to a non-ordained arbiter for adjudication, since there was no loss of income.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, EH 83:1.</i> Nevertheless, communal leaders and laymen are empowered to exercise exigency jurisdiction in matters of civil damages such as <i>boshet</i> under the rubric of <i>le-migdar milta</i> (protective measures) and <i>ha-sha’ah tzerikhah lekakh</i> (the times require it).<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 90b. See <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 1:126; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 2; <i>SA</i>, HM 2:1; <i>Rema</i>, HM 2:1; <i>Levush Ir Shushan</i>, HM 2; <i>Sma</i>, HM 2:9; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 2:5; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 2:2.</i> To promote broader policy goals, arbiters are authorized, under certain circumstances, to deviate from the black-letter Halakhah of damages and impose actual and/or punitive damages.
The question at hand, then, is whether the case in question constitutes an exigency situation in which the <i>beit din</i> is empowered to mandate damages even though they are not demanded by the <i>din</i>. There are three approaches to defining what constitutes an exigency situation that would empower an arbiter to mandate such damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">See Emanuel Quint and Neil Hecht, <i>Jewish Jurisprudence: Its Sources and Modern Applications</i> (Switzerland: 1980), 174–5.</i> According to <i>Maharam Lublin</i>, any individual can be punished in order to deter others from emulating his behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Lublin</i> 138.</i> The <i>Sma</i> maintains that this is true only if the wrongdoer is habitual in his misconduct,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 2:2.</i> while the <i>Sha’ar Ephraim</i> holds that the arbiters have this authority only if other people in the community are engaging in the same type of conduct and deterrence is necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i> 2.</i>
It seems clear that our case is not an exigency situation that empowers the <i>beit din</i> to impose damages upon the <i>Nitva</i>. As noted above, the practice of offering renewable contracts that can be extended by mutual agreement of the congregation and rabbi is a practice in many synagogues, including that of the <i>Nitva</i>; discharging the rabbi is a widespread practice among Modern Orthodox synagogues and is grounded in halakhic precedent. As such, the <i>Nitva</i> did not act improperly and there are no grounds for awarding damages for the infliction of emotional stress. The <i>Tove’a</i>, like all people who venture out into the world and endure difficult situations, must learn to cope with his experience.
<b>Decision</b>
1. The <i>Nitva</i> did not act improperly in dismissing the <i>Tove’a</i> from his position as rabbi.
2. The <i>Nitva</i> shall immediately pay $25,000 to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
3. The <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim for damages based upon the <i>Nitva</i>’s infliction of emotional stress is hereby denied.

d) Self Dealing in the Not for Profit Boardroom

<b><i>D. Self-Dealing in the Not-for-Profit Boardroom</i></b><br><b><i>Yeshiva Har Tzion v. Yossi Stein</i></b>
Due to severe overcrowding conditions in their facility, Yeshiva Har Tzion sought land to build an additional building. Yossi Stein, a trustee on the <i>yeshiva</i> board, is the sole owner of Century Realty Corporation, which owned a plot of land adjacent to the <i>yeshiva</i> that was suitable for the <i>yeshiva</i>’s needs. Mr. Stein persuaded his real estate broker to offer the plot to the <i>yeshiva</i>, but neither Mr. Stein nor the broker disclosed Stein’s ownership of Century. The <i>yeshiva</i> ultimately bought the plot for one million dollars.
Realizing that the <i>yeshiva</i> required additional capital to finance the property purchase, Mr. Stein persuaded the board to sell a vacant lot owned by the <i>yeshiva</i> to his nephew. The nephew agreed that should the sale materialize, he would use his political connections to arrange for his uncle’s appointment as a councilman on the municipal board. Again, neither Mr. Stein nor his nephew disclosed their familial ties to the <i>yeshiva</i>, nor the nephew’s offer to his uncle.
The <i>yeshiva</i>’s board voted to approve both the purchase of the property and the sale of the <i>yeshiva</i> land. After the finalization of the sale, the <i>yeshiva</i> became aware of Mr. Stein’s ownership of the real estate company, as well as the identity of the buyer of their property. In light of the circumstances, Mr. Stein was removed from his board position.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that this situation can be best described as “a self-dealing transaction” in which the <i>Nitva</i> had a financial interest in the <i>yeshiva</i>’s purchase. The <i>Nitva</i> was therefore obligated to exhibit transparency by disclosing his interest in the transaction. Moreover, the <i>Nitva</i> utilized his power of persuasion as a board member to purchase this land at a cost of one million dollars. Upon discovering the <i>Nitva</i>’s ties to the transaction, the board became aware that the fair market value of the property was $900,000. Consequently, the <i>Tove’a</i> is suing for $100,000 from the <i>Nitva</i>.
Similarly, because the board was unaware of the fair market value of their property, the <i>Nitva</i>’s nephew was able to purchase the property at $150,000 below its market value.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">While the apparent complete ignorance of the board appears surprising in this case, it is not surprising for members of a group to adopt a view or views simply because another member or members endorse that position. This is known as the phenomenon of “groupthink,” which entails a desire to identify with the dominant position and label it as “fair” even when it is not without engaging in open group discussion and analysis of the matter. In effect, this leads to irrational decision-making, failure to seek information from outside sources, voting on matters without due diligence, and arriving at decisions which may undermine the institution’s best interests. Hence, groupthink may lead to the emergence of the validation of self-dealing. See Cass Sunstein, “Deliberative Trouble? Why Groups Go to Extremes,” 110 <i>Yale Law Journal</i>, (2000), 71. Consequently, it is unsurprising to find that the <i>Nitva</i> was able to pursue his agenda and receive group support, buttressed by the board’s failure to perform due diligence regarding his vested interest in two transactions.</i> The <i>Tove’a</i> is therefore suing for an additional $150,000.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Counterclaims</b>
If the purchase price of the property did not reflect the fair market value, it was the board who shirked its responsibility by failing to perform due diligence and leg-work that might have demonstrated that both transactions were not the good deals they seemed to be. Moreover, while other boards have the practice of requesting that its members read a conflict-of-interest policy, list any affiliations in which they have a financial interest, and recluse themselves from deliberation should a conflict arise, there is no such practice on the <i>Tove’a</i>’s board. As such, the process of purchasing the land was not tainted, and the <i>Nitva</i> is exempt from any responsibility regarding this matter. Finally, <i>Nitva</i> argues that his removal from the board was unjustified and he should be instated to his former position.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Requirement of Transparency</b>
The <i>Nitva</i>’s argument is that a duty to refrain from self-dealing is predicated upon the signing of a conflict-of-interest questionnaire. If a board member signed such a document, he has an obligation to avoid self-dealing transactions, but if he did not do so, no such duty exists and there is no requirement to inform the board of his vested interest in any matter up for discussion or vote.
This argument is halakhically untenable. The board in question serves the interests of a <i>yeshiva</i> whose ultimate goal is the inculcation and internalization of halakhic norms and Jewish education. Those same norms apply to the <i>yeshiva</i>’s board irrespective of the existence or nonexistence of any contractual agreement executed by its members.
Halakhah instructs us to not only be innocent, but also to appear in the eyes of our fellowmen as innocent. The Mishnah thus instructs that the person who enters the Temple office for the purpose of collecting donated half-shekels must act in a particular manner:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The collector may not enter dressed in a loosely-hanging garment [with sleeves in which money can be hidden], nor wearing boots or sandals or <i>tefillin</i> or an amulet [in which money can be concealed] … For a person must be guiltless before his fellowman as before God, as the Torah states: “You shall be guiltless before God and before Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shekalim</i> 3:2.</i></small></span>
In short, one must exhibit transparency in one’s relations with others. This imperative is not limited to an individual engaging in social interaction, but rather equally applies to a person who occupies public office. The identical halakhic requirement applies to a member of a board when he is serving his institution and when he is interacting with others in a social context.
Since the professional halakhic-ethics of a board is synonymous with the halakhic code of social ethics, we must analyze a trustee’s professional responsibility through the same categories that govern interaction with others in other contexts. We will therefore consider whether a trustee is to be viewed as a <i>dayan</i> (judge), <i>shomer</i> (bailee), <i>apotropos</i> (guardian), or <i>shaliah</i> (agent). The trustee’s halakhic identity will determine how his conflict of interest will ultimately be viewed.
<b>2. The Trustee as a <i>Dayan</i></b>
Numerous decisors have advanced the idea that the authority of the community and its public servants are comparable to and function like a <i>beit din</i>, with each and every municipal officer serving as a <i>dayan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:411; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 214, 249; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 566; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot Re’em</i> 53, 57; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 4:8.</i> This conclusion extends by analogy to any communal, synagogue, or <i>yeshiva</i> board.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi <i>Pe’ah</i> 8:6 and <i>Rash Sirilio</i> ad loc.; <i>PDR</i> 7:225, 250, 261.</i>
A <i>dayan</i> may not judge any case that may benefit him in some way.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:642; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 354; <i>SA</i>, HM 7:12, 37:19; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 7:10.</i> By extension, all self-dealing transaction involving individuals who are empowered to render communal decisions should be prohibited. Invoking the community leader<i>-dayan</i> paradigm, <i>R. Yehezkel Landau</i> argues:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Regarding taxation matters, they are interested parties, as explicitly stated by <i>Rema</i> 163, that for all communal needs … one must enlist all the taxpayers to preside on these matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadurah Kama</i>, HM 20.</i></small></span>
In other words, all communal matters, including tax concerns, are to be construed as vested interests of each and every board member, and therefore only the local citizenry may resolve these matters. Others have also subscribed to the view that all acts of self-dealing are prohibited for communal leaders.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 568.</i>
Public office holders should act at all times in a manner that demonstrates integrity, avoiding even the appearance of a conflict-of-interest, and thus serving as examples to fellow officers and the community. Given that the scenario described regarding Mr. Stein and the board may be characterized as a self-dealing transaction, such a potential sale should neither have been reviewed nor deliberated upon by the <i>Nitva</i>.
Was the <i>Nitva</i> precluded as well from involvement in deliberations regarding the sale benefiting his nephew, a sale from which he would derive no financial gain? A <i>dayan</i>, and by extension a trustee, must equally distance himself from self-dealing that involves a non-financial interest. Regarding a witness or <i>dayan</i> with a vested interest in a non-financial matter, <i>Rambam</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If the witness finds that he has an interest in the testimony … he should not testify regarding it … Just as he shall not testify in this matter due to the possibility that he is an interested party, similarly he shall not judge this matter …<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Edut</i> 16:4–5. See also <i>SA</i>, HM 37:21; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 37:10.</i></small></span>
The exclusion of a “<i>nogei’ah be-davar</i>” (an interested party) from involvement in deliberations has been extended to public servants, who are compared to <i>dayanim</i>. R. Yosef ibn Lev (<i>Maharival</i>), for example, discussed a case in which a <i>hazzan</i> obligated himself to serve a particular community but then accepted a position in another community, claiming that the first community had breached the terms of the agreement. The members of the community claimed, on the other hand, that the <i>hazzan</i> remained obligated to serve them. <i>Maharbil</i> ruled that the testimony of the head of a <i>kehillah</i> was not admissible; they were <i>noge’im be-davar</i>, as they wished to continue to benefit from the <i>hazzan</i>’s skill.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 1:36. See also <i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 1:81.</i> If the citizenry’s testimony is invalid in such a case, the leadership’s input regarding such a matter should certainly be discounted.
Consequently, our case, in which the <i>Nitva</i> persuaded the board to sell the <i>yeshiva</i>’s vacant lot to his nephew in the hopes that his nephew would facilitate his appointment to the municipal board, is an example of self-dealing. Given that such a civil appointment would benefit the <i>Nitva</i>, the transaction is tainted.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Had it been unclear that such an appointment would materialize, the <i>Nitva</i>’s input regarding the transaction would not be tainted. See <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 354; <i>SA</i>, HM 37:10. Moreover, if the nephew were to explicitly state that the civil appointment was a gift rather than remuneration for facilitating the transaction, the trustee may accept the civil office. See <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 98b, s.v. <i>she-yesh</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 60.</i>
The question of the propriety of selling the <i>Tove’a</i>’s land to the <i>Nitva</i>’s nephew is actually addressed in a <i>teshuvah</i> of <i>R. Yosef Trani</i>, who discusses whether a trustee of a charitable foundation may sell some of its assets to a relative.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, HM 2:1.</i> <i>R. Trani</i> contends that this would be a self-dealing transaction and is therefore prohibited. First, the factor of <i>hashad</i> (suspicion) ought to preclude such an act.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shabbat</i> 23a–23b; <i>Sefer Yerei’im</i>, commandment 340; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 349; <i>Teshuvot Hesed Avraham</i>, OH, 21; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 2:40, 4:82.</i> Furthermore, it is unlikely that there will be serious negotiations and use of bargaining tactics in discussion with a relative of a board member. Finally, potential buyers with more attractive offers than the relative will abstain from the bidding process due to their assumption that the trustee’s relative has the sale “locked up.”
<b>3. The Trustee as a <i>Shomer</i></b>
Halakhah recognizes that obligations may be created by parties undertaking duties based upon oral or written agreements, whereby each party establishes a claim against the other that the latter is obligated to honor. Thus, a <i>shomer</i> (bailee) is obligated by dint of agreement with the <i>mafkid</i> (bailor) to safeguard the asset entrusted to his safe-keeping. In effect, a communal officer who is entrusted with dispensing, investing, and dealing with public funds has the status of a <i>shomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, HM 12; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i>, HM 1:217; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 17; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, HM 301:9.</i>
As Talmud notes, a <i>shomer</i> is precluded from involvement in self-dealing transactions:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If one deposits fruit with his neighbor and it spoils … he [the <i>shomer</i>] may not touch it – this is R. Meir’s ruling. But the Sages maintain: He provides a solution for them by selling them pursuant to the <i>beit din</i>’s direction, and he must sell it to strangers, not to himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 38a; see <i>SA</i>, HM 292:19.</i></small></span>
Even though the transaction has been approved by a <i>beit din</i> of experts (<i>mumhin</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>beit din</i> is required either to appraise the bailment or to sanction the <i>shomer</i>’s right to execute a sale, which is beyond the mandate of his bailment.</i> the asset may only be sold to a third party. If we were to allow the <i>shomer</i> to buy it himself, others would be suspicious that he lowered its value prior to acquiring it for himself. Moreover, even though the purchase received <i>beit din</i> approval, people would be unaware that there was a <i>beit din</i> appraisal or that a <i>beit din</i> may execute such an appraisal, and they would thus assume that the <i>shomer</i> deceived the <i>beit din</i> regarding the asset’s market value.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesahim</i> 13a; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 38a; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 98a, s.v. <i>de-amrei</i>; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 428; <i>Perishah</i>, HM 290:15.</i> Should the bailment be sold to the <i>shomer</i>, the sale, although executed under the auspices of <i>beit din</i>, is null and void.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot She’eilah ve-Pikadon</i> 7:5; <i>SA</i>, HM 292:19.</i> In short, a <i>shomer</i> has no right to engage in a self-dealing transaction, and even <i>beit din</i> review cannot validate a <i>shomer</i>’s purchase.
In our case, the <i>Nitva</i>, a public servant, is considered a <i>shomer</i> and was therefore proscribed from purchasing the property for himself under the guise of an offer advanced by a real estate broker.
<b>4. The Trustee as an <i>Apotropos</i></b>
Public servants are empowered either by election or appointment by the constituency of their respective communities or voluntary associations to be entrusted as guardians over their assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">In general, <i>hilkhot apotropus</i> deal with persons who are incapable of taking care of their own affairs, such as minors or adults who are mentally impaired, but the institution of guardianship applies equally to a public servant. See <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Ramban</i> cited by <i>Beit Yosef</i>, YD 169 (end); <i>Rashba</i> cited by <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 128, 163; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:117.</i> The creation of these bodies and the responsibilities of the trustees vis-à-vis these constituencies are shaped and molded by <i>hilkhot apotropsut</i>, the laws of guardianship.
An <i>apotropos</i> charged with guardianship of an orphan must avoid any <i>hashad</i> (suspicion) that he is mismanaging his ward’s funds. To be above suspicion, any profit derived by an <i>apotropos</i> from a personal transaction with a third party concerning the orphan’s assets requires the prior scrutiny of a <i>beit din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’avad</i> and <i>Nimmukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 67a; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 290:15; <i>Rema</i>, HM 290:8; <i>Perishah</i>, HM 290:15. The <i>beit din</i> must evaluate the transaction to ensure that the <i>apotropos</i>’s self-dealing does not endanger the orphan’s assets. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 290:10; <i>Sma</i>, HM 290:26; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i>, HM 46, 349, 434.</i> which may determine that the sale is to the orphan’s financial benefit as well and therefore may validate the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Helkat Mehokek</i>, EH 93:45.</i>
The same conclusion would be applicable to a trustee, who has the status of an <i>apotropos</i>. <i>R. Adas</i>, <i>R. Ya’avetz</i>, and <i>R. Elyashiv</i> invoke this parallel, emphasizing that an overarching concern of an <i>apotropos</i> managing a communal organization is to avoid suspicion when disbursing funds to needy individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Bikkurei Asher</i> 2:53.</i> In other words, <i>hilkhot apotropos</i> mandates that trustees comply with full disclosure of their vested interests and that a <i>beit din</i> or administrative body review any and all interested transactions by implementing “a fairness standard.”
In our case, to avoid the issue of <i>hashad</i> in the public eye, the <i>Nitva</i> was required to disclose his ties to Century Realty Corporation and his familial relationship to the purchaser of the <i>yeshiva</i>’s property. Validation of the two transactions would require a determination by the <i>beit din</i> or any administrative body, including but not limited to the board,<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">For a possible precedent allowing a layman to appraise a widow’s self-interested action relating to an orphan’s assets, see <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 17:14; <i>Maggid Mishnah</i> and <i>Lehem Mishnah</i> ad loc.</i> that the transactions and its terms have been arrived at through a rational and fair process, that the terms of the sale are fair and reasonable, and that these transactions are in the organization’s best interests.
If an <i>apotropos</i> was appointed by a father for his child and there is corroborating evidence, such as the existence of witnesses, that testifies to the <i>apotropos’</i>s self-dealing activities, he may be relieved of his duties.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 10:7.</i> According to some decisors, a <i>beit din</i> appointed <i>apotropos</i> may be removed from his position even if he is only suspected of engaging in self-dealing,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, YD 257:3; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 290:10.</i> while others argue that witnesses to his activities are required prior to removal.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 290:5.</i> Given the facts in our case, the <i>Tove’a</i> certainly had well-substantiated grounds to remove the <i>Nitva</i> from his status as an <i>apotropos</i>. Indeed, contemporary decisors have applied <i>hilkhot apotropos</i> in mandating the removal of trustees from the board of a religious charitable foundation due to their improper behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 21.</i>
<b>5. The Trustee as <i>Shaliah</i></b>
It is also possible to view the role of a board through the prism of <i>hilkhot shelihut</i>, the laws of agency, as the board members must serve the best interests of their constituency. A <i>shaliah</i> (agent) is proscribed from being in a conflict-of-interest with the person who appointed him. As <i>Rambam</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If someone appoints an agent to betroth a woman on his behalf, and he [the agent] proceeded to betroth her for himself, she is betrothed to the agent. But it is prohibited to act in such a fashion, and whoever acts in this manner and the like in other matters of commerce is called wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 9:17.</i></small></span>
Although his act is not nullified due to his deviation from his mandate, the <i>shaliah</i>’s self-dealing is viewed as inappropriate behavior.
At first glance, it would seem that Halakhah frowns upon the recalcitrant <i>shaliah</i> because he fails to fulfill the mandate of the one who sent him. In truth, however, Halakhah is also concerned with the character and integrity of the agent himself. Thus, the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules that if a person appoints a <i>shaliah</i> to sell his field, the <i>shaliah</i> may not buy it himself, even if his property neighbors the field and he therefore should, by right, be offered the land first (<i>mezran</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 175:16.</i> One of the reasons for this ruling is that we are concerned that there will be a <i>hashad</i> that the agent acquired the field at a price below its fair market value.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sema</i>, HM 175:26. Cf. others who argue that as an agent, he is the “<i>yad</i>,” the arm of the principal. Consequently, purchasing the field for himself is a halakhic impossibility; a person cannot sell something to himself. See <i>Ketuvot</i> 98a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 105:2.</i>
This same applies, by extension, to public servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 7:109; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 114; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 573; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, HM 19; <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 2:63.</i> The purpose of a board is to promote and foster the best interests of the organization; a board’s agenda epitomizes an agent’s mandate: “I appointed you for my benefit rather than detriment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafim</i> 1:2.</i> Self-serving behavior undermines the institution’s goals, as well as its ideological and financial integrity, and it should thus be deemed unacceptable. As such, transparency and accountability for its activities is paramount.
Emerging from this discussion is that the board of the <i>yeshiva</i> ought to have obligated all its members to read the organization’s conflict-of-interest policy and fill out an annual disclosure form enumerating the affiliations in which they have an ownership interest and, to the extent known, those affiliations of family members covered by the conflict-of-interest policy. The board could have passed a simple prohibition against all self-dealing, thereby reinforcing the fiduciary concept of loyalty and accountability. Alternatively, the board could have chosen to govern its members’ activities under <i>hilkhot apotropos</i>, in which case a <i>beit din</i>, administrative panel, or the board itself would review any conflicts of interest that might arise and determine if the potential transaction complies with the fairness standard. Accordingly, we would have to consider whether the interested trustee complied with the full disclosure policy; whether the board environment was unbiased at the time the decision was made to engage in the transaction; whether there was due diligence in assessing the fairness of the transaction; and whether the transaction promoted the organization’s ideological, economic, and financial interests.
In this sense, the <i>Nitva</i> is correct in stating that the board did not fulfill its duties in serving the community’s best interests, as it failed to issue or enforce conflict-of-interest guidelines and was certainly negligent in the realm of due diligence. However, the <i>Nitva</i> cannot claim that the board’s failure to address interested transactions gives him license to do whatever he wishes. As a member of a covenant-faith community, his actions must be transparent and above any and all suspicion. Consequently, the <i>Nitva</i>’s failure to disclose his relationship to Century Realty Corporation, his familial ties to the purchaser of the <i>yeshiva</i>’s property, and their arrangement for the <i>Nitva</i> to receive a municipal office tainted the process, as well as the two transactions.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">On the other hand, if the <i>Nitva</i> used the organization’s funds to give a gift to or fund a trip for his nephew in order to close the deal, such behavior would not be construed as deriving benefit from communal assets. See <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:55; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 286:3; <i>SA</i>, HM 286:2; 290:4. Clearly, prior board authorization for such actions would be advisable.</i> As such, the <i>Nitva</i> is monetarily liable for his actions.
<b>Decision</b>
The <i>Nitva</i> is hereby obligated to immediately pay the <i>Tove’a</i> $250,000.

e) Real Estate Brokerage Fee Commission

<b><i>E. Real Estate Brokerage Fee Commission</i></b><br><b><i>Simcha Levy vs. Bayla Srulowitz</i></b>
In June 2005, Simcha Levy, a New York licensed real estate broker (<i>Tove’a</i>) entered into a written brokerage agreement with his client, Bayla Srulowitz (<i>Nitva’at</i>), whereby he would show commercial properties for sale to the <i>Nitva’at</i> and would receive a 7% commission, to be shared equally by the buyer and seller, on any consummated sale. Pursuant to this agreement, the <i>Nitva’at</i> was shown several properties. In May 2006, the <i>Nitva’at</i> purchased one of those properties for three million dollars. The <i>Nitva’at</i> refused to pay the 7% commission on the transaction to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
In August 2005, the <i>Nitva’at</i> placed an ad in the local newspaper that she was interested in selling a piece of residential property. Upon reading the ad, the <i>Tove’a</i> secured a buyer for the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s property and the <i>Nitva’at</i> sold it. Inadvertently, the <i>Tove’a</i> forgot about the transaction, and only recalled it eighteen months later. At that time, the <i>Tove’a</i> billed the <i>Nitva’at</i>, but she refused to pay the broker commission for this transaction.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
Based upon the written agreement executed between the parties, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he is entitled to a brokerage fee for his services rendered in the commercial property transaction. Although there was no express brokerage agreement between the parties in the residential property transaction, the <i>Tove’a</i> claims that based upon commercial practice, he is entitled to a broker’s commission fee of 6% for services rendered. In both transactions, the <i>Nitva’at</i> accepted the benefits of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s services, and he is therefore entitled to a commission.
<b><i>Nitva’at</i>’s Counterclaims</b>
Since there was no express written brokerage agreement between the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva’at</i> regarding the purchase of the residential property, according to commercial practice, the <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to a commission for services rendered. Moreover, even if the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to payment, New York State’s statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit regarding unpaid real estate commission is six years; since the time limit for pursuing a remedy has expired, commercial practice dictates that the <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to recover his commission.
Regarding the purchase of the commercial property, the <i>Nitva’at</i> admits that the <i>Tove’a</i> provided the services as promised, but she argues that the rate of commission recorded in the brokerage agreement is above the market rate for property sold for three million dollars, and he therefore is entitled to a maximum of 6% brokerage commission.
<b>Discussion</b>
Halakhah dictates that a <i>metavekh</i> or <i>sarsur</i> (broker) is duty-bound to comply with the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>hiyuvim</i> (obligations). Remuneration of a broker for his services is thus guided by the principles of <i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh haser</i> and <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>.
<b>1. <i>Zeh Neheneh Ve-Zeh Haser</i></b>
If one individual benefits from another (<i>zeh neheneh</i>) and the latter sustains a loss due to the benefit conferred (<i>zeh haser</i>), the beneficiary is liable to pay, either because he is viewed as a <i>gazlan</i> (a thief) who is benefiting without remitting payment or a <i>mazik</i> (tortfeasor).<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 371:10; <i>Or Samea’ach</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nizkei Mamon</i> 1:2.</i> In secular law, this is referred to as “unjust enrichment.” Prior to imposing monetary liability in such a case, the loss caused to the benefactor must first be defined.
Real estate brokers invest their time to identify a property that best fits their clients’ needs and budgets. They obtain listings and execute agreements with owners to place properties for sale with the real estate company, and they compare the listed property with similar properties that recently sold in order to determine the market value of the property. A broker may meet frequently with prospective buyers to discuss and visit available properties. When buying property, brokers arrange for title searches to verify ownership and for meetings between a seller and potential buyer, during which they agree to the details of the transaction. A broker also acts as an intermediary in price negotiations between a buyer and seller, and in some instances may assist in arranging financing from a lender for the prospective buyer, which may be the catalyst “to close the deal.” The broker’s outlay of expenses for advertising, licensing, and transportation, as well as his profit, is covered by his market commission. Accordingly, consummation of a sale without paying the broker his commission constitutes a loss for the broker. As this is an example of <i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh haser</i>, the broker is entitled to reimbursement.
<i>Rema</i> rules that this is true even in the absence of a written or verbal agreement to provide services:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If an individual performs an action or benefit for his friend, he [the beneficiary] cannot say that it was done gratis, as he did not tell him to do it, and he must compensate him.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 264:4. See also <i>Rema</i>, HM 246:17 and 363:10. There are exceptions to this rule. <i>Rema</i> contends that certain actions, such as expressing a willingness to serve as an <i>arev</i> (guarantor on a loan) without performing a <i>kinyan</i> (symbolic act of undertaking an obligation), are not actions for which one customarily receives compensation; hence, an <i>arev</i> would not be able to recover a fee for his services from the borrower. See <i>Rema</i>, HM 129:22. For the rationale of <i>Rema</i>’s ruling, see an earlier discussion found in <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 64:3.</i></small></span>
According to some authorities, the basis for <i>Rema</i>’s position is a case brought in the Talmud, in which a man planted trees in a field without the owner’s permission and then requested remuneration. The owner, however, repeatedly asserted that he was not interested in the improvements to his property. Subsequently, the owner fenced in the trees, and Rav then instructed him to pay the man who had planted them; by taking efforts to protect the trees, the owner revealed that he was, in fact, interested in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 101a. See <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 185:13.</i>
Numerous legists endorse <i>Rema</i>’s view,<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 246:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 246:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i> 70; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i>, vol. 2, EH 21; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 345; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 134; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, EH 70:28; <i>PDR</i> 11:278, 282–283. Given the apparently contradictory rulings in <i>Rema</i> (see supra n. 2), some <i>Aharonim</i> view this matter as a legal doubt and rule that one cannot extract money from the beneficiary. See <i>Bah</i>, HM 363; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 246:9, 363:13; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadurah Tanina</i>, HM 34; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 119; <i>Teshuvot Dovev Meisharim</i> 1:42.</i> arguing that an individual is entitled to a fee for services rendered regardless of whether the individual was duly empowered by another to perform those actions or he performed the services on his own initiative, provided that the beneficiary of the work did not direct him to stop working or communicated to him that he would not receive remuneration for his services.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Tur</i>, HM 375:1 (in the name of <i>Rosh</i>); <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 375:1; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:151. Cf. <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Teshuvot Peri Tevu’ah</i> 58; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 3:15.</i>
Alternatively, failure to remit compensation for work rendered is subsumed in the category of “encroaching upon another’s property without permission.”<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 87:7, 185:3.</i> As such, even in the absence of an agreement between the parties, a broker should receive compensation for his services.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 2:49; <i>PDR</i> 13:34; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 15:67; <i>Teshuvot Halikhot Yisrael</i> 1.</i>
In effect, a broker’s performance is a quasi-contract based upon unjust enrichment, <i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh haser</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Tilita’ah</i> 3:7; <i>Teshuvot Halikhot Yisrael</i> 14.</i> Hence, if a broker furnished his services and the buyer changed his mind and withdrew from the deal, the buyer is obligated to pay a full commission.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i>, HM 150.This position is endorsed by numerous <i>Aharonim</i>, including <i>Bnei Hayyei</i>, HM 185; <i>Misgeret ha-Shulchan</i> 185:21; <i>Mishkenot ha-Ro’im</i>, <i>ot</i> 60, <i>sirsur</i> 120; <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Rabbim</i>, HM 27.</i>
<b>2. <i>Minhag Ha-Soherim</i> (Commercial Practice)</b>
One of the issues at bar is whether New York commercial practice (<i>minhag ha-soherim</i>) allows for the recovery of a brokerage commission in connection with a broker’s efforts to procure a buyer for a residential property. Significantly, the <i>Tove’a</i> does not allege that he had an express agreement with the <i>Nitva’at</i> to perform brokerage services for this property, but he claims that New York commercial practice entitles him to such compensation. The <i>Nitva’at</i>, however, claims that this is not the prevalent commercial practice.
New York case law clearly supports the requirement to pay a broker’s commission, even in the absence of a written agreement. In one case, the court ruled:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>[T]he contract of employment may be established either by proof of an express and original agreement that the services should be rendered, or by facts showing, in the absence of such express agreement, a conscious appropriation of the labors of the broker. Indeed, “the contract may be established in some cases by the mere acceptance of the labors of a broker.”<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Joseph P. Day Realty Corp. v. Chera</i>, 308 A. D. 2d 148,152, 762 N.Y.S. 373, N.Y. AD, 2003. 308 AD 2d 148, 153 [2003].</i></small></span>
This holding is reflective of a series of earlier New York rulings, dating back to 1881, that a broker is entitled to commission based upon facts indicating conscious appropriation of the labors of the broker by the client – that is, an implied contract of employment.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co.</i>, 83 NY 378, 380 (1881); <i>Colvin v. Post Mortgage &amp; Land Co.</i>, 225 NY 510 (1919); <i>Greene v. Hellman</i>, 51 NY 2d 197,205–206 (1980); <i>Gronich &amp; Co. v. 649 Broadway Equities Co.,</i> 169 AD 2d 600 (1991). For other grounds for recovery, see <i>Ficor Inc. v. National Kinney Corp.</i>, 67 AD 2d 659, 659–660 (1979); <i>Helmsley-Spear Inc. v. NY Blood Center</i>, 257 AD 2d 64, 67 (1999).</i>
Although neither party is knowledgeable in New York law, they both expected to resolve their differences based on <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>, which is reflected by the law. The Talmud instructs that “an individual may stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah” with regard to monetary matters, whereas Jews are not entitled to accept secular law that violates Halakhah.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin 19b</i>.</i> As such, should parties expect to resolve their matters entailing violations of theft and <i>ribbit</i> (prohibited interest), their arrangement would be halakhically unenforceable. Provided that no <i>issurim</i> (prohibitions) are violated, however, parties’ expectations (<i>umdana</i>) that broker-client relations should be governed by commercial practice are <i>halakhically</i> enforceable.
As <i>Hazon Ish</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The law of the kingdom [civil government] determinates the expectation of people. Since customarily we abide by the law of the kingdom under certain prescribed conditions, the law influences people who then decide to rely on civil law … Therefore, when we [<i>beit din</i>] apply secular law, we are in actuality following our Halakhah rather than their laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1. Interestingly, <i>Hazon Ish</i> finds precedent for his position in the Ra’avad’s ruling cited by <i>Shakh</i>, HM 73:36. However, a review of that ruling indicates that the invoking of the <i>umdana</i> is limited to instances in which the Halakhah fails to address a situation and the resolution of the situation can be realized by invoking an <i>umdana</i>, while Hazon Ish argues that it is inconceivable that there is any gap in Halakhah. Halakhah as a religious-legal system has the capacity to address all situations based on its own sources and rules of interpretation. As such, by citing Ra’avad’s position, Hazon Ish extends Ra’avad’s affirmation of the workings of an <i>umdana</i> even if the Halakhah provides a contrary solution! Others limit the <i>Ra’avad</i>’s ruling to situations in which the Halakhah regarding a particular matter is subject to diverse opinions; see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:128.</i></small></span>
For example, Israeli civil legislation dictates terms of tenancy (the Law for Tenant Protection). <i>R. Shlomo Karelitz</i> argues in the name of his uncle, <i>Hazon Ish</i>, that absent any agreement to the contrary between a landlord and tenant, there is implicit expectation, an <i>umdana</i>, that the terms of tenancy will be based on civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, 360.</i> However, in the absence of a clear indication that the parties wish to adopt civil law, the assumption is that Halakhah is the governing system.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1, 5, 9. The question of how non-observant divorcing couples should be treated is beyond the scope of our presentation here.</i>
In effect, the implementation of Halakhah may be predicated upon the expectations of people to follow halakhic tenancy law. The fact that a secular law exists regarding the matter may cause a change in the expectation; although it was originally clear that halakhic tenancy law would be adhered to, there is now a desire to follow secular law. Consequently, the Halakhah changes due to the change in the <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">See Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 5765), 68. For an extensive list of contemporary <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to this view, see Dov Frimer, “The Influence of Israeli Law upon Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 39 <i>Jewish Studies</i> (1999), 133.<br>R. Sherman challenges this conclusion, arguing that an <i>umdana</i> rooted in non-Jewish practices is ineffective; see A. Sherman and S. Daichovsky, “The Law of Marital Partnership – Non-Recognition in Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 19 <i>Tehumin</i> (5759), 210–11. Cf. my “Varying Approaches Towards the Division of Matrimonial Property upon Divorce” [Hebrew], 71–72 <i>ha-Darom</i> (5761), n. 46, which provides a list of <i>teshuvot</i> that affirm reliance upon non-Jewish practices in monetary matters. Despite his view of the validity of <i>umdana</i> in this context, R. Sherman legitimates adjudication in <i>beit din</i> according to secular law if the spouses agree that their monetary affairs will be resolved in this manner. R. Sherman and other Israeli <i>dayanim</i> view the civil legislation dealing with monetary relations between spouses as “<i>minhag ha-medinah</i>” (national custom), and a resident of Israel is obligated to comply with such legislation. See Netanya Regional Rabbinical Court, File no. 764411/1, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Plonit</i>, Oct. 3, 2010.</i> Invoking this <i>umdana</i> regarding tenancy law has been endorsed by other authorities as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:86; <i>PDR</i> 16:312.

See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 68:12; <i>Tur</i> and <i>SA</i>, HM 61:5; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 42:36, 61:9, 71:33; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, ad loc. 29, EH 66:48; <i>Teshuvot Re’im</i> 16; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i>, p. 149. If the parties must know of the usage, if one party claims that he was unfamiliar with the expectation of following secular law regarding dividing up marital assets, then it becomes the other party’s responsibility to demonstrate that such an expectation in fact exists. See <i>Shakh</i>, HM 42:36, 61:5, in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Erekh Shai</i>, EH 50:7; Michoel Wygoda, <i>Agency Law: Section 5</i>, Israel Ministry of Justice [Hebrew], n. 390. If everyone follows the <i>nohag</i>, claiming that one does not subscribe to it will be no defense. However, in monetary matters, should there be a minority who fails to follow the <i>nohag</i>, such a claim will be accepted; see <i>Teshuvot Nahal Yitzchak</i>, vol. 1, HM 61.</i>
The underlying rationale for legitimizing this approach is that the parties essentially agreed to resolve their issues according to their expectations, which in our situation means following secular law. In the words of <i>R. Feinstein</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>They have operated on the strength of the custom of the region, and that is equivalent to having specifically agreed to this arrangement.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 1:72.</i></small></span>
While Halakhah itself is immutable, the fact that an <i>umdana</i> can serve as a basis for adopting civil law over the Halakhah in monetary matters is essentially built into the Halakhah itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b.</i>
Given that the custom of the locale reflects civil law, the parties’ expectations to follow that law is analogous to having accepted such an arrangement between themselves. In other words, the assessed expectation of the parties is no different than parties executing a contract and providing for a choice of law provision stating that their differences will be resolved by applying secular law.
With regard to the sale of the residential property in our case, there is ample evidence in the record that the <i>Nitva’at</i> accepted the benefit of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s services and that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s efforts were instrumental in consummating the sale. As <i>R. Yisrael Grossman</i> argues, the negotiations between the broker and the seller constitute <i>“hoda’at ba’al din</i>” (admission) that the <i>Nitva’at</i> was interested in using a broker and gave her implicit consent to his appointment, and she is therefore obligated to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Halikhot Yisrael</i> 39.</i> Alternatively, as <i>R.Ya’akov Blau</i> contends, we invoke <i>umdana</i>, the expectations of the parties, which entail following <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 336.</i> Since the commercial practice in New York, as reflected in the law, is to require brokerage fees even in the absence of a written agreement, the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to a commission for his efforts.
<b>3. The Amount of a Brokerage Commission</b>
When the parties’ agreement does not specify the specific amount of the commission or, as in our case, when no agreement was executed regarding brokerage services, how can the rate be determined? <i>R. Yaakov ha-Levi Ettinger</i> (seventeenth century Salonika) writes that the answer depends on whether real estate matters fall under the purview of the Talmudic rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> (the law of the kingdom is the law).<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 28a; <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a–b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 44b–45a.</i> In the opinion of <i>Rema</i>, all matters that are “<i>le-takanat bnei ha-medinah</i>,” for the benefit of the citizenry – understood by <i>Rema</i> as referring to any issues relating to social interaction – may be governed by civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, HM 369; <i>Rema</i>, HM 73:14, 369:11.</i> Vigorously disagreeing with <i>Rema</i>, <i>Shakh</i> argues that if the particular secular law contradicts Halakhah, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> does not apply<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, HM 73:39. Although normative Halakhah today is to follow <i>Shakh</i>’s view, some Rishonim and the majority of Aharonim adopt the <i>Rema</i>’s position. See <i>Aliyot de-Rabbeinu Yonah</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 55a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban 22</i>; <i>Levush Ir Shushan</i>, HM 369:11; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Emet 12</i>; <i>Teshuvot Dovev Meisharim</i> 1:76.</i> In our instance<i>,</i> there is no conflict between Halakhah and civil law regarding this matter, and <i>Shakh</i> would therefore concur that the rule is applicable. Hence, in our case, the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to a commission. <i>R. Ettinger</i> notes that even if the civil law were to contradict Halakhah, given that there is halakhic-legal doubt regarding whether we should follow the view of <i>Rema</i> or <i>Shakh</i>, we may resolve the rate of a brokerage commission based upon <i>minhag</i> (commercial custom).<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Other <i>Aharonim</i> have the same hesitancy; see <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 65; <i>Erekh Shai</i>, HM 73:14; <i>Teshuvot Havatzelet ha-Saharon</i>, HM 8.</i> Many decisors have endorsed this opinion regarding a real estate broker and <i>shadkhan</i> (marriage broker) alike.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 1:79; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, HM 1:1; <i>Teshuvot va-Yeshev Moshe</i> 38; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 185; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:115; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhmah</i> 3:28;<i>Teshuvot Panim Meirot</i> 2:63; <i>Teshuvot Rabaz</i>, EH 62; <i>PDR</i> 11:278, 284; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, HM 2:57.</i>
Based upon the foregoing, the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to receive the customary commission in New York at the time of the sale of the residential property – 6%.
<b>4. Status of a Real Estate Agreement</b>
Before proceeding to discuss whether the <i>Nitva’at</i> is obligated to pay the agreed upon 7% rate of commission on the commercial property, we must first establish the halakhic status of the real estate agreement.
Two components are required in order to undertake an obligation – <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act) and <i>gemirat da’at</i> (firm resolve of the parties).<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hazon Ish</i>, HM 22; Yehezkel Abramsky, <i>Dinei Mamonot</i> (Bnei Brak: 5731).</i> In this case, a <i>kinyan sudar</i> – handing a handkerchief or another article by one party undertaking the obligation to the other party – would not have been effective in validating the agreement, as a <i>kinyan</i> cannot obligate a party in a <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>. Since the commission was not yet in existence at the time of the agreement, a <i>kinyan</i> cannot obligate the <i>Nitva’at</i> to pay the brokerage fee.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 60:6, 209:4–7. Cf. <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 332:6.</i>
Furthermore, the terms of the agreement in question are as follows:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Owner agrees to pay a commission of 7% of the sale price if the broker procures a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase the premises … If the property is sold … the commission provided for herein shall be due and payable …</small></span>
Numerous authorities view this sort of language as a promise to execute a future action. This constitutes a <i>kinyan devarim</i>, which fails to create an enforceable duty.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3b, 148b; <i>SA</i>, HM 245:1, 253:3; <i>Teshuvot Mahairval</i> 1:59; <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 147; <i>PDR</i> 11:131. See my “Breach of a Promise to Marry,” 17 <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (2007), 267.</i> Only an agreement that incorporates language of <i>hithayvut</i> (obligation), such as “I obligate myself to pay” or “I obligate myself now to pay,” creates a monetary obligation, essentially transforming the parties into debtors.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 243:12.</i> Hence, it would seem that a clause providing for payment of a commission in the future, even if it reflects the market rate, is unenforceable.
However, Halakhah recognizes the validity of a contract by virtue of <i>kinyan situmta</i>, the presence of a “seal.”<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 3:8; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 66; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 194:2; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:79.</i> If an agreement is acceptable according to commercial practice, there is implied <i>gemirat da’at</i> to undertake the obligation in accordance with the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 55:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:268; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i>, HM 380; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, YD 314, HM 66; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Kama</i> 2:39.</i> While agreements implementing a <i>kinyan sudar</i> are valid <i>min ha-din</i> (based upon the formal laws of obligations), contracts characterized by language considered <i>kinyan devarim</i> – such as surety agreements, preliminary agreements, contracts to sell a house, arbitration agreements, and divorce agreements – are binding by virtue of <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 176:10, 218:19, 229:2, 230:10, 232:6, 330:5, 331:12; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 19–20; <i>Rema</i>, HM 72:5. According to <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>, a <i>minhag</i> regarding monetary matters that is unaccompanied by rabbinic or communal sanction has an independent status, even if the result will be to extract money from <i>muhzakim</i> (those in present possession). See <i>PDR</i> 16:40, 16:133, 18:354.</i> A real estate brokerage agreement is no different than these agreements. Consequently, a contractual provision providing for a <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>, such as a payment of a commission in the future, is valid and binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 129:6; <i>Sma</i>, HM 129:15; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 129:13.</i>
In addition to the halakhic requirements for solemnizing an agreement between parties discussed above<b>, </b>Halakhah requires that the terms of an agreement incorporate certain stipulations, referred to as the “<i>mishpetei ha-tenai’im</i>” (laws of conditions), in order to be binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 207:3; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 207:7; <i>SA</i>, EH 38:2.</i> In our case, the brokerage agreement should have been drafted in the following fashion:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If the broker renders his services properly, he is entitled to a commission; if the broker fails to render his services properly, he is not entitled to a commission.</small></span>
Nevertheless, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> concludes that the parties’ intent to establish terms of a commercial contract overrides any failure to comply with the <i>mishpetei ha-tenai’im</i>. Accordingly, notwithstanding the agreement’s failure to properly employ the formal language of stipulation mandated under Halakhah, the present agreement is binding upon the parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 61:16; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, HM 61:39; <i>Sma</i>, HM 61:26.</i>
<b>5. The Validity of a Mutually Agreed upon Commission Above the Market Rate</b>
In the contract between the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva’at</i> regarding the commercial property, the parties agreed that the brokerage commission would be 7% of the purchase price. Given that the rate of compensation is linked to local custom standards, the <i>Nitva’at</i> alleges that the mutually agreed upon rate is above the market standard, which is between four to six percent. Consequently, she should be required to pay less than the rate stipulated in the contract.
Relying upon the <i>Maharam</i>’s ruling, <i>Rema</i>, <i>Shakh</i>, and others claim that a broker is limited to receiving a commission that reflects the market rate because the client can always allege that he was jesting (“<i>hashata</i>”) and never seriously intended to pay the higher rate stipulated.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 172 (in the name of <i>Maharam</i>); <i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Rotenburg</i> (Berlin edition), 498, 499, 952; <i>Rema</i>, HM 264:7; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 264:15; <i>Teshuvot Maharil Hadashot</i> 158; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, HM 76. Many sources in this section have been culled from Y. Goldberg, “A Broker’s Claim for Wages Exceeding the Market Rate” [Hebrew], 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5763), 183.<br>This position is corroborated by the <i>halakhah</i> that if a buyer provides his agent with an advance prior to the agent’s completion of his services and afterwards refuses to pay the balance because he argues that the balance exceeds the market rate, he is exempt from remitting the balance. See <i>SA</i>, HM 81:26; <i>Sma</i>, HM 81:53; <i>Sha’ar ha-Mishpat</i> 81:16.</i> In fact, even if it is clear that the client was serious in offering the higher rate, he is still only obligated to pay the market rate.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 64:3. Cf. <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 81:4; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sechirut</i> 15.</i> If, however, the client voluntarily paid the promised rate, he has no grounds for advancing a claim of “jesting” and the entire sum belongs to the broker.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1240; <i>SA</i>, HM 264:8.</i>
The majority of authorities, however, do not accept this view and maintain that a broker is entitled to receive the agreed upon amount even if the rate exceeds the market standard.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharach Or Zaru’a</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 1:99; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Ribbot</i> 396; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> 3:71; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, HM 2:135; <i>Imrei Yosher</i>, <i>Hilkhot Dayanim</i> 18.</i> Indeed, even the authorities who contend that a broker’s remuneration cannot exceed the customary rate agree that once the parties sign a contract detailing the agreed upon commission, the client is bound by those terms. The execution of a <i>kinyan</i> demonstrates the <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the parties, precluding the use of the “jesting” argument.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 32; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 81:6; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, HM 264:8; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 129:8, 264:4; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:157; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, HM 185.</i> Furthermore, if local practice is that the client must remit whatever amount he promised, he must do so even in the absence of a halakhic agreement; the existence of a <i>minhag</i> entails that there is automatically <i>gemirat da’at</i> to comply with one’s duty to remit payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Edut be-Yehosef</i> 2:35; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i>, supra n. 31.</i>
As we saw above, although the written agreement in this case cannot be validated by way of <i>kinyan sudar</i> or the <i>kinyan devarim</i> within it, it is valid as per the <i>minhag ha-soherim</i>. Since there was <i>gemirat da’at</i> at the time of its writing, all views would agree to the validity of the parties’ written agreement to pay a brokerage commission rate that exceeds the customary rate.
<b>6. Statute of Limitations Regarding Outstanding Debt</b>
Even if the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to a commission for the sale of the residential property, the <i>Nitva’at</i> argues that the statute of limitations in the state of New York precludes his collection of those funds. In New York, after the expiration of six years, the injured party loses the right to file a lawsuit seeking monetary damages or other relief. The <i>Nitva’at</i> argues that since the <i>Tove’a</i> filed his suit after that time had elapsed, commercial practice dictates that he is precluded from receiving any relief.
Lapse of time may, indeed, be sufficient basis to impugn the credibility of evidence in support of a claim, leading a <i>beit din</i> to believe that fraud is at play and therefore to find on behalf of the defendant.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 68:20, 85:10; <i>Tur</i>, HM 61:16–17; <i>SA</i>, HM 61:9, 98:2; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 190; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 109; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:142; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 73; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i>, HM 1:44.</i> However, in this case, the <i>Nitva’at</i> does not deny the existence of the debt and there is no reason to be suspicious of the reliability of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim. With few exceptions,<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Exceptions include the statute of limitations regarding a widow who failed to advance a claim for payment of her <i>ketuba</i> or support for an extended period of time or a daughter who failed to claim one tenth of her father’s estate for her wedding; see <i>Ketuvot</i> 68b; 96a,104a. In monetary affairs, if a <i>dayan</i> accepted a bribe and the giver does not claim its return, some construe his silence as waiving his right of recovery; see <i>Bah</i>, HM 9:2; <i>Levush</i>, HM 9:1.</i> a lapse of time in the absence of fraud does not curtail the right to advance a claim for an outstanding debt. Thus:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A creditor may recover a debt at any time, even if it has not been mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta Ketuvot</i> 12:3.</i></small></span>
<i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>When the creditor submits a note of indebtedness which is authenticated, the <i>beit din</i> says to the borrower, “Pay!” Even if there was a lapse of a few years and he did not advance a claim, we do not say that he waived it.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 98:1. See also <i>SA</i>, EH 101:3; <i>Rema</i>, HM 163:2.</i></small></span>
Thus, unless a creditor has explicitly waived his right of collection,<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, HM 98:2; <i>Sma</i>, HM 98: 2; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 2:17; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i> 3:134.</i> the consensus of authorities is to reject a statute of limitations regarding unpaid debts.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:26; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 404; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:85; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot Devar Shmuel</i> 41; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 104:2; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 7; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:15; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:107; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Kama</i>, 1:50.<br>However, if initially the creditor’s intent is to waive the outstanding debt and subsequently he changes his mind, the debt is considered waived. See <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 12:5; <i>Teshuvot Havazelet ha-Sharon</i>, vol. 2, HM 30.</i>
In a locale in which there is no existent <i>minhag</i> to pay brokerage fees, there may be doubt as to whether a time lapse should be viewed as <i>mehilah</i>, a waiver of the debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">R. Avraham Alkali (nineteenth century Hungary) accordingly raises such a doubt; see <i>Zekhor le-Avraham</i>, HM, vol. 3, <i>erekh sakhar</i>.</i> However, today, when it is common practice to pay for such services, <i>R. Ovadiah Yosef</i> argues that in the absence of an explicit waiver, the right of collection is not curtailed due to lapse of time.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 13:34, 43.</i>
Although Halakhah itself does not recognize a statute of limitations in the case of outstanding debt, both <i>Rishonim</i> and <i>Aharonim</i> argue that if the common commercial practice is to recognize a statue of limitations, the custom is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">For an extensive review of this issue, see M. Elon, “The Statute of Limitations in Jewish Law” [Hebrew], 14 <i>Ha-Praklit</i> (5718),179, 243.</i> For example, <i>Rosh</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If an announcement appears, that anyone who has a claim and lien regarding land should now inform us and advance his claim, if he remains silent without protest, all his rights will be null, since this is the practice and this is the law of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 79:13.</i></small></span>
<i>Shulhan Arukh</i> endorses this view as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 104:2.</i> Such practices continued through the nineteenth century and were supported by some decisors.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mizgeret ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 61:16; <i>Ateret Tzvi</i>, HM 61:16; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:182; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 61:18; <i>Kesef ha-Kedoshim</i>, HM 61:9.</i> For these decisors, the statute of limitations is validated based upon common practice in the locale (<i>minhag</i>), a communal ordinance (<i>takanat ha-kahal</i>), or civil law (<i>dina de-malkhuta</i>).
This view is subject to serious challenge. <i>Minhag</i> only has the ability to override Halakhah in monetary matters, not those involving <i>issurim</i> (ritual prohibitions);<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a–b; Yerushalmi, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1.</i> we are powerless to permit what Halakhah prohibited. For example, a <i>minhag</i> not to cancel debts in the sabbatical year has no validity, as there is an <i>issur</i> to collect such debts.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 64:4.</i> Similarly, the Jewish community is only empowered to legislate matters in the realm of <i>mammon</i>, not <i>issur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:132; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 178, 185.</i> Thus, since it is prohibited to imprison a Jew due to his delinquency in repaying a debt, any communal legislation sanctioning this form of punishment is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 68:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 484; <i>SA</i>, HM 97:15. Although a community is empowered to legislate contrary to Halakhah in monetary matters, it may not pass legislation that entails appropriating a citizen’s assets, resulting in profit for one citizen and financial loss for another. That limitation, however, applies only if the legislation is directed against a particular individual(s). If the legislation is passed for the benefit of the community and an individual subsequently incurs a loss due to its passage, the ordinance is binding. See <i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 27:13; <i>Teshuvot She’erit Yosef</i> 9; <i>Rema</i>, HM 2; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:237. Accordingly, were it not for the element of <i>issur</i> involved, the communal passage of a statute of limitations addressing the community at large would be valid.</i> Finally, although Halakhah recognizes civil legal provisions in many monetary matters, should a civil law entail an element of <i>issur,</i> Halakhah will decline to impart recognition to the particular secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:158.</i> For example, if there were to be a civil law allowing for the collection of <i>ribbit</i> (interest), one would be proscribed from following it.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 133.</i>
A broker is considered a <i>kablan</i> (a contractor for certain services)<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 9:4; <i>Rema</i>, HM 333:5.</i> for the real estate services rendered.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Halikhot Yisrael</i> 1–2.</i> By revoking his legal right to collect an outstanding debt, we would be sanctioning the act of <i>gezelah</i>, misappropriating funds from a creditor. Although the matter at hand involves money, it is not a monetary matter; it involves the <i>issur</i> of thievery and therefore cannot be overridden by <i>minhag</i>, <i>takanat ha-kahal</i>, or <i>dina de-malkhuta</i>.
Accordingly, <i>R. Ben Tzion Uziel</i> levels criticism against those arbiters who invoke these factors in validating a statute of limitations:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Our matter is different from a custom adopted wherein we accept modes of <i>kinyanim</i>, such as <i>situmta</i> or <i>minhag ha-sokherim</i>, which are biding pursuant to custom. There is no sanction to steal due to customary practice … This involves the law of theft, and theft is not permitted due to custom.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, HM 28.</i></small></span>
Based upon the foregoing, we find that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s right to recover his compensation remains until this very day and was never extinguished due to the lapse of time.
<b>Decision</b>
1. The <i>Nitva’at</i> is hereby obligated to pay a 7% commission as a brokerage fee for the sale of the commercial property.

f) Drafting a Halakhic Will

<b><i>F. Drafting a Halakhic Will</i></b><br><b><i>Reuben Levy v. Rachel Singer and Leah Shlanger</i></b>
The parties signed an arbitration agreement dated October 29, 2007 before the <i>beit din</i> to resolve their differences and disputes in reference to the estate and inheritance of the late R. Simeon Levy. At the hearing, the following document – henceforth referred to as the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> (gift document) – was submitted as evidence. Prepared in 1985 by the testator, with an addendum signed in 2007, it purports to be an allocation by the late R. Levy of his assets among his three children, his son and two daughters.
<b>The Will</b>

My signature on this gift award shall serve as proof upon myself as one hundred witnesses, whereas that today, Sunday of the Torah reading <i>Ki Tissa</i>, 10 Adar, 5745 (March 3, 1985), I begin the writing of this will, with a clear state of mind with the assistance of the Almighty, which is a will for my son and daughters, may they live and be well, and [is to be effective] from today and after demise on the entire estate that will be left after me, both moveable property and real property, both such assets that I already have in my possession and such assets as may come into my possession until my demise. I am hereby offering my desire in this document, which shall become effective as mentioned above in the first line.
<b>1. </b>The two houses I have here in Staten Island shall be equally distributed according to their value between my son and daughters.
<b>2. </b>All of the funds in the bank, as well as all of the stocks and bonds, shall be equally distributed between my son and daughters, either by distributing the above or by selling [them], and the proceeds shall be distributed amongst them as mentioned above.
<b>3. </b>The cemetery shall remain the possession of my son [handwritten word on top of typewritten text reads: <i>u-venotai</i>, “and my daughters”].
<b>4. </b>All my religious books shall be equally distributed amongst my son and daughters, in accordance with their value.
<b>5. </b>The pages of an illustrated copy of the <i>Moreh Nevukhim</i>, written and published in Barcelona, for which I paid one thousand dollars for each flip page, shall be distributed amongst my son and daughters, except for a few flip pages to my sons-in-law [illegible] three to my sons-in-law.
<b>6. </b>In 1980, I acquired ten plots at the Beth Shemesh Cemetery in Israel. I sold one plot to my nephew, Yankel. For the remaining nine, I have “contracts of sale” in my bank safe, and I request of my son that after my demise I shall be taken there, to be buried in one of the aforementioned plots. If at all possible, my son should escort me until there; that is my preference. The rest of the plots shall be left for family members.
<b>7. </b>All the silverware shall be distributed equally among my son and daughters according to their worth and value.
<b>8. </b>In the event there will be any differences of opinion amongst my son and daughters on any matter that relates to the estate, I authorize, with all of my powers and my mind, my son R. Reuben to decide on every significant or insignificant matter; he and his determinations should be followed. And by utilizing every possible expression of appeal, I request that there shall be no differences of opinion on any matter of the matters, but that everything shall be peaceful and unanimous, for this is my dignity and the dignity of the family. It has already turned out that in respectful families people were stubborn and they did not care about the deceased’s dignity, and the entire family became disgraceful and shameful.
<b>9. </b>I direct my daughters to be careful in [exhibiting] an abundance of modesty in their attire, and especially regarding the hair of the head, without any compromises; this is my compensation for all my effort, to leave behind my son and daughters in this world, who proceed in the path of my holy forefathers of blessed memory, for which I have devoted myself to the Grace of the Almighty, to educate them and to raise them on the path of the Torah and fear of God.
<b>Affixed Signature:</b> R. Simeon ben Yosef Levy, 10 Adar 5745.
<b><i>The Addendum</i></b>
All the above is my true will, and the gift shall arrive today and a moment before my death to all my sons and daughters without any exception according to the usage of our Torah scholars, <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and decisors. I hereby declare (<i>mesirat moda’ah</i>) that since the original will is lost, therefore I confirm and sign off on this copy and nullify retroactively all wills that were written regarding my inheritance and assets, and one can nullify this will only in the presence of my son and daughters. My signature shall attest to all the above as a full admission (<i>hoda’ah gemurah</i>) in the presence of the two signed witnesses below, and it is executed with a <i>kinyan sudar</i> and other effective <i>kinyanim</i>. Today, I have signed with sound mind, Thursday, <i>Parashat Bo</i>, 6 Shevat, 5767, January 25, 2007.

<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
Mr. Reuben Levy maintains that his father’s entire estate and inheritance should be given to him, in accordance with the Torah law of inheritance. Since his sister, Rachel Levy, is the firstborn of the family, no claim of <i>bekhorah</i> (right of the firstborn male to a double portion) is advanced by Reuben.
The plaintiff claims that the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> is a forgery. Moreover, even if it is authentic, given that this alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> was neither attested by witnesses nor validated by a <i>kinyan</i>, a symbolic act to effect the transfer of assets, the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> is halakhically inconsequential.
Furthermore, given that their father was diagnosed with dementia in 2005 and was under Aricept treatment, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he lacked the halakhic-legal capacity to execute a <i>shtar matanah</i>. In fact, Dr. Springlass confirmed (in writing and via the telephone during a <i>beit din</i> hearing) that R. Levy, his patient, was bereft of the mental capacity to create a halakhic-legal document during that time period. Consequently, the reconfirmation of the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> in the presence of witnesses, which took place in 2007, had no validity. Hence, in the absence of an authenticated <i>shtar matanah</i> to the contrary, their father’s assets ought to be divided according to the Torah laws of inheritance. As such, the <i>Tove’a</i> is the <i>yoresh me-de-oraita</i>, the sole heir to his father’s assets. Should the <i>beit din</i> affirm the testamentary disposition, they will be engaging in <i>avurei ahsanta</i>, disinheriting the heir who is the only one recognized as such by the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Given that in this will, the testator desires to transfer all of his assets, immovable and movable property, the assumption of Mr. Reuben Levy is that <i>avurei ahsanta</i> applies regarding both types of property. Although <i>Hilkhot Ketanot</i> 2:267 supports such a conclusion, others argue that disinheriting a Torah heir applies only to immovable property, <i>karka</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, HM 2:6; <i>Levush Orah</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> 24:10.</i>
Moreover, the <i>Tove’a</i> claims that the defendants’ initiation of probate proceedings in Brooklyn Surrogate Court and in Brooklyn Supreme Court regarding other inheritance matters not covered by this arbitration agreement involved recourse to <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>, gentile courts, which is prohibited by Torah law. Hence, the <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he is entitled to receive $14,093.75 reimbursement from the defendants for court and legal costs.
<b><i>Nitva’ot</i>s’ Counterclaims</b>
Rachel Singer and Leah Shlanger, the <i>Nitva’ot</i>, argue that on March 3, 1985, instructions for dividing up the assets of their late father equally between his children were recorded in a one-page document that was prepared, typed, and signed by the deceased himself. At the time, although R. Levy signed the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>, there were neither witnesses present to affirm his wishes, nor did their father execute a <i>kinyan</i> to validate the document and transfer his estate “one moment before my demise.” This document was placed by their father in an envelope (with outside markings of “<i>tzava’ah</i>” [will]), which was then placed in a dresser in his home.
Years later, although the original alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> was lost, copies of it were circulating among various family members. Concerned that the <i>Tove’a</i>, their brother, would contest the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>, at the behest of the defendants, on 6 Shevat, 5767 (January 25, 2007), the sisters allege that their father desired to add an addendum to the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> and consented to its validation by two witnesses, accompanied by the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>. The addendum was prepared by a local rabbi.
The addendum provides that R. Simeon Levy, being of clear mind, arranges that his gift will transpire a moment before his demise, acknowledges the loss of the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>, and asserts that his signature attests to all that was stated as a firm admission in the presence of the two witnesses and accompanied by a symbolic transaction, <i>kinyan sudar</i>. Accompanying this addendum is the testator’s signature, as well as the signatures of the two witnesses.
Simeon Levy passed away on Rosh Hodesh Av, 5767 (July 16, 2007). Upon his demise, the <i>Nitva’ot</i> argue that the disposition of their father’s assets should be executed pursuant to the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>, which allegedly was halakhically validated on January 25, 2007. The <i>Nitva’ot</i> argue, pursuant to the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>, that all items belonging to their father, including but not limited to manuscripts and books, are to be divided equally among all three children, except if specified otherwise in the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>.
The <i>Nitva’ot</i> further claim that their initiation of probate proceedings in Surrogate Court does not fall under the category of arranging proceedings in <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>. Moreover, they claim that pursuant to New York case law, the court will not confirm an award of any arbitration panel concerning the distribution of the assets of a deceased’s estate. Since the <i>Tove’a</i> would be left with no means to enforce the <i>beit din</i>’s award, he would be forced to file in Brooklyn Supreme Court in any event. Second, the <i>Nitva’ot</i> filed in secular court out of fear that the <i>Tove’a</i> would abscond with items from their father’s assets. The same concern motivated the <i>Nitva’ot</i>s’ decision to initiate a restraining order in Brooklyn Supreme Court that effectively blocked the sale of the property by the <i>Tove’a</i> without the authorization of the <i>Nitva’ot</i>. Hence, they argue, they are liable neither for remuneration of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s court and legal fees relating to the Brooklyn Supreme Court action, nor for the fees for the probate proceeding.
<b>Summary of Submitted Testimony</b>
<b>R. Israel</b>: R. Israel described the procedure that took place on January 25, 2007 at the testator’s home. R. Israel read the entire alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> to R. Levy in the presence of two kosher witnesses, Mr. Joseph Cohen and Mr. Aryeh Rabinowitz. At the conclusion of each clause, R. Israel asked the testator if the instructions conformed to his wishes. Although the typewritten alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> was reconfirmed, at the testator’s request, R. Israel added the following in his own handwriting:
1. In section three, illegible words that possibly read “and my daughters” were added.
2. In section five, the words “three to my sons-in-law” were added.
Upon completing the reading of the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> and the addendum, the testator dated the document, accompanied by his personal signature, the two witnesses affixed their signatures, accompanied with their addresses, and a <i>kinyan sudar</i> was performed.
<b>Mr. Joseph Cohen and Mr. Aryeh Rabinowitz</b>: Both individuals profess and are known in their respective communities to be Orthodox Jews. Both attested to the aforementioned procedure as outlined by R. Israel. They understood the purpose of the procedure and testified that Simeon Levy was cognitively aware of what was transpiring at the time.
<b>Dr. Springlass</b>: Dr. Springlass was the deceased’s internist since 1982. Having observed Simeon Levy in October 2006, three months prior to his reading and signing of the addendum, Dr. Springlass attested that Simeon Levy had difficulties with speech and expression, was incontinent and physically weak, and required total care. He was taking Aricept, a medication intended to help dementia patients that generally does not impair their cognitive abilities. Although he was unable to create a legal document, he was able to follow simple commands and express his approval concerning a specific question posed to him, and he may have understood what he read.
In his testimony, Dr. Springlass writes: “A diagnosis of dementia indicates that the patient has impaired judgment, but even a demented patient could make a decision (yes or no) to a clear directive while retaining a certain level of comprehension.” In other words, a patient with mild, moderate, and even severe dementia is able to demonstrate capacity to make some decisions, including the execution of an advance directive whether to accept or deny certain medical treatments.
<b>Mr. Miller, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Levine</b>: All three individuals knew R. Simeon Levy, the <i>gabbai</i> (sexton) of their synagogue, for over two decades. All three testified that the deceased was an organized individual who handled the record keeping of the contributions to the synagogue, and they surmised that he was a successful businessman. Attesting to the deceased’s business acumen, Mr. Levine acknowledged that he would not have hesitated in asking him to be a partner in his personal business. Although the consensus among the three men is that R. Levy was frail and exhibited slurred speech in 2006, Mr. Miller and Mr. Levine pointed out that he was aware of his surroundings when in the synagogue. Furthermore, both Mr. Miller and Mr. Simon remarked that one could clearly see from his expression and demeanor whether he was content with a particular person honored by being called up to the Torah.
<b>Mikhail Szold</b>: In April 2006, prior to R. Levy’s admission to the hospital as well as during his hospital stay, Mr. Szold was an attendant for R. Levy during the night hours. Mr. Szold testified that R. Levy would fall asleep at the dinner table and was incontinent, unable to converse, and incapable of signing a legal document.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Authenticity of the Will</b>
Based upon the cumulative evidence, it is our opinion that this typed document (the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i>) was prepared by R. Simeon Levy. His meticulous concern for detail is clearly demonstrated, for example, in sections 5 and 6 of his testamentary disposition. In addition to the will’s directives being reflective of the testator’s character and personality, the signature on the document is unassailably R. Simeon Levy’s signature.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Our conclusion was based upon comparing the signature recorded on the will with other documents signed by the testator. For the grounds of verifying a contested signature based upon a review of other documents signed by the same individual, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhosot le-Ramban</i> 22; <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 13, <i>helek</i> 1, <i>halakha</i> 3; <i>Tur</i>, HM 69; <i>Tumim</i>, HM 69:7; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 69:8 in the name of <i>SA</i>, HM 69:2. Cf. <i>Shakh</i>, HM 69:12; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, HM 46:5; <i>PDR</i> 1:108, 112.</i> There is no evidence on record that Simeon Levy was coerced into writing this document. Quite to the contrary, he crafted this document (which he intended to be a <i>shtar matanah</i>) in total privacy from his family. By his own admission, the <i>Tove’a</i> knew of its existence many years before the execution of the addendum and lodged no protest of fraud. Hence, we reject the <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention that the alleged gift document is a fraud.
<b>2. The Prohibition of <i>Avurei Ahsanta</i></b>
Assuming the authenticity of this testamentary disposition, is there any basis for the <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention that a <i>beit din</i> affirming this document will be engaging in <i>avurei ahsanta</i>, disinheriting the halakhic heirs? The Mishnah notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>If a man assigns his estate to others and leaves nothing for his sons to inherit, what he has done is done [i.e., it is valid], but the spirit of the Sages shows no pleasure in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 8:5, codified by <i>Mishnah Torah, Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:11; <i>SA</i>, HM 282:1. Whether this ruling entails a prohibition against disinheritance or is a halakhic-moral imperative that inheritance assets be given to Torah heirs is subject to debate. See Yerushalmi <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:6; <i>Rif</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 133b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>kelal</i> 85, <i>siman</i> 3; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 133b, s.v. <i>assur</i>; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:11; <i>Kehillot Ya’akov</i> 46. Regarding whether it is a biblical or rabbinic prohibition, see <i>Sedei Hemed, Kelalim</i>, <i>kelal</i> 3. <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 118 notes that one should refrain from retracting a verbal commitment to disinherit a Torah heir lest one be regarded as a “<i>mehusrei emunah</i>,” lacking in trustworthiness.<br>The <i>Poskim</i> emphasize that either both the testator and <i>beit din</i> or the testator alone must refrain from engaging in <i>avurei ahsanta</i>. See <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 400; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 118; <i>Netziv</i>, <i>Ha’amek She’eilah</i>, <i>She’ilta</i> 135; <i>Ramban</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 21:16–17; <i>Maharam Schick</i>, <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot,</i> mitzvah 401.</i></small></span>
Although our Sages frowned upon and even warned against any disinheritance or diminution of inheritance assets from Torah heirs, numerous decisors have argued that assets may be diverted to others as long as a significant share – and according to some, even a nominal amount – is set aside for the Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">As <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 8, ch. 4, n. 9 observes, there is no clear resolution of the question of how much must be given to the Torah heirs in order to avoid the strictures of disinheritance. See <i>Sefer ha-ittur</i>, <i>Matnat Shekhiv Mera</i> 59b (p. 118); <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:147; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 92; <i>Taz</i>, EH 113:1 in the name of <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 92; <i>Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadurah Tinyana</i> 4:1 in the name of <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 92; <i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 21:4, 6; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 282:2; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:110, HM 2:49–50; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 3:135. Cf. others who argue that any amount of diminution of inheritance is proscribed; see <i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 3; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 151; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:12. <i>Teshuvot Zera Avraham</i> 2:110 argues that half of the estate should be left to the Torah heir(s), provided that the testator is wealthy. According to R. Z. Goldberg, the amount being given to the Torah heirs who will not be inheriting assets should be mentioned in the will; see <i>Shurat ha-Din</i>, vol. 2, 360, n. 11<i>.</i></i> Although we are unaware of the deceased’s intent in choosing to divide his assets equally between his son and daughters, Halakhah sanctions such a distribution for the purpose of financially benefiting all of one’s children, rather than for egalitarian considerations.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer,</i> HM 153.</i>
<b>3. Gifting During One’s Lifetime</b>
Given that death divests the testator of title and automatically transfers title to the Torah heirs,<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 135b.</i> how can one disinherit or diminish the assets of the Torah heirs during one’s lifetime? By making a gift in a halakhically effective manner during one’s lifetime – <i>matnat bari</i>, the gift of a healthy person – one can divest himself of his assets so that upon death, the title to the property will not automatically vest with the Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 3; <i>Kenesset Gedolah</i>, HM 282:10; <i>Ha’amek She’eilah</i>, <i>Parashat Vayetzei</i>, <i>She’ilta</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 7:132; <i>Dinnei Mamonot</i>, vol. 3, <i>sha’ar</i> 4; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 8, ch. 4 (end). For one of the earliest post-talmudic uses of this technique, see the will attributed to R. Sa’adia Gaon found in the Cairo Geniza; see Yosef Rivlin, <i>Inheritance and Will in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew], ch. 9 and accompanying addendum. For examples of authorities who reject this technique, see <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 31; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 118; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 311; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:12; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), HM 42; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 151; <i>Teshuvot Zera Avraham</i>, supra n. 4.</i>
In order for a gift during one’s lifetime (<i>donatio inter vivos</i>) to be effective in the transfer of assets, certain terminology must be used; otherwise, as far as Halakhah is concerned, the document is invalid. Proper language indicating a gift transfer would be the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>I hereby acknowledge by a perfect acknowledgment (<i>hoda’ah gemurah</i>) that I transferred a perfect gift, a gift of a healthy person, that is publicly known from today, and retain the right to revoke this gift during my lifetime until one moment before my demise the following assets …<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 174. For similar terminology, see Dayan Yitzhak Grunfeld<i>, The Jewish Law of Inheritance</i> (Jerusalem: 1987), 108–9; R. Zvi Y. ben Ya’akov, <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i>, vol. 2, 296.</i></small></span>
In effect, the gift recipient receives title to the property, while the testator, similar to any donor, retains the right of the income derived from the property during his lifetime and has the authority to revoke or modify his gift until his demise.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA,</i> HM 257:1, 7.</i> In this manner, the donor continues to retain possession of his assets during his lifetime and avoids becoming dependent upon others.
To formally transfer title, there is also a requirement to execute a <i>kinyan sudar</i>, a symbolic act of transfer by handing over a scarf or any other object by the beneficiary to the donor or the witnesses to the agreement, as a symbol that the object has been transferred.
The disadvantage in utilizing this <i>kinyan</i> is that it is effective in transferring property and chattel only. Currency, bank accounts, promissory notes, and mortgages cannot be transferred in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA,</i> HM 190:1, 195:1, 203:1; <i>Pithei Hoshen,</i> vol. 8, 170, n. 2.</i> Furthermore, <i>kinyan sudar</i> is ineffective in transferring assets that are neither in the donor’s possession nor in existence at the time the <i>kinyan</i> is made.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 209:4–7.</i> Moreover, according to some decisors, this <i>kinyan</i> is ineffective if the language of transfer is “the person will take,” “will possess,” “will be distributed” and the like, as such language refers to a future time, not the present.<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Many <i>Poskim</i> view this language as a promise to execute a future action and therefore a form of <i>kinyan devarim</i>, which fails to create a halakhically enforceable obligation. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 3b, 148b; <i>SA</i>, HM 245:1, 253:3; <i>Tur</i>, HM 253; <i>Sma</i>, HM 253:9; and my “Breach of a Promise to Marry,” <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> 17 (2007), 267. A promise for future action is invalid because death relinquishes the testator’s title and vests title with the Torah heirs, and there is “no <i>kinyan</i> after death.”<br>If the prevailing <i>minhag</i> is that the word “shall” or “will” is employed in contracts to obligate oneself, such language would be effective in asset transfer. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 105; <i>Hagahot Imrei Baruch</i>, HM 201; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, HM 2:26.</i> Finally, a gift must be given openly, in a public fashion, lest the donor be parsimonious in his donation or give the same gift to another individual in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">SA, HM 242:3–5. For extenuating circumstances allowing for the drawing up of a secret gift document, see <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 8, 352, n. 91. Some argue that nowadays one need not be concerned with the possibility of a secret gift; nonetheless, <i>le-khathilah</i>, one should mention this fact in the document. See <i>SA</i>, HM 242:5; <i>Rema</i>, ibid.</i>
To overcome some of the limitations of a <i>shtar matanah</i>, many wills incorporate a <i>hoda’ah</i>, an acknowledgement utilizing the language of “I gave this object to … ,” ”this object belongs to …” or “I am obligated to … this amount of …” alongside the gift formula.<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 60:6, 257:7; <i>SA</i>, HM 40:1, 250:3. The acknowledgment of the debt utilizing this language constitutes a <i>kinyan</i>. See <i>SA</i>, EH 108:3; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 281:7.</i> The mere acknowledgment of the debt creates a legal title. Sometimes called “<i>odita</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Rishonim</i> and <i>Aharonim</i> utilize the concepts interchangeably, R. Saadia Gaon distinguishes between them. See Berachyahu Lifshitz, <i>Asmakhta</i>, [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1988), 265, n. 322.</i> for this admission to be effective in transferring the assets, it must be executed either in writing, before witnesses, or before a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">This matter is subject to much debate. See <i>Mishnah</i> Torah, <i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i> 11:15; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 40:1, 194:3; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 18:6; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 40:1, 60:17.</i> If he complies with these formal requirements, a testator may transfer property that is not yet in existence or not in his present possession.
Because he wished to leave to his children bank accounts, stocks and bonds, land, buildings, manuscripts, books, silver items, and assets that would come into his possession in the future, R. Levy prepared a will in the form of a <i>shtar matanah</i> and <i>hoda’ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">The combination of both formulations of gift-giving and admission is advanced by many contemporary <i>Poskim</i>. See Grunfeld, supra n. 8, 106–11; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 174; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i>, vol. 2, 296; vol. 3, 370; R. Sha’anan, “A Will According to Halakhah” [Hebrew], 13 <i>Tehumin</i> (5752–5753), 317; R. M. Bleicher, “A Will: Its Drafting and Formulation” [Hebrew], 2 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5754), 353. Cf. R. Feivel Cohen, <i>Kuntres mi-Dor le-Dor</i>, 9–17. For advocates of implementing <i>odita</i> as a vehicle to transfers assets that are not yet in existence, see <i>Yad Rama</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a; <i>Ri Megash</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiyah</i> 9:9.</i> Did his will meet the requirements of a properly written <i>shtar matanah</i> and <i>hoda’ah</i>? If the will was defective, was the addendum prepared years later properly crafted, addressing the shortcomings of the original will?
A review of the original will indicates that the basic building blocks of a gift donation are absent. Instead of incorporating the conventional gift language, “I retain the right to revoke this gift during my lifetime until one moment before my demise,” the will reads, “to be effective from today and after my demise.” Moreover, the will was prepared in the privacy of R. Levy’s home, not in the presence of his family, and is bereft of language indicating that these gifts were being given in an open and public fashion. Finally, the continuous use of the language “shall be distributed” throughout the various sections of the will denotes a promise of future action, which is ineffective terminology for transferring assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 12.</i>
Similarly, the implementation of “<i>hoda’ah</i>” in the opening words of the will – “my signature on this gift award shall serve as proof upon myself as one hundred witnesses, whereas that today … I begin the process of writing this will” – is faulty. In effect, the testator is utilizing a <i>hoda’ah</i> for the purpose of attesting to the timing of the disposition, not as a form of <i>hithayvut</i>, undertaking an obligation. Proper <i>hoda’ah</i> in this case would have been language to the effect of, “I acknowledge that I gave this object to … ,” which would then enable transfer of property.<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, HM 60:6, 245:1; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 250:3; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 40:1.</i> Finally, even if the proper <i>hoda’ah</i> language had been used by R. Levy, the absence of the performance of a <i>kinyan</i> or the absence of a <i>kinyan</i> executed in the presence of specified witnesses may have made this will invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 13.</i>
Thus, the original will drafted by R. Levy is problematic in terms of both gift-giving and obligating through admission to the transfer of certain assets. The outstanding question is whether the addendum that was prepared years later properly addressed the halakhic shortcomings of the original will.
Normative Halakhah is that improper formulation of a <i>shtar</i> can be remedied by performing a <i>kinyan</i> and inserting at the end of the document that an effective <i>kinyan</i> was made. We can then assume that the individual who was obligating himself in the original <i>shtar</i> wished to effect a transfer of assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:31; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 195:20, 22; <i>Rema</i>, HM 60:6, 212:1. See Y. Goldberg, “An Improperly Drafted Legal Document Finalized by a <i>Kinyan</i>” [Hebrew], 1 <i>Shurat ha-din</i> (5754), 301. According to <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen,</i> HM 245:1-2, a <i>kinyan suddar</i> must be implemented.</i> Accordingly, the incorporation of the language “from today and one moment prior to my death” in the addendum, linking the <i>hoda’ah</i> to the enumerated assets, as well as the performance of a <i>kinyan</i> and the signing of proper witnesses, ought to validate the original will, despite its flaws, and serve to properly transfer the assets to the sons and daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">In effect, the burden of proof to authenticate a will is equivalent of that required in secular criminal law – proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than negating any uncertainty as to the will’s veracity.</i> The will’s defects do not, per se, create doubts as to its veracity regarding the testator’s subjective wishes to execute the asset transfer.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently, any further claims against the veracity of the will, unrelated to the defects in question, should be treated as claims against a valid will.</i>
<b>4. Required Mental Capacity to Confirm an Existing Will</b>
If a properly worded addendum and performance of a <i>kinyan</i> can validate a previously invalid will, we must address the question of whether the addendum in our case is valid, given R. Levy’s mental state at the time of its execution.
Although R. Levy may have been cognitively impaired to the extent that he could not execute a new halakhic document in January 2007 and is therefore considered a <i>shoteh</i> in that context,<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakhmei Provencia</i> 57; <i>Yavin She’mua le-ha-Rashbatz</i>, <i>Tikkun Soferim</i>, <i>ha’ar</i> 16.</i> one who is deemed mentally incompetent in certain realms is not necessarily deemed globally impaired.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 35:21; <i>Tevuot Shor</i>, YD 1:11; <i>Teshuvot Tzemah Tzedek</i>, EH 153; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:120.</i> People with dementia are often incorrectly assumed to be globally decisionally incapacitated, but certain halakhic views,<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 24. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 153; <i>Teshuvot Yehuda Ya’aleh</i> 93; <i>Teshuvot Mishnat Rabbi Aharon</i> 56.</i> as well as contemporary medical research,<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">See Zev Schostak, “Alzheimer’s and Dementia in the Elderly: Halachic Perspectives,” 52 <i>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> (Fall 2006), 83, 86–88.</i> indicate otherwise.
It is our view that R. Levy, although suffering from occasional memory loss and mild disorientation, was sufficiently lucid and oriented (<i>bar da’at</i>) to understand that the personally prepared document enumerating his wishes of 1985 was being read to him in January 2007 and, upon the conclusion of its reading, to decide to sign it. This level of <i>da’at</i> was sufficient to reaffirm the original will.
To buttress this position, we invoke <i>R. Yehezkel Landau</i>’s ruling that “<i>gadol omeid al gabav</i>” – if a legally responsible individual supervises a <i>shoteh</i>’s execution of a divorce document, the <i>get</i> is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, cited in <i>Or ha-Yashar</i> (<i>Teshuvot</i> Regarding the <i>Get</i> of Cleves) 30.</i> Our case involves a level of <i>da’at</i> more basic than that necessary to execute a <i>get</i>, and R. Levy’s reaffirmation should therefore be valid by way of a <i>kal va-homer</i> (a fortiori).
<b>5. Rejecting the Validity of the Will</b>
Our conclusion thus far may be challenged. If we accept the view that prior to the distribution of the inheritance assets, the “<i>muhzakim</i>,” the possessors of the estate, are the heirs as indicated by the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 15; <i>Teshuvot Maharyah ha-Levi</i> 2:86; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 142; <i>Mahairval</i> 3:35. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shai</i> 75, 79.</i> then this sole Torah heir – R. Levy’s son – who will receive a smaller share in the inheritance due to his father’s will, can argue that he follows those opinions that would invalidate such a will, despite the later addendum.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">For a list of <i>Poskim</i> who invalidate a <i>matnat bari</i> as a technique for estate planning, see n. 7 above.<br>This type of argument is known as “<i>kim li</i>,” “I hold the opinion.” The rationale of the argument is that we do not extract money on the basis of uncertainty. See <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>kelal</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, vol. 1, HM 38. Even if the <i>muhzak</i> does not advance this argument, <i>beit din</i> has the right to raise the plea; see <i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 4, 144. To avoid the possibility of this argument, R. Levy could have inserted a provision in his will that precluded the advancement of such a plea. In fact, a contemporary proposed will incorporates such a disclaimer; e.g. <i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 3, 185.</i> According to this argument, since the will did conform to <i>hilkhot shtarot</i>, the laws of legal documents, it cannot deprive him, the Torah heir and estate holder, of his rights, regardless of the addendum attesting to its validity. If the <i>shtar matanah</i> is not a valid legal document, we must find other avenues of accepting its content as obligatory.
<b>6. “<i>Mitzvah le-Kayem Divrei ha-Met</i>” as Means of Validating the Will</b>
Although R. Levy’s employment of terminology of gift-giving and admission in his original will falls short of creating a halakhically acceptable disposition of his assets, it may be argued that the will should be validated based upon the rule of “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>,” the religious duty to carry out the wishes of the deceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 14b–15a; <i>Ketuvot</i> 69b–70a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a; <i>SA</i>, HM 252:2. Whether this rule is a type of <i>kinyan</i> is subject to debate; see <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 2:95; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 207; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiyah u-Matanah</i> 29; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 248:5; <i>Rema</i>, HM 252:2; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:35; <i>Teshuvot Lev Aryeh</i> 2:57; <i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> HM 2:53; <i>Teshuvot Heshev ha-Efod</i> 2:135.</i> A testamentary disposition of assets, even if it does not fulfill the standards of <i>hilkhot shtarot</i>, certainly reflects “the wishes of the deceased.”<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">The assumption is that this rule is effective regarding a <i>shtar matanah</i>; see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. <i>ho kibeil</i>; <i>SA,</i> HM 252:2. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 207; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224.</i>
Although this rule has none of the attendant formalities of <i>hilkhot shtarot</i>, its scope is subject to debate and its applicability has been limited by a number of authorities. According to <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i> and those who subscribe to his position, in order for the rule to be applicable, the property or funds must be deposited by the donor with a third party (“<i>hashlashah</i>”) for the purpose of implementing the testator’s wishes, which was not the case here.<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 143, nn. 84–85.</i> <i>Tosafot Ri ha-Zaken</i> and <i>Ramban</i> argue that the rule is binding only if the testator clearly designates to the heirs a third party who will comply with the testator’s wishes, which was also not the case here. Finally, according to <i>Rosh</i> and others, the deposit with a third party must have been executed prior to the verbal directive in order for the rule to be applicable, which again was not the case here.<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">For a summary of the different positions, see <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:39.</i> Thus, “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>” may not serve as the basis for affirming R. Levy’s will.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that if R. Levy possessed retirement assets, pursuant to R. Tam’s position (codified by <i>SA,</i> HM 252:2), those assets that he transferred to a trustee during his lifetime to a trustee would have a status of <i>hashlashah.</i> Accordingly, transfer to the beneficiaries would be effective based on “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met.</i>”</i>
<b>7. The Mitzvah of <i>Kibbud Av</i> as Means of Validating the Will</b>
Despite the shortcomings in this testamentary disposition based upon <i>hilkhot shtarot</i> and its failure to meet the criteria for “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>” due to the absence of <i>hashlashah</i>, it is our opinion that the children’s compliance with the instructions of this document is required based on the <i>mitzvot</i> of <i>kibbud av</i>, honoring one’s father,<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:53; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam,</i> YD 203; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Levy</i> 2:86; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 214; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shai</i> 79; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224 (14); <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 146–8; and M. Schwartz<i>, Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, 467–8.</i> and <i>mora av</i>, filial reverence.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish,</i> YD 148:8. R. Akiva Eiger is unsure whether to validate a will based upon these grounds; see <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> 1:68.</i>
<i>Mora av</i> dictates that a son may neither stand nor sit in his father’s place nor contradict his words.<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:11; <i>Kiddushin</i> 30b–31a.</i> Fundamentally, a son must refrain from diminishing the dignity, identity, or self-worth of his father. In fact, the centrality of <i>mora</i> resonates in the words of R. Levy, who wrote in his will:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>And by utilizing every possible expression of appeal, I request that there shall be no differences of opinion on any matter of the matters, but that everything shall be peaceful and unanimous, for this is my dignity, the dignity of the family, and the dignity of your mother.</small></span>
Thus, although the gift disposition and accompanying addendum may not constitute a valid gift according to the laws of <i>shtarot</i> or by way of <i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>, the deceased’s concern for his own dignity and the paramount significance of avoiding “<i>kalon avihem</i>,” embarrassment to the parties’ father in the distribution of his assets,<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 62a: “If a father leaves a cow or a garment or anything that is stolen, the heirs are obligated to return it in order to uphold the dignity of their father.” See <i>Rashi,</i> ad loc., s.v. <i>ha-mesuyam; Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 86a., s.v. <i>perias ba’al hov</i>; M. Schwartz, <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, 469. The implicit assumption of our opinion is that the mitzvah of <i>mora</i> is applicable even after a father’s demise; see <i>Birkhei Yosef</i>, YD 240:24 (subsection 17).</i> propels this panel to affirm this document, the wishes of R. Levy, and to transfer the assets as established in the will<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon the <i>shtar borerut</i>, the signed arbitration agreement between the parties, it is within our authority to coerce the parties to comply with the <i>mitvzot</i> of <i>kibbud av</i> and <i>mora.</i> Thus, we shall refrain from addressing whether <i>beit din</i> is empowered to do so in the absence of such an agreement. See <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i> 33; <i>SA</i>, HM 107:1; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 107:1; <i>Sma,</i> HM 107:2; <i>Rema</i>, YD 240:1. For the grounds of our authority, see <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 12:18; <i>SA</i>, HM 13:2.</i>
As such, the validity of the addendum executed on January 25, 2007 is not relevant, and we need only address the status of the handwritten clarifications (in provisions 7 and 10) as incorporated in the <i>shtar matanah</i> at that juncture in time.
<b>8. Deciphering the Provisions of the Will</b>
Section three of the will reads: “The cemetery shall remain the possession of my son,” and a handwritten clarification possibly reads “and my daughters.” We find that this addition, which seems to indicate that R. Levy changed his mind regarding the distribution of this asset, is unacceptable. According to Halakhah, any incorporation of a handwritten change must be followed by either the depositor’s signature or initials or another <i>kiyum</i> as certification of the emendation.<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 171.</i> Neither R. Levy’s signature nor his initials are annexed to this handwritten change, and in the case of doubt (<i>safek</i>) regarding the intent of the deceased, we do not remove an asset from the Torah heirs, as they are the presumptive heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 15; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:86; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 144; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 142.</i>
Regarding the validity of the handwritten clarification in provision five, which now reads “three to my sons-in-law,” R. Levy’s presumed intent was to distribute three pages of the <i>Moreh Nevukhim</i> to each of his sons-in-law. We find this addition to be acceptable based upon common usage (<i>lashon bnei adam</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 207; <i>Sma</i>, HM 42:28; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, vol. 9, 4:35.</i>
<b>9. The Prohibition of <i>Lifneihem ve-Lo Lifnei Arka’ot shel Akum</i></b>
The prohibition of <i>lifneihem ve-lo lifnei arka’ot shel akum</i> proscribes Jews from litigating their disputes in an adversarial proceeding in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 26:1.</i> Matters that are administrative in nature, such as confirming an award of a <i>beit din</i> or probating an uncontested testamentary disposition, do not fall within the parameters of this prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Dovev Meisharim</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 1:192; <i>Teshuvot Emunat Shemuel</i> 17.</i> However, in a contested testamentary disposition, there must be a determination of how to divide up the assets by a <i>beit din</i> prior to recourse to a probate proceeding; initiating a probate proceeding regarding a contested testamentary disposition prior to a <i>beit din</i> ruling entails a violation of the prohibition of recourse to <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>.
Should one party submit a claim in civil court in violation of the prohibition of litigating in <i>arka’ot shel akum</i>, resulting in the incurrence of expenses, such as legal and court fees, to the other party, upon proving his outlay of expenses, the party who submitted the claim is obligated to pay for all these expenses.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, HM 26:7; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 2, HM 1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:172.</i>
However, if a party institutes proceedings in the form of injunctive relief (<i>ikul</i>) in civil court for the purpose of rescuing funds that otherwise may be lost to him, while some authorities require prior permission of <i>beit din</i>, others argue that if “time is of the essence,” there is no violation of <i>lifneihem ve-lo lifnei arka’ot shel akum</i> (either <i>le-khathila</i> or only <i>be-dieved</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kesef ha-Kodshim</i>, HM 26:1; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 45; <i>Minhat Petim</i> 26.</i> Under such circumstances, the other party would not be remunerated for his court and legal fees.
A “<i>heter arka’ot</i>,” a <i>beit din</i>’s permission to litigate a matter in civil court, does not mean that one is allowed to accept every award issued in such a court. If a Jew receives a monetary award in civil court, he may accept it only if Torah law would have sanctioned such an award; should he accept such an award when Torah law would not permit it, he is considered a thief.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:290, cited by <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, HM 26; <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshulash</i> 1:19.</i> Hence, pursuant to the matters within its jurisdiction as expressed in the signed arbitration agreement, this <i>beit din</i> is the final arbiter regarding the provisions of this document and the deceased’s distribution of his assets, and the son and daughters of the late R. Levy cannot accept an award in Surrogate’s Court that is in excess of the award mandated by this decision.
<b>Decision</b>
We hereby order, pursuant to our authority under the signed arbitration agreement, that R. Levy’s assets be divided up between his son and daughters in accordance with his wishes as expressed in his gift document dated Adar 10, 5745 (March 3, 1985) and the handwritten clarification of provision number five of January 25, 2007.
Any assets that the gift document does not refer to shall be allocated to the son, the <i>yoresh mi-de-oraita</i> (inheritor according to Torah law). Should the three children agree to divide any asset or assets differently from the directive of this decision, the children’s wishes will be determinative and override the ruling of this <i>beit din</i>, as well as the wishes expressed in their father’s gift document.
<b>Pursuant to the above</b>
1. All <i>seforim</i> that belonged to R. Simeon Levy are to be divided up equally according to their value among his son and daughters.
2. All <i>seforim</i> belonging to R. Levy that will appear in the future are to be divided up equally according to their value among his son and daughters.
3. All of the silverware items from R Levy’s home shall be distributed equally according to their value among his son and daughters.
4. If any <i>seforim</i> or silver items are missing, and upon submission of evidence it is demonstrated that the possessor is either the plaintiff or one of the defendants, the item will be returned and allocated as per the foregoing. If the item has been sold to a third party, the seller of the item to the third party shall pay the value of the item to the other siblings pursuant to the foregoing.
5. Each son-in-law will receive three pages of the manuscript of <i>Moreh Nevukhim</i>.
6. The cemetery plot shall remain in the possession of Reuven Levy.
7. All the funds in the banks, stocks, and bonds shall be distributed equally, according to their value, between his son and daughters.
8. The proceeds from the sale of the two houses in Staten Island shall be distributed among his son and daughters.
9. As of the date of the issuance of this decision, Mr. Reuven Levy has failed to submit the name(s) and address(es) of the person(s) who posses estate items given by him without the consent of his siblings or this <i>beit din</i>. Accordingly, for <i>bizayon beit ha-din</i> (denigrating a <i>beit din</i>), Mr. Reuven Levy is fined $10,000, with each sibling to receive $5,000 from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding imposing monetary penalties for contempt of <i>beit din</i>, see <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96.

g) A Revocable Living Trust Agreement

<b>G. A Revocable Living Trust Agreement</b><br><b><i>Motel Rabinowitz v. Rochel Mayer</i></b>
On May 13, 2007, Yosef Rabinowitz (“the Settlor”) created a living trust, a legal document intended to ensure that one’s assets are distributed to his beneficiaries according to his wishes upon death. The Settlor chose his son Motel (<i>Tove’a</i>) to manage the trust and designated as the beneficiaries of the trust his children, Rochel Mayer (<i>Nitva’at</i>) and the <i>Tove’a</i>.
On June 11, 2009, the Settlor passed away. Upon his demise, pursuant to the trust agreement, his estate was to be transferred to the beneficiaries, namely the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva’at</i>. Attempting to prevent the transfer of assets to the <i>Nitva’at</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> summoned the <i>Nitva’at</i> to <i>beit din</i>.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that the provision of the trust agreement which provides that his father’s estate be divided up equally between his children is in violation of the halakhic rules of <i>yerushah</i> (inheritance), according to which such assets belong to the son. The <i>Tove’a</i> is the “<i>yoresh me-de-oraita</i>,” the sole Torah heir to his father’s assets, and should the <i>beit din</i> affirm the trust agreement, it will be engaging in “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>,” disinheriting the only heir recognized as such by the Torah. Consequently, the <i>Tove’a</i> should inherit the entire estate.
Since the <i>Nitva’at</i> was firstborn of the family, no claim of <i>bekhorah</i> (right of the firstborn male to a double portion) is advanced by the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b><i>Nitva’at</i>’s Claims</b>
Given that her father divided up the estate equally between his children, we should respect the deceased wishes as a testator and a father (<i>kibbud av</i>, honoring one’s father), and she is therefore entitled to half of the estate.
Moreover, during her father’s lifetime, the <i>Nitva’at</i> claims that her brother, as co-trustee of the estate, diverted $200,000 from the estate and deposited said monies in his personal bank accounts. Consequently, in addition to her share of 50% of the estate currently in the trust, she is seeking recovery of $100,000 of the diverted funds.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Torah’s Order of Inheritance</b>
A person can only dispose of his property during his lifetime; upon his demise, human ownership ceases and halakhic succession law determines who will inherit his estate. This process of inheritance is automatic, as <i>Rabbeinu Gershom</i> notes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>No one benefits man, but rather he automatically receives his ancestor’s inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 141b. Many of the sources for this decision have been culled from Mattisyahu Schwartz, <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah,</i> vol. 1<i>.</i></i></small></span>
Thus, there is no transfer of assets between the testator and his heirs through the implementation of a <i>kinyan</i>, a symbolic act of transfer. As the Talmud states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>There is no <i>shtar</i> (halakhic-legal document) after death.<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 55b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 152a.</i></small></span>
Thus, the late <i>Dayan Yitzhak Grunfeld</i> of London, England writes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>The logical consequence of this is that any money in the hands of a beneficiary of a will under the law of the land which, as far as Jewish religious law is concerned, belongs to a different person, namely, the proper heir in accordance with the Halakhah of inheritance, has to be returned to that heir.<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Dayan Yitzhak Grunfeld, <i>The Jewish Law of Inheritance</i> (New York: 1987), 53–55. For an extensive discussion regarding the halakhic arguments pro and con regarding the efficacy of a civil will, see my “The Propriety of a Civil Will,” <i>Hakirah</i> (forthcoming) and my <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, vol. 2 (forthcoming).</i></small></span>
Pursuant to the Mishnah,<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 88b.</i> upon demise of the deceased, the order of succession is as follows: (1) the sons (2) their descendants (3) the daughters (4) their descendants (5) the father (6) the brothers (7) their descendants (8) the sisters (9) their descendants (10) the grandfather (11) the brothers of the father (12) their descendants (13) the sisters of the father (14) their descendants, etc.
In the context of its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of succession, the Torah concludes by stating that the order is “<i>hukat mishpat</i>” (a statute of judgment). The description of <i>hilkhot yerushah</i> as a “<i>hok</i>” implies, among other things, that these <i>halakhot</i> are immutable, even though they relate to monetary matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 12:9; <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:1; Yisrael Moshe Hazan, <i>Nahalah le-Yisrael</i>, 49.</i> Thus, although Halakhah permits individuals to determine the parameters of their monetary relationships, provided that the arrangement complies with a proper form (<i>kinyan</i>) and does not violate any prohibitions (such as theft or <i>ribbit</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, HM 344:1.</i> <i>hilkhot yerushah</i> is an exception. As <i>Rambam</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>A man cannot cause his estate to descend to someone who is not potentially his heir; nor can he deprive the heir of the inheritance even though this is a monetary matter. For it says … “And it shall be for the children of Israel a statute of judgment” … This means that this statute cannot be altered and no stipulation can affect it.<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:1.</i></small></span>
In other words, stipulating that assets are to be distributed to a non-halakhic heir falls in the category of “<i>matneh al mah she-katuv ba-Torah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b.</i> Such an arrangement is null and void and one is prohibited to execute it.<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:6; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 133b, s.v. <i>mah</i>; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i> 8:37; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 85:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Padua</i> 60; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 336; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:118; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 151; <i>Teshuvot Maharasham</i> 7:12; <i>Teshuvot Zera Avraham</i> 2:110. Cf. others who argue that it is improper to engage in disinheritance; <i>SA</i>, HM 282:1; <i>Sma</i>, HM 282:2.</i> Barring any halakhically-sanctioned arrangement allowing assets of an estate to be distributed to non-Torah heirs, numerous authorities invalidate a testamentary gift document prepared by an attorney and recognized by a civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ramban</i>, <i>Rashba</i>, <i>Rosh</i>, and <i>Ran</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 7:250; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 203; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:158; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shemuel</i> 103; <i>Teshuvot Ziknei Yehuda</i> 27:113; <i>Teshuvot Edut be-Ya’akov</i> 71; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Tzedek</i> 150.</i>
Based upon the foregoing, it would seem that the <i>Tove’a</i>, the Torah heir, is entitled to the entire estate.
<b>2. The Parameters of “<i>Mitzvah le-Kayem Divrei ha-Met</i>”</b>
In the case at hand, a trust was created by the Settlor, namely the father, who entrusted during his lifetime all of his property to the <i>Tove’a</i>, the trustee. The <i>Tove’a</i>, who holds legal title to the property, is obligated to hold and manage the property for the beneficiaries, the <i>Nitva’at</i> and himself. As a trustee, he owes a fiduciary duty to manage the trust in the best interests of the beneficiaries. As provided by the agreement, the Settlor and the trustee may lease, mortgage, or reduce the ownership rights over all or part of the trust property. After the demise of the Settlor, the <i>Tove’a</i> shall distribute the assets of the trust to the beneficiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the trust is revocable; during his lifetime, the Settlor may revoke the trust agreement in whole or in part. In effect, by the creation of this trust, the assets have been transferred out of the Settlor’s probate estate, thereby reducing or eliminating taxation of property later in the hands of the beneficiaries or their estates.
Is the implementation of a revocable living trust permissible, or is it a contravention of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>,” disinheriting a Torah heir? Since the Settlor had a right of revocation of the trust agreement, do we conclude that he retained title to his assets and that transferring these assets to a trustee would therefore remain subject to the Torah order of succession?
The Talmud writes that there is a “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>,” a duty to comply with the wishes of the deceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 14b–15a; <i>Ketuvot</i> 69b–70a.</i> According to <i>Ri ha-Zaken</i> and <i>Ramban</i>, if the testator expressed a clear directive to a <i>shalish</i> (a third-party) that he desires to give an asset to a particular individual upon his death, his wish should be complied with.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a, s.v. <i>de-ka</i>; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5b; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:53; <i>Beit Yosef</i> (in the name of <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Sefer Mesharim</i>, <i>Ra’ah</i>, and <i>Ritva</i>), HM 252; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 7:48:11(4). Some argue that the <i>shalish</i>’s awareness and agreement to be entrusted with these assets suffices, and there is no need for a directive from the testator; see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224(7).<br>These sources as some of the sources found infra in nn. 13–31 are culled from Reuven Ungar, Trusteeship (<i>Ne’amanut</i>), Israel Ministry of Justice [Hebrew] (manuscript on file with author).</i> According to some legists, even in the absence of asset transfer between the testator and the <i>shalish</i> and/or execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of transfer), the verbal commitment constitutes a <i>neder</i> (vow) or is akin to a <i>neder</i>, which serves as the grounds for being obligated to comply with this mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 8a; <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhirah</i> 22:15; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, YD 213:2; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 212:3, 252:3; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 110; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:34.</i> Others argue that the testator’s instructions must be recorded in a <i>shtar</i> (halakhic document) in order to attest to the seriousness of his desire to transfer his assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mateh Yosef</i>, HM 5; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Asher</i>, HM 2:26; <i>Zikhronot Eliyahu</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet Mem</i>, 506. Cf. <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a, s.v. <i>de-ka</i>.</i> If the <i>hashlashah</i> (a directive to entrust assets or an actual deposit with a third party) transpired for safekeeping or any other reason unrelated to estate directives or if the funds were deposited after the issuance of a will, the “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>” is not fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a, s.v. <i>ve-ha</i>; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 6:22; <i>Rema</i>, HM 252:2; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, HM 2:95.</i>
However, the communication of such a directive or the execution of a <i>shtar</i> with a <i>shalish</i> suffices only according to certain authorities. According to <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>, as codified by <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, the actual assets must be deposited with a <i>shalish</i> who will have control over these assets for the express purpose of complying with the wishes of the departed, with clear instructions regarding how these assets must be allocated upon the testator’s demise.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a; <i>SA</i>, HM 252:2.</i> Others contend that absent actual possession of the estate assets, the control of these assets for the purpose of actualizing the testator’s wishes suffices to enable the “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:39; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, vol. 2, HM 95.</i>
These assets are under the <i>shalish</i>’s control; the beneficiaries do not have ownership rights.<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 17. Whether the beneficiaries may refuse to comply with the <i>shalish</i>’s instructions is subject to debate. See <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i> HM 5:11, 14; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 14; <i>Teshuvat Teshurat Shai</i> 447.</i> Thus, should the property remain in the <i>shalish’</i>s possession and the testator subsequently passes away, the assets will be transferred to his designated beneficiaries and are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of the order of Torah succession. Accordingly, there is no violation of the prohibition of “<i>avurei ahsanta.</i>”
Upon establishment of the trust, the scope of this instrument encompasses only assets that were in existence at the time of the trust’s formation. Consequently, assets acquired later or not mentioned in the trust agreement are not governed by the trust. To address these assets, a Settlor may execute a “pour over will,” which will transfer assets into the trust after the Settlor’s demise. However, since Halakhah does recognize any transfer of property after death, such an arrangement is halakhically ineffective. Moreover, Halakhah dictates that in general, assets that are not yet in existence cannot be transferred at the time a disposition is prepared.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 60:6, 209:4.</i> Accordingly, any assets acquired over the years, before the Settlor’s death, will not be transferred into the trust. However, many authorities invoke the “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>” as grounds for justifying the inclusion of future assets into the trust.<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matanah</i> 30; <i>Teshuvot Maharivel</i> 3:43; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, HM 353; <i>Sha’arei Uziel</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 21, 4:6.</i>
<b>3. The Trustee as a <i>Shalish</i></b>
As explained above, a revocable living trust is a legal document intended to ensure that a person’s assets are distributed to his beneficiaries according to his wishes upon his death. In creating a living trust during his lifetime, the Settlor actually transfers ownership to the trust or the trustee and then selects a trustee(s) to manage it, but he retains the right to revoke the trust agreement and he may use the assets and derive profit from them.
Without addressing whether Halakhah recognizes the legal fiction of a trust instrument, the function of the trustee is clearly identical to that of a <i>shalish</i>. Both individuals are duty bound, either halakhically<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">See Mordechai, <i>Bava Batra</i> 592; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 250:2.</i> or legally, to manage the assets for the beneficiaries until the testator’s death. Upon the testator’s demise, the assets are to be transferred to the designated heirs. In both the instances of the <i>hashlashah</i> and that of a trust, the testator and Settlor are authorized to revoke the appointment of the <i>shalish</i> or trustee at any time.<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">See Z. Goldberg, “<i>Yerushot ve-Tzava’ot</i>” [Hebrew], 5 <i>Ha-Yashar ve-ha-Tov</i> (5768), 3, 8.</i> Thus, despite the fact that both agreements are subject to revocation, the net result of the appointment of a <i>shalish</i> or a trustee to manage assets for the benefit of future heirs is that the property under their control will eventually belong to the beneficiaries, rather than reverting to the Torah heirs upon the testator’s death.
In addressing the trust instrument that provides for a Settlor and third party as co-trustees, <i>R. Feivel Cohen</i> rules:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>Although the Torah does not recognize the “<i>gavra</i>” (the legal entity) known as a trust, if there is a co-trustee who can manage the assets for the family, it is equivalent to <i>hashlashah</i> with a third party and enables the fulfillment of the <i>halakhah</i> of “<i>mitzvah le-kayem divrei ha-met</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">R. Feivel Cohen, letter to R. Chaim Jachter (on file with author). In his letter, R. Cohen addresses a case of two trustees, but his conclusion would equally apply to our case of one trustee.</i></small></span>
Setting aside the issue of whether Halakhah recognizes the institution of a trust, the arrangement in the present case fulfills the criteria of <i>hashlashah</i> according to all authorities. According to <i>Ri ha-Zaken</i> and <i>Ramban</i>, the very appointment of a trustee to manage the estate in accordance with the Settlor’s wishes and to transfer his assets to the designated beneficiaries after his death is a sufficient form of <i>hashlashah</i>, even in the absence of clear instructions. Moreover, since the trustee is one of the designated beneficiaries and he has control of the assets, even though the actual assets are not in his hands, <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i> and <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> would agree that there are sufficient grounds to implement the duty to fulfill the deceased’s wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, HM 252:8; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 252:4, 7.</i>
There are far reaching implications of this analysis, as it does not simply offer grounds for viewing a trust arrangement as a mode of <i>hashlashah</i>, but also demonstrates the concept of a split ownership of property. The Mishnah, Talmud, and restatements recognize the possibility that a seller will sell something and retain a portion of it for himself by stipulating a reserve clause (<i>shiur</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6; <i>Bava Batra</i> 5:4; <i>Gittin</i> 48a; <i>Bava Kama</i> 78b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 48a–b, 63a–b; <i>SA</i>, HM 214–216.</i> For example, one can sell a tree while retaining the right to any fruits growing on the tree or one can sell an apartment and retain the right to occupy it. Applying the concept of a reserve clause to a testator’s estate distribution, <i>R. Z. Goldberg</i> explains, is an illustration of transferring “the actual asset today and the fruits after death.” Thus, the testator transfers ownership to the <i>shalish</i> today, yet reserves the right to continue to use those very assets until his death, upon which the recipient owns the fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 20, 8. This understanding of “the actual asset today and the fruits after death” as an expression of <i>shiur</i> is found explicitly in Yerushalmi <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:8.<br>Others argue that this rule is in actuality “a continuing <i>kinyan.</i>” In other words, in the context of inheritance, the <i>kinyan</i> for the fruits commences during the testator’s lifetime and ends after his demise. See <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 136a, s.v. <i>ha-totev</i>. Although “there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death,” since the <i>kinyan</i> commenced during his lifetime, it will be effective; see <i>Teshuvot Havot Binyamin</i> 72:4.<br>Others contend that the fruits are transferred a moment prior to the testator’s death; see <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>Tanina</i> 85, in the name of <i>Beit Meir</i>.</i> In effect, there is a bifurcation of ownership between the testator (and by extension the Settlor), who continues to retain use of the assets, and the <i>shalish</i> (and by extension the trustee), who receives ownership of the assets.
The transfer of ownership to another party – in our case, to the beneficiaries – is contingent upon the fact that the ownership of the seller – in our case the Settlor – manifests itself in his ability to use the asset. As <i>Hazon Ish</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>It is impossible that the giver retain it for himself by only protesting that the recipient refrain from using it.<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, EH 73:4. See also, <i>Teshuvot Hessed le-Avraham</i> (Teomim), HM 37; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 5:216.</i></small></span>
In other words, the seller’s reserve clause cannot simply direct the buyer to refrain from using the item. Rather, the seller (and by extension the Settlor) must retain ownership, which is limited to his right of usage.
However, whereas the ownership of the testator/Settlor is limited to usage, the ownership of the <i>shalish</i>/trustee is not limited to his right of usage for the benefit of the heirs, but rather to his empowerment to transfer the assets to the heirs upon the demise of the testator/Settlor. Given the right of usage of the testator/Settlor, the <i>shalish</i>/trustee is proscribed from selling the asset(s) to a third party.<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 257:1.</i>
The concept of a bifurcation of ownership was examined in the Talmud regarding a father who decided to disinherit his wayward son.<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 48b.</i> Although he disapproved of his son’s repeated acts of thievery and desired to disinherit him, he did not want to infringe upon the inheritance rights of his grandson. Therefore, the father stipulated, “Let my son acquire the property, and should my grandson become a Torah scholar, let him acquire it.” Whether such “acquiring on the condition to convey” is effective was subject to debate. The Talmud resolves that the son could have limited ownership rights, which expressed itself in his acquisition of the estate<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 48b; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 48b.</i> and his empowerment to transfer these assets to the grandson, who would become the owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, YD 223:3.</i> Similarly, the <i>shalish</i>/trustee is duly authorized to transfer assets to the designated heirs upon the death of the testator/Settlor.
The parameters of the ownership of a <i>shalish</i>/trustee were scrutinized in two Israeli Rabbinical Court decisions. In one case, a testator wished to distribute his estate to Torah and philanthropic institutions upon his death. He therefore established a religious trust (<i>hekdesh</i>) and appointed trustees who were authorized to distribute these assets in a discretionary fashion. In the trust agreement, the testator requested that those institutions which had already commenced in building or received a promise from him that he would participate in their construction would receive funding prior to other institutions recorded in his will as potential recipients in the distribution of his estate. After his demise, a <i>yeshiva</i> claimed that the testator had promised to assist them monetarily in the construction of their institution and that it was therefore entitled to receive monies from the estate. The trustees argued that they had a right to benefit from the estate and they were unaware of such a promise; consequently, they were unwilling to distribute funds to the <i>yeshiva</i>.
The parties brought their dispute to the Petach Tikvah Regional Rabbinical Beth Din for resolution. Upon deliberation, the <i>beit din</i> concluded that the trustees were empowered to resolve this matter and they rightfully declined the <i>yeshiva</i>’s request. The <i>yeshiva</i> then appealed to the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem. Writing for the majority, <i>R. Elyashiv</i> observes:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>From the content of the testamentary disposition, from its language and meaning, it is crystal clear that he never intended and had not even contemplated to transfer his assets to the trustees so that they should have full ownership in his assets … He simply wanted to guarantee that the will would be valid and that Torah and <i>hessed</i> institutions would receive their due portion … The extent of their acquisition did not extend beyond “acquiring on the condition to convey,” which is effective.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:240, 243, reprinted in <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:213.</i></small></span>
In the trust agreement, the Settlor of the religious trust stipulated that the estate assets were to be distributed to Torah/<i>hessed</i> institutions that had already embarked on construction or those to whom the Settlor had promised to give funds. Given that a promise was communicated to this <i>yeshiva</i> by the Settlor, the trustees were bereft of authority to use the assets for their own benefit and deny the earmarked funds to the <i>yeshiva</i>. The trustees’ scope of authority is limited to complying with the Settlor’s guidelines regarding the potential candidates for asset distribution, just as the rights of the wayward son mentioned in the Talmud were characterized as “acquiring, on the condition to convey.”
Thus, despite the testator’s right of revocation, the <i>shalish</i>’s limited ownership rights serve as the vehicle for fulfilling the duty of respecting the wishes of the departed, bypassing in a halakhically legitimate fashion the Torah order of <i>yerushah</i>. The existence of a revocable trust instrument providing for a bifurcation in ownership and use serves as a vehicle for implementing the wishes of the departed and allows the <i>Nitva’at</i> to receive a 50% share in her father’s estate, including assets which were acquired by the Settlor after the trust’s formation.
<b>3. The Validation of a Will Based upon <i>Kibbud Av</i></b>
Additionally, the <i>Nitva’at</i> argues that her entitlement is a concrete expression of the fulfillment of the mitzvah of <i>kibbud av</i>. At first glance, it would seem that this argument lacks foundation. As we know, in situations where compliance with a parental desire violates a divine imperative, we affirm the halakhic norm.<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i>, <i>Kedoshim</i> 1:10; <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b; <i>Yevamot</i> 5b.</i> In our situation, it appears that the father’s request to distribute a portion of his estate to the <i>Nitva’at</i> in effect violates the Torah order of succession, which mandates that the entire estate be inherited by the <i>Tove’a</i>.
However, we do not assume that the father intended to bypass the <i>hilkhot yerushah</i>, and compliance with his wishes is therefore a fulfillment of <i>kibbud av</i>. Moreover<i>,</i> as we have noted, as long as the Torah heir receives a portion of the estate, there is no violation of the prohibition of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous decision, n. 4; <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, 478.</i> and there is therefore not contradiction in our case between <i>kibbud av</i> and the Torah requirement.
Nevertheless, one might argue that the mitzvah of <i>kibbud av</i> should be inapplicable in our case. While a child is obligated to support his parents,<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, <i>ha-hodesh</i> 8.</i> he may refrain from such support if he incurs a financial loss as a result.<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 32a; <i>Tosafot</i>, ad loc., s.v. <i>oro</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:56; <i>SA</i>, YD 240:5. Cf. Yerushalmi <i>Pe’ah</i> 1:1, <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7; <i>Sefer ha-Yashar le-Rabbeinu Tam</i> 141; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, YD 240:6.</i> In our scenario, <i>kibbud av</i> would entail financial loss for the son, who would have to share his <i>yerushah</i> with his sister, and he should therefore be exempt from the requirement. <i>R. Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>R. Yair Bachrach</i>, and others indeed note this <i>safek</i> (doubt) regarding whether a testamentary disposition that involves a son’s loss should be affirmed based on <i>kibbud av</i>, but they conclude that compliance with the testator’s wishes is based upon <i>kibbud av</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 214; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 86; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:52, 2:224 (16). And possibly this is R. Akiva Eiger’s position. See <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> 1:68.</i>
This conclusion would equally apply to a secular will.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heshev ha-Ephod</i> 2:106.</i> Despite the various problems posed by validating a civil will – or, for that matter, a halakhic will that has been drafted in a questionable fashion – there are authorities who will validate these documents based upon <i>kibbud av</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:53; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, YD 283; <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 37.</i>
In sum, based upon the execution of a trust agreement and in compliance with <i>kibbud av</i>, we affirm the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s right to receive a 50% share of her father’s estate.
<b>4. The Trustee as a <i>Shomer</i></b>
The <i>Nitva’at</i> contends that the <i>Tove’a</i>, in his capacity as a trustee, misappropriated some of the trust’s assets, and she is therefore entitled to recover half of the absconded assets as her rightful share in the estate, as provided by the terms of the trust agreement. The trustee’s consent to manage the estate’s assets places him in the category of a <i>shomer</i> (bailor). Implicit in this arrangement is that the <i>Tove’a</i> is obligated to guard the assets and that the <i>Tove’a</i> accepts this responsibility.
Some argue, however, that since a trust is a legal fiction, it should be treated like “<i>hekdesh</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron Kirschenbaum, “Legal Person,” in Menachem Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem: 1975), 161.</i> This originally referred to an administrative body that collected animals and money earmarked as donations for the maintenance and the sacrificial service in the Holy Temple. Upon consecration, these assets, which were originally the donor’s, essentially were transferred to God’s ownership. Although the Temple <i>gizbar</i> (treasurer) was charged with managing these assets and representing the Temple’s interests, there was a distinction between ownership and management<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 159–63.</i> (similar to the idea of a modern day corporation).<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Berle and Means were among the first to note this distinguishing characteristic of a corporation. See Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, <i>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</i> (NY: 1967), 2–5.</i> The <i>Mekhilta</i> states:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><small>“When a person gives his friend money or objects to guard” – the verse states “his friend” – his friend, and not <i>hekdesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta</i>, <i>Shemot</i> 22:6; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 57b.</i></small></span>
Bailment only applies to property given to individuals, and <i>hekdesh</i> is therefore not subject to its rules. If a bailment has been donated to <i>hekdesh</i>, the laws of bailment are inapplicable to it. Analogously, the entrustment of assets to a trustee for the benefit of a trust, an independent legal entity, should not be subject to the laws of bailment.
However, in our issue at bar, we are dealing with a revocable trust, and therefore the right of revocation resides with the Settlor. Consequently, even though a trust has been established, there is an identifiable human being, the Settlor, who is the <i>mafkid</i> (bailee). Consequently, the <i>Tove’a</i>, as trustee, is to be construed as a <i>shomer</i>. Moreover, given the fact the <i>Tove’a</i> receives remuneration for his services, whether a trust is subject to the laws of bailment is irrelevant; he is a <i>po’el</i> (a worker), and is therefore accorded the responsibility of a <i>shomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Baruch Kahane, <i>Shomerim</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1998), 1334.</i>
Furthermore, as <i>metzuvim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a.</i> members of a covenant-faith community, we are instructed not only innocent, but also to appear so in the eyes of our fellowmen.<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">See the Mishnah, <i>Shekalim</i> 3:2, which describes the lengths to which one must go to ensure that there is not suspicion that he has stolen from the Temple treasury. For contemporary applications of this Mishnah, see my “Self-Dealing in the Not-for-Profit Board Room: An Inquiry into a Trustee’s Multi-Faceted Halakhic Identity,” 43 <i>Tradition</i> (2010), 7.</i> If this applies to every individual, it certainly applies to a trustee who manages an estate on behalf of beneficiaries. In our case, in which the <i>Tove’a</i> is a potential heir as well, the need to be above suspicion is of paramount significance.<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, HM 2:1, who writes that for this reason, among others, a trustee of a charitable foundation may not sell some of its assets to a relative. Regarding the concern of <i>hashad</i> (suspicion), see also <i>Shabbat</i> 23a–23b; <i>Sefer Yere’im</i>, mitzvah 340; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, mitzvah 349; <i>Teshuvot Hessed Avraham</i>, OH 21; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, OH 2:40, 4:82.</i>
This relationship of trust is not limited to the requirement of transparency, but equally extends to a proscription against any misappropriation of a beneficiary’s asset. As a <i>shomer</i>, the trustee cannot acquire any of the trust assets for himself; should he acquire them, he is a thief.<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, HM 292:1.</i> As a trustee, his limited ownership rights serve as a means to facilitate the management of an estate ensconced in a trust instrument,<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Perishah</i>, HM 267:16.</i> rather than a vehicle toward his self-aggrandizement.
Consequently, due to the <i>Tove’a</i>’s misappropriation of trust funds, the <i>Nitva’at</i> is entitled to receive $100,000 from the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b>Decision</b>
1. The <i>Nitva’at</i> is entitled to receive 50% of the assets of her father’s estate.
2. The <i>Tove’a</i> is hereby obligated to pay the <i>Nitva’at</i> $100,000.
