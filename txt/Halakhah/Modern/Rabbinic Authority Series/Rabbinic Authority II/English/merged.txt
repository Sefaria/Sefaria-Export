Rabbinic Authority II

Preface

The present volume is the second in a series of volumes intended as an introduction to a subject perhaps unfamiliar to many – rabbinic authority in our halakhic sources. The subtitle, “The Vision and the Reality,” points to the themes being addressed in this work.
In addressing the halakhic “vision” of rabbinic authority,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As we know, Halakha distinguishes between the theoretical law, which emerges from an abstract study of the sources of Halakha, and the law that is applied in a particular factual context, i.e., <i>Halakha le-ma’aseh</i>. See Talmud Bavli, <i>Bava Batra</i> 130b and Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Beitza</i> 2:1 (R. Yohanan’s statements).<br>In our presentation of “the vision and the reality of rabbinic authority,” we are dealing with the Halakha that was and continues to be applied to actual factual situations, which is memorialized in <i>sifrei psak</i>, restatements of Halakha, and <i>sifrei teshuvot</i>, responsa. However, whereas the “the reality” portion of our presentation deals with the halakhic-judicial rulings of a <i>beit din</i>, “the vision” section focuses upon the decisions of halakhic authorities.</i> we will focus our attention upon a number of issues that the Torah-observant community has been grappling with during the last fifteen years. How does Halakha envision the professional responsibility of investment brokers vis-à-vis their investors? Is a manager of a “feeder fund” permitted to place money into the hands of a third party?
Given that there are brothers who are contesting in <i>beit din</i> (Jewish court) the right of their sisters to receive a share in the inheritance bequeathed by their father, how does Halakha view the propriety of a civil testamentary disposition? Will the estate be divided up as per the father’s instructions, or will the brothers as the Torah heirs receive the lion’s share of the <i>yerusha</i>, the inheritance?
With the advent of more incidents of spousal abuse and child abuse being perpetrated by members of our community, we address how the institution of <i>beit din</i> may serve to harness its authority and render monetary awards to the victims of abuse. Furthermore, we address whether there are any halakhic grounds for imputing institutional liability for acts of child abuse that occur under their watch.
The final component of my discussion of the “vision” of rabbinic authority is to deal with the role of a <i>to’ein</i>, a rabbinical advocate in the <i>beit din</i> process.
The “reality” of rabbinic authority presented in this volume deals with one type of authority, a <i>beit din</i>, which is an institution whose workings and contributions to “the path of Halakha” is unknown by most segments of our community. One of the primary reasons for communal unfamiliarity with this institution can be traced back to a Mishnaic ruling:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Upon finishing their deliberations, they would bring the litigants back to the courtroom, and the senior member of the panel would state: Mr. X, you are acquitted and Mr. X, you are liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:7</i></span>
In short, the rendering of a <i>beit din</i> decision is limited to identifying the party who is innocent and the party who is responsible. <i>Beit din</i> procedure does not mandate the furnishing of a reason for a <i>beit din</i> judgment. A review of various passages in the Talmud, as well the rulings throughout the ages until this very day, will show a consensus that, generally speaking, a <i>dayan</i> (an arbiter) may issue a <i>psak din</i> (a decision) bereft of any reasoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 84b; <i>Shavuot</i> 30b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM </i>) 19:1.</i> However, prior to a <i>beit din</i>’s rendering of its judgment, should a litigant be concerned that a member of the panel or the entire panel be ignorant of Halakha, and thus concerned that an error may be committed in rendering the <i>psak din</i>, or suspicious that a member of the panel or the entire panel are biased or may have been bribed, in certain instances the panel is obligated to provide a reasoned opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 14; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 14:1, 4; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 25; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:2.</i> The right to request a reasoned opinion is not limited to a situation whereby one is summoned by a standing <i>beit din</i> to appear in front of them to resolve a contentious matter. According to certain authorities,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Yehoshua</i> 1–2. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 12.</i> such a request ought to be equally acceded to by an ad hoc panel known as a <i>zabla</i> (acronym for “<i>zeh boreir lo achad</i>” – “one chooses one”).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the absence of a standing <i>beit din</i> or when dealing with a litigant(s) who does not want to appear in front of a standing <i>beit din</i>, each party chooses one judge (known as a “<i>boreir</i>,” “selected one”) and the two arbiters choose a third, and an ad hoc panel is convened to resolve contentious matters between the parties. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 13:1–2.<br>Should the parties fail to agree on a standing <i>beit din</i> to resolve their differences, they are obligated to appear in front of a <i>zabla</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:3; File no. 199-61 Beit Din Yerushalayim, in the name of Rabbi Y. Elyashiv and Rabbi N. Karelitz. Whether a divorcing wife must accede to her husband’s request to appear at a particular standing <i>beit din</i> to address end-of-marriage issues is subject to debate. See <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 14:4; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:38; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:5. However, the <i>minhag</i> in the NY metropolitan area is that when a couple fails to agree on a standing <i>beit din</i> to resolve their differences, they are obligated to appear in front of a <i>zabla</i>.<br>Cf. other <i>Poskim</i> (rabbinic authorities) who contend that a defendant isn’t obligated to convene a <i>zabla</i>, however he must be prepared to appear in front of a standing <i>beit din</i> that will determine whether there are merits to the plaintiff’s contention that the complexity of the matter requires the convening of a <i>zabla</i>. Upon review, should the standing <i>beit din</i> concur with the plaintiff’s assessment, the defendant must agree to participate in a <i>zabla</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 47; <i>Teshuvot Ben Porat</i> (Engel) 2:10.</i> Today, many litigants are questioning a <i>dayan</i>’s credibility, halakhic expertise, and/or business acumen, and therefore, if at all possible, a reasoned opinion should be forthcoming in order to demonstrate that a <i>dayan</i> is not free to decide a case according to his personal whim, but is constrained by sources of halakhic reasoning and canons of interpretation. As Maharah Ohr Zarua and Havot Yair opine, each and every <i>dayan</i> should furnish the grounds for his decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharah Ohr Zarua</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 165. In fact, given that there is no halakhic duty to provide a reasoned <i>psak din</i>, R. Yehezkel Landau was highly critical of Torah scholars who nullified another <i>beit din</i>’s <i>psak din</i> without having heard the parties’ presentations and without providing reasons for the grounds for their position. See <i>Ohr ha-Yashar</i> 30.</i>
Yet, in contemporary times, due to the fact that halakhic court procedure does not mandate the issuance of a reasoned opinion, it is unsurprising to find that <i>dayanim</i> have generally refrained from giving reasoned judgments. Nevertheless, certain <i>dayanim</i> who serve in the <i>beit din</i> networks of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate and Eretz Hemdah-Gazit located in Eretz Yisrael have submitted reasoned judgments.
For over a decade, I served as a <i>dayan</i> on the Beth Din of America, and I continue to appear on various <i>zabla</i> panels, as well as be a single arbitrator for the Hassidic, Modern Orthodox, Sefardic, and Yeshiva communities in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. A <i>beit din</i>’s role is to address matters of social interaction, including matters of personal status such as <i>giyur</i>, conversion, and grounds for <i>kefiyat get</i>, Jewish divorce coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>beit din</i>, rather than an individual Jew, is required in order to determine whether there are grounds for coercing the giving of a <i>get</i>. See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2b, s.v. “<i>le’ba’i</i>”; <i>Sefer ha-Yeraim</i> 164; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 63; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 3; <i>Meshoveiv Netivot</i> 3; <i>Minhat Hinukh</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 168; <i>Ohr Sameach</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20; <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 4:3; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Ta’am</i> (Heft) 128; <i>Teshuvot Kol Eliyahu</i> (Yisrael), <i>EH</i> 22; <i>Teshuvot Tzmach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), 262 (9); <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>EH</i> 178:20; <i>Teshuvot Be’er Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 10:7; <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Beit ha-Levi</i> (Soloveitchik), end.<br>Cf. some <i>Poskim</i> who rule that one Jew is sufficient to determine whether <i>kefiya</i> is proper. See <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, 3:1; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 2:64; <i>Teshuvot Ma’aseh Hiya</i> cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>EH</i> 134, <i>Haghot Tur</i> 32; <i>Teshuvot Yehuda</i> (Gordin), <i>EH</i> 51:2; <i>Yad Aharon</i> (Alfandri), <i>EH</i> 134:20–21.<br>However, even according to the other <i>Poskim</i> who require a panel of three <i>dayanim</i> in order to coerce a <i>get</i>, if the couple agrees that one <i>dayan</i> should decide whether there are grounds for becoming divorced, such an agreement is valid. See File no. 212396-2, Beit Din Petah Tikva, 29 Iyar 5770.<br>As noted by Rabbi Z. N. Goldberg, all matters of marriage and divorce that relate to <i>issur v’heter</i>, ritual matters such as the validity of a marriage or parenting arrangements, a sole <i>dayan</i> suffices to address the issue. See <i>Lev ha-Mishpat</i>, vol. 1, 149–150.<br>So, for example, under certain prescribed conditions, a marriage may be voided (“<i>bitul kiddushin</i>”) such as a post-marital discovery that the two witnesses who were present at the wedding ceremony were invalid, and therefore, the marriage never occurred. Such a determination may be rendered either by a panel of three <i>dayanim</i> or by a single rabbi.<br>Obviously, if the divorce matter entails addressing certain monetary claims and/or mandates witness interrogation, it requires the convening of a panel of three <i>dayanim.</i> See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 3:1; <i>Perush Ovadiya of Bartenura</i>, <i>Avot</i> 4:8; <i>Teshuvot Yehuda</i>, ibid.; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, ibid.; <i>Lev ha-Mishpat</i>, ibid.<br>Whether the requirement of having a <i>beit din</i> of three <i>dayanim</i> for the actual <i>seder ha-get</i> (execution of the writ of Jewish divorce) is <i>min ha-din</i>, according to black-letter Halakha, or due to <i>minhag</i>, practice due to the stringency of dealing with the <i>hezkat issur</i> (presumptive prohibition) of <i>eishit ish</i> (a married woman), is subject to debate. See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 2:66 and <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>EH</i> 114.</i> In numerous instances, I have rendered reasoned opinions in commercial matters and domestic relations. Labor relations such as employment termination and severance awards, business matters such as partnership dissolution, the validity of <i>minhag hasohrim</i> (commercial practice), civil law, contractual agreements and preliminary agreements, the interpretation of contracts, the principle of indemnity in insurance law, <i>ribbit</i>-related issues such as recovery of economic loss of funds, consequential damages, lease, construction and loan agreements, self-dealing in non-profit organizations, and copyright infringement, have been the subjects under scrutiny in many of these cases. In addressing family matters, I have dealt with the grounds for issuing a divorce judgment, dividing up marital assets upon divorce, spousal support, child support and placement, filial obligations to one’s parents, and <i>yerusha</i> issues such as guidelines for drafting a halakhic will and the validity of a civil will and a trust agreement. The cases and materials found in the cases that have been chosen for this volume cover the range of subjects characteristic of all modern legal systems, namely <i>dinei mamonot</i> (civil matters), public and administrative law, family law, and philosophy of law. Given that Halakha is a religious legal system, the impact of <i>issur ve-heter</i> (ritual law) upon the monetary issues under investigation is equally dealt with in our judgments.
As members of our covenant-faith community, we are obligated to resolve our differences in a <i>beit din</i> rather than engage in transgression by resorting to litigation in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i>, <i>piska</i> 6; <i>Gittin</i> 88b; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:1–3</i> Hence, the parties who appear in a <i>beit din</i> sign a <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement), which empowers the panel of <i>dayanim</i> to resolve a matter in contention according to the norms of Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 18.</i> Assuming the <i>beit din</i> process and its decision comply with the rules of secular arbitration law, the judgment will be enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Uniform Arbitration Act, sec. 1. A <i>dayan</i>’s decision must be enforceable. See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 14b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7b; <i>Ohr ha-Hayyim</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 16:18 in the name of <i>Pesikta</i>; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>HM</i> 1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 3:2. Moreover, as a <i>dayan</i>, it is one’s responsibility not only to render a judgment in accordance with Halakha, but equally to ensure that the decision will be enforceable. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 14b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:18; <i>Perush ha-Gra</i>, <i>Mishlei</i> 31:9; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 177; File no. 921426/6, Netanya Regional Beit Din, June 25, 2015. In other words, if a party refuses to comply with the <i>beit din</i>’s <i>psak din</i> or attempts to vacate the ruling in civil court, it is the panel’s duty to issue a decision that he is in contempt of <i>beit din</i>, as well as invoke any mechanisms such as an “<i>ikul</i>,” an attachment of property of the losing party, which will facilitate the enforcement of the <i>psak din</i>. See <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:17; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:10; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:30; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:34; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:32.<br>In some <i>beit din</i> arbitration agreements, one finds that the parties agree to waive a civil law that prohibits an arbitrator to have a familial tie to one of the parties. Without addressing the legal validity of such an arrangement, how does Halakha view such an agreement? Generally speaking, in the context of financial matters, the operative rule is “an individual may contrary to what is written in the Torah”. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b. Therefore, if the <i>beit din</i> errs regarding a monetary matter, the litigant’s waiver of his right to appeal is valid. Every individual has a right to waive his right to money that he may have been entitled to receive from another person. As such, seemingly such an arrangement ought to be recognized.<br>However, regarding matters of ritual law (<i>issura</i>), parties are proscribed from negotiating such an arrangement. Given that a violation of secular law is an infraction of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> (the law of the kingship is the law), we are dealing with a matter of <i>issura</i>, and therefore parties cannot agree to engage in an <i>issur</i>, and surely a <i>beit din</i> cannot render a decision that is tainted by <i>issur</i> and proceed to convene a hearing in which a litigant has a family relationship to an arbitrator. See <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 28a; <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 212; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 28:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 2:27, 219; <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 28:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 314, <i>EH</i> 139; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i>, 50.<br>Obviously, even if civil law would not disqualify the arbitrator from serving on the case, clearly a <i>dayan</i> is disqualified due to his familial ties to one of the litigants. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 7:12. Nonetheless, if the <i>dayan</i>, the arbitrator, discloses the disqualification to the parties prior to the proceeding and both parties mutually agree to proceed with the <i>din torah</i>, then there are no grounds for appealing the decision due to the relationship. Regarding the validity of a litigant accepting the opposing party’s undue influence relating to the proceeding, see <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 218; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 3:332. Recognizing a party accepting a familial tie between the <i>dayan</i> and the opposing party, see <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 7:15.</i>
In this volume, there are ten presentations that have been inspired by reasoned opinions handed down as a member of a <i>beit din</i> panel. The format of our presentation is to begin by offering a rendition of the facts of the case followed by the claims of the <i>tove’a</i> (plaintiff) and the reply and counterclaims of the <i>nitva</i> (defendant).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Recently, in various places in the US there have been a few <i>battei din</i> in the format of ad hoc panels that have handed down decisions in monetary matters without hearing the defendant’s reply. Such a decision is null and void. See <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 87; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:18.<br>In fact, if one inquires from a rabbi how to deal with a contentious issue dealing with two fellow Jews, it is incumbent upon the rabbi to either hear both sides of the issue from both parties or to render a decision with the caveat “if the facts are as you presented them to me, the decision is …” See <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:5 in the name of <i>Meil Tzedaka</i>. In other words, a rabbi ought to function like a <i>beit din</i> with respect to “hearing the other side” prior to giving a reply to a question posed to him.<br>In particular, such a procedural requirement is important when a <i>beit din</i> must determine whether there are grounds to obligate a <i>get</i>. See <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:181.</i> Subsequently, there is a discussion of the halakhic issues emerging from the parties’ respective claims and counterclaims, followed by a decision rendered by the <i>beit din</i> panel. To preserve the confidentiality of the parties, names have been changed and some facts have been changed and/or deleted.
As we mentioned, accompanying these presentations is an examination of the halakhic identity of an investment broker, the propriety of a civil will, contemporary issues relating to domestic violence, and the role of a rabbinical advocate in the <i>beit din</i> process. Chapters one, three, and four have originally appeared in the pages of <i>Tradition</i> and chapter two has originally appeared in <i>Hakirah</i>. All of these essays appear here in an expanded form.
Hopefully our presentation will educate our community on the parameters and scope of rabbinic authority in general and “shatter the silence” surrounding the institution of <i>beit din</i> in particular. For those who avail themselves of the services of a <i>beit din</i>, it may be a life-defining moment. As such, it behooves our community to understand the institution, to become attuned to the dynamics of its decision making process, and to perform due diligence in deciding in which <i>beit din</i> to pursue one’s matters.<br>A.

Chapter 1; The Multifaceted Halakhic Identity of a Jewish Investment Broker

<b>The Multifaceted Halakhic Identity of a Jewish Investment Broker</b><br>Nearly all investors in the securities markets must avail themselves of the services of brokerage firms. Even sophisticated investors who choose their own investment portfolio usually rely on brokerage services to execute their transactions. Other investors rely on brokers for their professional and (hopefully) informed and competent advice. Given the irrational exuberance that affected many investors in the trading markets in the years prior to the 2008 market meltdown, it behooves us to address, from a halakhic perspective, some of the issues that emerge in a broker-client relationship.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The issue of a broker providing incomplete or false information, such as a misrepresentation of investment earnings, failing to warn a customer of the dangers of the lack of diversification, such as over-concentration in volatile securities, or over-leveraging through margin borrowing, have been addressed in this writer’s “The Investment Advisor: Liabilities and Halachic Identity” (hereafter: The Investment Advisor), 58 <i>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> 107 (Fall 2009), and subsequently have been examined more extensively in this writer’s “The Scope of the Tort of Negligent Misrepresentation in Investment Planning,” 19 <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> 141 (2011), and therefore will not be discussed in this forum. Both essays may be accessed at www.yutorah.org.<br>Additionally, there are other realms of Halakha that impact upon a broker’s identity, namely, <i>hilkhot hit’hayivut</i>, i.e., laws of obligations including, but not limited to, labor relations, surety relations (i.e., <i>arevut</i>), and laws of theft, all of which are beyond the scope of this presentation.</i>
The purpose of this essay is to address whether a Jewish investment broker or a manager who owns partnership interests in a fund, is liable for failing to comply with his Jewish client’s instructions to execute a buy or sell of an investment product.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An investment broker must be distinguished from an investment advisor. An investment advisor furnishes to clients personal, competent, unbiased, ongoing advice regarding the management of his investment portfolio. The Investment Advisors Act of 1940 obligates an advisor to act solely in the best interests of his clients.<br>On the other hand, a broker is engaged in effecting transactions in securities for the accounts of others. A broker is regulated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which mandates “a suitability standard” whereby a broker must always put the client’s interest before the broker’s own and that the investment must be suitable for the client, but, for example, need not necessarily be the least expensive. Based upon New York Stock Exchange Rule 405, brokerage houses must perform due diligence in determining a client’s net worth, income, and investment expectations prior to accepting to service an account. Given that the definition of financial risk is a function of the above factors, in the words of Prof. Aaron Levine, “Rule 405 should be viewed as society’s judgment that risk is an inherent <i>defect</i> of a financial product.” See Aaron Levine, <i>Case Studies in Jewish Business Ethics</i>, (Ktav: New York, 2000), 124.<br>Clearly, discount brokers and online discounters owe no suitability duty when merely serving as “order clerks” executing an unsolicited purchase order to purchase an unrecommended security. However, a discount brokerage would owe a suitability obligation to a customer if it engaged in a pattern of conduct that would constitute a “recommendation.” See Laura Unger, Commissioner, SEC, “On-Line Brokerage: Keeping Apace of Cyberspace” (November 1999).<br>This essay is limited to addressing a broker’s responsibility vis-à-vis his clients.<br>The premise of our presentation is that engaging in a brokerage does not afoul of the strictures of gambling. See <i>Tosafot Ri</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 24b, s.v. “<i>kol</i>”; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:13.</i> For example, if the broker fails to sell a security and the investment declines in value, is the broker liable for the loss? If the broker fails to buy a product he’s been instructed to buy, and the security increases in value, is the broker liable for the loss of anticipated profits? A reply to these questions and others requires us to examine the multifaceted identity of a broker or an investment manager of a fund as a <i>shaliah</i>, i.e., an agent, and as a <i>shomer</i>, i.e., a bailee.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 10:5; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:113; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 185:7; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 185:7; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 306:12; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>HM</i> 19. Obviously, unlike a <i>shomer</i> who returns his bailment upon the expiration of the period of bailment, a broker is not obligated to return the principal investment to his client. The volatility of financial markets presumes that an investor may profit or lose his entire investment or a portion of it. Thus, the analogy of a broker to a <i>shomer</i> is incomplete.<br>For contemporary <i>teshuvot</i> that view a broker through the prism of <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> and <i>shomerim</i>, see Shear Yashuv Cohen, “The Responsibility of Economic Advisors” (Hebrew), 26 <i>Torah She-be’al Peh</i>, 33 (5745); <i>Piskei Din shel Battei ha-Din ha-Rabbaniyim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR)</i> 9:16 (Rabbis Tenna, Nesher, and Horowitz); <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i>, 2:16; <i>Piskei Din mi-Beit Din le-Dinei Mamonot u’le-Birur Yahadut</i> 4:265; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:34. Cf. others who construe a broker’s liability in terms of “<i>adam ha-mazik</i>” rather than a <i>shomer</i>. See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 27b, s.v. “<i>u-Shmuel</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:13; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:53, 3:107; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 179; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i>, <i>HM</i> 27. Our analysis is not limited to a broker who may sell partnership interests in a financial product, but equally applies to an investment manager who sells partnership interests in his fund. In other words, the manager and clients are partners in a fund. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 42b; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:11; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:8 and infra text accompanying nn. 68–79.</i>
A broker may service his clientele with two types of accounts. One type of a brokerage account is non-discretionary, which requires a customer’s authorization prior to the execution of any investment transactions. The duties of a broker handling such an account are more than simply being an “order taker” who competently executes a securities transaction for a client who manages his own investment portfolio. In the absence of any written agreement between the broker and the client, the duties required in handling a non-discretionary account include due diligence in evaluating an investment, the duty to execute an order promptly in accordance with the client’s instructions and best interests, the obligation to refrain from any self-dealing, and the obligation not to misrepresent any fact relating to the trade.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Leib v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc</i>., 461 F. Supp. 951, 952–953 (ED Mich. 1978), <i>affirmed</i>, 647 F.2d 165 (6th Cir. 1981); <i>Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Cheng</i>, 901 F. 2d. 1124, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 1990).<br>Clearly, the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>shelihut</i> and <i>shemira</i> furnish guidelines in defining the broker-client relationship. Nevertheless, given that we are dealing with monetary matters, Halakha allows the parties to determine their own business relationship, provided that the arrangement complies with a proper form, e.g., <i>kinyan</i>, and is not violative of any prohibitions such as theft or the interdict against taking <i>ribbit.</i> See <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur HM</i> 305:4; <i>SA, EH</i> 38:5, <i>SA HM</i> 291:17, 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1. Consequently, if the prospectus or written agreement between the broker and customer varies from the norms of <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> and <i>shemira</i>, the agreement will be valid and binding upon the parties. For example, if an offering memorandum permits a managing partner (without notice to, or the consent of any investor) to delegate investment discretion to money managers and to make investments with other investment entities, requiring the exercise of reasonable care in selecting these managers or entities, subject to the monitoring of their efforts by the managing partner, the managing partner is not responsible for any ensuing losses from the investment. In other words, the agreement between the parties determines liability or not. For an identical conclusion in a recent New York securities case, see J. Ezra Merkin and BDO Seidman Securities Litigation, et al., 08 Civ. 10922 (DAB) (SD NY 2011).<br>Pursuant to most decisors, such an arrangement will exempt the broker from responsibility for any negligent behavior.

For a contemporary application of this ruling to brokers, see <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 25.</i> As such, brokers are not mere “order clerks” mechanically executing buy and sell orders. Nevertheless, the broker’s services are transaction-specific and are limited to a faithful execution of the client’s instructions, rather than offering risk assessments, such as the dangers of the lack of diversification or over-concentration in volatile securities.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly a broker would breach his duty to his client if the broker front-runs an order authorized by the customer by trading in advance of executing the order, perhaps in awaiting its impact on the market.</i> In many instances, account agreements make it explicitly clear that the customer is responsible for his own investments.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Should a customer be unsophisticated with regard to financial matters or exhibit diminished capabilities, such as being a victim of a stroke, the broker is additionally obligated to inform his customer regarding any attendant risks in choosing a particular security.

What happens, however, if the broker abstains from following his client’s instructions to purchase an investment and the product subsequently declines in market value? Is the broker liable to reimburse his client for the ensuing loss of anticipated profits?
Halakha provides that a broker, similar to an agent, should execute an agreement with his client either through oral communication or in writing. As Shulhan Arukh rules, “If one instructs his agent ‘proceed and sell land or chattel for me,’ or ‘acquire for me,’ the agent sells and buys and executes his mission … and one who appoints an agent does not require a <i>kinyan</i> or witnesses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 82:1.</i>
Or as R. Shmuel de Medina observes, “Authorizing an agency via writing is more effective than orally creating one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 46.</i> An agency agreement in writing provides the terms of the agent’s mandate (and by extension, a broker’s performance), as well as the consequences of his failure to perform. In short, the broker has actual authority to engage in trading on behalf of his customer. This agreement serves as the broker’s mandate to serve the best interests of his client and defines the parameters of his mandate.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For a summary overview of agency law in English sources, see Issac Herzog, <i>The Main Institutions of Jewish Law</i>, (Soncino: London, 1967), vol. 2, 141–153; Emanuel Quint, <i>A Restatement of Rabbinic Civil Law</i> (J. Aronson: New Jersey, 1995), vol. 6, 49–80.</i>
Nevertheless, should a broker abstain from executing a transaction, is he liable for any ensuing loss of anticipated profits? The halakhic stance regarding this matter has been recently summarized by Dr. Michael Wygoda, Senior Director of Jewish Law at the Ministry of Justice in Yerushalayim, Israel:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Michael Wygoda, “The Agent who Breaches his Principal’s Trust,” 18. <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 265, 273, 285–286. (2009).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The principal … has no legal claim, but merely a grievance, against an agent who fails to carry out his mandate … however, if the principal sustains a loss because of the agent’s action, he is, in some cases, entitled to claim damages from the agent, and need not make do with expressing a grievance …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Some early authorities hold that, in principle, the preclusion of profits is indeed not grounds for indemnification … Other early authorities, however, maintain that … in principle, prevention of profit does provide grounds for a claim, provided the anticipated profit was certain …</span>
Numerous authorities ascribed to the latter approach and argue that in cases in which the profit is speculative or dependent upon the actions of a third party, there is no recovery for lost profits.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Ra’avya</i>, 957 (Deblitsky edition); <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, 183:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i>, 1:399; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 151; <i>Teshuvot Maharash ha-Levi</i>, <i>EH</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 1:167; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 178<i>.</i></i> Consequently, given our situation, the value of securities is subject to market fluctuation; hence, a broker who fails to execute his mandate to buy or sell a product is exempt from liability for any lost profits.
The above conclusion is corroborated by the dominant interpretation of the following Talmudic passage:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If someone gives money to his friend to go and purchase wine for him during the season while the price was low, but he was negligent and failed to buy it, the law is that he has to pay him with wine according to the low price.</span>
Here, a promise was made, the promisee relied upon the promisor to purchase wine, and the promisee suffered monetary loss. Talmud concludes that the promisor is liable to compensate for the harm incurred. Many opine that the compensation resulting from the promisee’s reliance is due to the fact that the promisor explicitly agreed at the time the agreement was made to reimburse the promisee for the loss resulting from failure to finalize the wine purchase.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 114–115; <i>Teshuvot Maharam</i>, Cremona edition, 103. Furthermore, such an agreement must not run afoul of the strictures of <i>asmakhta</i>, i.e., the lack of firm resolve of the obligator, such as the absence of the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>. See <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 40:4, 61:10. Whether commercial practice may validate an agreement that runs afoul of <i>asmakhta</i> is subject to debate. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:16; <i>PDR</i> 3:131, 139–149, 14:334, 344.<br>Cf. others who contend that preclusion of profit is illustrative of a case of <i>grama</i>, i.e., indirect causation, and one is exempt from acts of <i>grama</i>, or that it is a case of <i>asmakhta</i>, i.e., that the individual who undertook the obligation did not firmly resolve that he would receive the profits and therefore no obligation was ever undertaken. See Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 5:3; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:16.<br>Whether a recovery of lost profits known in legal parlance as an example of consequential damages is a violation of the prohibition of <i>ribbit</i> is beyond the scope of this presentation.</i> Analogously, a written agreement between a broker and his client mandating liability for failure to execute a transaction would be valid. On the other hand, in the absence of such an agreement, any harm suffered from relying upon the promise would be unrecoverable.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">However, there exists the minority opinion of Ra’ah, who argues that one does not require an agreement that provides for recovery of anticipated profits. In lieu of an agreement, by giving money to the agent to execute a wine purchase at an attractive price and hearing the promisor’s words, the promisee relied upon the promisor’s compliance. For further discussion of how to understand this position, see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b, 75b and this writer’s “A Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective,” in Aaron Levine, ed. <i>The Oxford Handbook on Judaism and Economics</i>, (Oxford University Press: NY, 2010), 340, 347–348. Invoking such a position requires that it is certain that there will be an accrual of profit. See <i>Ravya’ah</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 957, which is cited by Mordekhai, <i>Bava Kama</i> 125; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 178; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 22:20. Consequently, in situations in which profit would have clearly accrued and the broker abstained from executing the transaction, he would be liable. See <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 110; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i>, vol. 1, 85; <i>Teshuvot Nahalat Tzvi</i> 292:7; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 50<i>.</i> Cf. R. Hershel Schachter, <i>Ginat Egoz</i>, 51 and <i>Piskei Din me-Beit Din le-Dinei Mamonot u-le-Berur Yahadut</i>, 4: 265, 269, who seem to understand Ra’ah’s position as obligating a broker to pay even in a case that the yielding of profit is uncertain.</i> To state it differently, even though the broker may not have been able to foresee the ensuing loss due to his failure to comply with his client’s instructions, nevertheless by virtue of the fact that a broker is viewed as a <i>shomer</i>, he is responsible for unforeseeable damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 93b; <i>Maharik</i>, infra n. 19; <i>Teshuvot Revid ha-Zahav</i> 42 (5).</i> What happens, however, in a situation in which the broker receives instructions to sell an investment product such as a stock or bond, the broker fails to carry out his client’s instructions, and the customer sustains losses due to the broker’s inaction? At first glance, absent any agreement that states otherwise, given that the damage was only indirect (<i>grama</i>), and the ruling that “one who causes indirect damage is exempt from liability” (“<i>grama be-nezikin patur</i>”),<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 60a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 22b. Alternatively, given that a broker is viewed as a <i>shomer</i> and <i>shaliah</i>, he would be liable for acts of <i>grama</i>. See <i>Teshuvot She’eilat Ya’avetz</i> 1:85; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1: 593; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 140.</i> the broker cannot be considered legally liable for his client’s losses.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">However, there would be a halakhically-moral obligation to furnish compensation. See Mishnah, <i>Bava Kama</i> 6:4. Moreover, according to the Ra’ah’s view (see supra n. 14), he would be liable. And <i>possibly</i>, as suggested by Dr. Wygoda and Hayyim Zafri, this is the basis of R. M. Feinstein’s ruling that a broker who refrains from selling a stock that subsequently depreciates is liable for losses incurred. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 3, Hayyim Zafri and Michael Wygoda, Agency, Section 9, (Hebrew) Ministry of Justice, Yerushalayim, Israel.</i> This conclusion flows from those <i>Poskim</i> who view a broker through the lens of “<i>adam ha-mazik</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 3.</i> As we will demonstrate, however, the broker, as an agent, may nevertheless be deemed halakhically-legally liable by virtue of his status as a <i>shomer sakhar</i>, i.e., bailee who is paid a commission, who is liable for negligence including <i>grama</i>, loss, and theft, and is entrusted with managing the purchase/sale of stocks, bonds, annuities, or mutual funds, which are objects of <i>shemira</i>, i.e., bailment, and therefore subject to <i>hilkhot shemira</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 131; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:142.

Implicit in our presentation is that Halakha recognizes commercial relationships that primarily entail the accumulation of wealth and are governed by the <i>halakhot</i> of entrustment of assets, i.e., bailment, to the broker. For example, the Talmud discusses a partnership arrangement called an “<i>iska.</i>” This arrangement is defined as “<i>palga milveh u-palga pikadon</i>,” half loan and half bailment. The investing partner invests the funds that are required for the business enterprise and plays no role in managing the business, while the managing partner uses the investor’s capital to operate the business. Unless stipulated otherwise, all profits and losses are to be divided equally between the two partners. The investing partner receives the profits from the half designated as a loan and the managing partner receives his profits from the half labeled as a bailment. In effect, the managing partner receives remuneration for his time and effort in managing the bailment.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">As such, according to most decisors, the laws of a paid bailee, i.e., <i>shomer sakhar</i>, govern his relationship to the <i>iska</i>. See <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 177:5; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i>, 1:75.</i> The <i>iska</i> arrangement is an example in which an individual is managing somebody else’s money while being entrusted as a bailee to protect those assets.
In viewing an agent as a bailee who is entrusted with assets within a commercial setting, it is unsurprising to find the following responsum penned by R. Yosef Trani, which addresses our issue of liability for damages incurred by indirect causation. R. Trani deals with an agent who was remunerated and authorized to sell merchandise given to him by the principal, but failed to finalize the sale. Is he liable for its depreciated value? Though in terms of <i>hilkhot nezikin</i>, we are dealing with a case of <i>grama</i>, and we would expect the agent to be exempt from liability. Nevertheless, R. Trani concludes that the agent is liable for damages caused indirectly.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharit</i>, supra n. 14. See supra, n. 3.</i> In effect, the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>shelihut</i> and <i>shomerim</i> trump <i>hilkhot nezikin</i>. R. Trani’s position is endorsed by others.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Divrei Geonim</i> 15:17, 95:32. See supra n. 15.</i>
Seemingly, we may analogize to our case of the broker who fails to fulfill his customer’s mandate. Just as in R. Trani’s case, in which the businessman is liable for failure to sell the merchandise, a broker who fails to act should be liable for any subsequent damages. Implicit in both instances is that an agent who serves equally as a bailee is responsible for the depreciation of the value of the bailment entrusted to him.
Does a <i>shomer</i>’s duty of care (and by extension, a <i>shaliah’s</i> duty) extend to protecting the market value of an asset in his safekeeping, or is it limited to ensuring the physical state of the bailment? The resolution of this issue emerges from a question regarding the prohibition of benefiting from <i>hametz</i> that was in the possession of a Jew over Pesach (<i>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesach</i>). If a Jew deposits <i>hametz</i> with a fellow Jew on the eve of Pesach and the Jewish bailee neglects to sell the <i>hametz</i> to a gentile before the onset of Pesach, will the owner of the <i>hametz</i> be forbidden to derive benefit from it after Pesach?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 13a. See <i>The Investment Advisor</i>, supra n. 1, at 15–16.</i> Is a <i>shomer</i> obligated to prevent the loss of the value of the <i>hametz</i>? Most decisors argue that a <i>shomer</i>’s responsibility is limited to ensuring the preservation of the physical state of the bailment, namely the actual <i>hametz</i>, no different than the Talmudic conclusion regarding the <i>shomer</i>’s duty to prevent the spoilage of fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 38a; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30a, s.v. “<i>le-tzorkho</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 3:18; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>Orah Hayyim</i> (hereafter: <i>OH</i>) 443:4; <i>Mishnah Berura</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 443:16; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:16.

Nevertheless, in situations of potential devaluation of currency or depreciation of documentation such as a lottery ticket, most authorities argue that a <i>shomer</i> is obligated to redeem this currency, lest the owner of the assets incur financial loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 1:112; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 593; <i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham</i> 105; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Rahamim</i>, <i>HM</i> 13. Cf. <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i>, <i>OH</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:185.</i> For example, in case of an agent’s neglect to extend the expiration date of a lottery ticket, R. Ya’akov Emden rules that he should indemnify the principal for the market value of the ticket prior to its expiration date.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’eilat Ya’avetz</i>, supra n. 16.</i> Without having to render an independent authoritative opinion of our own regarding this issue, pursuant to majority rule we may conclude that in cases of imminent document or currency depreciation, a <i>shomer</i> must engage in safekeeping and save the value of his client’s assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Berura</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 443:16.</i>
Similarly, one may argue that a <i>shomer</i> who is aware of a potential loss in the market value of an investment and fails to sell the investment is liable for the loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Given this diversity of halakhic opinion, one contemporary authority concludes that one cannot extract money from a money changer (an agent who equally serves as a bailee) if he fails to exchange the currency prior to an impending devaluation. See <i>Berurei Halakha</i>, vol. 4, 12. In effect, pursuant to this position, one would be unable to file a claim in a <i>beit din</i> against a broker who manages a nondiscretionary account, fails to sell an investment, and generates a loss for his client. It is worth noting that this authority failed to factor into his decision the discussion of currency devaluation discussed in the text accompanying nn. 24–25 and endorsed the majority opinion regarding <i>hametz she-avar alav ha-Pesach</i>. A discussion of this matter may have motivated him to reconsider his ruling.<br>Regarding the issue of whether the declining value of an investment is to be labeled a “<i>hezek she-eino nikkar</i>,” imperceptible damage, see <i>The Investment Advisor</i>, supra n. 1, at 122, n. 53; and Wygoda, supra, n. 10, at 274, n. 25.</i> On the other hand, given that a nondiscretionary account is transaction-specific, once the transaction is executed, absent any agreement to the contrary, the broker has discharged his mandate and therefore <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> and <i>shemira</i> no longer govern his relationship with the client. Should the investment depreciate, the broker is no longer under any halakhically enforceable obligation to avert any of the client’s losses. In other words, such a claim for losses incurred generates no monetary redress and therefore will not be addressed by a <i>beit din</i>.
However, should the broker become aware at some juncture that his former client’s investments are depreciating; he is obligated to sell his former client’s assets. There is a duty based upon the biblical exhortation relating to the restoration of lost property, “And you shall return it to your brother,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 22:1.</i> which directs one to save a fellow Jew’s assets in a situation that there is an clear impending loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 294:6; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, vol. 3, part 3, no. 160; <i>Mishnat Ya’avetz</i> (Zolti), <i>HM</i> 40:2.</i> After the transaction is executed and the broker has discharged his duties as memorialized in the agreement, should the broker become aware that his former client’s investment has declined in value, he may sell it with the former client’s consent, and it is understood that he can charge the client for professional services rendered.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 44; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:313; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, <i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 2:9.</i> Though generally one should restore property free of charge,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 265:1.</i> nevertheless the finder should not incur a financial loss, or even a loss of profit, and therefore he should justifiably be reimbursed for his services rendered.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:1; <i>Shulhan Arukh ha-Rav</i>, <i>Hilkhot Metzia u-Pikadon</i> 33.</i> As noted by Rema, Ketzot ha-Hoshen, and Netivot ha-Mishpat, recovery of a lost object is grounded in the concept of <i>zekhiya</i>, which tells us that “a benefit may be conferred upon a person in his absence, but a burden may not be imposed on anyone unless he is present.” In other words, should the conduct be construed in the eyes of the owner as a <i>hov</i>, i.e., a detriment, an individual must abstain from saving the asset.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 262:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, ad locum. <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 262:3.</i> Consequently, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the client may feel that his former broker’s involvement would be detrimental to his interests, and therefore the broker should abstain from saving his client’s assets.
To avoid any potential problems, such as the client’s reluctance to have his broker execute another transaction or the possibility that another broker will be hired to manage the customer’s account, which would construed as a “<i>hov</i>” to the customer, the provisions of the first broker’s agreement ought to address both the parameters of their business relationship prior to the broker’s finalization of the transaction, as well as his responsibilities after its consummation<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 36. In other words, though a broker may become aware of losses for his former client, nevertheless, unless there is an agreement between the parties regarding the broker’s involvement in the customer’s holdings after the finalization of the transaction, the broker should refrain from taking any action. See <i>Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, supra n. 31.</i> (including his professional fees for services rendered).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 265:1; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 36. Cf. <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 265:1; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum.</i> In the absence of a written agreement, the broker should notify his former client regarding the depreciation and ask him whether he should sell the financial product.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Aveida</i> 7:1, n. 2.</i>
Our conclusion regarding a broker’s ongoing responsibility after a customer’s order has been executed stands in bold contrast to the position of American law, which limits a broker’s duty to the narrow task of warning his client of the risks of certain investments and then consummating the transaction requested, rather than obligating the broker to continue monitoring the account and informing his client should his assets begin to depreciate.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 4 and 6; <i>De Kwiatkowski v.

However, we need to point out that the broker’s duty to inform his client of asset depreciation is a halakhic-moral obligation and therefore cannot be enforced in a <i>beit din</i>. Absent a written agreement to the contrary and given the pragmatic considerations of the broker’s unawareness of the client’s wishes and present management of the portfolio, should the broker refrain from “saving” the value of his client’s assets, he is not liable for any ensuing loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 259:1; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 348:22; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 66:21; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 132; <i>Mishnah Berura</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 443:12. However, should the agreement indicate that, upon becoming aware of the decline of the investment, the broker is obligated to initiate steps to avert a loss, then the halakhic-moral duty of the restoration of lost property is transformed into a halakhic-legal duty, which may be addressed in a <i>beit din</i> setting.</i> In the words of R. Ephraim Navon, “we have not found that he is obligated to pay for recovery of a lost object.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 35.</i>
In short, on the one hand, pursuant to Halakha, similar to American judicial opinion, a broker must warn an owner of a nondiscretionary account about the dangers of risky investment choices. On the other hand, unlike American law, with its tradition of rugged individualism, which inexorably serves as the ideological backdrop for a broker’s circumscribed duties vis-à-vis his client,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Powers v. Francis I. DuPont &amp; Co.</i>, 344 F. Supp. 429 (ED Pa. 1972); <i>Chee v. Marine Midland Bank</i>, No. 88 CIV. 0557, 1881 WL 15301 (ED NY 1991); <i>T-Bill Option Club v. Brown &amp; Co.</i>, No. 92–2737, 1994 US App. LEXIS 11976 (7th Cir. May 23, 1994); Barbara Black and Jill Gross, “Economic Suicide: The Collision of Ethics and Risk in Securities Law,” 64 <i>U. Pittsburgh L. Rev</i>., 483, 484–485 (2002–2003).<br>However, as noted by Prof. Aaron Levine (in a written communication to this author), in the case of a full-service broker who receives a higher fee for his services, there is a requirement that ongoing advice regarding his investment continue to be offered even after the execution of a trade and the nondiscretionary account has been closed. See Black and Gross, op. cit., 499–503. In fact, industry practice suggests that a broker has a duty to monitor a client’s portfolio after a transaction has been completed. See Black and Gross, op. cit., 504–505.</i> Halakha instructs us that it is incumbent upon a broker to intervene on behalf of his former client by warning him of an impending loss from a recent trade.
In sum, if a broker is servicing a nondiscretionary account in a case of anticipated profits, there are no grounds for indemnification. On the other hand, should he fail to execute a client’s instructions to sell an investment, and the client suffers losses, he is liable. However, once a broker’s duties have been discharged and the mandated transaction has been executed, unless the agreement provides otherwise, any subsequent losses due to market fluctuations are beyond the broker’s halakhic responsibility.
What happens, however, if a client directs a broker to execute a transaction, but a few minutes prior to finalizing the buy or sell, circumstances have changed and the broker realizes that executing such a transaction would result in losses to the client? Unable to contact his client regarding the impending loss, does the broker comply with his mandate and finalize the transaction, causing losses to his customer, or does he refrain from fulfilling his mandate in order to protect his client’s interests?
Not only are the parties bound by the express terms of the agreement, an agreement that memorializes the broker’s actual express authority, but certain duties as a <i>shaliach</i> are also implied. Actual implied authority emerges within two contexts. Firstly, the broker must perform the client’s mandate. Nevertheless, the broker must also do what is necessary to achieve the principal’s objectives, even if it is not memorialized in their agreement. Additionally, the agent may not have been explicitly mandated to take a particular action, but if he can infer that he is authorized to do so based upon the principal’s goals, then he is authorized to execute such conduct.
The Talmud argues that an agency relationship is premised upon the fact that an agent “shall act for the benefit of the principal rather than his detriment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 42b; <i>Ketuvot</i> 99b.</i> As such, Shulhan Arukh concludes, “Every principal who appoints an agent implicitly articulates that any detriment resulting from the agent’s performance negates his agency.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 182:3.</i> Consequently, if the principal can demonstrate that the agent’s actions undermine his mandate, the agency relationship is null and void.
The above <i>halakhot</i> of implied agency will apply equally to a broker’s discretionary account and non-discretionary account. Should circumstances arise that were not contemplated when the agreement was negotiated, would the agent be responsible? R. Shmuel Kalai addresses a question regarding a principal who authorized an agent to deliver goods to a particular individual. Upon investigation, the agent discovered that the third party was impoverished and would therefore be unable to pay for the goods. Despite this clear warning signal, the agent delivered the goods to the third party. As anticipated, payment was not forthcoming. R. Kalai rules that the agent had deviated from his mandate by undermining his implied authority to serve the principal’s best interests, and he was therefore liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 52</i>
Addressing a similar scenario, R. Shmuel de Medina argues that by dint of the agent being a <i>shomer</i>, the significance of this warning sign should have propelled the agent to refrain from executing the ­transaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 50.</i> As a <i>shomer</i>, he is obligated to safeguard these goods rather than cause damage to his principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 127. For the differing rationales for the respective positions of the Maharashdam and Mishpetei Shmuel, see Wygoda, supra n. 10 at 272–273, n. 19.</i>
In our scenario, if the parties did not contemplate changed circumstances when the agreement was negotiated, and the execution of a transaction would incur losses for the client, it is incumbent upon the broker to refrain from finalizing the transaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafin</i> 1.</i> For example, if Moody downgrades a firm’s debt to “junk bond” status and this rating is announced prior to the opening of the futures market, it would be incumbent upon a broker to contact his customer to decide how to proceed.
<b>II.</b>
In the absence of any written agreement between the broker and the client, how does Halakha address discretionary accounts for which the broker fails to execute a transaction he was instructed to make and the value of the product subsequently declines? Is the broker liable to reimburse his client for the ensuing loss of anticipated profits?
In contrast to the management of a nondiscretionary account, a broker handling a discretionary account determines whether to buy or sell without any instructions from the client. To execute transactions wisely, the broker must be duly informed of market fluctuations that affect his client’s interests, protect his client’s objectives, and provide ongoing advice regarding the risks entailed in purchasing or selling an investment. In effect, the broker manages the account and is granted power of attorney to engage in securities transactions for the client without his prior approval. Whereas in a nondiscretionary account a broker’s duties are circumscribed on a transaction-by-transaction basis, in a discretionary account, there is an ongoing relationship between the broker and his client wherein the broker is authorized to execute numerous transactions without prior approval. Ongoing due diligence requires that the broker be cognizant of whether a precipitous decline in a security is due to the financial integrity of the company, or, in Prof. Aaron Levine’s words, “the halo effect” of the financial markets. The broker’s understanding of the situation will determine whether he sells or refrains from selling the product. Furthermore, the broker must keep in mind the investor’s goals, i.e., whether his needs are long term or short term.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 1.</i> For example, if his client is relatively young and everything else is equal, a broker may decide that his client’s retirement portfolio should consist of volatile securities. On the other hand, once this client reaches old age, the broker’s responsibility may be to transfer his portfolio to more conservative securities.
In short, similar to our conclusions regarding a nondiscretionary account, in a case of anticipated profits relating to an investment executed by a broker managing a discretionary account, there are no grounds for indemnification. However, should the broker fail to execute a client’s instructions to sell an investment and the client suffers losses, he would be liable. Finally, in a discretionary account, the execution of a transaction is not a sign of the discharge of the broker’s mandate. After the execution of a transaction, the broker has an ongoing duty to provide clients with investment advice and provide risk assessment of their securities. Consequently, should there be red flags that indicate a potential depreciation of an investment, the broker is obligated to prevent any potential losses.
<b>III.</b>
Absent any agreement that provides otherwise, what happens if the investment manager (hereafter: manager) of a nondiscretionary account or discretionary account chooses to appoint another manager to manage the account? Does Halakha recognize the institution of an agent appointing a sub-agent and what are the manager’s responsibilities in this case?
In the absence of a written authorization from the principal, can an agent appoint a sub-agent? Articulating the position of normative Halakha regarding this matter, a contemporary writer states,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Quint, supra n. 9, at 60. Whether the sub-agent becomes the agent of the original principal or the agent of the first agent is subject to debate. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 188:2 and 244:2; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 42:25; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 42:58; <i>Yad ha-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 6:16; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, <i>EH</i> 111.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The agent may appoint a second agent [a sub-agent] to do the assigned task for the principal and the second agent may appoint another sub-agent, and so forth … All this may be done without authority of the principal unless he expressly forbids such further appointments, or unless the acts to be done by the agent are so sophisticated or entail a high degree of trust.</span>
In short, the sub-agent’s authority flows from the authority of the agent, rather than that of the principal. In effect, the agent is appointing an agent for the principal.
Rivash rules that, “throughout the entire Torah, an agent may appoint another agent in cases where there is no insistence on personally appointing one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i>, 228. See Michael Wygoda, Israel’s Law of Agency: Section 16, (Hebrew) Ministry of Justice, Yerushalayim: Israel.</i> Should the agent unilaterally appoint a sub-agent, according to some authorities such an appointment would be valid ex post facto. As Rambam opines,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 9:35. See also <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 141:38. For other opinions that invalidate the sub-agency <i>ex post facto</i>, see <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 141:41.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a husband gave a bill of divorce to his agent and said to him, “only you should deliver it to her,” he should not send it with another, but if he gave it to another agent … then she is divorced.</span>
Clearly, our broker-client relationship provides another illustrative example of a principal’s potential insistence on being selective regarding his agent of choice. Professionals, such as investment managers and brokers, regardless of whether they are managing discretionary accounts or nondiscretionary accounts, have a special relationship of confidence and trust with their clients by virtue of their training and expertise. Elsewhere we discussed how various indicia, such as a broker’s expertise, words of persuasion, and receipt of a professional fee, serve to engender a relationship of trust and reliance between the parties which gives rise to a broker’s duty of care.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, n. 1. Cf. Shimshon Ettinger, <i>Agency in Jewish Law</i> (Hebrew), (Magnes: Yerushalayim: 5769), 215–216, who argues that the requirement of demanding a particular agent rather than allowing the agent to appoint a sub-agent is inapplicable to commercial affairs is baseless. Clearly, the significance of induced-reliance in the broker-client relationship as a factor in a client’s readiness to authorize a sub-agent’s appointment belies the paramount importance of receiving the principal’s consent in a sub-agent’s appointment in monetary matters. See Herzog, supra n. 9, at 150.</i> As such, given the vulnerability, dependency, and substantial disparity in knowledge that may exist between the broker and client, we may assume that the client will insist on personal service and would be reluctant to have his account managed by another broker. Consequently, should an unauthorized transfer be made to another broker or manager, the client may justifiably exclaim, “I do not want my bailment to be in the possession of another!”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 29a. As we have shown, an agent has certain responsibilities as a <i>shomer</i>, and therefore a <i>mafkid</i>’s insistence to appoint a particular agent may be extrapolated from the laws of bailment. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 123:4. However, should such an appointment be executed, it would be valid <i>ex post facto</i>. See supra text accompanying n. 51.</i>
Nonetheless, Talmud instructs us:<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 56b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">What does [the Mishnah] mean when it states, “He gave it over to a shepherd”? It means he transferred it to an apprentice because it is customary for a shepherd to give over his charges to his apprentice to watch.</span>
In other words, the animal owner knew that the shepherd would not guard his animal personally and would entrust it to the safekeeping of another; therefore, the first <i>shomer</i> is exempt from any liability resulting from negligent conduct of the second bailee.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, when one <i>shomer</i> transfers an object to another <i>shomer</i>, the first <i>shomer</i> is liable for theft and loss. See <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>She’elah u-Pikadon</i> 4:1, 6. However, if said transfer transpires with the consent of the <i>mafkid</i>, the second <i>shomer</i> is solely responsible. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:26; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:304; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 40.</i> In other words, everything depends upon the customary practice of the shepherd and the animal owner’s awareness of that practice.
The authorities extend this Talmudic rule to encompass situations in which it is customary for a salesman who holds merchandise to entrust it to another for safekeeping, or for a craftsman who is authorized to repair an item to give it to his worker to perform the work. There is a presumption that the customer is well aware that his asset will be in the hands of another, and therefore we may assume that the client consents to the appointment of the new <i>shomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 338; <i>Teshuvot Maharitatz</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Noam</i>, <i>HM</i> 1.</i> Analogously, in our case, though the client developed a sense of trust and confidence with his manager, and one would expect that the client would insist in benefiting from the broker’s personal service, nevertheless, if the client is aware that the manager usually delegates his responsibilities to others, we assume that the client implicitly agreed to the appointment of the second broker, absent any explicit protest from the customer.
Given that we can infer from the circumstances that the client consents to the appointment of a sub-manager, what are the respective responsibilities of the first manager and the sub-manager? As we explained, the responsibility of a broker or investment manager who sells partnership interests in his own fund is defined both by <i>hilkhot shemira</i> and <i>hilkhot shelihut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 3. Moreover, though according to <i>Shakh</i>, a partnership such as the relationship between a manager and his client is not governed by <i>hilkhot shelihut</i>, and consequently, preempts the client from arguing that “I appointed you for my benefit rather than my detriment,”numerous authorities claim that principal-agent ties do exist. See <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 77:19. Cf. <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 77:9; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, ad locum; <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i> 77:4; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 86:19; <i>Beit Meir</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 86 (end); <i>Teshuvot Beit Shlomo</i>, <i>HM</i> 47; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:28. As such, a partner who deviates from his partnership agreement will be responsible to his partner(s). Such deviation is measured by an assessment of how partners operate in the marketplace, i.e., <i>umdana</i>. See <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i>, ibid. and <i>Maharsham</i>, ibid. However, when the deviation entails negligent conduct, even Shakh would agree with Rema that the partner would be liable. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:10.</i> As such, we are dealing with a situation of <i>shomer she-masar le-shomer</i>, i.e., one bailee who transfers the bailment to another bailee. In our particular case, we are dealing with a <i>shomer sakhar</i> who asks a second person to become a <i>shomer sakhar</i>. Consequently, in the absence of any agreement regarding this transfer, each <i>shomer</i> is liable for negligence, loss, and theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Pikadon ve-She’ela</i> 4:1, 6.</i> In such a situation, the principal has the option to seek redress from either manger who is the bailor. Therefore, should the sub-manager be incapable of paying, the original manager remains liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:41; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 33.</i>
However, in our scenario, in which there exists tacit agreement regarding the transfer of the account management to a second manager, should negligence, loss, or theft of assets transpire under the watch of the second manager, who may the customer proceed against for redress? Numerous <i>Aharonim</i> understand Rambam’s posture as arguing that the sub-agent is in actuality the agent of the principal. Therefore, the first agent disappears from the picture and assumes no responsibility vis-à-vis the entrusted asset.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot She’ela</i> 4:9; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:24; <i>Teshuvot Maharitatz</i> 21. For this rationale of Rambam’s view see <i>Sema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:41. For differing reasons for his posture, see <i>Teshuvot Nivhar Kesef</i>, <i>HM</i> 83; <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 181; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 134; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 217. Kahane, supra n. 25, at 1195.</i> Others have interpreted Rambam’s view (hereafter: the second approach) as claiming that the first agent is exempt from any responsibility provided that he could not foresee that the entrusted asset would have been lost, stolen, or negligently handled. However, if the agent knew of the negligent conduct of the sub-agent and still decided to refrain from intervening, the first agent is still responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 291:24 as understood by <i>PDR</i> 1:186; <i>Dibrot Moshe</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 35. The implicit assumption is that Rambam’s ruling, which deals with a father transferring his bailment to members of his household, equally applies to situations in which it is the customary practice to entrust an asset for bailment to a particular party.</i> For example, if a <i>shomer</i> asks another person who customarily serves as a <i>shomer</i> for the first <i>shomer</i>, and the second <i>shomer</i> misappropriates the object of the <i>shemirah</i> in the first agent’s presence, i.e., <i>shelihut yad</i>, the first agent is to be held responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Oholei Ya’akov</i> 64.</i>
A similar ruling endorsing the second approach was handed down in another case. Yitzhak, the salesman of Avraham, was entrusted to sell one of Avraham’s assets, and Yitzhak sold it to Ya’akov. Prior to purchasing the merchandise, Ya’akov invited Yitzhak and his assistant to dine at his home. While Ya’akov was hosting Yitzhak, the assistant was guarding the merchandise in another room. After some time elapsed, the assistant left the room and dined with the others. Exploiting the absence of the assistant from the other room, Ya’akov took the merchandise and fled without paying for it. Clearly, the theft of the merchandise was due to the combined acts of negligence of Yitzhak and his assistant. On one hand, the assistant’s departure from the room in which the merchandise was being stored was an act of negligence. On the other hand, Yitzhak was negligent by failing to protest when his assistant walked into the dining room without the goods. As such, the bailor, the owner of the asset, may opt to seek redress from either Yitzhak or the assistant,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 20. For a discussion of Alsheikh’s responsum, and <i>Oholei Ya’akov</i>’s responsum supra n. 63, see Kahane, supra n. 25, at 443.</i> and, should the assistant be impoverished, Yitzhak is solely responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:41.</i>
A third approach, subscribed to by Rabbeinu Tam and Rosh, and endorsed by various <i>Aharonim</i>, is that in the event of negligent behavior perpetrated by the sub-agent, the principal may proceed directly against the sub-agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 42b, s.v. “<i>kol ha-mafkid</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 3:23; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:42–43; <i>Levush</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 72:31; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:55.</i> The rationale is that the principal never wanted the sub-agent to be the sole individual responsible for the assets. Had this been the case, the principal would have hired the sub-agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura</i> 4, <i>helek</i> 3, no. 143.</i> Or, one may argue that in actuality, the sub-agent was holding the assets for safekeeping for the benefit of the agent rather than the owner of the assets, and therefore the agent continued to remain in the picture such that if negligence ensued, he could be liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 36a; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 291:8; Kahane, supra n. 25, at p 427–428.</i> Regardless of which rationale serves to explain the aforementioned position, given that the sub-agent acted negligently, he will be liable. Should he be impoverished, the principal may seek redress from the agent.
All of the above three approaches are predicated upon the fact that the responsibility of the agent was defined by <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> and <i>shemira</i>. Moreover, should we be dealing with an agent who is equally a partner with the third party by dint of having the status of a <i>shomer</i>, the parameters of his responsibility will be the same as that of any agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Shutafut</i> 2:3. See infra n. 71.</i>
Similarly, in our situation, assuming that the appointment of a second broker was approved by the client, if subsequent evidence indicates that the first broker failed to avert the loss or dissipation of assets due to the negligent behavior of the second broker, the assignment of liability would be subject to debate. According to the first approach, the second broker alone would still be liable. However, pursuant to the two other views, the initial broker would be responsible. Should the second broker be incapable of paying for the loss, the first broker would indemnify the client. However, should an agreement between the parties provide that the initial broker must monitor the results of the second broker’s servicing of the account, if the second broker is incapable of paying for any incurred losses due to his negligence, the first broker would remain liable.
However, how does Halakha address the case of an investment manager who owns partnership interests in a fund, sells some partnership interests to investors, and, pursuant to his agreement with the investors, directs a second manager to invest these assets in other financial securities? Clearly, the investment manager assumes the responsibilities of a <i>shomer</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:11; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:8.</i> therefore, the investment manager, similar to the initial broker in the aforementioned case, will be liable for any negligence committed by the second manager, should he be unable to pay.
What is the definition of negligence in the above case? Regarding entrusted assets, <i>Rema</i> states, “the assets are to be placed in a guarded place, which is a function of the locale and the times.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:18. See also, <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:20.</i> In other words, the duty of care required of the <i>shomer</i> is dependent upon the prevailing standards of the community for safekeeping such assets. The assumption of the <i>mafkid</i> is that the <i>shomer</i> will guard the entrusted asset according to communal standards.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 134.</i> Moreover, the <i>shomer</i> may treat the object entrusted to him in the same fashion he treats the same object in his own possession, a standard that is higher than the communal standard.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Mezia</i> 8:6; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:14.</i> However, should the <i>shomer</i>’s standard fail to measure up to minimally the communal standard, he will be liable for any negligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 70.</i>
Similarly, in our scenario, a manager or broker is obligated to comply with the standards adopted by the capital markets in servicing investment portfolios.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The scope of responsibility for <i>peshi’a</i>, which is defined by accepted norms of behavior of the marketplace, i.e., <i>nohag mekubal</i>, is not limited to a <i>shomer</i> and equally applies to a broker-qua-<i>shaliah</i>, or manager who is viewed as a both a <i>shaliah</i> and a partner<i>.</i> See <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafin</i> 3; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 46; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, supra n. 69, at 46, n. 9; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:429. For example, an agent cannot be deemed liable if a few are suspicious of the sub-agent’s investment practices. Consequently, if the sub-agent possessed a good reputation and his fraudulent practices were never detected by the SEC, Wall Street, or the like, the agent will be be exempt from liability. The identical conclusion was reached in J. Ezra Merkin and BDO Seidman Securities Litigation, et al., supra n. 4.<br>Due to the ongoing right of a principal to invoke that his mandate “should be for his benefit rather than his detriment,” R. Tenna demurs and argues that a broker or manager is obligated to consider even infrequent instances of potential problems that are not contemplated by most people. See <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 3, at 31–32.</i> Moreover, should industry standards dictate that a manager who earns a higher fee than a discount broker monitor his client’s portfolio while being managed by a second manager, failure to exercise such due diligence in the wake of a customer’s investment depreciation will result in the first manager being held liable.
A broker or manager may opt to protect his client’s assets in the same fashion he treats his own portfolio. However, should his performance be significantly below the prevailing standard, he would be liable for any loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Should his treatment be only marginally below the accepted standard, he would be exempt from liability. See <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 117.<br>Moreover, the manager is obligated to operate according to the agreement with his clients. See supra n. 58. <i>A fortiori</i>, the manager will be liable for any acts of <i>peshi’a</i>. See <i>Beit Meir</i>, supra n. 58; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, supra n. 69.</i> Moreover, if a second manager is managing assets under the assumption that the client acquiesces to his appointment, then according to the second and third approaches we outlined above,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 62–65 and 66–68.</i> the initial manager’s scope of responsibility to avert the negligence of the second manager would be equally defined by industry standards. For example, if the investment community adopted certain standards relating to the overseeing of a second manager’s accounts, then should the first manager turn a blind eye to red flags indicating a depreciation or dissipation of the client’s assets by the second manager, he would be liable if the second broker is unable to repay the client. Adopting the first approach, on the other hand, would exempt the first manager from liability based on <i>hilkhot shelihut</i>. However, should the initial manager have a partnership interest with his former clients, he would remain liable for failing to respond to warning signs of a depreciation or dissipation of their assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, nn. 59, 76, and 77. Despite the absence of a principal-agent relationship, given that the manager has a financial interest in these assets, he remains liable as a partner.

In the last ten years, the financial markets have undergone a boom and bust cycle that has generated a record number of clients’ claims filed at securities arbitration forums, such as the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

Chapter 2; The Propriety of a Civil Will

<b>The Propriety of a Civil Will</b><br>During the last twenty-five years, approximately a dozen different formulations of halakhic wills have been disseminated in our community, each new proposal formulated to address problems with the others; nonetheless, to this very day, many segments of our community continue to utilize a civil will as the vehicle for their estate planning.
As we know, in accordance with secular law and the wishes of a testator, an attorney will draft a last will and testament that will distribute assets to a surviving spouse, son(s), and daughter(s) upon demise of the testator. Given the continued use of a secular will in our community, the purpose of this essay is to examine how halakhic authorities deal with such wills. At the conclusion of our presentation, we raise the practical significance of our <i>limud</i> (study) for our community.
<b>1. The Torah’s Order of Hereditary Succession, the <i>Issur</i> of “<i>Avurei Ahsanta</i>” and “There is No <i>Kinyan</i> after Death”</b>
Inheritance occurs by itself. Upon a person’s demise, human ownership ceases and halakhic succession law determines who will inherit his estate. As Rabbeinu Gershom notes, the heir automatically receives his ancestor’s inheritance without anyone giving it to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 141b.</i> There is no transfer of assets between the testator and his heirs via the implementation of a <i>kinyan</i>, i.e., a symbolic act of transfer such as an exchange of money or the writing of a <i>shtar</i> (a halakhic-legal document). As Talmud states,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 55b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 152a. However, a deceased retains ownership of his estate. For further discussion, see J. David Bleich, “Do the Deceased Enjoy Property Rights?” 47, <i>Tradition</i> 71, 82–88 (2014).</i> and as it is restated in Shulhan Arukh,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 250:9.</i> there is no <i>shtar</i> after death.
The signing of a <i>shtar</i> is an example of a <i>kinyan</i> that may serve as a vehicle to transfer assets, provided that the person is alive. Upon death, the person is incapable of transferring assets, or as the <i>Poskim</i> (rabbinical authorities) state, “there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death.”
In the words of the late Dayan Grunfeld of London, England,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Dayan I. Grunfeld, <i>The Jewish Law of Inheritance</i>, New York: Feldheim, 1987, 53–55.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">… In Jewish law we have the rules … There is no gift after death and … There is no effective document after death … The logical consequence of this is that any money in the hands of a beneficiary of a will under the law of the land, which as far as Jewish religious law is concerned, belongs to a different person, namely, the proper heir in accordance with the Jewish law of inheritance, has to be returned to that heir.</span>
Unlike secular law, which permits a transfer of assets upon death, according to Halakha, the moment of death preempts this possibility. The halakhic system, rather than the effectuation of a <i>kinyan</i>, creates the transfer of an inheritance. Pursuant to the Mishnah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 88b. And a son(s) rather than a daughter(s) inherits his mother’s estate. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 108a, 110b–111a.</i> upon demise of the decedent, i.e., the father, the order of succession is as follows: (1) the sons, (2) their descendants, (3) the daughters, (4) their descendants, (5) the father, (6) the brothers, (7) their descendants, (8) the sisters, (9) their descendants, (10) the grandfather, (11) the brothers of the father, (12) their descendants, (13) the sisters of the father, (14) their descendants, etc.
After presenting the <i>halakhot</i> of succession, the Torah concludes by stating that the order of hereditary succession is “<i>hukat mishpat</i>” (a statute of judgment). The description of <i>hilkhot yerusha</i> as a “<i>hok</i>” implies, among other things, that these <i>halakhot</i>, despite dealing with monetary matters, are immutable.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 12:9; <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:1; <i>Yisrael Moshe Hazan</i>, <i>Nahala le-Yisrael</i>, Vienna, 1851, 49.</i> Generally speaking, Halakha allows individuals to determine their own monetary relationships, provided that the arrangement complies with a proper form, i.e., <i>kinyan</i>, and is not violative of any prohibitions, such as theft or the interdict against taking <i>ribbit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 38:5; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:17; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 305:4; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1.</i> One of the exceptions to this rule is <i>hilkhot yerusha</i>. As Rambam states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nahalot</i> 6:1. See <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>Mahdura Tinyana</i> 83.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A man cannot cause his estate to descend to someone who is not potentially his heir; nor can he deprive the heir of the inheritance even though this is a money matter. For it says … “And it shall be for the children of Israel a statute of judgment” … that means, this statute cannot be altered and no stipulation can affect it.</span>
In other words, stipulating that assets are to be distributed to a non-halakhic heir falls in the category of “<i>matneh al ma shekatuv ba-Torah, tna’o batel</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i>, supra n. 7. Whereas Rambam argues that an estate distribution at variance with Halakha is a violation of “<i>hukat mishpat</i>,” others contend that the execution of such planning presumes that the assets of the testator during his lifetime can be designated as his <i>yerusha</i>. But, in fact, during the testator’s lifetime these are his assets. It is only upon the testator’s demise that Halakha determines that these assets are now designated as <i>yerusha</i>, are no longer in the testator’s possession, and automatically the Torah heirs receive their rightful distribution. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 113b. Alternatively, since the <i>yerusha</i> belongs to the heir only upon the testator’s demise, during his lifetime he cannot execute an arrangement at variance with the Torah order of <i>yerusha</i>. See <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 41a.<br>Though <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 282:1 states that diverting a share of the estate to a non-Torah heir is characterized as a transaction that merely does “not find pleasure in the eyes of scholars,” decisors construe such conduct as a formal <i>issur</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam me-Padua</i> 60; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 336; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:118.<br>Clearly, the <i>issur</i> of disinheritance devolves upon the testator. Should a <i>beit din</i> affirm such a distribution, the <i>beit din</i> is not engaging in any <i>issur</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 78; File no. 592010/1, Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Almoni</i>, June 14, 2010. Cf. infra text accompanying n. 171. Furthermore, there is no <i>issur</i> of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>” (transferring inheritance) to the non-Torah heir who receives a portion of the estate. See <i>Ranah</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Maharil</i> 76; <i>Orhot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>Tzva’ah</i> 15; <i>PDR</i> 22:132, 145.<br>In bold contradistinction to the <i>halakhot</i> of hereditary succession that preclude the possibility of devising a testamentary arrangement which stands in variance to these <i>halakhot</i> labeled as “<i>hukat mishpat</i>,” when dealing with a husband’s inheritance of his wife’s <i>yerusha</i>, according to certain authorities one may factor into consideration the testator’s intent in determining whether the husband will inherit her estate. By dint of matrimony, a husband inherits his wife’s estate. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 111b; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 18a. Consequently, some <i>Poskim</i> argue that if the wife dies and at the time of the demise, the husband intended to divorce her, he does not inherit her estate. The implicit assumption is that a husband’s right to inherit from his wife is predicated upon an ongoing marital relationship of <i>ishut</i>, intimacy. See <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 146b, s.v. “<i>nafla</i>”; <i>Mordekhai</i> in the name of R. Avraham of Regensburg, <i>Bava Batra</i> 612; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 90:5; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, ad locum 19. Cf. <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 9:16; <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 2:4; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 90:23; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 90:17. However, even those who differ with this ruling may agree that if the couple agreed to divorce or if divorce proceedings have commenced prior to the wife’s demise, the husband would not inherit his wife’s estate. See <i>Teshuvot Bah</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> 7:79. Regarding contemporary times, some argue that the husband would inherit his wife’s estate. See <i>Hohkmat Shlomo</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 90:5; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 90:8.</i> and therefore a testator does not have the power to stipulate that a non-Torah heir should inherit him,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:543; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 103; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 110, <i>HM</i> 304; File no. 8820-41-1, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Attorney General</i>, November 23, 2009. Prior to the testator’s demise, whether a Torah heir can waive his right to his share is subject to controversy. See <i>Yad Rama</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 126b; <i>Hidushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 126b; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 50.</i> and it is prohibited to execute such an arrangement.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:6; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 133b, s.v. “<i>ma</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i> 8:37; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 85:3; <i>Maharam me-Padua</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Rema</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Ranah</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 151; <i>Teshuvot Maharasham</i> 7:12; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:29; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, 2:110; <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, Livorno, 1878, 25a.

For further discussion, see infra text accompanying n. 80.</i> Moreover, according to many <i>Poskim</i>, the Torah heirs are entitled to the entire estate and there is an <i>issur</i> to transfer any portion from the Torah heirs to non-Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:37; <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:29, 2, <i>HM</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Ibn Lev</i> 3:31,93; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Teshuvot Yashiv Moshe</i> 2:236.</i> For example, if a father is survived by a son and a daughter, the son, the Torah heir, will inherit his entire estate.
Moreover, should a non-Torah heir retain the assets, it would constitute stealing from the rightful heir.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 160; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 142; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:86; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Asher</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 29; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:15; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 282:1; <i>Dinei Mamanot, vol.</i> 3:208.

<b>2. The Varying Approaches towards Validating a Civil Will</b>
<b>A. Rabbi Schwadron and Rabbi Feinstein’s View</b>
In reply to the contention that transfer of an estate based upon a secular will flies in the face of the recognized rule “there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death,” R. Moshe Feinstein states the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:104. The translation is culled (with certain modifications) from Grunfeld, supra n. 4, at 72.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Although we are dealing here with a gift to be made after the death of the donor, and there is no such thing as a <i>kinyan</i> after death, as the object no longer belongs to the donor and such a gift is therefore not valid in Jewish law, nevertheless according to the law of the land a person can legally transfer money after death or any other object that at that time no longer belongs to him or her … In essence it is clear, according to my humble opinion, that a testament of this kind, the disposition of which will certainly be put into effect by the authorities of the country, does not need a <i>kinyan</i>, as one could not imagine a more effective <i>gemirat da’at</i> than this. Hence, since a <i>kinyan</i> is not necessary, the legal heirs can uphold their right even against those persons who are the proper heirs by Torah law, although there is no such thing in Jewish law as a gift after the death of the donor.</span>
There are two ingredients required in transferring ownership to another individual: effectuating a <i>kinyan</i> and <i>gemirat da’at</i> (i.e., the parties’ firm resolve to undertake this obligation). In other words, one requires a physical act, such as the execution of a <i>shtar</i>, and the intention of the parties to transfer the assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Whether the <i>kinyan</i> is a vehicle for ascertaining that <i>gemirat da’at</i> exists or whether the performance of a <i>kinyan</i> is separate from the requirement of <i>gemirat da’at</i> is subject to debate.</i>
In the absence of a <i>kinyan</i>, can one argue that the intention of the parties suffices to transfer an asset? In reply to this question, R. Shlomo Kluger expounds:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am ve-Da’at</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 269. For others who subscribe to this view, see <i>Hiddushei R. Shimon Yehuda ha-Cohen Shkop</i>, <i>Kinyanim</i> 11; Yehezkel Abramsky, “<i>Monetary Laws</i> (<i>A Definition of Types</i>)” (Hebrew), 9–13.<br>The citation of these authorities should in no manner be construed as their endorsement of a civil will.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The essence of the <i>kinyan</i> of the Torah is to resolve in one’s heart to transfer (an asset), as we learnt that, in consideration of the pleasure of our children marrying each other, each father undertakes certain prenuptial obligations. Therefore this proves that in an instance where we can discern that there is was a firm resolution, one does not require an act of <i>kinyan</i>. And in cases where we require a <i>kinyan</i>, it is because we do not know what he resolved in his heart, and possibly he did not resolve to transfer (an asset) … Every act of <i>kinyan</i> is only in order to ascertain what he resolved in his heart. However, if we know what he resolved and it is being transferred with a full heart (clear intention) we do not mandate an act.</span>
Implicitly following in R. Kluger’s footsteps, R. Feinstein argues “that a testament of this kind, the disposition of which will certainly be put into effect by the authorities of the country, does not need a <i>kinyan</i>, as one could not imagine a more effective <i>gemirat da’at</i> than this.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 16.</i>
In other words, the testator’s execution of a civil will that will be recognized by the civil court corroborates for us that he firmly resolved in his heart to transfer his estate, and consequently a <i>kinyan</i> is not required.
Addressing a will prepared by R. Me’sag that divided up his estate amongst his sons, daughters, and grandchildren, relying upon R. Doniel Tirnai,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, infra n. 31.</i> R. Shalom Schwadron states,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224 (2). See also <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 11. In effect, his view is identical to R. Feinstein’s position. See Yosef Goldberg, “An improperly drafted <i>shtar</i> and at the end a <i>kinyan</i> was executed,” (Hebrew) 1, <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 319, 323 (5754). See also, <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 10:346, 350.<br>According to R. Aharon Lichtenstein, R. Yosef Soloveitchik prepared a civil will. Based upon R. Dr. Dov Frimer’s conversations with Mr. Julius Berman, Esq.,it is R. Frimer’s understanding that R. Soloveitchik endorsed the notion that <i>gemirat da’at</i> could be obtained based upon the testator’s awareness that the provisions of a secular will would be enforced by civil law and therefore no <i>kinyan</i> was necessary.<br>Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:12.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The requirement of a <i>kinyan</i> is to attest to his will and thought, that he resolved in his heart to give with his soul. Wherever there is a presumptive <i>umdana</i> (sound inference/common sense) that demonstrates that he gave with his heart, a <i>kinyan</i> is superfluous.</span>
To claim, in accordance with Rabbis Schwadron and Feinstein, that one can transfer an asset based on <i>gemirat da’at</i> without a <i>kinyan</i> means accepting a well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> that is discussed in various places in the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">(1) <i>Ketuvot</i> 102a–b: “These are the matters that can be acquired via the medium of speech.” See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 102b, s.v. “<i>a’libai</i>.” (2) <i>Bava Batra</i> 142b, acquiring for the benefit of an embryo; See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 210:1.

Cf. R. Tauber who argues that R. Feinstein’s validation of a civil will was a concession issued decades ago when there were very few Torah-observant American Jews who regularly proceeded to civil court for their estate planning. Therefore, R. Tauber concludes that today, when Torah observance has increased expodentially in the American Jewish community, even R. Feinstein would concur that preparing a civil will is improper. See <i>Kesai Mishpat</i>, 113. A review of R. Feinstein’s <i>teshuva</i> does not indicate that the motivation of his ruling stems from the level of religious observance of the American Jewish community. On the contrary, as R. Feinstein states, “And this is an important reason why in this land they rely upon these civil wills … Nonetheless, they unconsciously intended to the truth. If there aren’t prophets, they are the sons of prophets.” Moreover, as we have shown, his ruling is well grounded in halakhic sources and is but one example of his approach in rendering a <i>psak</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, Introduction to <i>OH</i>; <i>YD</i> 1:101 (end).</i>
Nevertheless, many <i>Poskim</i> demur and contend that a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i>, a physical act of transfer, is mandated. For example, Beit Yosef and Rema allow parties to execute an agreement without the prescribed <i>kinyan</i> assuming they use some form of <i>kinyan</i>. For example, both Beit Yosef and Rema will permit <i>metaltelin</i> (chattel) to be transferred with <i>kinyan kesef</i> (an exchange of money), though generally <i>metaltelin</i> cannot be transferred with <i>kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 195; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 195:5. See also, <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 198; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 198:3.</i> In other words, minimally, parties must implement a recognized <i>kinyan</i>, even if it is not the one prescribed for the particular object. Other <i>Poskim</i>, among them Derisha and Shakh, take issue with this position and argue that transfer of ownership requires the prescribed <i>kinyan</i> for the particular matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Derisha</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:3; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 198:10.</i> The consensus is that a recognized <i>kinyan</i> must be used.
Secondly, should a non-Jew adopt Halakha for a particular transaction and purchase with a bona fide <i>kinyan</i> from a Jew, such an agreement would be valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, supra n. 24.</i> Again it is a valid agreement because a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i> was employed.
Moreover, if the recognized forms of <i>kinyan</i> are not effective because of a rabbinic decree, the parties cannot privately stipulate to use these <i>kinyanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 198:5; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum, 10.</i> Finally, for many <i>Poskim</i>, <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a commercial practice of transferring ownership) is based on either <i>minhag</i> (custom)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:268, 3:17, 4:125; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 23.</i> or <i>kinyan halifin</i> (barter),<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Dvar Avraham</i> 1:1, <i>anaf</i> 1.</i> or grounded in <i>kinyan meshikha/hazaka</i> (the act of pulling or possession).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Halakhot im Bi’ur Yad Dovid</i>, <i>Ishut</i> 1, 228–229.</i> In other words, there is a requirement of some “objective” act or at least a mutual understanding that creates the <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the parties.
In short, a civil will is invalid since a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i> is required to transfer an asset and there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death. As such, the view of Rabbis Schwadron and Feinstein is problematic.
<b>B. <i>Maharam of Rothenburg</i>’s View: A Gift in Contemplation of Death</b>
As an alternative possibility, some authorities<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See decisors cited in <i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, <i>OH</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Kapei Aharon</i> 12; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:197; R.

Meir of Rothenberg, who opines,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 254, 602, and <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 591. For our understanding of <i>Maharam</i>, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224 (1) in the name of Rabbi Meaglunza.<br>To avoid a challenge to his verbal instructions, the testator would have to memorialize his wishes into writing. See <i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, supra n. 31, at p. 71a.<br>For the antecedents of this testamentary disposition, see <i>Gittin</i> 66a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 151b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even a healthy person who says “give this person this and that if I die,” this is designated “commanding because of death” and he [the heir] has acquired [the property].</span>
In effect, despite the absence of a <i>kinyan</i>, the assets have been transferred with the verbal instructions of the testator provided that he mentions the day of death. Whereas a <i>matnat shekhiv mera</i> is a bequest communicated by a person on his deathbed, this is a gift of a healthy person prepared in contemplation of death (<i>metzave mahamat mita</i>). In effect, the testator’s instructions create an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> (sound inference which is obvious to all) that he is resolute in giving this gift, and therefore no <i>kinyan</i> is required.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, supra n. 31. Many have adopted his approach. See <i>Kapei Aharon</i>, infra n. 42; <i>Mahara Sasson</i> in the name of <i>Rif</i>, <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Ran</i>, and <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sasson</i> 151<i>.</i> In fact some have rejected his approach. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam me-Padua</i> 53; <i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 257:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 257:7; <i>Teshuvot Har ha-Mor</i> 40; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>YD</i> 203; <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, supra n. 11, at 4–6. Cf. <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, supra n. 11, at 13a, who claims it is a minority view.</i> Hence, a non-Torah heir may be a beneficiary of an estate without the gifting being a violation of halakhic order of <i>yerusha</i>. Though many decisors reject this approach, it may be considered within the context of the doctrine of <i>muhzak</i> and the <i>kim li</i> argument, as we shall demonstrate.
When a dispute is submitted to a <i>beit din</i>, the court has to determine which claimant retains certain assets. In Halakha, there is a concept whereby one of the claimants is considered the one who is in possession of the disputed item (<i>muhzak</i>), while the other claimant wants to “extract” this item and transfer it to himself. In case of a disputed inheritance, the <i>beit din</i> has to ascertain, first of all, who is the <i>muhzak</i>. Which of the two parties – the Torah heirs or the non-Torah heirs – should be considered “in possession” of the inheritance that the other is trying to take away? Seemingly, one could argue that, inasmuch as the Torah grants the inheritance to certain people, <i>ipso facto</i> they are considered as <i>muhzakim</i>. But, as we explained, in accordance with Maharam’s view, the gifting process is not in violation of the Torah order of succession. If so, the two heirs are on equal footing. Consequently, since there is a <i>safek</i> (doubt) whether we follow Maharam’s posture or not, if the non-Torah heir is <i>muhzak</i>, he will prevail.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224; <i>PDR</i> 19:1, 4 (Rabbis Elyashiv, Zolti, and Hadas).</i>
The <i>safek</i> whether we follow Maharam’s posture or not is equally relevant with regard to invoking the claim of <i>kim li</i>. Pursuant to halakhic court procedure, a party in a dispute can argue as follows: “I want the court to rule in my favor, which is based on the position of Rabbi X, who affirms my claim.” Under certain prescribed conditions, we will accept his position even if Rabbi X’s view is in the minority, and the majority rule differently.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hanina Ben Menahem, “Towards a Jurisprudential Analysis of the <i>Kim-li</i> Argument,” (Hebrew) 6–7 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> 45 (5739–5740).</i> Such an argument can be invoked either by a <i>muhzak</i> or by a <i>beit din</i>. Thus, if the non-Torah heir is considered the <i>muhzak</i>, he can request the court to uphold the secular will on the basis of a <i>kim li</i> argument that, “I want the court to rule in accordance with Maharam,” who validates a secular will.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For those who contend that one can advance such a plea when the non-Torah heir is <i>muhzak</i>, see <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 25, <i>Dinei Tefisa</i> 23, and other <i>Aharonim</i> cited in <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> 7, <i>HM</i> 2:6.<br>Others argue that even if the non-Torah heir seizes the assets, one may advance a claim of <i>kim li</i> on his behalf. See <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 25 (end); <i>Yabia Omer</i>, ibid. (end).</i>
Since Maharam may have issued contradictory rulings regarding the effectiveness of <i>metzave mahamat mita</i>, and may have changed his mind regarding its effectiveness as a vehicle to transfer an estate, Maharam’s view possibly may not serve as grounds to recognize a civil will.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For the self-contradictory rulings that limit the Maharam’s <i>psak</i> to instances of the testator dying, see <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 592; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenburg</i>, Berlin ed., 46.<br>For attempts to reconcile these rulings, see <i>Maharam me-Padua</i>, supra n. 33; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 94; <i>Teshuvot Maharil</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sason</i> 151.</i>
<b>C. The Validity of <i>Minhag</i> in Estate Planning</b>
Another approach focuses on whether the existence of a <i>minhag</i> of preparing and executing wills in accordance with secular law ought to be recognized or not. To have binding force, a <i>minhag</i> that is unaccompanied by rabbinic or communal sanction in the form of a legislative enactment<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For the independent status of a custom involving a monetary matter, see <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:10, 218:19, 229:2, 230:10, 232:6; 330:5, 331:12; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 72:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 19–20; <i>Teshuvot Mahara Ashkenazi</i> 33; <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, supra n. 11, at 410–411.</i> must be clear and widespread among the majority of members of the community and must have been practiced at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 79:4; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 475; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 342; <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 10; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1. Given that other authorities require rabbinic endorsement of the <i>minhag</i> (see infra n. 45), some conclude that this issue is a matter of halakhic doubt and therefore one cannot extract money from the <i>muhzak</i>. See <i>Knesset ha-Gedola SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201, <i>Ha-gahot Beit Yosef</i> 4–5. Consequently, if a contested will is being resolved based on the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i>, a <i>beit din</i> ought to broker a <i>peshara</i> (compromise) amongst the parties. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 4:54; <i>Teshuvot Darkhei Noam</i>, <i>HM</i> 35; File no. 288409/5, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v</i>. <i>Plonit</i>, April 10, 2013.</i> There are some eighteenth- and nineteenth-century authorities (some despite various reservations) who have recognized the use of a civil will that employs the language of “giving” rather than “bequeathing” or “inheriting,”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, supra n. 31, at 76b. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Radakh</i> 26:3 who argues that <i>minhag ha-makom</i> is determinative. Though Radakh’s ruling addresses the case of <i>shekhiv mera</i>, R. Shlomo Sha’anan applies it to a testator who prepares a civil will.

See <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:67; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot Rabach</i>, <i>HM</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Aderet Eliyahu</i> (Riki) 23. As such, these <i>teshuvot</i> fail to serve as grounds to validate a secular will today, when the civil law allows individuals to execute estate-planning arrangements based upon Halakha provided that the will is drafted in a legally acceptable fashion. See text infra accompanying n. 101.</i> According to this view, even if the Torah heirs seize the assets from the non-Torah heirs, the assets would have to be returned to the designated heir(s).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Kapei Aharon</i>, 13 (159a).</i> As R. Yehiel Epstein rules, in places where the government is insistent that all legal documents be drafted in accordance with civil law, we must comply with their laws. Therefore, he concludes, documents written in accordance with civil law are valid, and <i>a fortiori</i> if the document is in accordance with the local custom.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 68:6.

Epstein’s ruling in <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:17, this conclusion seems problematic.</i>
Alternatively, others conclude that to validate a civil will on the basis of <i>minhag</i>, it must be a <i>minhag</i> approved by Torah scholars (<i>minhag vatikin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> (Melamed) 2:52 (end); <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 304; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 102; <i>Teshuvot Admat Kodesh</i>, 1, <i>YD</i> 16; <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, supra n. 11, at 25a; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 2:19; <i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, supra n. 31, at 75a; <i>Teshuvot Ramatz</i> 1:92; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 78; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, <i>EH</i> 45 citing many <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to this view. Cf. supra n. 38. For the definition of <i>minhag vatikin</i> as a practice approved by <i>Poskim</i>, see <i>Ohr Zarua</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 280. For a presentation of the diverse views regarding whether the <i>validity</i> of a minhag is contingent upon rabbinic endorsement, see Netanya Beit Din ruling, supra n. 39.</i> According to this view, since there are some <i>Poskim</i> who validate civil wills, distributing assets in accordance with a civil will would be halakhically justified.
Even though there are <i>Poskim</i> who reject the validity of a civil will based upon <i>minhag</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 6:254 cited by <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 26; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:545; <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i> 1:21; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> (<i>Kal’i</i>) 53; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Ribot</i> 174; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 20:71. Accordingly, a <i>minhag</i> that disinherits a <i>bekhor</i> from his double portion will not be determinative. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 281:4; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 281:16.</i> nevertheless neither a <i>kim li</i> plea by the Torah heirs<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 35.<br>In fact, pursuant to <i>Hida</i>, in cases in which there is a clear <i>minhag</i> that distributes estate assets to a daughter based on civil law, one can invoke the <i>kim li</i> argument of those <i>Poskim</i> who endorse the validity of this <i>minhag</i>, such as Rivash and Maharshakh.

In cases in which there is doubt regarding a monetary matter, we cannot extract money from the defendant. Consequently, a defendant (in this case, the non-Torah heir) can argue that there are authorities who agree that the <i>minhag</i> ought to be determinative and therefore the will should be validated. Others would contend that the Torah heir, by dint of the Torah law of <i>yerusha</i>, is the <i>muhzak</i> and therefore retains the estate. As the Talmud instructs us, a Torah heir, by virtue of <i>hilkhot yerusha</i>, does not need to plead his right.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 41a.</i> Consequently, the halakhic doubt concerning whether <i>minhag</i> ought to be determinative is irrelevant. The bottom line is that the Torah heir has possession of the estate.
One suggested justification for legitimating secular wills based on <i>minhag</i> dates back to a <i>teshuva</i> penned by Rivash. The <i>teshuva</i> deals with a fourteenth-century Jewish community composed entirely of <i>mumarim</i> (apostates) residing on the island of Majorca who decided to replace Halakha with the governing civil law. Rivash ruled that their decision was to be understood as a practice adopted by the community and was therefore binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 52.</i> Lest one assume that this ruling is limited to Jewish apostates,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Mishpat ha-Yerusha</i>, supra n. 11.</i> Rivash clearly states that his decision is applicable to any Jewish enclave that decides to have their matters resolved according to secular law.

Doniel Tirani of nineteenth-century Italy and others that such documents will be effective as a <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a transfer recognized by commercial practice).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ikrei ha-Da’at</i>, supra n.31, at 70a, 73b; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224 (30); <i>Erekh Shai</i>, <i>HM</i> 235.</i> To put it differently, just as authorities recognize a modern-day contract as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 23; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:8; <i>Teshuvot Zemech Zedek</i> (Lubavitch), <i>YD</i> 233; <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharshag</i> 3:113; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>PDR</i> 3:363, 4:193, 275; 6:202, 14:43.<br>Implicit in this approach, according to certain <i>Poskim</i>, is that secular law can nullify an individual’s ownership of property, while simultaneously, the execution of the <i>kinyan</i> that is utilized in commercial practice serves to transfer this property to another individual. See <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Kinyanim</i>, 219, note 9 (end).</i> Halakha imparts equal validity to a civil will as another example of a <i>kinyan situmta</i>.
At first glance, invoking <i>kinyan situmta</i> in our situation poses various problems. Firstly, R. Zalman N. Goldberg contends, <i>minhag</i> that is reflective of civil law is not binding. Since obedience to the law entails an element of coercion, and <i>minhag</i> is predicated upon voluntary compliance, a <i>minhag</i> grounded in law is a self-contradiction and therefore unenforceable.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 14:334 (R. Z. N. Goldberg’s opinion); R. Goldberg, 2 <i>ha-Yashar ve-ha-Tov</i> 9 (2006). Subsequent to issuing his <i>psak din</i> and authoring the article, R. Goldberg has emphasized that his position regarding the halakhic ineffectiveness of <i>minhag</i> is limited to matters dealing with commercial modes of undertaking obligations and transferring of assets. See R. Kleinman, “Civil Law in the Nation: <i>Minhag ha-Medina</i>,<i>”</i> (Hebrew), 32 <i>Tehumin</i> 261, 269–271 (5773).</i> As such, since the text of a civil will is drafted and executed according to the norms of secular law, we would deny its validity. Secondly, according to some authorities, notably Bah, one cannot transfer <i>karka</i> (real estate) via a <i>kinyan situmta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 202:1.</i> And pursuant to other opinions, one cannot transfer assets that are not yet in the testator’s possession at the time the testamentary disposition was prepared and signed (<i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6, 209:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 257:7.</i> Should we subscribe to these views, a testator would be unable to earmark real estate for inheritance purposes or authorize distribution of assets that were not in his possession at the time of the drafting of the will.
Yet, there are numerous authorities who recognize a <i>kinyan situmta</i> based on a <i>minhag</i> that reflects civil law,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Yosef</i> (Iggeret) 21; <i>Teshuvot Nediv Lev</i> (Dovid Hazan) 12; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:111; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72, 75; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yisrael</i> 172; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Halva’ah</i> 2:29.</i> even if it entails the transfer of real estate<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:132; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:6; <i>Hiddushei R.

The more vexing issue, however, is that the transfer of assets in accordance with a secular will transpires after the testator’s demise, and a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, like other <i>kinyanim</i>, is effective only during the testator’s lifetime. As we noted, there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death. For this very reason, R. Zalman N. Goldberg and R. Judah Dick, Esq. reject the effectiveness of <i>kinyan situmta</i> for halakhic estate planning.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Goldberg, supra n. 62; Dick, supra n.14.</i>
Others, such as Rabbis Eliyahu Hazan, Yehuda Mesalton, and Messas, as well as a <i>psak</i> attributed to R. Yosef Elyashiv, contend that if there is a <i>minhag</i> to execute a civil will, the distribution will be effective based on <i>kinyan situmta</i> without elucidating the grounds for their conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’alumot Lev</i>, supra n. 42; v<i>e-Zot le-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 42; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i> 1, <i>HM</i> 1; <i>Ma’aseh Beit Din</i> 1: p. 401 (Rabbi Yissachar Hagar in the name of R. Elyashiv); Moshe Toledano, “The Status of a will drafted without a <i>kinyan</i>,” (Hebrew) 5 <i>Kovetz Darkhei Horo’ah</i> 280, 291 (5768).</i>
The grounds for the effectiveness of a civil will as a form of a <i>kinyan situmta</i> can be extrapolated from the position of Rabbeinu Yona of Gerondi, Spain and R. Yeshayahu Blau of Yerushalayim.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aliyot de-Rabbeinu Yona</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 55a, s.v. “<i>vearisa de-parsai</i>,” s.v. “<i>oleh be-yadeinu</i>”; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i> 8, p. 219.</i> According to this position, the transfer of the assets from the testator to the heirs is subdivided into two stages.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">For this explanation, see Shmuel Shilo, <i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i> (Hebrew) Yerushalayim, 1975, 324–326 and Sinai Deutsch, “The Validity of a Will Drawn in a Foreign Court,” (Hebrew) 12 <i>Dine Israel</i> 193, 223–229 (5754–5755).</i> Invoking the view that the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> (the law of the kingship is the law), secular law divests the testator of the ownership of the assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The notion that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is based upon “<i>hefker beit din hefker</i>,” loosely translated as “the right of <i>beit din</i> to expropriate a person’s property,” resonates with others such as <i>Teshuvot Mahariz Enzel</i> 4; <i>Dvar Avraham</i>, supra n. 23.</i> Subsequently, based on <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> (commercial practice) and utilizing a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, the assets are transferred from the testator to the heir. The execution of a <i>kinyan situmta</i> is contingent upon the fact that the testator will pass away, and with his demise the beneficiary(/ies) will acquire the assets of the estate (i.e., <i>kinyan al tenai</i>). In actuality, the <i>kinyan situmta</i> is executed during the testator’s lifetime only to be implemented upon his death.
Alternatively, echoing Rabbis Schwadron and Feinstein’s rationale, Rabbi Toledano states that the customary practice demonstrates the <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the donor, and therefore a custom can substitute for a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Toledano, supra n. 71, at 293, 295.</i> This conclusion ought to equally apply, as R. Toledano claims, to matters of inheritance.
Regardless of which rationale is offered for the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i> relating to a civil will, this approach seemingly undermines the limited scope of the authority of <i>minhag</i>. As we know, the principle of <i>minhag mevatel Halakha</i>, that custom overrides the law, is limited to monetary matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1; Mishnah, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a–b.</i> In other words, a custom can override an existing Halakha in monetary affairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 76.</i> On the other hand, in matters of <i>issura</i> (prohibitions), custom cannot override Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashana</i> 15b.</i> In our instance, though we are dealing with a monetary matter (inheritance), nevertheless, as we explained, <i>hilkhot yerusha</i> are labeled “<i>hukat mishpat</i>” (immutable) and as <i>issur</i> (prohibition) and therefore <i>minhag</i> should be ineffective in overriding the halakhic order of testamentary succession. And in fact, for the aforesaid reason, some authorities explicitly rule that a <i>minhag</i> cannot override the Torah law of succession.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 46.</i>
Nevertheless, according to many authorities, one may distribute assets to non-Torah heirs if a significant share of the estate (fifty percent or twenty percent) is distributed to Torah heirs, or according to others, if even a nominal amount is distributed to Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i> 3, <i>Bava Batra</i> 127; <i>Sefer ha-Ittur</i>, <i>Matnat Shekhiv Mera</i> 59b (p. 118); <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 3:147; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 168; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 49; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 113:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:12 in the name of <i>Rema</i>; <i>Teshuvot Beit Dovid</i>, <i>HM</i> 137; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashash</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 133b, s.v. “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>”; <i>Zerah Emet</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:70; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 92; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 92 (as understood by <i>Taz</i>, <i>EH</i> 113:1) and <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahdura Batra</i>, 1:1 (in the name of <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 92); <i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 21:4, 6; <i>Teshuvot Agudat Eizov</i>, <i>HM</i> 15; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 282:2; <i>Teshuvot R.

Goldberg, 2 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 360, n. 11 (5754). Pursuant to one opinion, as long as some of the same property that is distributed to a non-Torah heir(s) is given to the Torah heir, there is no violation of <i>hilkhot yerusha.</i> See <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 1:70.<br>One exception to the rule is that one cannot withhold a portion of the <i>bekhor</i>’s double share. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Geonim</i>, Harkavi ed. 260; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 281:4. For an exception to this rule, see infra text accompanying nn. 83–85.<br>The fact that the distribution of a portion to a Torah heir and the balance to a non-Torah heir does not contravene an <i>issur</i>, cannot be taken as proof that a distribution based upon a civil will would be recognized by the above authorities.</i> R. Shmuel Wosner of Bnei Brak, Talmud Yerushalmi, Bava Batra 8:6, and the rulings of <i>Rishonim</i> imply that one engages in an <i>issur</i> only if one transfers the entire estate to non-Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Shevet ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 80.</i> R. Dovid Feldman of London, England argues in his treatise on <i>yerusha</i> that the same conclusion may be drawn from the discussion in Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 133b.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzrot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>Nahalot</i> 228.</i> In effect, there is no commission of the <i>issur</i> of <i>avurei ahsanta</i> since a potential Torah heir receives a portion of the estate.
In other words, if there would be a <i>minhag</i> to divest the Torah heirs from benefiting from any portion of the inheritance, then the custom would be null and void, and would require us to redistribute all the assets to the Torah heirs. However, if a portion of the estate is distributed to the Torah heirs and the balance to non-Torah heirs, then the <i>minhag</i> is not tainted by any element of <i>issura</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 52b (the matter of <i>takanat benin dikhrin</i>); Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Ketuvot</i> 9:1; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 52:4 (end).</i> Consequently, if there is a prevailing custom that divests a <i>bekhor</i> (first-born son) entirely from his double portion of inheritance, such a <i>minhag</i> has no validity. However, if he has been disinherited from only a portion of that share, the <i>minhag</i> will be determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yad Rama</i>, supra n. 42; <i>Maharik</i>, supra n. 46; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 281:4 (in the name of <i>Maharik</i>); <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Radvaz</i> supra n. 46. The same is applicable when daughters inherit the entire estate and the son(s) receives nothing. See <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 2:19; <i>Maharit</i>, supra n. 8. Other <i>Poskim</i> mandate that a double portion of the decedent’s estate must be given to a <i>bekhor</i> and a partial distribution of his double portion to others is prohibited<i>.</i> See supra n. 80 (end); <i>Mishpat Hatzava’ah</i>, supra n. 14, at 59. Cf. others who contend that a gift while alive or an obligation may be undertaken to others, which in effect will diminish the <i>bekhor</i>’s double portion. See <i>Kerem Shlomo</i>, <i>HM</i> 282; <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 282.</i> Similarly, if a civil will distributes an estate exclusively to the daughter(s) without distribution to the son(s), such a will is not halakhically effective. But if a Torah heir receives at least a portion of the estate, such an arrangement is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 80.</i>
Even if the basis of the civil will is not grounded in the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i>, one may have to distribute a portion of the estate to the Torah heirs. In other words, if a <i>Posek</i> relies on the positions of Rabbis Meir of Rothenburg, Schwadron, and Feinstein to recognize a civil testamentary disposition, or if the estate has been structured based upon one of the halakhically sanctioned techniques,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 14.</i> according to various <i>Poskim</i>, provisions may have to be made for distribution to the Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Shtaroth le-Rav Hai Gaon</i>, <i>shtar</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 168. However, R. Hai Gaon contends that if one utilizes a technique such as a <i>matnat bari</i> (a gift donated by a healthy person) or a <i>matnat shekhiv mera</i> (a deathbed gift), one need not distribute a portion to a Torah heir. See <i>Sefer ha-Shtarot</i>, op. cit., <i>shtar</i> 8–9 and 12. Cf. <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11.<br>Whether a testator executing a <i>matnat bari</i> must avoid transferring property to a non-Torah heir is subject to debate. See R.

Others contend that validating a secular will based upon a secular legal system contravenes the prohibition for Jews to litigate matters in a secular court. In other words, the prohibition is not limited to litigating one’s affairs in secular courts, but extends to adopting practices that follow secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See infra n. 54.

<b>D. The Scope of <i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i></b>
Under certain prescribed conditions, Halakha is willing to recognize some secular laws based upon the rule “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>,” “the law of the kingship is the law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 28a; <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a–b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 44b–45a. Many of the sources dealing with <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> have been culled from <i>Shilo</i>, supra n. 73.<br></i> Though the rule addresses a kingship governmental structure, nevertheless the rule is applicable to any polity that has been established with the consent of its citizens, has a legislative body,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:612, 637; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:28; Yosef Henkin, “<i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i>,” (Hebrew) 31 <i>Hapardes</i> 3–5; <i>Yehave Da’at</i> 5:63.</i> and enacts legislation that does not discriminate against its citizenry.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gezela ve-Aveida</i> 5:14; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:8; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:158; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 3:968; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 153; <i>Teshuvot Hikekei Lev</i>, <i>HM</i> 6.</i>
Seemingly, a civil will drafted in accordance with the governing laws of a democratic order such as the United States ought to be recognized based upon the following <i>psak</i> of Rema:<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:8.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are some authorities who state that the law of the kingship is the law in regard to taxes and tariffs dealing with immovable items … but other matters not.

In accordance with Rema’s commentary on Tur, something beneficial for a state’s citizenry is any matter that relates to interaction between individuals,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i>, 369.</i> such as the execution of a testamentary disposition even if it is in variance with Halakha.
Though Shakh vigorously opposes incorporating a rule of secular law when it is contrary to Halakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:19.</i> nevertheless, historically, commencing with the time of the <i>Rishonim</i>, the majority of <i>Poskim</i> endorse the position of Rema.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Doveiv Mesharim</i> 1:76.

Although in the past most authorities subscribed to Rema<i>’s</i> view, in contemporary times in Eretz Yisrael and elsewhere, normative Halakha endorses the Shakh’s position.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma’adnei Aretz</i> 18:1; <i>Amud ha-Yemini</i> 1:8; <i>PDR</i> 5:269–270; 8:78, 81. In the most trenchant terms, Israeli <i>Poskim</i> lambast those who argue that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> can serve as grounds for validating a civil will. See Ben Tzion Uziel, “<i>Mishpat Yerushat ha-Banot</i>,” (Hebrew) 9 <i>Talpiyot</i> 27, 44 (5725); Avraham Tzvi Yehuda Kook, “<i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i> Regarding Inheritance,” (Hebrew) 3 <i>Tehumin</i> 231 (5742); Eliezer Waldenburg, “The Proposed Inheritance Law according to Halakha,” (Hebrew), Jubilee Volume to Shimon Federbush, Yerushalayim, 5721, 221; <i>Teshuvot Yehave Da’at</i> 4:65.</i> Moreover, though Rema invokes <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> regarding matters relating to the benefit of the citizenry of a particular country, nevertheless, following in the footsteps of the Shulhan Arukh,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i>, vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 15.</i> Rema opposes applying this rule as grounds for validating a civil will.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:11.</i> Similarly, though R.

Feinstein explicitly rejects the notion that a civil will can be validated based upon that view.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:72.</i>
Furthermore, since American law does not mandate that inheritance matters be resolved in accordance with civil law, there is no reason to invoke <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> as a basis for validating a secular will.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Aliyot de-Rabbeinu Yona</i>, supra n. 72; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:895; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 495 in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 55; <i>Kezot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 104:6; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 104:3; <i>Teshuvot Hukot Hayyim</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh Tzedaka</i>, <i>HM</i> 33:15; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Assad</i> 2:114; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> 3:28; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Likkutim</i>, <i>HM</i> 16.<br>Therefore, if the validity of a will is based upon <i>situmta</i> (see infra text accompanying nn. 109–113) and the governing civil law does not mandate the implementation of a certain <i>kinyan</i> regarding estate disposition, executing a <i>situmta</i> will be ineffective. See <i>PDR</i> 18:207, 240.</i>
Moreover, as Tashbetz and R.

Moshe Benveniste mandated that a daughter return her share in the inheritance to her brother because it was lost property (<i>hashavat aveida</i>), and he records that all scholars of the period rejected the validity of a secular will, based upon <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i> 2:15.</i> In R. Benveniste’s words, “they struck that opinion with a hundred measures against one.” As such, at first glance, one must reject the validity of a secular will based on <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>. Subsequently, addressing a case of inheritance that occurred in 1851 in Ancona, Italy, R. Yisrael Moshe Hazan rails against those who equate the halakhic recognition of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> in estate distribution with the halakhic validity imparted to parties who arrange their monetary affairs in variance with Halakha.

Notwithstanding what we have presented here, without impinging upon the element of <i>issur</i> of <i>hilkhot yerusha</i>, according to contemporary <i>Poskim</i> such as Rabbis Messas and Sha’anan, one can still invoke the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevuot Shemesh</i>, supra n. 57; <i>Sha’anan</i>, supra n. 55. See also, R. Yirmeyahu cited in <i>Pnei Moshe</i>, supra n. 104; <i>Teshuvot Aderet Eliyahu</i> 23.</i> A last will and testament is a document that entails gifting an estate to various individuals. Though its provisions and the terminology employed by the document may not be in conformity with the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>shtar matana</i>, a bona fide document that grants a gift, nevertheless, it is a <i>shtar matana</i> that is valid in the eyes of secular law. The question is whether Halakha recognizes a <i>shtar kinyan</i> (a vehicle to transfer an asset) such as a <i>shtar matana</i> that was prepared in accordance with civil law.
According to the majority of <i>Rishonim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ittur</i>, vol. 1, <i>Ma’amar Shemini</i>, <i>Kiyum Tofsim ve-Hotmim</i>; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 325; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 1:10; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Malveh ve-Loveh</i> 27:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 37; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 203; <i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 92; <i>Hiddushei Nimukei Yosef</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b.</i> and some <i>Aharonim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:545, 6:1183; <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 53.<br>However, clearly <i>Radvaz</i> will reject a will as a <i>shtar matana</i> that reflects the <i>minhag</i> of disinheriting Torah heirs.</i> a <i>shtar matana</i> drafted in accordance with secular law is valid. The majority view of <i>Rishonim</i> notwithstanding, Shulhan Arukh and many <i>Aharonim</i> relied upon the minority view of <i>Rishonim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rif</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 1:410; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Malveh ve-Loveh</i> 27:1</i> to invalidate such a <i>shtar matana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 68:1; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 2:415; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 103; <i>Teshuvot Orah le-Tzadik</i>, <i>HM</i> 1; <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 68:1</i> Rabbis Messas and Sha’anan, relying upon the majority of <i>Rishonim</i> and some <i>Aharonim</i> who validate the <i>shtar</i>, argue that a civil will ought to be recognized. Yet, since a <i>shtar matana</i> is a <i>shtar kinyan</i> and there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death, on what grounds can one legitimate such an estate distribution in accordance with a secular will?
Here again, as we mentioned previously in our presentation, the grounds for maintaining the effectiveness of a civil will as a <i>shtar matana</i> is based upon the position of Rabbeinu Yona and R. Blau, in which the will acts as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>. According to this position, the transfer of the assets from the testator to the heirs is subdivided into two stages. Invoking the view that the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, secular law divests the testator of the ownership of the assets. The assets are subsequently transferred from the testator to the heir as a conditional transfer (<i>kinyan al tenai</i>) that takes effect with the testator’s demise. As we explained previously, the <i>kinyan situmta</i> is executed during the testator’s lifetime, only to be implemented upon his death.
In short, clearly, the need to distribute a portion of the estate to the Torah heirs is not limited to an instance of enforcing a civil will based upon <i>minhag</i> or <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>. As we mentioned earlier, these approaches of Rabbis Rothenburg, Schwadron, and Feinstein are predicated upon the fact that a partial distribution to a Torah heir will suffice to nullify the issue of <i>avurei ahsanta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 80; <i>Sefer ha-Shtarot le-Rav Hai Gaon</i>, <i>shtar</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 168. However, R. Hai Gaon contends that if one utilizes a technique such as a <i>matnat bari</i> (a gift donated by a healthy person) or a <i>matnat shekhiv mera</i> (a deathbed gift) one need not distribute a portion to a Torah heir. See <i>Sefer ha-Shtarot</i>, op. cit., <i>shtar</i> 8–9 and 12; <i>Teshuvot ha-Geonim</i>, supra n. 80. Cf. <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i>, Hildesheimer ed., vol. 2, 511; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11.<br>Whether a testator executing a <i>matnat bari</i> must avoid transferring property to a non-Torah heir is subject to debate. See R. Hai Gaon, ibid.; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 25:3; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 113:1; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, ibid.; <i>Teshuvot Mahane Yehuda</i>, <i>HM</i> 282; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 3:28 (3).</i>
Accordingly, the testator’s preparation of a civil will can be grounded in the <i>pesakim</i> of Maharam of Rothenburg, R. Schwadron, and R. Feinstein, and those <i>Poskim</i> who affirm the <i>minhag</i> and the validity of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>.
In the foregoing (section 2, subsections a–d), we presented the positions of Rabbis Rothenburg, Schwadron, and Feinstein, as well as <i>Poskim</i> who endorse the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i> or <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, which would serve as grounds for drafting a civil will as a means for distributing one’s assets to non-Torah heirs. In fact, R. H. Shlomo Sha’anan, a <i>dayan</i> serving on a Tel Aviv Beit Din, took into account all four approaches in order to validate a civil will.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Sha’anan, supra n. 55; <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 34.</i> It is important to stress that all of these approaches are grounded in a particular halakhic-legal technique that allows for an estate distribution to any individual, regardless of whether the person is a Torah heir or not. In effect, the estate has been effectively transformed from a potential source of inheritance for a Torah heir into an asset that can be acquired by anyone, no different from any article for sale in the marketplace.
As we have discussed, however, others reject these techniques and affirm the Talmudic and Shulhan Arukh rule that “<i>yerusha ein lo hefsek</i>” (the succession of inheritance cannot be interrupted),<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 125b, 129b; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 248:1. See supra n. 15 and infra n. 164.</i> and therefore reject all of these solutions.
<b>E. The Parameters of “<i>Mitzva le-Kayeim Divrei ha-Met</i>”</b>
As we explained, many would argue that the will is ineffective in transferring an estate either because “there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death,”<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying supra nn. 3–4.</i> or because one may not disinherit a Torah heir from his rightful share as dictated by the Torah view of succession. Distributing a partial share to a Torah heir will not obviate the halakhic fact that the Torah view of succession is “<i>hukat mishpat</i>.” According to many <i>Poskim</i>, any distribution of a share to a non-Torah heir entails the contravention of an <i>issur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 336; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:29; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 2:164; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11. Cf. text supra accompanying n. 80.</i> Hence, even <i>be-diavad</i> (<i>ex post facto</i>), one may not rely upon a secular will.
However, according to some <i>Poskim</i>, one can validate a secular will based upon “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>,” the halakhic duty to carry out the wishes of the deceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 14b, 15a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 149a. It is subject to debate whether “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” applies to a testator’s instructions unrelated to property. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:130; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:168; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, Tinyana, <i>EH</i> 45. Additionally, whether “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” applies to an asset that is a <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i> (something which is not yet in existence) or <i>davar she-lo ba lirshuto</i> (something not yet in one’s control) is subject to debate. See <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 3:43; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 212:3, 252:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:39; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 110; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>YD</i> 2:77.</i> Among the <i>Rishonim</i> there are two primary approaches to understanding the conditions in which this <i>mitzva</i> applies. According to some decisors, should the testator state, “Give such and such to Reuven,” such a clear instruction without transferring the actual asset to a <i>shalish</i> (third party) is enough for there to be a “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a, s.v. “<i>ve’od</i>”; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Gittin</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>be-bari</i>”; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>BB</i> 149a, s.v. “<i>deka</i>”; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 252 who cites <i>Rosh</i>, <i>Ritva</i>, and <i>Ra’ah</i>; <i>Teshuvot Rema</i> 48; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252 (8); <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:4, 7; <i>Teshuvot Binyan Tzion ha-Hadashot</i> 2:24.<br>For discussion of <i>Ritva</i>’s view, which is cited in <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 69b, see <i>Kesai Mishpat</i> 112.</i> Others require that the assets be deposited for purposes of eventual estate distribution (<i>hashlasha</i>) with a <i>shalish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>, <i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. “<i>veho</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 15:1; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 1:15; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Ibn Lev</i> 2:39; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 95. Others claim that the deposit with a third party must have been executed prior to the verbal directive. See <i>Mahari Ibn Lev</i>, op. cit.<br></i> Normative Halakha mandates that the assets be deposited with a <i>shalish</i> for the express purpose of carrying out the testator’s wishes, and the will should preferably employ the language of <i>matana</i>, gifting (such as “I give”), rather than language of <i>yerusha</i> (such as “I bequeath”).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 250:23, 252:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 48.<br>Whether one can fulfill the wishes of the deceased by employing <i>yerusha</i> terminology in a testamentary disposition rather than the language of gifting is subject to debate. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 248:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 248:6.<br>Whether “<i>hashlasha</i>” is applicable in regard to real estate is subject to dispute. See the exchange of letters between Helkat Mehokeik and R. Heschel printed at the back of <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i> and cited in <i>Teshuvot Heshev ha-Efod</i>, 2:106. Given that real estate, unlike movable assets, cannot be deposited with a third party, the question is whether control over a given property is sufficient to fulfill the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>hashlasha</i>.</i>
Based upon the foregoing, Maharit contends that a civil will does not conform to the dictates of “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>”:<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharit</i>, supra n. 8.</i> A civil will lacks a clear directive from the testator to the Torah heirs to distribute the assets, which is a precondition for invoking “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:4; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:8; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:10; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i> 1:150.</i> and does not satisfy the requirement of disclosing the provisions for distribution of the estate in the presence of the future heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a, s.v. “<i>be-mai</i>”; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i> 1:150.</i> That, coupled with the fact that an <i>issur</i> is committed by disinheriting a Torah heir,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpatim Yesharim</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rohel</i> 93.</i> renders it impossible for a civil will to be affirmed. Finally, R. Hayyim Ozer Grodzenzky argues that one cannot find support for the idea that a civil will can constitute valid <i>hashlasha</i> (deposit) in this <i>teshuva</i> of Maharit since this <i>teshuva</i> addresses charity bequests,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:34, 4:66.</i> and his ruling therefore may not necessarily extend to private testamentary dispositions.
In one of his rulings, R. Grodzensky writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 4:66.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I have always doubted the propriety of the wills executed in civil courts since there is no <i>shtar</i> after death, yet a Jewish court will affirm their provisions.</span>
As such, though his decision addressed matters of charitable bequests, clearly his ruling regarding the invocation of “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” applies equally to the conventional last will and testament. Contemporary decisors understood Rabbi Grodzensky’s <i>psak</i> in a similar fashion.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heshev ha-Ephod</i> 2:106, 3:25; <i>Teshuvot Netzah Yisrael</i> 20; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Yerusha</i>, pp. 145–146; <i>Mishpatei Tishmaru</i>, supra n. 89; <i>Kuntres me-Dor le-Dor</i>, supra n. 14, at 2; <i>Mishpat Shlomo</i>, supra n. 55.</i>
To buttress his aforementioned position, R. Grodzensky found precedent in a <i>teshuva</i> of R. Ya’akov Ettlinger dealing with a secular will.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Binyan Tzion</i>, supra n. 120.</i> The facts posed to R. Ettlinger were the following: A healthy individual prepared a testamentary disposition in accordance with civil law, wherein upon his demise, his estate would be distributed among Torah and non-Torah heirs. Since the estate arrangement failed to comply with Halakha, the non-Torah heirs inquired of R. Ettlinger whether this civil will would be halakhically valid. Since the assets were in the hands of the beneficiaries in accordance with secular law, these individuals were <i>muhzakim</i> in these assets. Lest one argue that the assets must be deposited with a third party prior to invoking “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>,” R. Ettlinger argued that since the testator communicated explicit instructions to transfer these assets upon his demise,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying supra n. 130.</i> this suffices to comply with the <i>mitzva</i>. The fact that executors were appointed to ensure that his wishes would be fulfilled, and that the will would be enforced by secular authorities, suffices to comply with the dictates of “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban</i>, supra n. 120; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 54 in the name of <i>Ra’ah</i>; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 48 in the name of <i>Rambam</i>.<br>The existence of an executor of a will creates <i>hashlasha</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Heshev ha-Ephod</i> (in the name of <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>) 3:25.</i>
Relying upon R. Ettlinger’s argumentation, R. Grodzensky posits,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:34. Here again, R. Grodzensky’s argument demonstrates that his decision is not limited to cases of <i>tzedaka</i>. Though in this <i>teshuva</i> he does not definitively resolve that executing a civil will is valid, elsewhere he validates it. See <i>Kovetz Iggerot</i> 25.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For some time, I have inclined to the view that the beneficiary in a will executed in accordance with the law of the land is to be considered as a <i>muhzak</i>, since the testamentary disposition will be carried out in accordance with the law of the land, and as such we do not need the halakhic requirement of a deposit for the purpose of estate distribution. However, I have not found a source (“<i>gilluyei</i>”) for this Halakha.</span>
In effect, the preparation and execution of a civil will and its subsequent enforcement by civil authorities is tantamount to depositing the assets with a third party for the express purpose of future estate distribution, i.e., <i>hashlasha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying supra n. 133.</i> His position has been endorsed by some <i>Poskim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Binyan Tzion</i>, supra n. 120; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 1:853; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shai</i> 75. <i>Minhat Shai</i> argues that both <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 13, and <i>Radvaz</i>, supra n. 42, agree with his position.</i>
A similar approach has been espoused by R. Shmuel Shor, who recognizes that <i>hashlasha</i> applies only when one gives a gift to a stranger. However, when one gives a gift to his daughter, and she is considered <i>muhzeket</i> according to civil law, a deposit is not required and therefore such a testamentary disposition is therefore valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Minhat Shai</i>, supra n. 135.</i>
Arguing somewhat differently from Rabbis Shor and Grodzensky, R. Henoch Padwa writes that the initiation of the executor’s action to probate the will is to be viewed as a type of <i>hashlasha</i> and therefore, the condition for “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” at this juncture has been fulfilled. In other words, the preparation of a testamentary disposition in accordance with secular law and its enforceability by the court are insufficient to establish <i>hashlasha</i>. One requires the probating of the will by the executor.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Heshev ha-Ephod</i>, supra n. 129. See also, <i>PDR</i> 17:175, 278.</i> On the other hand, implicit in their approach is that <i>hashlasha</i> suffices and there exists no requirement that the testator communicate instructions to the Torah heirs regarding the estate distribution.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. supra text accompanying n. 124.</i>
The ramifications of Rabbis Grodzensky, Shor, and Padwa’s view that the preparation of a civil will and/or probating it is a form of <i>hashlasha</i> and therefore serves to ascertain <i>gemirat da’at</i>, would be applicable to all segments of our Orthodox Jewish community. Many Jews who identify and affiliate with religious institutions in our Orthodox Jewish community execute such testamentary dispositions. Although many different documents have been suggested as complying with halakhic estate planning, and there are attorneys with the expertise and experience to address the observant Jewish community’s concerns in drafting a halakhic will which will be in legal compliance, it is not unusual to find, amongst families across the Orthodox spectrum, numerous testamentary instructions which continue to be prepared in accordance with civil law. And in fact, many contested <i>yerusha</i> matters addressed in <i>beit din</i> today deal with civil wills executed by members of all segments of our community.
However, R. Yosef Elyashiv seemingly invalidates such testamentary dispositions. He argues in a written <i>teshuva</i> that R. Grodzensky’s view that the preparation and enforcement of a civil will is a form of <i>hashlasha</i> is applicable only to secular Jews who do not exhibit “a deficiency in their <i>gemirat da’at.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kovetz ha-Teshuvot</i> 3:225.</i> To put it differently, since secular Jews do not comply with Halakha, they firmly intend to have their civil wills probated in secular court. On the other hand, an observant Jew’s allegiance is to Halakha, and should he prepare a civil will, he has no firm commitment to have the document probated civilly. The <i>gemirat da’at</i> of an observant Jew is to follow Halakha, and since in R. Elyashiv’s view a civil will cannot be validated for observant Jews either <i>le-khathila</i> or <i>be-diavad</i>, a testator’s <i>gemirat da’at</i> is recognized only if his estate planning is halakhically compliant. A similar view is espoused by Meishiv be-Halakha, a Torah publication of Machon Lehoro’ah, a <i>beit din</i> in Monsey, New York.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meishiv be-Halakha</i> 211, n. 288</i>
However, as noted by R. Schwartz, R. Elyashiv’s line of reasoning should apply equally to any observant Jew who files a civil divorce, trusting that his testamentary disposition will be executed in accordance with his wishes upon his demise.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, vol. 2, 309. In fact, R. Pinchus Rabinowitz, an expert in <i>yerusha</i> matters and a <i>dayan</i> in Monsey, NY who for years was in regular communication with R. Elyashiv, informed me on July 30, 2013 that R. Elyashiv changed his mind and subscribed to R. Grodzensky’s view even with regard to Torah-observant Jews.</i> In fact, according to a <i>mesorah</i> attributed to R. Elyashiv, in situations in which people recognize one mode of estate planning, i.e., executing a civil will and preparing such a testamentary disposition, we assess (<i>umdana</i>) that their intentions were to transfer the estate as a gift in accordance with secular law, and we treat it as <i>hashlasha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo Zafrani, 20 <i>Moriah</i>, <i>gilyon</i> 122 (Tevet 5756). See supra n. 140. Cf. R. Turetsky, who attributes a contradictory <i>psak</i> to R. Elyashiv. See <i>Teshuvot Yashiv Moshe</i>, 475.</i> To state it differently, even observant Jews who have their estate wishes executed in accordance with civil law trust that their instructions will be complied with, and therefore a civil will ought to be recognized as a vehicle for <i>hashlasha</i>.
Nonetheless, R. Elyashiv contends based upon “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” that a <i>peshara</i> (compromise) should be executed by the Jewishly observant who utilize secular estate arrangements.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 139.</i> And Meishiv be-Halakha contends that it is <i>midat hassidut</i> to comply with the provisions of a civil will, and invokes the possibility that confirmation of such a testamentary disposition is a fulfillment of <i>kibbud av</i>, a matter we will discuss later in our presentation.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">See infra text accompanying nn. 153–169.</i>
Finally, regarding Maharit’s opposition to invoking “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” when a civil will is in violation of the <i>issur</i> of <i>avurei ahsanta</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 80.</i> this may be based on the view that “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” is a form of <i>kinyan</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if a testator instructs a <i>shalish</i> to transfer ownership of an asset to a third party upon his demise, the beneficiary assumes responsibility for the assets after the testator’s death. See <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 15b, s.v. “<i>de-amru</i>”; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 630 in the name of <i>R. Tam</i>; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 29; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:224 (10); <i>Sefer Shiurei ha-Rav</i> (Y. B. Soloveitchik) on <i>Gittin</i> 13a.</i> and therefore invoking it as grounds for recognizing a non-Torah heir’s entitlement to estate assets does not mitigate the contravention of an <i>issur</i>. In fact, in another <i>teshuva</i> penned by Maharit, he seems to endorse this understanding of “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 2:95.</i> and we can therefore readily understand his opposition to invoking this notion in cases of disinheritance of Torah heirs.
However, most <i>Poskim</i> contend that “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” is not an act of <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Absent the actual transfer of the asset(s) by the testator during his lifetime to the <i>shalish</i>’s control, it is fulfillment of a <i>mitzva.</i> See <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>, <i>Tosafot Gittin</i> 13a, s.v. “<i>ve-ho</i>”; <i>Shitot Kadmonim</i> and <i>Hiddushei ha-Rama</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 13a; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 629; <i>Tashbetz</i> 2:53; <i>Rema SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:2; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 248:5; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> (Urbach), <i>YD</i> 48.</i> Rather, as the words denote, this concept informs us that it is a halakhic duty, a <i>mitzva</i>, to fulfill the wishes of the deceased. As R. Shaul Nathanson notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is a matter of “kindness of truth” [<i>hessed shel emet</i>] that we do with the departed … and it is a duty to comply with the wishes of the deceased.</span>
Yet, as we explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying supra n. 80.</i> should the testamentary disposition provide that Torah heirs, alongside non-Torah heirs, benefit from the estate distribution, the <i>issur</i> of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>” is nonexistent and the <i>mitzva</i> may be fulfilled and enforceable by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 252.</i>
In short, though not explicitly stated, we assume that despite the recognition of a civil will by R. Grodzensky, R. Shor, and the others who recognize a civil will, they will all concur that Torah heirs must receive a distribution from the estate, lest the execution of the will entail a contravention of the <i>issur</i> of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying supra n. 80.</i> Even if the language employed by the testator is “to bequeath” or “to inherit” rather than “to give” his assets, such language will not invalidate the civil will that reflects the deceased’s wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 248:1. Though <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 248:1 and <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 1:872 disagree, nonetheless, since there is halakhic doubt as to who ought to possess the assets, we do not extract them from the <i>muhzak</i>. See <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i> 2:22 (225). However, it is questionable whether such terminology will validate such a disposition based upon the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>kibbud av</i>. See infra text accompanying nn. 154–158.</i>
<b>F. The Parameters of <i>Kibbud Av</i></b>
Finally, in the absence of affirming a civil will as a means to perform the “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>,” there are <i>Poskim</i> who argue that compliance with a parent’s wishes is a fulfillment of the <i>mitzva</i> of either <i>kibbud av</i>, honoring one’s father,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 148; <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 13; <i>Minhat Shai</i>, supra n. 136; <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 33; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 214; <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 21, at 15–18; <i>Kovetz ha-Teshuvot</i>, <i>HM</i> 215; <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 33.<br>Rabbi Ya’akov Reicher argues that in accordance with the dictates of <i>lifnim mi-shurat ha-din</i> (lit. “beyond the limit of the law”), one may invoke <i>kibbud av</i> regarding a testamentary disposition. See <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:168. Even though he contends that one cannot coerce the child to respect his parent’s wishes, nevertheless, should such a matter be resolved by a <i>beit din</i>, the signing of an arbitration agreement would be grounds to effectuate his compliance. A <i>beit din</i> can mandate compliance with one’s halakhic-moral obligations. See <i>Teshuvot Mahari Bruna</i> 241; R. Zalman Goldberg, <i>Shivhei ha-Peshara</i> section 5 (letter sent to Kollel Mishpetei Aretz, Ofrah, Israel).<br>Since one is saved from transgressing an <i>issur</i> by performing the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>kibbud av</i>, we may assume that these <i>Poskim</i> hold that as long as the Torah heir(s) receives a portion of the <i>yerusha</i>, there is no nullification of the <i>halakhot</i> of Torah succession.</i> or <i>mora av</i>, filial
reverence.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>YD</i> 148:8. R. Akiva Eiger is unsure whether to affirm a will based upon these grounds. See <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i> 1:68.</i> The implicit premise of this position is that a <i>beit din</i> can coerce a child to comply with his parent’s wishes<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhosot le-Ramban</i> 88; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzva</i> 33; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 97:16; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 1. Alternatively, even if one contends that there is no basis for coercing an individual to honor his parent, by dint of signing on the arbitration agreement, the child is duty-bound to obey a <i>beit din</i> that mandates that the parent be accorded honor and respect. See supra n. 154.</i> and that a child is obligated in <i>kibbud av</i> after his father’s demise.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shivat Tzion</i> 58; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 240:17.<br>For example, after his father’s demise the heir is obligated by the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>kibbud av</i> to pay off his father’s debts and restore an object the father stole or <i>ribbit</i> he took. See <i>Ketuvot</i> 91b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 94b, 112a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 157a.</i> Such a conclusion would apply equally to a secular will.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Heshev ha-Ephod</i>, supra n. 129.</i>
Others disagree for one of three reasons. Firstly, one cannot coerce a child to comply with his parent’s wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 91b, s.v. “<i>mitzva</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 9:13–14; <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 21.</i> Some argue that <i>kibbud av</i> is limited to personal service of a parent, whereas incurring a financial loss does not fall within the ambit of the <i>mitzva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 240:1.<br>Firstly, though many <i>Poskim</i> argue that there is no <i>mitzva</i> of <i>kibbud av</i> when he does not benefit from the child’s action, there are decisors who disagree. See <i>Havot Yair</i>, supra n. 154; R. Akiva Eiger, supra n. 154; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i>, 2:224 (in the name of <i>Rivash</i> and <i>Tashbetz</i>). Secondly, as R. Schwadron aptly notes, benefit accruing to a parent is not limited to personal service, but encompasses equally his monetary assets. See <i>Maharsham</i>, op. cit., subsection 14. Hence, there should be unanimous agreement that a parent derives benefit, albeit it may be of a psychological nature, from his children’s receiving his assets in accordance with his instructions.<br>Finally, permitting a non-Torah heir to inherit, in effect, creates a situation that the Torah heir has to expend his own money, and seemingly, such an outlay of monies exceeds the scope of <i>kibbud av</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Tehila le-Dovid</i>, <i>HM</i> 252:2.</i> Consequently, since foregoing one’s share in an estate entails an expense to the child without reimbursement by the parent, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>kibbud av</i> is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Emet le-Ya’akov</i>, <i>HM</i> 282. Cf. <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 13 and others who argue that the son has not benefited from receiving a <i>yerusha</i>, but rather, by being deprived of it, he incurred a loss.</i> Finally, some argue that since there is no obligation to honor and/or respect a parent after his demise,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 148; <i>Shevut Ya‘akov</i>, supra n. 154.</i> the child is exempt from complying with the parent’s testamentary wishes, which will be actualized after his death.
We should be mindful of the words of a well-respected twentieth-century halakhic arbiter. After stressing the importance of complying with the order of succession prescribed in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 14.</i> R. Tucashinsky concludes with the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gesher ha-Hayyim</i>, vol. 1, 41.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And if he erred and wrote to his daughter or wife in a language that is ineffective for estate transfer, it is desirable that the sons agree to distribute the estate equally with their sister and mother, and it is a <i>mitzva</i> to fulfill the words of the father … and also to avoid friction and controversy.</span>
The <i>pesika</i> of R. Tucashinsky, which was forged in the crucible of his learning experience and investigation of the halakhic sources, led to him to conclude that various halakhic techniques for drafting a will were the order of the day. And in his writings he suggested various texts of halakhically sanctioned <i>tzavaot</i>. Nevertheless, he concludes his presentation with the point that our Torah is described as “ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.”
Though R. Tucashinsky was hard pressed to find grounds to validate a secular will, nonetheless, he clearly experienced personal anguish regarding disrespecting a father and his personal wishes and the potential family strife and instability which ensued by a son who contests a civil will. He therefore directed the son(s) to agree and accept the estate distribution to the non-Torah heirs based upon <i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>, <i>kibbud av</i>, and fostering <i>shalom</i>.
A similar approach, albeit much more subtle in form, resonates in the writings of R. Mattisyahu Schwartz. After his exhaustive treatment of over four hundred pages in volume 1 of <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i> arguing for the paramount importance of drafting a halakhic will, examining the advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques proposed for drafting a will, and his fifty-five-page review of all the differing views of whether <i>kibbud av</i> is applicable in volume 2, R. Schwartz summarizes his conclusion by stating,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, vol. 2, 85.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In volume 1 of <i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i> we had a lengthy presentation in explaining why the <i>Poskim</i> argue that one must affirm a civil will due to honor of a father [and we discussed the views that rejected <i>kibbud av</i>].</span>
In other words, his aforesaid summary indicates that R. Schwartz is subscribing to the view that <i>ex post facto</i> one should affirm the will based upon <i>kibbud av</i>. A halakhic will is the prescribed method for estate planning, however R. Schwartz affirms a civil will based on <i>kibbud av</i>. In fact, R. Schwartz argues that even <i>Poskim</i> who hold that children are exempt from <i>kibbud av</i> in complying with estate directives agree that if the children fulfill their parent’s wishes, they do fulfill the <i>mitzva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, vol. 1, 501.</i>
His position manifests itself when dealing with the following scenario: A father’s will mandates that portions of his estate be distributed to non-Torah heirs, but upon his demise, his wife demands that the estate be distributed to other non-Torah heirs. Applying rulings emerging from different cases, R. Schwartz finds three approaches to parental precedence and filial responsibility. In a case in which two parents disagreed about the propriety of a match for their child, R. Yehzekel Landau concludes that if only the mother is alive, <i>kibbud em</i> trumps <i>kibbud av</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>EH</i> 45.</i> In a case in which there is a conflict between the deceased mother’s will and the instructions of a living father, and the father’s instructions involve financial loss, R. Akiva Eiger contends that the son can choose whose instructions to follow.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">R. Akiva Eiger, supra n. 155.</i> Should a father oppose his son’s recitation of <i>Kaddish</i> for his deceased mother, some <i>Poskim</i> argue that in such a situation <i>kibbud av</i> and <i>kibbud em</i> are on equal standing and that the <i>avel</i> (mourner) can therefore choose whose instructions he wants to follow.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hayyim She’ol</i>, 1:5; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhma</i>, 5:15.</i> In other words, drawing from cases dealing with a prospective marital mate, a child incurring a financial loss through <i>kibbud av</i>, and the <i>Kaddish</i> recitation for a parent despite the other parent’s protestation, R. Schwartz draws three contrasting conclusions regarding how to confront a mother’s desire to modify her husband’s estate disposition and divide the estate among other non-Torah heirs.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat ha-Tzava’ah</i>, 2:82–88.</i> To state it differently, there is no discussion whatsoever about tearing up the will and giving all the assets to the Torah heirs. The question is simply whose <i>kavod</i> will be the determining factor in the estate distribution. And therefore, there are no grounds to distribute the entire <i>yerusha</i> to the Torah heir.
In conclusion, numerous decisors invalidate a civil will either because there is no <i>kinyan</i> after death and/or because affirming the will entails the violation of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the <i>Poskim</i> cited supra n. 15, see <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 172; <i>Rav Pe’alim</i>, supra n. 98; File no. 5528-42-1, Petach Tikva Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, January 20, 2005; File no. 8820-41-1, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Attorney General</i>, November 23, 2009; Asher Weiss, “An Improperly Drafted Will,” (Hebrew) 6 <i>Darkhei Horo’ah</i> 130, 133–137 (5767).</i> Should the assets earmarked in a civil will be distributed to non-Torah heirs, many <i>battei din</i> will redistribute the lion’s share of the estate to the Torah heir(s) in accordance with the order of Torah succession.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 259; <i>Kovetz ha-Teshuvot</i> supra n. 139.</i> Other <i>battei din</i> will rely upon the views expressed in our presentation that would validate a civil will.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 55 and 115.</i>
Should a <i>beit din</i> choose to invalidate the estate distribution in the will, a nominal distribution will be given to the daughter(s). Since legally, the daughter must sign off in order for the son to inherit his share of the estate, the daughter can rely on <i>Poskim</i> who do not obligate a daughter to sign off the estate distribution,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Whether one can coerce a daughter to sign a waiver is a matter of controversy. See <i>Pnei Moshe</i> supra n. 104; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i> 2, <i>Mahdura Tiltali</i> 1:78, 265, 3:45, 73; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 1:4; <i>Heshev ha-Ephod</i>, supra n. 129; <i>Erekh Shai</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:9; <i>Teshuvot Beit Shlomo</i> (Sklai), <i>OH</i> 85:3, <i>YD</i> 2:79, <i>HM</i> 108–109; <i>Hukot ha-Hayyim</i> 73; <i>Teshuvot Mahariz Enzel</i> 28–29; <i>Nahalat Tzvi HM</i> 276; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim HM</i> 2:3; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim HM</i> 2:15.<br>However, if this matter is being resolved by a <i>beit din</i> empowered by signed arbitration agreement to address this matter, then even those <i>Poskim</i> who contend that generally one cannot coerce a daughter to sign a waiver document, the <i>beit din</i> does possess such authority.</i> and she therefore has a right to receive a portion of the estate.
In exchange for her signature, there is a <i>minhag</i> to give her either at least ten percent of the value of the estate,<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pnei Moshe</i>, supra n. 104 (in the name of Maharit); <i>Hukot Hayyim</i>, supra n. 174; <i>Seder Eliyahu Rabba ve-Zuta</i> 15.</i> or an amount determined by a <i>beit din</i> panel.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 1:4; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:3; <i>Teshuvot Birkat Yosef</i> (Landa), <i>HM</i> 22; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 5:211; <i>Teshuvot Mahaze Avraham</i> (Steinberg) 2:19; <i>PDR</i> 9, 115, 126–131. For a text of a waiver document, see <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 15:60.</i> In effect, offering assets to a daughter is a <i>peshara</i>, a compromise. Generally speaking, in an instance of <i>issur</i>, one cannot implement a <i>peshara</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>HM</i> 23; <i>Teshuvot Yad Eliyahu</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot be-Tzel ha-Hokhma</i> 3:36.</i> nevertheless, the <i>issur</i> here may be inoperative. As we earlier noted, though the entire estate belongs to the Torah heirs and consequently, according to certain decisors, a partial distribution to a daughter entails a violation of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 12.</i> some <i>Poskim</i> permit distribution to a non-Torah heir. Implicit in their allowance of distribution to a daughter is their endorsement of the position that distribution to a non-Torah heir is permissible if he shares in the estate distribution.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 80.</i> Alternatively, since secular law mandates a daughter’s signature for the son to receive his estate distribution, Halakha allows her to sign off. Consequently, in the absence of an <i>issur</i>, a <i>peshara</i> may be implemented. Finally, to avoid a daughter proceeding to litigate her claim in civil court, which entails the commission of an <i>issur</i>, we allow a <i>peshara</i> to be executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Birkat Yosef</i>, supra n. 176<i>.</i></i>
Others, such as Rabbis Maharam of Rothenberg, Schwadron, and Feinstein, sanction the use of a civil will either based upon the <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the testator, “commanding because of death,” <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, or <i>minhag</i>. Regardless of the grounds for validating a secular will, it may be effective in transferring assets to a non-Torah heir only if there is a partial distribution to a Torah heir.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 80.</i>
On the other hand, some <i>Poskim</i> validate a secular will based upon “<i>mitzva le-kayeim divrei ha-met</i>” or <i>kibbud av</i>. Here again, to avoid the <i>issur</i> of “<i>avurei ahsanta</i>,” such recognition may require that the Torah heir receive a partial distribution of the estate. Others, as we have shown, oppose both approaches.
Deciding between competing arguments regarding the propriety of a civil will is the sole prerogative of the <i>Posek</i> and <i>beit din</i>. The relative strength and plausibility of each argument will continue to be scrutinized within the framework of future <i>pesakim</i> and <i>piskei din</i>.
<b>Conclusion</b>
Since the halakhic propriety of a civil testamentary disposition is subject to debate, it behooves our community to seriously consider that a Torah heir may decide (based upon either his own halakhic convictions, desire for material aggrandizement, hatred of his siblings who are non-Torah heirs, or at the behest of his spouse’s inveighing) to challenge in <i>beit din</i> his father’s civil will that distributes portions of the estate to his siblings who are non-Torah heirs. Such claims have been advanced in <i>battei din</i> in the past and and continue to be submitted to this very day to <i>battei din</i>. One should never assume that fighting regarding <i>yerusha</i> would happen only in somebody else’s family. Since there is no halakhic consensus to affirm a civil will, there is a distinct possibility that the overwhelming majority of the assets will be redistributed and awarded to a Torah heir(s) by a <i>beit din</i>. Optimally, our community ought to seek halakhic and legal counsel regarding halakhic estate-planning techniques that will avoid the potential challenges to the halakhic efficacy of a civil will.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 14.</i>
Should a civil will be contested, and settlement negotiations and mediation fail, it is advisable that a Torah heir as well as a non-Torah heir approach a rabbinic authority who has expertise in Even ha-Ezer and Hoshen Mishpat, and preferably experience in <i>dayanut</i>, for counsel on how to handle this matter.

Chapter 3; Harnessing the Authority of Beit Din to Deal with Cases of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse

<b>Harnessing the Authority of <i>Beit Din</i> to Deal with Cases of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse</b><br>The purpose of our presentation is to educate victims of spousal and child abuse, and the Jewish community in general, about the type of relief that can be provided by a <i>beit din</i>, which has the authority to resolve certain monetary issues relating to such conduct. We hope in this presentation to both demonstrate the nature of these claims and their halakhic underpinnings, so that our <i>battei din</i> will be open to accept such claims and also to serve as an introductory guide to <i>dayanim</i> and <i>to’anim</i> (rabbinical advocates) to deal with such claims.
<b>1.</b>
The first part of our presentation focuses on the right of a Jewish wife to advance various monetary claims against her abusive Jewish husband. Such a right exists equally for a husband who is a victim of abuse,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, our discussion regarding <i>kevod ha-beriyyot</i> and filing for monetary awards for z<i>sa’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i> applies equally in a case of an abusive wife.</i> however, our discussion focuses on the more frequent situation of the abusive husband.
In a hypothetical scenario, a husband and wife are at home with their Jewish maid and suddenly, without any incitement, the husband hits his wife on her hips and back in front of the maid. The husband denies the allegations and argues that the battery was self-inflicted. In reply, the wife counters by arguing that it would have been impossible for her to produce self-inflicted wounds on her back. Moreover, the maid corroborates the wife’s version of the events. Subsequently, the wife files a police report and a restraining order is issued against her husband. Based upon professional findings, it is clear that the husband is a bipolar personality and is violent.
In fact, the wife’s friends are aware of the husband’s abusive relationship with his wife. Fearful for her life, she abandons the marital home and seeks <i>mezonot</i>, i.e., spousal support, compensation for lodging expenses, and monetary damages for physical and emotional abuse. The couple decides to have their issues resolved in <i>beit din</i>. During the proceedings, health care professionals attest to the husband’s proclivity to physical and emotional abuse.
<i>Kevod ha-beriyyot</i> (the dignity of human beings) ought to be one of the governing halakhic norms in our social relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 19b; <i>Shabbat</i> 94b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 79b; <i>Menahot</i> 37b–38a; Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Berakhot</i> 6b; <i>Kilayim</i> 32a. For many of these sources in our presentation, see Eliav Shochetman, “Violence against Women as Grounds for Divorce” (Hebrew), ed. Aviad Hacohen, <i>Volume in Memory of Menachem Elon</i> (forthcoming).</i> Thus, a husband has a duty to respect his wife as a member of the human race. Additionally, as a husband it is incumbent upon him to respect her more than he respects himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 59b; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 59a; <i>Yevamot</i> 62b; <i>Nedarim</i> 51a; <i>Hullin</i> 84b; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 228:3.</i> Whereas various halakhic guidelines have been established relating to the duty of <i>kevod ha-beriyyot</i>, there is a paucity of sources practically detailing how to demonstrate in positive terms one’s respect for one’s wife. Clearly, spousal respect requires intimate and individualistic answers that emerge from the singularity of persons and their relationships to each other, as well as their fused existence. It seems that Halakha has left it up to the husband to determine how to translate into practical terms respect for his spouse.
On the other hand, there are specific acts of dishonor, of demeaning a wife’s persona, such as threatening to assault her or actual battery, which entail a diminution of her honor as a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenburg</i>, Cremona Edition, 291; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot la-Ramban</i>, 102; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:113; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i>, 88; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 74; <i>Sefer ha-Aguda</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 172; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:36; <i>Teshuvot Perah Mateh Aharon</i> 1:60.<br>Cf. numerous <i>Poskim</i> who sanction wife-beating in order to prevent the commission of a transgression (<i>le-afrushei me-issura</i>), should a wife be delinquent in fulfilling her marital duties or needlessly curses her husband. See <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 218; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 888;<i>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:10;<i>Rema, SA EH</i> 154:3. Whether such conduct is permissible today is beyond the scope of our presentation. Suffice it to say that there are authorities who prohibit assaulting a wife in these circumstances.</i> Consequently, just as <i>habbala</i> (battery) involves transgressing a negative Torah commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 25:3; <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, <i>mitzvat lo ta’aseh</i> 300; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:1.</i> similarly, spousal battery is a violation of <i>habbala</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:3, <i>Rema</i>, ad locum. Moreover, the batterer is invalid to be a witness in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding.

Given that a husband is responsible for the injury he causes his wife, how would a <i>beit din</i> assess the damages? At first glance, there are seemingly no grounds for awarding monetary damages to a victim of abuse. As we know, there are five types of payment that are to be made in case of assault: permanent injury (<i>nezek</i>), physiological pain (<i>tza’ar</i>), medical expenses (<i>rippui</i>), loss of earnings (<i>shevet</i>), and shame (<i>boshet</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:3.</i> Following in the footsteps of Rambam,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 5:10.</i> Shulhan Arukh rules that today we can only advance a claim for medical expenses and loss of economic earnings.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:2.</i> However, Rema disagrees and argues that the practice is that even such types of payments cannot be collected.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:2. Cf. <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:7.</i> In short, all five types of damages are not collectible today in a <i>beit din</i>. In the absence of the five payments, pursuant to numerous <i>teshuvot</i> of Geonim, Shulhan Arukh and Rema rule that the parties themselves or a third party such as a <i>beit din</i> ought to attempt to mediate the matter, with the goal of appeasing the victim by offering appropriate compensation for the injury inflicted upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:11; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:5; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:2, 420:38.</i> Should mediation fail, according to Rambam, if a husband assaults his wife, it is incumbent upon <i>beit din</i> to take a portion of the husband’s assets and purchase real estate (<i>karka</i>) and transfer this asset to his wife.

Others argue, pursuant to <i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:14, that the wife retains title; however, the profits (<i>peirot</i>) belong to the husband. See <i>Ra’avad</i>, ad locum; <i>Semag</i>, positive commandment no. 70; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 66a.</i>
Should the couple be unable to settle the matter between themselves, the husband and wife may submit to a <i>beit din</i> to address the wife’s monetary claims relating to spousal abuse. The couple would sign an arbitration agreement (<i>shtar borerut</i>) accompanied by executing a <i>kinyan</i> (i.e., a symbolic act of undertaking this duty), which empowers the panel to halakhically<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:18.</i> and legally<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Assuming the decision complies with the rules of civil arbitration procedure, it would be legally enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States; see Uniform Arbitration Act, sec. 1.</i> issue a decision. Optimally, the <i>shtar</i> should specifically authorize the panel to resolve claims relating to personal injury, and thus allow the <i>beit din</i> to issue an award of any of the aforementioned payments, should the circumstances dictate such relief. The significance of this arrangement is that although, as we pointed out, normative Halakha precludes a panel from addressing such matters, nevertheless, should the parties obligate themselves to accept a <i>beit din</i>’s decision regarding this matter, such a <i>shtar</i> is valid. In other words, the authority to issue a decision is grounded in the parties’ willingness to fulfill their respective obligations, rather than the judicial authority of a <i>beit din</i> to render a decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 114a; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shekhenim</i> 12:7; <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 334:43; <i>Imre Bina</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; R.

See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:13; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda HM</i> 1. For recent applications of this view, see File no. 9326351, Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, August 11, 2007 (R.

However, regarding non-punitive damages such as <i>nezek</i>, <i>rippui</i>, and <i>shevet</i>, Sha’ar Mishpat will validate such a provision in a <i>shtar</i>.</i>
However, even in the absence of a provision in the <i>shtar</i> that allows the panel to render a decision on matters relating to personal injury, a panel may attempt to appease the victim by offering him appropriate compensation for the injury the batterer caused.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Geonim,</i> ed.

In addition, at the very least, the signing of the <i>shtar borerut</i> will legally empower a <i>beit din</i> to address this <i>nezikin</i> (tort) claim within the context of a divorce proceeding, which addresses all the end-of-marriage issues, or a non-divorce proceeding, which is limited to resolving this claim. However, given that Halakha does not authorize <i>dayanim</i> in contemporary times to award any of the five <i>nezikin</i> payments, on what grounds can a panel issue any potential award? Moreover, what type of <i>nezikin</i> awards can be rendered by a <i>beit din</i> today? Prior to the mid-fourth century CE, arbiters who had received <i>semikha</i> (rabbinic ordination) were authorized to resolve monetary matters, including the assessment of the five aforementioned payments as a form of a compensation for both injurious and non-injurious physical abuse. After the lapse of the ordination process in the fourth century CE, non-ordained arbiters lack authorization to impose these five payments.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 18–20.</i>
Nevertheless, <i>dayanim</i> today<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And, for that matter, such empowerment extends to all <i>dayanim</i> who functioned in the earlier periods of Jewish history.

In such circumstances, a <i>beit din</i> may mete out punishment as a deterrent, so as to forestall the danger that others will emulate the transgressor’s conduct if it goes unpunished. The imposition of such punitive damages may be handed down by lay arbiters (<i>beit din shel hedyotot</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 1:161; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i>, 3:385, 393; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i>, 265; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i>, 211; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:1; <i>Levush</i>, <i>Ir Shushan</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; <i>Sma</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:9; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, 2:5; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:2; <i>Perisha</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 2.

Given that a contemporary <i>beit din</i> is empowered to impose such measures, it is our opinion that spousal physical abuse ought to be compensated in situations of repeated abuse, in order that others do not emulate the batterer’s ways.
Moreover, feelings of embarrassment and shame, which are engendered by acts of spousal abuse, may serve as grounds for a monetary award. Halakha recognizes compensation for <i>nezek</i> (bodily injury), <i>tza’ar</i> (emotional stress) which traumatizes the victim in avoiding the engagement in any future conjugal relations, and <i>boshet</i> (shame) engendered by bodily injury,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the act of rape as an example of <i>hezek</i> despite the absence of a physical act of injury, see supra n. 15.

Similarly, a claim for <i>tza’ar</i> (emotional stress), even feelings of emotional pain that transpire during the healing process, will be awarded by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:17.

Cf. <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 2:6, 9.</i> In the absence of physical contact, <i>le-migdar milta</i> awards for <i>tza’ar</i> may be rendered. In fact, throughout different periods of Jewish history dating back to medieval times and to the present, arbiters have meted out compensatory awards based upon <i>boshet</i> and <i>tza’ar</i> claims.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, 101:1, 8, 9; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot la-Ramban</i>, 240; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 3:204; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i>, 3:480; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:24, 333:49; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>YD</i>, 146; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i>, 134, <i>HM</i>, 181; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i>, 74; <i>Zera Emet</i>, supra n. 50; <i>Rav Pe’alim</i>, supra n. 50; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 49.</i>
On the other hand, in the absence of a physical contact, seemingly a <i>beit din</i> cannot hold an offender responsible for a person who feels emotionally abused and demands relief, i.e., <i>boshet devarim</i>. According to the strict law, responsibility for <i>boshet</i> requires that the victim has been physically contacted by the batterer.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 41.</i> Nonetheless, a <i>beit din</i> today is empowered, <i>le-migdar milta</i>, to apply the identical standards employed to assess shame engendered by physical violence to situations of <i>boshet devarim</i>, provided that we are dealing with frequent instances of abuse and want to deter others from emulating a batterer’s behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420: 38–39.</i>
Finally, punitive damages, which may compensate above and beyond any damage incurred, are meant to provide an incentive against repeating the behavior that caused the victim’s injury.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 28–41.</i> As such, punitive damages differ from compensatory damages, which focus upon “making the victim whole.” Here again, <i>dayanim</i> have meted out punitive damages in cases of spousal abuse.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Geonim</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i>, 477; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i>, 62.</i>
Regardless of whether one files a claim for emotional distress due to physical abuse or emotional abuse, marital relations are complex, emotive, and subjective, and therefore difficult to subject to objective scrutiny. Marriages are molded by mutual understandings and interchanges as well as mutual expectations that can evoke different judgments as to whether a particular type of conduct should be labeled as emotional abuse. Nevertheless, given that in the past Halakha has awarded recovery for suits dealing with broken engagements and defamation of character, we see no reason to exempt spousal relations from the ambit of halakhic scrutiny and potential monetary award. Determining what conduct is abusive is a very difficult inquiry in any context, yet this is a <i>beit din</i>’s mandate.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 111–180.

Alternatively, in the absence of conditions which may be characterized as <i>le-migdar milta</i> or if one subscribes to the posture that such power may be invoked only by the <i>gadol hador</i> (the greatest scholar of the generation),<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 41.</i> there are three other avenues which would allow for the submission of such claims. Firstly, generally speaking, there is a requirement to maintain a <i>beit din</i> comprised of <i>mumhim</i> (<i>dayanim</i> who received ordination handed down from Moshe Rabbeinu). Such <i>dayanim</i> are empowered to award <i>kenasot</i> (penalties), including but not limited to matters of <i>nezikin</i>. In contemporary times, in the absence of <i>mumhim</i>, the power of <i>beit din</i> stems in part from the parties’ willingness to accept their authority, and the awarding of <i>kenasot</i> is therefore permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubezet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 89b, s.v<i>.</i> “<i>ve-gedolei ha-mehabrim</i>”; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 3:1; <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i> 1:1.</i> In effect, through the acceptance of their authority via the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>, the parties agree to obligate themselves to remit such monies should an award be rendered. This obligation is effective even though the parties do not explicitly state in the <i>shtar borerut</i> (the arbitration agreement) that the <i>dayanim</i> may issue a decision regarding a <i>nezikin</i> claim that may entail a <i>kenas</i>.
Secondly, since the parties empower the <i>beit din</i> to resolve matters in accordance with <i>peshara</i> (court-mediated settlement), the panel may resolve matters dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kenasot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:93; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda HM</i> 1, cited authoritatively by <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:3; <i>Mishpetekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:32; Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i> 187; File no. 70029/1, Eretz Hemdah-Gazit Beit Din, October 31, 2011.</i>
Finally, usually the couple signs a <i>shtar borerut</i> that authorizes the <i>beit din</i> halakhically and legally to issue a ruling. The <i>shtar</i> should specifically authorize the panel to resolve claims relating to various types of personal injury, namely, physical injury, pain, the incurring of medical expenses, loss of work time, experiencing shame, as well as indirect injuries. Although contemporary arbiters are generally precluded from addressing these <i>nezikin</i> claims, should the parties obligate themselves to accept a <i>beit din</i>’s decision regarding these claims, such a <i>shtar</i> is valid. In other words, the authority to issue a <i>psak din</i> is grounded in the couple’s willingness to fulfill their respective obligations, as in the case of any contractual agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Imrei Bina</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; Z. N. Goldberg, 11 <i>Yeshurun</i> 602–3 (2002).</i> Alternatively, such acceptance is no different than the imparting of validity to the litigants’ decision to accept a halakhically invalid witness (such as a relative) as an arbiter.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aruk ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:13; <i>Beit Yehuda</i>, supra n. 62.

Sherman’s opinion).<br>Though <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:1, 2:1 casts doubt upon the validity of such a <i>shtar</i> with regard to awarding punitive damages, however, regarding awarding compensatory damages, <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i> will validate such a provision in a <i>shtar</i>.</i> Whereas invoking the power of <i>le-migdar milta</i> empowers a <i>beit din</i> to mete out punitive damages, these three aforementioned approaches permit a <i>beit din</i> to award compensatory damages. Compensatory damages represent the financial equivalent of the loss or harm suffered by the victim, to restore the injured victim to the position he was in prior to the <i>nezek</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:38; <i>Rema</i>, ad locum.</i>
To award compensatory or punitive damages, the victim of abuse must demonstrate that the act(s) actually transpired.

(Whether one validates her words as testimony or trustiworthiness has halakhic ramifications that are beyond the scope of this presentation.) Alternatively, a woman’s testimony, though inadmissible because <i>of gezerat hakatuv</i>, a scriptual decree, nevertheless, a woman’s words are trustworthy. See <i>Tosafot Zevahim</i> 103a, s.v. “<i>ein le ela</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhosot le-Ramban</i> 128.<br>Nevertheless, many disagree and argue that the truth can only be ascertained on the basis of valid testimony of two adult Jewish males, and hence, the testimony of women would be invalid. See <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:4 and <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:5, 408:1. But, cf. <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 71, in the name of <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i> who argues that according to the <i>din</i>, black-letter law, in the absence of the presence of men, the testimony of two women is admissible regarding matters of <i>nezikin</i>.<br>However, during the time of Rabbeinu Tam, halakhic legislation was introduced that provided that in situations of battery where males are absent, the testimony of one woman would be accepted as trustworthy regarding the veracity of the event.

See <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, op. cit.; <i>Sma</i>, op. cit.; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> ibid. Others contend that such testimony is valid even if it is a frequent occurrence. See <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 71, in the name of <i>Maharik</i>.<br>Some contend in pursuance with the legislation that their trustworthiness is accepted only if an act suddenly happened and finished. See <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 71.<br>However, regarding instances of <i>davar she-be’erva</i>, matters of intimacy such as marriage and divorce, such evidence is inadmissible by dint of the legislation. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 4, <i>Tur</i> 1, 15; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 211; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>YD</i> 216; <i>Teshuvot (Petah) Beit Dovid</i> (Yosef Dovid, Salonika) 2, <i>HM</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Sha’ish</i> 2:29; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:84 (6); <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:56; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 3, <i>EH</i> 19; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hezkiah</i> 1, <i>EH</i> 7.<br>Cf. others claim that a ineligible witness’s testimony is even admissible concerning matters of intimacy involving finding grounds to release a wife from an <i>igun</i> situation. See <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, op. cit. <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i> 1, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 184; <i>Teshuvot Atzei Hayyim</i> (Teitelbaum) 18. In fact, one trusts a single midwife’s statement regarding <i>yuhasin</i>, which according to certain <i>Poskim</i> is a matter of <i>erva.</i> See <i>Kiddushin</i> 73b, <i>Beit Dovid</i>, op. cit. in the name of <i>Mordekai</i>, <i>Aguda</i>, and <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>. Accordingly, testimony of an ineligible witness may encompass not only observing an act of spousal abuse, but equally physical abuse of a child.<br>In fact, the <i>din</i> as well as legislation is understood to encompass matters beyond assault, such as shaming a Torah scholar and accepting a <i>meturgamen</i>, a translator of a witness’s testimony in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. See <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Zev</i> 249; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 120, 179 (in the name of <i>Mordekai</i>); <i>Rema</i>, supra n. 69; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 334:43; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, ad locum 64; <i>Ha’amek She’ailah</i>, s<i>hei’ltot</i> 55:4. Therefore in light of that position, the admissibility of ineligible witnesses where eligible witnesses are absent should equally apply to matters of <i>erva</i>.<br>In sum, the scope of <i>takanat ha-kadmonim</i> is defined by whether one invokes an <i>umdana</i>, inferential fact-finding that would extend its parameters beyond the actual factual background of the enactment dealing with a woman who witnesses a scuffle in a synagogue’s women’s section, or refrains from invoking an <i>umdana</i>, which results in the halakhic ramifications being limited to the actual facts which the legislation addressed. For varying opinions whether one can employ an <i>umdana</i> regarding a <i>takanah</i>, see <i>Ketonet Yosef</i> (Birdugo), <i>shorshei dinim</i>, <i>anaf</i> 20, “<i>umdana</i>.”<br>Some <i>Poskim</i> who argue that in pursuance to either the <i>din</i> or legislation that an invalid witness’s testimony is admissible to verify spousal rape, contend that on the basis of one individual’s testimony, a <i>beit din</i> can issue a <i>nezikin</i> award, which means that one can extract money from the abuser and give it to the victim. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 73b; <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, op. cit.; <i>Maharik</i>, op. cit. (in the name of <i>Mordekai</i>); <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 35:11; <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 71; <i>Petah Beit Dovid</i>, op. cit<i>.</i>; <i>Mishpat Arukh</i>, 2, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:14 (20). Our presentation here is premised upon these <i>Poskim</i>’s rulings. But, cf. <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i> supra n. 71; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:10; <i>Teshuvot Maharash ha-Levi</i> 38.<br>Others argue in principle that we should reject this rabbinic legislation. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:182; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, supra n. 71; <i>Mishkenot ha-Ro’im</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet Ot Ayin</i>; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 35:20; <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:24; <i>Yeshuot Yisrael</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:11; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:13, 408:2.<br>In sum, assuming that physical abuse happened, a woman’s testimony such as in our case of a Jewish maid is admissible and one can extract money on the basis of her testimony. Consequently, under such circumstances, a wife has grounds for advancing a <i>nezikin</i> claim against her abusive husband. This conclusion presumes that the matrimonial relationship is bereft of strife. However, should there be altercations and quarrels among themselves; the wife’s trustworthiness is undermined. See <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 17:48; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 178:9.</i>
However, there are authorities who reject an ineligible witness testimony in matters of battery between individuals for which nobody else is present to offer valid testimony, or who affirm that extracting money from the batterer requires two Jewish male witnesses who can confirm abuse transpired.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding social violence and spousal abuse respectively, see <i>Petah Beit Dovid</i>, supra n. 74, PDR 21, supra n. 74.

For the reliability of a gentile’s professional opinion, see <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 1:324; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:66; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i>, 493; <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 20:1; <i>Teshuvot Be’er Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 5, <i>anaf</i> 4; Z.

In short, if the allegation of physical violence can be proven through the batterer’s admission, the testimony of two male witnesses, or circumstantial evidence such as a health care professional’s findings or a husband’s behavior interacting with third parties and with his wife in <i>beit din</i> proceedings,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 9465-21-1, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, February 14, 2007.</i> there are grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to award monetary relief to the abused wife. In our scenario, the testimony of the wife and maid that the assault transpired, third-party testimony that attests to the violent character of the husband, and the testimony of a doctor regarding the husband’s proclivity to battery, are sufficient proof for the wife to argue that the events transpired.
In sum, in the absence of two adult Jewish male witnesses, there are two different evidentiary standards which allow a <i>dayan</i> to determine whether in fact the alleged abuse actually transpired. One relies upon the testimony of an invalid witness such as a woman, and the other focuses upon a constellation of factors, which, in addition to invalid witnesses, includes professional findings pertaining to the batterer and his known behavior in social interaction. Regardless of which standard is being invoked, the common denominator is well expressed in the words of Rashba, who states:<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i>, 3:74.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Each <i>beit din</i> [must judge] according to the local matter and time in investigating the matter; If there were witnesses – a man or even a woman … and according to the perception of the <i>beit din</i>, its wisdom and sharpness, [it will] recognize the matter based on the facts. This is why they should search and undertake numerous inquiries, and this is hinted in what has been said, “to judge a true <i>din</i> to the [fullest] truth” …</span>
Likewise, R. Moshe Sofer observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 74. Accordingly, money may be extracted from another individual relying upon a single ineligible witness. See <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yoel</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 117. However, given that in the twentieth century, <i>dayanim</i> are either corrupt or lack Torah scholarship, R. Yoel Teitlebaum concludes that we must rely upon two eligible witnesses.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It seems that the Torah did not require [two witnesses], except when the <i>beit din</i> did not know without the two witnesses. But a matter which is clear to them without having to trust witnesses, is as if they observed it on their own. And just like if the <i>beit din</i> witnessed the event themselves, the Halakha would be handed down without <i>edut</i> … likewise, if at every stage the <i>beit din</i> knows what took place without the trustworthiness of a witness, they are empowered to judge without testimony, and it is not subsumed under the category of “upon two witnesses” …</span>
Regarding cases of spousal abuse, a recent <i>beit din</i> summarizes our conclusion,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 4564-24-1, supra n. 82. See also, File no. 25449-2, Ashdod Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, November 9, 2013 (physical and emotional abuse). For a recent case in which a <i>beit din</i> relied upon a single <i>eid</i>’s testimony, the husband’s face-to-face communications, as well as telephone conversations to him wherein he stated that he battered his wife frequently and regarding spousal assault, “this is the way of the Torah.” See File no. 4927-21-1, Petach Tikva Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

<span class="poetry indentAll">Concerning violence between a couple that occurs in their home, it is almost impossible to bring valid witnesses. Therefore, it is incumbent upon <i>beit din</i> to rely upon ineligible witnesses, circumstantial evidence or documentation.</span>
Upon determination that the incident of spousal abuse transpired, the <i>beit din</i> will determine whether a monetary award for <i>boshet</i>/<i>tza’ar</i> is appropriate. Should a <i>beit din</i> determine that the claim is with merit, the wife would receive monetary relief from her husband.
Finally, in the event the husband refuses to desist from physical and sexual violence, the wife is entitled to leave the marital home.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6, <i>EH</i> 45; <i>PDR</i> 11:327.</i>

Whether a wife who abandons the home is entitled to continuing support is dependent upon the reason for her departure from the marital home. Should she vacate the home due to the fact that the husband is delinquent in his marital duties, such as his duty of spousal support, the wife would not be entitled to such remuneration. On the other hand, if the wife separates due to being abused, which is verifiable by invalid witnesses, as is the case in our situation, she is entitled to ongoing support as well as reimbursement for lodging expenses.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 7: 477; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot la-Ramban</i> 103; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Berlin ed.,11; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 70:12; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:3; <i>Teshuvot Edut be-Ya’akov</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:113; <i>Teshuvot va-Yomer Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Mor ve-Oholot</i>, <i>EH</i> 10; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i>, supra n. 96; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yehezkiya</i>, <i>EH</i> 1, in the names of Rabbis Kook and Uzziel; <i>PDR</i> 1:7, 238; 15:119, 11:327; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 4:21, 18:58.<br>For the acceptability of invalid testimony in cases of a wife’s abandonment of the marital home, see <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 74:9, 154:3; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:14; <i>PDR</i> 1:201, 2:353.</i>
Procedurally speaking, all of these claims for spousal support and monetary relief for abuse, along with matters such as the <i>get</i>, parenting arrangements, and division of marital assets, are submitted to the <i>beit din</i> panel at the time of the hearing. Pursuant to the view of various decisors,<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 11:1 (in the name of <i>Be’er Sheva</i>); <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:143.</i> the overwhelming majority of the <i>battei din</i> in the NY metropolitan area do not require submission of a claim statement to the <i>beit din</i> and the opposing party prior to the hearing. However, there are a few <i>battei din</i> that follow another position<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 99; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 11:1.Though these authorities mandate a submission of a claim statement only in response to a defendant’s request, these <i>battei din</i> require the submission regardless of whether the defendant requests it or not.<br>Though pursuant to Shakh’s posture there is no obligation upon the defendant to respond to the plaintiff’s claim statement prior to the hearing, nevertheless, these <i>battei din</i> will mandate a defendant’s written response to the plaintiff’s allegations prior to the convening of the panel.</i> and mandate the submission of a claim statement, as well as a defendant’s reply, prior to the hearing.
The scope of the <i>beit din</i>’s jurisdiction, which is determined by the scope of the arbitration, is crucial. If the arbitration agreement is open-ended and states that “all differences and disputes relating to the end of marriage” are to be resolved, then all matters, including spousal abuse, will be addressed by the panel. If, on the other hand, the husband insists that the allegations of spousal abuse not be adjudicated by the panel, then the wife should seek <i>beit din</i> and rabbinic counsel which, among other things, should allow her to resolve this claim in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:2. Invariably, claims of abuse are submitted at the same time that a wife requests to be granted a divorce from her husband. In a case in which the husband refuses to deliver a <i>get</i> and a <i>beit din</i> renders a monetary award to the wife, if the husband consents to grant a <i>get</i> provided that his wife waives her right to the award, this does not pose any halakhic dilemma. See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 111–180.</i>
In conclusion, addressing spousal abuse in eighteenth-century Bulgaria, R. Eliezer Papo writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pele Yo’ets</i>, 1:5, 101.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is proper for the leaders of the cities to impose sanctions upon violent individuals, in particular decadent people that hit their wives … Their breath should depart — those who treat the daughters of Israel as servants, trampling and assaulting them … and they have no shame in their actions.

Historically, as we have shown, the <i>beit din</i> and/or rabbinic decisors have assumed this mission. As members of our self-respecting covenantal faith community, we need to follow in their footsteps and continue to bring such claims to our <i>battei din</i> and we need our <i>dayanim</i> to offer monetary relief, if justified.
<b>2.</b>
In a hypothetical scenario, a grown Jewish man of 23 years of age appeared in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding to accuse a former teacher of repeatedly molesting him while attending yeshiva elementary school. “I remember him touching me,” said the man, “He touched my private area.” At age ten, he was raped repeatedly. He stayed quiet for thirteen years, stuffing the pain within himself. He got a job, got married, had kids, and interacted with family and friends with a smile on his face. But every step of the way, he carried with him the suffering of the ten-year-old boy who was betrayed by his mentor. Eventually, the boy’s pain became too much to bear and he demanded that a <i>beit din</i> direct the yeshiva to terminate his teacher’s employment, and advanced a <i>nezikin</i> claim against his teacher for causing him shame and pain. Upon hearing about the alleged abuse scandal and the convening of this <i>beit din</i> proceeding, two other Jewish male adults stepped forward and testified in <i>beit din</i> regarding their own experiences as alleged victims of abuse perpetrated by the same teacher while attending this yeshiva elementary school. Advocating verbal persuasion as the only vehicle for educating children, the teacher admitted during the proceeding, that he did not use corporal punishment.
Rambam states,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 5:1–2.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Anyone who assaults an honest (<i>kasher</i>) individual of Israel whether he is a minor or of majority age … in a disrespectful fashion (<i>derekh nitzayon</i>, such as illicit fondling<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Though this phrase means fighting in certain contexts in <i>Tanakh</i>, here it is understood to mean disrespect.<br>In other words, Halakha not only outlaws genital penetration but equally any illicit touching or fondling.

Similar rulings were handed down by Shulhan Arukh and others.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:1; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat lo ta’ase</i> 595; <i>Shulhan Arukh ha-Rav</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nizkei Guf ve-Nefesh</i> 1.</i> Yet, under certain prescribed conditions, a teacher is permitted to hit a child for educational purposes.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:11; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 378:8; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 378:9; this writer’s “Corporal punishment in school: a study in the interaction of Halakha and American law with social morality,” 37 <i>Tradition</i> 57 (Fall 2003) accessible at http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/744984/Rabbi_Dr_Ronnie_Warburg/Corporal_Punishment_in_School:_A_Study_in_the_Interaction_of_Contemporary_American_Law_with_Social_Morality.<br>Any halakhic dispensation to employ force within the context of a classroom is predicated upon the fact that secular law sanctions such behavior.</i>
Based upon the teacher’s admission that he did not use corporal punishment in the classroom, we are dealing with a case of alleged child abuse rather than an instance of a teacher hitting his student for educational reasons. In the absence of a criminal conviction by a court,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 66.</i> the question is whether we can accept as <i>edut</i> (testimony) the information provided by these three men in order to address the monetary claims advanced by the victim.
A similar question was addressed by a <i>dayan</i> in the mid-nineteenth century. In the year 1850, a teacher who was teaching in a town for a period of eight years was rumored to have engaged in homosexual liaisons with some of his students. A few of them who now had reached the age of thirteen spoke about his improper behavior. The teacher accepted upon himself “with an oath and a vow” that immediately after the close of the school year, he would move and seek employment elsewhere. His desire was to live and teach in Lvov located in the Ukraine. However, rumors of his alleged conduct quickly spread to Lvov and a respected layman of Lvov requested that R. Yosef Shaul Nathansohn, the town’s <i>av beit din</i>, investigate and inquire into this matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meshiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 1:185.</i> Upon deliberation, R. Nathansohn received the testimony of two teenagers who alleged that this teacher had engaged in the aforementioned abusive behavior. The question posed to R. Nathansohn was whether the teacher ought to be disqualified from teaching.
R. Nathansohn’s reply was that such a determination requires the testimony of two male witnesses. Though both alleged victims were presently of majority age, nonetheless, given that their testimony related to incidents that transpired while they were minors, their present testimony is considered to be the testimony of minors.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:3. This ruling applies even if their testimony relates to others or to themselves. See <i>SA ha-Rav</i>, <i>YD</i> 1:42.<br>Though there are certain exceptions wherein we rely upon their testimony pertaining to events that occurred while being minors, our instance is not one of them. See <i>SA</i>, op. cit.</i> Consequently, given that we are dealing with minors, generally speaking their testimony is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:1.</i> But R. Nathansohn invokes the <i>Rema</i>’s view (and others) according to which their testimony would be admissible and may be relied upon in cases involving battery where no male adults were present.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, text accompanying nn. 71 and 74. In the absence of two Jewish male witnesses, there are contemporary <i>Poskim</i> who will rely on testimony from minors, recordings, letters, or polygraph findings. See T. Gartner &amp; Y. Silman, “Treatise on ‘your fellow-Jew’s blood’” (Hebrew), 15 <i>Yeshurun</i> 634, 638, 663 (5765).</i> As such, relying upon their testimony, and for the children’s welfare, R. Nathansohn precluded the teacher from accepting a teaching position in Lvov.
Given that various decisors challenge Rema’s posture,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nn. 71 and 74.</i> is there any other evidentiary basis for a teacher being dismissed or ineligible to teach children due to having been involved in alleged incidents of child abuse? In nineteenth-century Izmir, Turkey, a rumor spread that a teacher had touched a student’s private area. However, the incident could not be verified. Subsequently, another rumor spread that on Purim this teacher entered a home and molested a young boy in the same fashion. According to the rumor mill, this occurrence repeated itself in the same home on Pesach. In response to these rumors, the teacher argued that he never touched these boys. And in fact, in his two visits to this home, the teacher alleged, there were numerous individuals in attendance – how is it possible that they didn’t observe such conduct? The community was divided on whether to dismiss the teacher. Unable to corroborate that any of these incidents actually transpired, R. Hayyim Palache would not mandate the teacher’s dismissal.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hikekei Lev</i>, supra n. 71.</i>
The import of R. Palache’s position is clear. Lest alleged pedophiles lose their jobs and be publicly shamed for conduct that he or she never committed, it is incumbent upon <i>beit din</i> to critically investigate the allegations prior to rendering judgment. Addressing the alleged incident of a teacher molesting a young girl, R. Shmuel de Medina (known by the acronym “Maharashdam”) of sixteenth-century Salonika in the Ottoman Empire states,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>YD</i> 141.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since all of Israel is presumptively credible (“<i>be-hezkat kashrut</i>”), unless there are proofs or significant justifications (“<i>amatlaot</i>”), one cannot undermine a person’s presumptive credibility.</span>
In fact, a few years ago, within the context of a <i>beit din</i> setting, we addressed an allegation of a series of incidents of a teenager molesting a younger child in an Australian yeshiva dormitory. The <i>tove’a</i> (plaintiff), namely the parent who appeared on behalf of his child who was the victim of the alleged abuse, submitted his claim demanding a remuneration of his costs for the psychological counseling that his child required due to these experiences.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Though generally a <i>ba’al din</i> (litigant) advances his own claims in <i>beit din</i>, nevertheless, a minor who is a litigant may have his claims submitted by a parent or another party of majority age. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 96, 1–2, 108:6; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 108:2; <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 108:7. A parent or grandparent who submits a claim on behalf of his minor child or grandchild, respectively, has the status of an “<i>apotropus</i>” (guardian) appointed by a <i>beit din</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, 87–88; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 37.<br>The above conclusion is not to be construed as preempting the possibility that a minor may appear either as a plaintiff or defendant in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. In fact, such a possibility clearly exists. However, the actual advancement of claims will be performed by his guardian or another adult who appears with him at the proceeding. For a <i>beit din</i>’s authority to award recovery of therapy bills, see supra text accompanying nn. 25–41.</i> However, the child neither appeared in front of the <i>beit din</i>, nor was the <i>tove’a</i> able to demonstrate in any shape or form to the panel that these incidents actually transpired. The <i>beit din</i> requested supporting documentation related to these incidents, but never received this evidence from the <i>tove’a</i>. Moreover, the <i>tove’a</i> failed to appear to hear the <i>nitva</i>’s (defendant’s) reply to the <i>tove’a</i>’s allegations. As such, adopting Maharashdam’s approach, the <i>beit din</i> was unable to perform its due diligence regarding this matter and the panel denied the <i>tove’a</i> any monetary relief.
In his extensive <i>teshuva</i>, responsum spanning over twenty pages, R. Palache sets forth, among other matters, the evidentiary standard required in order to terminate a pedophile from employment. Rejecting Rema’s posture, which argues for the admissibility of testimony by minors in cases of <i>nezikin</i>, R. Palache offers another standard. He concludes that, in the absence of two male witnesses who observed the conduct, an abuser could be dismissed from a school’s employment if four conditions are met. First, the child, the victim of abuse, has to be intelligent and of upstanding character. Second, the child must not bear any animosity or hatred for the alleged abuser. Third, the child’s experience has to be corroborated by at least two more children who experienced abuse by this teacher. Finally, the abusive behavior must have happened in a place where people were not present who could testify to the alleged event. Assuming that after intensive inquiry, the <i>beit din</i> arrives at the conclusion that they are dealing with an event which occurred in private with at least three different children who are intelligent and do not harbor any animosity towards the alleged pedophile, there are grounds for the teacher’s dismissal. In R. Palache’s mind, the introduction of these conditions is based upon the <i>beit din</i>’s power to act <i>le-migdar milta</i>, namely the necessity for evidentiary guidelines to address a pressing societal problem.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, text accompanying nn. 28–40.</i>
Another evidentiary stance suggested by R. Palache is to rely upon the testimony of ineligible witnesses and “<i>kala de-lo pasik</i>” (a persistent rumor). He distinguishes between this type of rumor and a “<i>rinnun be-alma</i>” (a mere rumor), which does not serve to corroborate that the event took place.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">For others who will mandate testimony of two witnesses and not rely upon <i>rinnun be-alma</i>, see <i>Teshuvot Ri Migash</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i>, Blau ed., 111; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 53:4.</i> R. Eliyahu ben Hayyim (known by the acronymn <i>“</i>Ranah<i>”</i>) suggests that there are two conditions that have to be met in order for the rumor to be labeled a “<i>kala de-lo pasik.</i>” First, the rumor must have been heard by many individuals and must not have subsided. Second, one must ascertain the source of the rumor. If, upon discovery, we find that the initiator of the rumor is an enemy of the alleged abuser, the rumor must be discounted.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 2:41. See also <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 2:52; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>OH</i> 25; <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 53:7; <i>Bi’ur Halakha</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 53:25.</i>
Alternatively, based upon our foregoing presentation of the evidentiary standards employed to verify instances of spousal abuse, a <i>dayan</i> may rely upon the testimony of an invalid witness such as a minor, when accompanied by other factors, such as circumstantial evidence, including but not limited to professional health care findings and polygraph testing, in order to determine whether child abuse has transpired. In the absence of the testimony of two witnesses, cases of child abuse, like spousal abuse, may be resolved by utilizing alternative evidentiary guidelines.
In our scenario, depending upon which approach a <i>beit din</i> would adopt to determine whether abuse has actually occurred, a <i>beit din</i> is obligated to critically inquire into the credibility of the victims of abuse, their testimony, persistent rumors, and/or the circumstantial evidence which may serve to ascertain the veracity of the alleged event. Should the <i>beit din</i> ascertain that such an event transpired, it can then decide if there is a justification for employment dismissal and/or the rendering of monetary awards based upon claims of <i>boshet</i>/<i>tza’ar</i>, recovery of fees for therapy, etc.
In conclusion, in addressing the relationship between a parent and a child, R. Uziel aptly notes, “Neither the sons nor daughters of a man belong to him in the manner he owns his monetary assets.”<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, <i>EH</i> 91.</i>
<i>A fortiori</i>, it behooves a parent, sibling, principal, rabbi, teacher, health care professional, and the like to hearken to R. Uziel’s words and protect the bodily and emotional well-being of our children and grandchildren, while simultaneously servicing their educational and psychological needs. We can expect no less. The dismissal of rabbis, teachers, and administrative staff from our synagogues, <i>yeshivot</i>, and youth organizations due to the perpetration of child abuse and the awarding of damages for mental anguish to the victims, serves as an important indication of the seriousness with which we must treat this issue. Ensuring that claims of abuse victims are settled expeditiously and appropriately is a <i>beit din</i>’s mandate.
Similarly, the opportunity to file an action in <i>beit din</i> regarding spousal abuse provides a communal recognition of the intrinsic value of human dignity.
Addressing these issues should be a collaborative effort of <i>dayanim</i>, as well as the health care professionals who will assist the <i>beit din</i> panel. During the past fifteen years, I have witnessed firsthand how child psychologists and experts in child abuse have been “the light at the end of the tunnel” in dealing with parenting arrangements for children of divorced families. We should expect no less in seeking their counsel regarding child and spousal abuse cases.
Some <i>battei din</i> employ a vetting process. In other words, upon receiving a claim, the administrative staff of the <i>beit din</i> will decide whether or not the claim will be heard by a panel of <i>dayanim</i>. For example, though there are grounds for mandating honoring and respecting a parent,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat aseh</i> 33; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 97:16; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 1; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 107:2.</i> nonetheless, the staff may choose to refrain from accepting a claim initiated by a parent of the victim of abuse for <i>beit din</i> resolution. Or, though there may be grounds for filing <i>lashon hara</i> (defamation) suits against individuals,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:38; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:56; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 38:2.</i> the <i>beit din</i> policy may limit the acceptance of such claims to cases involving media communications and labor relations. In our opinion, the <i>beit din</i> vetting process regarding alleged abuse should be held to the minimum. Abuse cases, due to halakhic intricacies which we have briefly outlined, varying evidentiary standards and inquiries, and the societal need to address this ongoing issue in the Jewish community, require that a <i>beit din</i>’s administrative staff accept each and every case, provided that the alleged victim submit in writing some supporting documentation corroborating his or her claim.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, <i>battei din</i> that employ a vetting process require a plaintiff’s claim statement and a defendant’s response, and those <i>battei din</i> without a vetting process do not require a claim statement. See text accompanying nn. 99-100.</i>
Most administrative staffs of <i>battei din</i> accept any and every type of case brought to them, and leave it to the discretion of the <i>dayanim</i> to decide whether a particular matter is justiciable. Consequently, the decision whether to address such claims is in the hands of <i>dayanim</i> rather than administrators.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">For a recent US Supreme Court endorsement of a vetting process pertaining to civil lawsuits in federal courts, see <i>Ashcroft v.

Some of the same arguments that support and/or question the merits of this judgment equally apply to whether a <i>beit din</i> should employ a vetting process.</i>
A <i>beit din</i>’s decision to refrain from hearing claims of abuse effectively bestows upon the injurer a form of “halakhic entitlement” to cause the injury. Perceived weakness of the <i>beit din</i> may only lead to increased violation and debasement of Halakha because others have done it with impunity. Unlike other legal systems, in Halakha, there is generally no statute of limitations in advancing such claims. Even if the alleged act of abuse was perpetrated twenty or forty years ago, a <i>beit din</i> is empowered to hear such claims today.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 98:1; <i>PDR</i> 10:363, 368. Though these sources deal with non-payment of an outstanding debt such as a loan, the continuing right to advance a claim applies equally to a <i>nezikin</i> claim that potentially may translate into an outstanding debt if so determined by a <i>beit din</i>. Even if secular law invokes a statute of limitations regarding such claims, Halakha sanctions the advancement of such claims. See <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, <i>HM</i> 28:8; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 3:134.<br>For possible exceptions to this rule, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, 79:13 (end); <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 98:2; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 104:2 in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 7 in the name of <i>Ramban</i>; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 78. All of these sources that deal with non-payment of conventional monetary debts, such as failure to make a loan repayment, ought to be applied in advancing a <i>nezikin</i> claim.<br>Given that a <i>beit din</i> decision is legally an arbitration decision, in certain states such as Georgia, Illinois, and New York and there are statutes that expressly provide that if a claim is time barred in court, it would also be time barred in an arbitration proceeding.

We hope that our articulation of these claims will allow <i>battei din</i> to live up to their mission of openly addressing the issues of the Jewish community.
<b>Addendum</b>
Should we be dealing with a <i>beit din</i> which obligated a husband to give a <i>get</i> and he refuses to comply with the <i>beit din</i>’s directive and the wife waives her right to the monetary award for spousal abuse given to her by <i>beit din</i> in exchange for receiving her <i>get</i>, it is our opinion that we are dealing with a situation of “<i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>,” coercion regarding another matter, and therefore the subsequent execution of this <i>get</i> does not produce a <i>get me’useh</i>, a coerced <i>get</i>, which would be invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">In our presentation, we explained the grounds for awarding both punitive damages and compensatory damages for a <i>nezikin</i> claim relating to spousal abuse. In our present discussion as well as in this writer’s earlier presentation in <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 163–175, we assume that the meting out of punitive damages would not run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>. In fact, such a position of meting out punitive damages is espoused by R. Daichovsky of Yerushalayim, a former <i>dayan</i> of the Supreme Rabbinical Beit Din. See S. Daichovsky, “Monetary Enforcement Steps against Recalcitrant Husbands,” (Hebrew), 26 <i>Tehumin</i>, 173,176–177 (5766), and more recently by an Israeli <i>beit din</i> that obligated a husband to give a <i>get</i>. Upon the wife’s refusal to accept the <i>get</i>, the panel ruled that for every day the wife refuses to accept the <i>get</i>, she would be penalized 300 <i>shekalim</i> a day. The grounds for meting out such damages is<i> the wife’s failure to comply with the beit din</i>’s directive, i.e., <i>bizayon beit ha-din</i>. See File no. 819035/3, Petach Tikva Regional Beit Din, October 21, 2012, which can be accessed at <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> no. 33.Whereas R. Hadaya suggested that financial penalties against a recalcitrant spouse for failing to heed the words of a <i>beit din</i> may possibly be sanctioned, the Petach Tikvah <i>beit din</i> handed down its ruling without offering any reason. See <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96. See also, <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> vol. 1, 1:5.<br>However, many may disagree with this view and contend that punitive damages are awarded in order that the husband cease and desist from his <i>get</i> recalcitrance. As such, such an award may serve as a threat to the husband and result in a <i>get me’useh</i> should the <i>get</i> be executed in exchange for the wife’s entitlement to her <i>nezikin</i> award.<br>Nonetheless, others, while rejecting the imposition of punitive marriages, may concur that given that compensatory damages is a form of relief for past injury, this debt obligation generated by a <i>beit din</i> is free standing and independent, not linked to the <i>get</i>, and thus will avoid the specter of a <i>get me’useh</i>. See recently, Eliyahu Abergil, “The validity of a <i>get</i> in light of a severe monetary award imposed by civil court,” (Hebrew) 35 <i>Tehumin</i>, 272 (5775).<br>To state it differently, whereas an award for compensatory damages for <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i> incurred from spousal rape is an example of “<i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>,” an award for punitive damages is construed as “<i>ones mamon</i>.” For a discussion of this distinction, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41,163–175<i>.</i></i> To state it differently, since the <i>nezikin</i> award was handed down because of abuse rather than as a means to coerce the husband’s granting of a <i>get</i>, if the wife waives her right to the award in exchange for the <i>get</i>, any subsequent divorce avoids the strictures of a coerced <i>get</i>.
However, some <i>Poskim</i> may view this as a <i>get me’useh shelo ke-din</i> (an improperly coerced divorce). The question is whether contemporary <i>Poskim</i> ought to validate such a <i>get be-diavad</i>, <i>ex post facto.</i> It would seem that many, possibly the majority of <i>Poskim</i> would invalidate a <i>get me’useh ex post facto</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 88b, s.v. “<i>mifsal</i>”; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 48a, s.v. “<i>ve’hain</i>”; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. “<i>yotzi</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:6; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 77a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 49a, s.v “<i>get me’useh</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 104; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573, 2:276, 4:40 in the name of <i>Ra’avad</i> and <i>Rabbeinu Hananel</i>; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 50a; <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 88b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 339 in the name of <i>Rashi</i>; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 14:8; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 41; <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 12:33; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 77:5; <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 134; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 134:7; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 205:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:138; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 63; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 134:10, 13; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 1:40; <i>Teshuvot Mahari bei Rav</i> 41; <i>Gevurot Anashim</i> 38, 48; <i>Meshoveiv Netivot</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 7, 19; <i>Teshuvot R.

See <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, op. cit.; <i>Levush Mordekhai</i> 58:2.</i> Seemingly, those contemporary authorities who argue that this is an instance of <i>get me’useh</i> would reject the validity of the executed <i>get.</i> Should either spouse remarry, questions regarding the personal status of a child sired from this relationship.
In my opinion such a conclusion is not necessarily forthcoming. Firstly, even if the majority of decisors consider a <i>get me’useh</i> to be invalid <i>ex post facto</i> that does not mean <i>ipso facto</i> that the Halakha is in accordance with the majority view.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that possibly the majority of <i>Poskim</i> contend that a <i>get me’useh</i> is null and void does not necessarily mean that we follow this view due to the fact that their position represents a numerical majority. The rule of <i>aharei rabbim le-hatot</i>, following the majority, operates within the confines of a formal <i>beit din</i> proceeding. See <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur HM</i> 13 in the name of <i>Rashba</i>; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>kelal</i> 1, 5; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Zeraim</i>, <i>Shevi’it</i> 23; <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 24–25, 50–51. Similiarily, whether normative Halakha ought to align itself with the numerical majority who views a <i>get me’useh</i> as null and void may require the convening of Torah scholars who would exchange their opinions and engage in a give and take regarding the matter and resolve the issue. See <i>Teshuvot Maharlbah</i>, <i>Kuntres ha-Semikha</i>; Rabbinic Authority, supra n. 41, 24–25.</i> Secondly, it is this author’s hope that contemporary authorities, similar to <i>Poskim</i> in the past<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Behag</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i>, Machon Yerushalayim ed., 418; <i>Orhot Hayyim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gittin</i> 80b; <i>Teshuvot Beit Avi</i> 4:143, 169 in the name of <i>Rabbeinu Yeruham</i>; <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 48b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:41; <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 9:27; <i>Teshuvot Agudat Eizov</i>, <i>EH</i> 19:18 in the name of <i>Ra’avad</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i>, <i>EH</i> 262 (3, 9); <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:184; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 63, cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>EH</i> 134, <i>Ha-gahot Beit Yosef</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Ma’aseh Hiya</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 167 (238c–d); <i>Teshuvot Beit Avi</i>, <i>EH</i> 169; O.

Following in Rambam’s footsteps, these contemporary authorities would be endorsing the view of some well-respected <i>Aharonim</i> including R. O. Yosef that if she remarries, she can remain with her second husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 144; <i>Hagahot ha-Tur</i> 21 and <i>Hagahot ha-Beit Yosef</i> 21–22 in the name of <i>Maharshal</i>, <i>Mabit</i>, <i>Maharashdam</i>, and <i>Ranah</i>. Additionally, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:187; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 35; O.

A resolution of their actual views is beyond the scope of this presentation.</i>
Moreover, one may factor into consideration those <i>Poskim</i> who are lenient <i>ex post facto</i> in cases of monetary compulsion.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 40b, s.v. “<i>giluyi</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Maharach Ohr Zarua</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:110, 2:7; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, <i>EH</i> 125.<br>Said conclusion was attributed by the following <i>Poskim</i> to <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:40: <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Ribot</i> 291; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 2:77; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 35.</i> Furthermore, Maharashdam, Oneg Yom Tov, and R. Herzog, though admitting that many disagree with Rambam’s view, nevertheless they conclude that <i>Rambam</i>’s <i>psak</i> ought to be controlling and in a case of halakhic doubt, one should rule in accordance with his posture.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 128; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 168; Notes of R. Herzog, <i>Otzar ha-Poskim</i>, vol. 2, section 4 (pp. 1–2), section 20 (p. 5); <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:2–3.</i>
Furthermore, Radakh and Hazon Ish contend that the existence of a majority view is to be viewed as “<i>itmar hilkhisa” –</i> the Halakha has been decided and one therefore cannot impart legitimacy to an individual opinion, even in extenuating circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Radakh</i>, <i>bayit</i> 3, <i>heder</i> 1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>YD</i> 160:3–4.</i> It appears that in their mind, “abiding by the majority” in halakhic controversy is akin to following the majority in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. However, R. Ovadiah Yosef <sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yehave Da’at</i>, vol. 1, 25–29.</i>and others<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 51.</i> contend that debating a halakhic issue when the disputants are in absentia of each other and the emerging controvery is inter-generational, abiding by the majority does not necessarily apply. As such, the issue remains as a <i>safek</i> (doubt) and invoking a <i>sefek sefeka</i>, a double doubt, emerges in our scenario as a distinct possibility. And, in fact, as we mentioned, there are many <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to the view that a <i>get me’useh</i> is null and void, yet in a case of <i>sefek sefeka</i>, they aligned themselves with Rambam’s view.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 7, 13; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Torah</i> 3:63; R. Herzog, supra n. 133.<br>In fact, <i>ex ante</i> Hatam Sofer allowed a <i>beit din</i> to coerce a husband who was incapable of supporting his wife due to an illness by invoking a <i>sefek sefeka</i>. Possibly normative Halakha follows Rambam’s view, that in such a case there are grounds for coercion, and even if we accept the views of others that this an instance of a <i>get me’useh</i>, maybe a <i>get</i> mistakenly coerced is biblically valid. See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:131 (1). Consequently, should a <i>sefek sefeka</i> emerge <i>ex post facto</i> regarding the execution of a <i>get</i> in exchange for a wife’s waiving her <i>nezikin</i> award, Hatam Sofer would <i>a fortiori</i> agree that the <i>get</i> is valid.<br>Disagreeing with Hatam Sofer, <i>Hazon Ish</i>, supra n. 126 contends that given that the <i>beit din</i> overruled the Shulhan Aruch’s <i>psak</i>, which proscribes the meting of coercion in this case, therefore any executed <i>get</i> would be construed as a <i>get me’useh</i>. One may extrapolate from Hazon Ish’s view that a <i>beit din</i> that validates this couple’s exchange based on their perception of Halakha rather than intentionally transgressing it, should result that any executed <i>get</i> is valid <i>ex post facto</i>.<br>The question is whether a <i>sefek sefeka</i> will override a <i>hezkat issur of eishit ish,</i> a wife’s personal status that prohibits her to others. <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, op. cit<i>.</i>; <i>Sha’arei Torah</i>, op. cit.; R. Herzog, op. cit., explicitly follow the <i>Poskim</i> who argue that a <i>sefek sefeka</i> trumps a <i>hezkat issur</i>, endowed with the status of being forbidden such as <i>eishit ish</i> (a married woman). See <i>Ketuvot</i> 22b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:401; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i>, <i>EH</i> 43; <i>Badei ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>YD</i> 110 (277) in the name of <i>Maharit</i>, <i>Kereti u-Pleti</i>, and <i>Torat ha-Shelamin</i>.<br>Others contend that a <i>sefek sefeka</i> cannot override a <i>hezkat issur</i>. See <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 110:27, 29–30 and <i>Poskim</i> cited in <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> 6, <i>EH</i> 3:9–15.<br>However, according to some <i>Poskim</i>, a <i>sefek sefeka</i> will neutralize a <i>hezkat issur</i> provided that there are other se<i>nifim</i> (lit. appendages), supporting reasons to be lenient. See <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 1:7, 183; <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sasson</i> 4:9; <i>Teshuvot Maharhash</i> 4:56, 59. In our situation, we have offered additional reasons to validate a <i>get</i> executed under such circumstances <i>ex post facto</i> and consequently, the <i>sefek sefeka</i> should be determinative.<br>Implicit in our application of <i>sefek sefeka</i> to our situation is that it is predicated upon the notion that such a type of doubt may be determinative where there is a halakhic dispute. See <i>Teshuvot Ma’aset Binyamin</i> 56; <i>Pri Hadash</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 110, <i>Kelalei Sefek Sefeka</i>, 17; <i>Darkhei Teshuva</i> on <i>Tur</i>, <i>YD</i> 110:369. Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1276.<br>Thus, for all the aforesaid reasons, despite the fact that a wife was awarded monetary relief due to her inability to remarry and/or have children, any subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> ought to be recognized <i>ex post facto</i> by all segments of our Torah-observant community.</i> In other words, there may be uncertainties regarding the Halakha that stem from controversies amongst the earlier authorities that create a <i>sefek sefeka</i>, and one may rule leniently in such a situation. In our case, some contemporary <i>Poskim</i> may contend that the executed <i>get</i> is valid ex post facto due to the existence of a <i>sefek sefeka</i>. First, there is a <i>safek</i> whether awarding a <i>nezikin</i> claim for spousal abuse produces a <i>get me’useh shelo ka-din</i> and second, there is a <i>safek</i> whether a <i>get me’useh shelo ka-din</i> is null and void. Consequently, one should follow the lenient opinion of Rambam and others and conclude that the execution of a <i>get</i> under such circumstances is invalid, but not null and void. As R. S. Tzvi Gartner, a well-respected authority on <i>kefiyat get</i> and a veteran <i>dayan</i> of Monsey, NY and Yerushalayim writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kefiya be-Get</i> 207. R. Yehuda Fris, another Yerushalmi <i>dayan</i>, arrives at a similar conclusion. See <i>Yad Yehuda</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gittin</i> 154:1, <i>s.v.</i> “<i>kelalei pesika be kefiyat-get.</i>”<br>Whether Rabbis Gartner and Fris would concur that there is a <i>safek</i> whether such a <i>nezikin</i> claim would produce a <i>get me’useh</i> we leave as an open question.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Some <i>Aharonim</i> have ruled against Rambam but there are those who state Rambam is not a minority opinion, and we should rely upon him for <i>sefek sefeka</i> to act leniently. Consequently, if a woman received <i>kiddushin</i> from another, she requires another <i>get</i>.</span>
Furthermore, the majority opinion that a monetary imposition constitutes <i>ones mamon</i> (monetary duress) and therefore its imposition creates a <i>get me’useh</i> which is null and void, is predicated upon the levying of an exorbitant sum of money by a <i>beit din</i>. However, if the <i>nezikin</i> award is a small amount, it is financially non-threatening and therefore it is permissible avoiding the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">For further discussion what amount constitutes an <i>ones mamon</i>, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 41, 163–165.</i> Consequently, should we be dealing with a small award for spousal abuse, the question of a <i>get me’useh shelo ka-din ex post facto</i> does not come into question.
However, as we explained, even if we are dealing with a substantial monetary award, contemporary <i>Poskim</i> ought to either follow Rambam’s view, as others have done, and/or invoke a <i>sefek sefeka</i> which would validate a <i>get me’useh shelo ke-din be-diavad.</i>
Finally, even when there exists illicit coercion, it may be valid ex post facto if the couple is separated, in that the husband is exempt from providing food, clothing, and lodging, and is free to remarry. Under such circumstances accompanied by other arguments for permitting remarriage, R. Feinstein concludes that she can remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 3:44.</i>
If a wive receives a <i>get</i> in exchange for waiving her right to a <i>nezikin</i> award, it is incumbent upon <i>Poskim</i> to refrain from deciding in a stringent fashion by invalidating the <i>get</i> lest one cast <i>“la-az al ha-Rishonim”</i> (aspersions upon the early Sages), even if Rambam’s view is possibly a minority opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pri Hadash</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 496.</i> Furthermore, should one invalidate the <i>get</i>, it means that one is contesting the propriety of these executed divorces and any future offspring sired by either spouse who remarried would be impacted in terms of his personal status as a member of the Jewish community. Consequently, <i>Poskim</i> who argue that the <i>nezikin</i> award creates a <i>get me’useh</i> and claim that any resultant <i>get</i> is null and void ought to refrain from advancing their views to avoid the child having the halakhic stigma of a “<i>mamzer</i>” (a halakhic bastard).<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mayyim Amukim</i> 12; <i>Batei Knesiyot</i>, infra n. 143; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, <i>OH</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot Semikha le-Hayyim</i>, <i>OH</i> 1; <i>Sefer Tal Imrati</i>, 275–276.<br>If a <i>get</i> is executed under these conditions, and if subsequently remarriage occurs, it should be no worse than coercing a <i>get</i> based upon a wife’s <i>ma’is alai</i> (“he is repulsive to me”) plea, and if she subsequently remarries, we refrain from casting aspersions upon the <i>get ex post facto</i>.

Implicit in this approach is that in situations of <i>shev ve-al ta’aseh</i> (lit. “sit and do not act”), passive abrogation, a <i>Posek</i> may hand down a decision against the <i>get</i>; however, in a case of <i>kum ve-aseh</i> (lit. “arise and do”), an active abrogration, such as invalidating a <i>get</i>, he should refrain from deciding against it.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Get Pashut</i> 125:3; <i>Teshuvot Ein Mishpat</i> (Malki) 1; <i>Teshuvot Batei Kenesiyot</i> (Avraham ben Ezra) 1, <i>Beit Melo</i> 124; E.

In fact, a contemporary <i>beit din</i> headed by R. Avraham Sherman mentioned approvingly a <i>psak</i> of R. Burdigo regarding the need to refrain from casting aspersions upon the propriety of a <i>get</i> that stems from a marriage that may have been a <i>kiddushin al tenai</i>, a conditional marriage and/or may be a <i>get me’useh</i>, letting the children be stigmatized as <i>mamzerim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpatim Yesharim</i> 1:117; File no. 9225-64-3, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

In sum, for all the aforesaid reasons, even if some <i>Poskim</i> reject the validity of such a <i>nezikin</i> award, any subsequent <i>get</i> rendered by a <i>beit din</i> ought to be recognized by all segments of our community.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">In the event that the husband refuses to appear in <i>beit din</i> regarding the <i>nezikin</i> claim and the wife receives authorization from the <i>beit din</i> or a rabbinic authority to litigate this claim in civil court, and should the award comply with halakhic guidelines, should a <i>get</i> be executed it should subsequently be <i>pasul</i> rather than <i>batel</i>, even according to <i>Poskim</i> who argue that the <i>nezikin</i> award would create a <i>get me’useh shelo ka-din</i>.

Chapter 4; An Employer's Vicarious Liability for an Employee's Sexual Misconduct

<b>An Employer’s Vicarious Liability for an Employee’s Sexual Misconduct</b><br>In recent years, some of the rabbis, teachers, administrators, and health care professionals who were employed by our <i>yeshivot</i>, synagogues, and youth organizations of the Orthodox Jewish community have been convicted of child abuse.
How ought Halakha deal today with a yeshiva in New York City that employs a Jewish administrator, principal, or teacher who abuses one of its Jewish students? Though in our presentation, we will be addressing sexual abuse, our conclusions are not limited to sexual abuse, but encompass other forms of harassment, including assault, bullying, hazing, and sexual harassment. In the event that a victim files <i>nezikin</i> (civil damage) claims against the abuser’s employer in <i>beit din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For an earlier discussion regarding the types of claims a victim of abuse may advance against his abuser in <i>beit din</i>, see ch. 3 of this monograph.<br>The assumption of our presentation is that either the perpetrator has been criminally convicted by a court, or that the <i>beit din</i> will assess whether in fact he/she is an abuser. Once this determination has been rendered by a civil court or <i>a beit din</i>, the <i>beit din</i> would proceed to address the issue of the employer’s monetary liability for the employee’s sexual misbehavior.</i> the question arises whether the yeshiva is responsible to pay the victim of abuse.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For earlier treatments of the issue of employer liability relating to <i>nezikin</i> (injury) see Shillem Warhaftig, <i>Jewish Labor Law</i> (Hebrew), Yerushalayim, 1969, 929-951; Haim Hefetz, “Vicarious Liability in Jewish Law,” (Hebrew), 6 <i>Dinei Yisrael</i> 49 (5735); <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 44; Michael Wygoda, <i>Agency Law: Section 11</i>, Yerushalayim: Ministry of Justice. Many of the sources for sections 1–2 of this presentation have been culled from the aforementioned studies.<br>Even if the yeshiva has been incorporated, the corporate entity and its employees may be respectively institutionally and personally liable for any <i>nezikin</i> claims. See this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 65–110.</i> Are there grounds for a victim of abuse to file a claim that he suffered diminished educational opportunities and educational accomplishments, diminished wages and salaries, as well as a non-economic claim for pain and suffering, against the employer of the abuser?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Whether all these particular <i>nezikin</i> claims are valid grounds for monetary damages in Halakha is beyond the scope of our presentation. Alternatively, parties may choose to opt for resolving their matters in accordance with secular law. For the halakhic underpinnings for such an arrangement, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 2, 197–199.</i> Should in fact the institution be held responsible, we would in effect be invoking the notion of vicarious liability (or <i>respondeat superior</i>, lit. “the superior must answer”) which means that Halakha would hold an individual responsible for the misconduct of another, even though the individual is free from recklessness, personal blame, or fault, and is, in that sense, “innocent” of any wrongdoing. The modern justification for <i>respondeat superior</i> within the context of labor relations is that the employer chooses the worker, he controls the work and profits, and therefore he should also have to bear the risk, as he is in better position to absorb losses than his employee and therefore will be financially able to compensate for such injuries.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rochelle R. Weber, “Scope of Employment Redefined: Holding Employers Vicariously Liable for Sexual Assaults Committed by their Employees,” 76 <i>Minnesota Law Rev.</i> 1513, 1519–1520 (1992).</i> Secondly, should a yeshiva or, for that matter, any Jewish institution which services the needs of our children, be halakhically treated in the same fashion in terms of responsibility as an employer who is concerned about a third party’s entrance into the workplace? Finally, is the yeshiva liable for acts of an employee’s abuse even when the yeshiva has exercised reasonable care to correct and prevent any such misconduct?
<b>I. An Employer’s Responsibility for Bodily Injury Caused to his Employee</b>
In the absence of an employer’s negligent behavior causing the injury, the threshold question is whether the employer is responsible for any bodily injury caused to his employee. If in fact, the employer is not liable, then there would be no grounds to even consider whether an employer ought to be responsible for injury caused to a third party, such as a student abused by an administrator or teacher in a school setting.
Addressing the <i>mitzva</i> of erecting a <i>ma’akeh</i>, a parapet on one’s roof, and the prohibition against standing idly by someone’s death, Sefer ha-Hinukh writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat aseh</i> 538.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We realize that the Almighty, in his divine providence, knows exactly what will happen to every man, whether good or bad, decreeing according to his merits … Nevertheless, man must take all necessary precautions in every circumstance, for God created a world which follows the laws of nature: Fire burns and water extinguishes a flame … Likewise, someone falling of a high rooftop will die … Since by divine wisdom, our bodies … are subject to the laws of nature, He has commanded us to take all necessary precautions …</span>
As Rambam states,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, <i>mitzvat aseh</i> 184.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We have been commanded to remove all obstacles and danger from our homes and therefore we have to construct a wall to encircle the roof and around our pits … in order that no one may fall into them.</span>
Strikingly, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> extends beyond the duty to construct a fence upon one’s roof. As Sefer ha-Hinukh aptly notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, supra n. 5.</i> “The fact that Torah mentions ‘your roof’ – the Torah speaking in the usual case.”
In other words, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> is to serve as a paradigm for dealing with multifarious life situations beyond the actual building of a fence around a roof to avoid risk and danger to human life.
Sensitive to this understanding of the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i>, already Rabbi Nathan in the Talmud exhorts us,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 15b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One who raises a wild dog or uses a rickety ladder in one’s home transgresses the verse “one should not place blood in one’s home.”</span>
The commandment to provide a safe environment for both occupants of one’s home and third parties is not limited to one’s rooftop, but extends to raising a wild animal or using a rickety ladder in one’s residence. The violation of “one should not place blood in one’s home” (Devarim 22:8) extends beyond the failure to place a fence around one’s roof and encompasses the failure to monitor one’s pets as well as being derelict in maintaining the utility and safety of objects found in one’s home such as a ladder.
Noncompliance with the duty of constructing a <i>ma’akeh</i> entails the nullification of a positive commandment to construct a fence, as well as the negative commandment of “one should not place blood in one’s home.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rambam</i>, <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, <i>mitzvat aseh</i> 184; <i>mitzvat lo ta’seh</i> 298.</i> As such, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> is a halakhic-moral obligation, which is usually unenforceable by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 410:4; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i>, <i>HM</i> 44.</i>
Following in the footsteps of R. Nathan and the Sefer ha-Hinukh and realizing that the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> is a halakhic-moral obligation that encompasses multifarious situations, R. Epstein and R. Uziel contend that hazardous materials found in the workplace are to be regulated based upon the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i>. In other words, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> is not limited to protecting an individual in one’s home, but equally extends to one’s place of employment. Moreover, as we noted, it is <i>mitzva</i> with no halakhic-legal consequences. Therefore, in order to be able to hold an employer halakhically-legally accountable for bodily injuries caused to one’s employees by hazardous materials found in the workplace, R. Epstein and R. Uziel suggest that one must invoke the <i>nezikin</i> (injury) claim of <i>bor</i>, a pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i> and <i>Mishpetei Uziel</i>, supra n.10</i> The claim of <i>bor</i> covers scenarios in which an obstacle is created by an individual’s negligence, and another person is injured. The classic example is that of a person who digs a pit in a public thoroughfare, leaves it uncovered, and an animal falls into it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot</i> 21:33–34</i> Adopting the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>bor</i> as the avenue for addressing an employer’s liability for the injury caused by potentially hazardous material in the workplace will depend on whether the employer’s permission to allow the worker to enter the workplace <i>ipso facto</i> means that he assumes responsibility for an employer’s claim of <i>nezikin</i>. This issue is a matter of halakhic debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 398:5; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 389:10.</i> For those <i>Poskim</i> who argue that the employee’s entry into the workplace means that his employer assumes responsibility for any injury caused to the employee, then based upon <i>hilkhot bor</i>, the employer may be mandated by a <i>beit din</i> to pay for the injury. On the other hand, for those <i>Poskim</i> who contend that a worker’s entry into the work place does not assume an employer’s willingness to compensate the employee for potential injury, a <i>beit din</i> may not obligate him to pay damages. In short, whether an employer is responsible vis-à-vis the employee for exposure to hazardous materials in the workplace is subject to debate.
However, is an employer liable for directing an employee to engage in actual work that entails a danger to him? For example, knowing that an employee worked for their enemy, an employer’s creditors attack the employee, injure him and steal the merchandise. In this case, R. Yosef Trani obligates the employer to compensate his employee for his losses, which were caused by the employer’s negligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:156.</i> Said conclusion was drawn by R. Trani’s inference from Rashba’s posture,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot la-Ramban</i> 20.</i> a view which was subsequently endorsed by R. Moshe Isserles.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:48.</i> And in fact, a few other <i>Poskim</i> concur that in cases of an employer’s negligence, he is responsible to pay for the bodily injury incurred by the employee.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, <i>HM</i> 176; <i>Teshuvot Bnei Binyamin</i> (Navon), <i>HM</i> 35.</i> However, given that the employer did not assume responsibility to protect his employee’s bodily integrity, and given that many decisors reject the notion that an individual may be a <i>shomer</i> of the bodily integrity of another individual, many <i>Poskim</i> demur and contend therefore that he is exempt from liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 89:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 96; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:48; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 176:60; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, s<i>horesh</i> 131; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 435; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i>, <i>OH</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Gur Arye Yehuda</i>, <i>HM</i> 18; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 11:21.<br>However, some decisors argue that an employer is liable according to <i>dinei shamayim</i>, the laws of heaven, or <i>midat hassidut</i>, the standard of saintliness. See <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, op. cit<i>.</i>; <i>Gur Arye Yehuda</i>, op. cit.; <i>Maharashdam</i>, op. cit.<br>Alternatively, R. Schwadron contends that a <i>peshara</i> should be brokered regarding the matter. See <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, supra n. 17.<br>Regarding authorities who reject the idea that an individual can be a <i>shomer</i> of someone else’s body, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot la-Ramban</i>, 20; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 89:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 435; <i>Taz</i>, op. cit.; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, op. cit.</i> In short, in the event that there is no negligence on the part of the employer in the employee’s bodily injury or the injury to the laborer failed to transpire during the time of employment, many <i>Poskim</i> argue that the employer is exempt from responsibility.
Implicit in this conclusion is that liability for one’s behavior rests with the one who causes the injury rather than a third party, even when it is in a position of authority. Dating back to the time of the Second Beit ha-Mikdash (Temple), we encounter that the <i>Perushim</i> (the Pharisees), those who accepted the teachings of our Oral Law, and the <i>Tzedukim</i> (the Sadducees), those who rejected their rulings, already debated whether in fact Judaism accepts the notion of an employer’s vicarious liability for his employee’s actions. Recounting this controversy, the Mishnah in <i>Yadayim</i> informs us,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Yadayim</i> 4:7.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The <i>Tzedukim</i> said: We are protesting against you <i>Perushim</i>. If you argue that my ox and donkey who are exempt from <i>mitzvot</i>, that I am liable for the injury it caused, likewise my bondsman and bondswoman that are obligated in <i>mitzvot</i>, isn’t it clear that I would be obligated to pay for the injury they caused? They replied to them: No – If you say this regarding my ox and donkey who are bereft of intelligence, should we likewise say the same regarding my bondsman and bondswoman who possess intelligence? For if I anger them, they may go out and set on fire someone’s stack and I shall be liable to pay.</span>
In other words, according to the <i>Perushim</i>, the servant’s master is not liable for the damage caused by the servant.
Subscribing to the <i>Perushim</i>’s view, post-Talmudic authorities such as Tosafot and Meiri conclude that even if the slave intended to harm another individual, his master is not responsible for any ensuing damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 4a, s.v. “<i>lav</i>”; <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 4a.</i> Similarly, if a servant steals, his master is not duty-bound to pay for the theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 349.</i> The concept of individual responsibility is not limited to a master-servant relationship, but extends equally to halakhic marital ties. As Mishnah instructs us, though during her marriage a wife who injures somebody is exempt to pay for the injury caused,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Her nonpayment relates to a wife’s matrimonial property rights, which is a matter beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> nonetheless, upon divorce she is obligated to pay from her assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 87a.</i> Or should the wife own assets during the marriage that are not under the husband’s control, she must remit compensation during the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 424:14.</i> In short, a wife is responsible for the damage she caused to others.
The responsibility of a wife as well as a slave for damages is a reflection of the general rule that if Levi instructs Yehuda to violate Halakha and Yehuda does so, Yehuda is liable and Levi is not. For example, if Levi tells Yehuda to dig a pit, which Yehuda does, and Moshe falls into the pit and is injured, Yehuda is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 410:8.</i> Or, to give another example: An owner of hops entrusted his hops to a <i>shomer</i> (bailee) who has his own hops, and the <i>shomer</i> instructed his servant to put some hops into the beer, pointing to his own hops. However, the servant inadvertently placed the bailor’s hops into the beer instead. Subsequently, the bailor sued to recover the value of his hops. <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules that the <i>shomer</i> is exempt from responsibility. The servant is also not obligated to pay since his master, the <i>shomer</i>, did not specifically instruct him to put these hops in and not the others. Since the bailee’s instructions to place “some hops into the beer” were unclear in regard to whose hops, the servant is not liable to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:25.</i> Obviously, had the <i>shomer</i>’s instructions been clear and had the servant failed to comply with them, the servant would have been obligated to pay for the value of the hops. Here again, Halakha recognizes the notion of individual responsibility for one’s behavior. The one exception to the rule of individual responsibility is that a minor who engages in <i>nezikin</i> is exempt from responsibility when he attains majority age.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">However, should the minor benefit from the injury caused, then he must compensate. See <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:177.<br>Even though a minor is exempt from payment, nevertheless for educational reasons, a <i>beit din</i> is authorized to monetarily penalize a minor who is a <i>mazik.</i> See <i>Shevut Ya’akov</i>, ibid.; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i>, 1:432.</i> But here again, this exception is understandable and reflects the halakhic affirmation of individual responsibility. Since the act of <i>nezikin</i> was committed during a period when a minor is exempt from <i>mitzvot</i>, and responsibility only commences for actions done when one reaches majority age, therefore a minor is exempt from liability even upon attaining the age of majority.
In short, the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>ma’akeh</i> instructs us that an individual Jew must provide a safe environment that will minimize the exposure to risk. Secondly, the concept of individual responsibility undergirds the interaction between individuals, including but not limited to master-servant ties, spousal relationships, bailment matters, and relationships with minors. In sum, in responding to the question of whether an individual is responsible for the damage caused by someone else, the Talmudic reply is “an individual is obligated to protect his own body.” <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 4a.</i>
<b>II. An Employer’s Responsibility for Injury Caused by his Employee</b>
A similar conclusion that we found regarding injury caused to the employee may be found in the context of an employer’s responsibility for injury caused <i>by his worker</i>. For example, in a <i>baraita</i> we encounter the following teaching,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 118b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Our Rabbis taught: Once the quarryman has delivered [the stones for building] to the chiseler [for polishing and smoothing], the latter is responsible [for any damage caused by them]; the chiseler having delivered them to the hauler, the latter is responsible; the hauler having delivered to the porter, the latter is responsible; the porter delivers the stones to the bricklayer, the latter is responsible; the bricklayer delivers them to the foreman (to set the stones in place), the latter is responsible. But if after he had placed the stone properly in place, it caused damage, all are responsible. But has it not been taught: only the last is responsible, while the others are exempt? – There is no difficulty – the second refers to a laborer, the first case to an independent contractor.</span>
Addressing the situation of injury caused to the employer or a third party by a laborer, the <i>baraita</i> directs its attention to whether the other workers who are employed on the same project are responsible to pay for the damages caused. Does it make a difference whether we are dealing with a group of contractors who are being compensated for a project or a group of wage earners who are paid by the hour?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">For this distinction between a laborer and contractor, see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 112b, s.v. “<i>kablanut</i>”; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 9:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 333:5. For additional analysis towards defining the relationship between an employer and a laborer, see Berachyahu Lifshitz, <i>Employee and Independent Contractor: Acquisitions and Obligations in Contract</i>, (Hebrew), Yerushalayim 1993.</i> The Tannaitic reply is that if the damage was directly caused by a worker, regardless of whether we are dealing with workers who earn an hourly wage or contractors who are compensated based upon the completion of a project, liability resides solely with the <i>mazik</i>, the tortfeasor. As the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> states,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i>, supra n. 29.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Once the quarryman has delivered [the stones for building] to the chiseler [for polishing and smoothing], the latter is responsible [for any damage caused to a third party].</span>
And such a conclusion is seen as authoritative amongst the authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 118b; <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Bava Metzia Shita Mekubetzet</i> 118b.</i> Accordingly, if the actual damage transpired after the worker completed his job, then one must distinguish between a group of laborers and a group of contractors. Concerning the latter group of contractors, given that they all were partners in this enterprise and were jointly responsible for any ensuing damage, they all are jointly responsible to pay for the damages. However, a wage earner is hired to perform a particular job, and therefore only the last one will be liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’avad</i>, supra n. 32; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 384:4.</i>
On the other hand, in addressing a scenario of a contractor causing damage, the Mishnah in Bava Metzia instructs us,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 98b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a builder undertook to remove a wall and broke the stones or damaged someone,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See textual variant found in <i>Dikdukei Soferim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 98b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:14; <i>Rashash</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 98b.</i> he would be liable to pay.</span>
Accordingly, if a builder is contracted to demolish the wall, and he breaks the stones during the dismantling or injures a passerby, the builder is liable. The inference drawn from this Mishnaic ruling is that if we are dealing with a builder who has been hired on a per diem basis, if he causes property damage or he himself injures a third party from the dismantling of the stones, the employer as well as the employee would be jointly responsible in paying damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nizkei Mamon</i> 13:18; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 384:4.</i> The rationale is that an employer will supervise his wage earner’s job and therefore he is responsible for any <i>nezek</i> (damage) that was done by his laborer during his employment while working with his employer’s property. On the other hand, an employer has neither control nor the capacity to supervise a contractor’s work; therefore, he is exempt for any <i>nezek</i> committed by his employee. Clearly, should an employer of a group of contractors undertake to accept joint responsibility for damages incurred in the <i>baraita</i> case, he would share in the liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 118b; <i>Ra’avad</i>, supra n. 32.</i> However, should the pain continue to persist after the actual injury, the laborer is solely responsible for the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Nofet Tzufim</i> (Burdugo), vol. 1, <i>HM</i> 395.</i>
As is aptly noted by R. Sha’anan, a <i>dayan</i> who served on Tel Aviv’s <i>beit din</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 44 (463).</i> the aforementioned Mishnah and subsequent halakhic discussions are silent regarding employer’s liability for other types of <i>nezek</i>, such as the case of an employee who during the performance of work tramples on another person’s property located on the work site. Moreover, there is silence regarding whether employer liability extends to an employee who assaults or sexually abuses a coworker or a third party while on the job. It seems that in these instances, sole responsibility for such misconduct resides with the laborer. Consequently, it would seem a principal or teacher who abuses his student is solely liable for his own misbehavior. In fact, assuming a particular state permits corporal punishment of students by teachers, if a teacher utilizes excessive force in attempting to educate a student, he, rather than the employer, is responsible to pay for damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 50a; <i>Gittin</i> 31a; <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 245:9. For further discussion regarding this issue, see this writer’s “Corporal Punishment in School: A Study in the Interaction of Halakha and American Law with Social Morality,” 37 <i>Tradition</i> 57 (Fall 2003).</i> But, is a student in a yeshiva setting to be treated halakhically like a third party in the conventional workplace?
<b>III. The Halakhic Mandate for a Safe Workplace</b>
If in fact, the yeshiva, as the employer, is exempt from responsibility for any monetary claims advanced by the victim of abuse against one of the yeshiva’s employees; does that mean the yeshiva is absolved from introducing policies of hiring, supervision, and training dealing with sexual misconduct, which would hopefully create a safe environment for students? Firstly, Halakha is concerned for the victim of abuse, and ensuring that abuse does not take place must be of primary concern. In addition, the establishment and employment of such policies serve as a concrete articulation of our covenanted responsibility of <i>arevut</i>, guaranteeing that our fellow Jew observes Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 9:9–14.<i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 19.</i> Obviously, engaging in child abuse in any shape or form of improper touching or fondling is a halakhic violation.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 20:1; <i>Beit Shmuel</i> and <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, ad locum.</i> Hence, an employer, similar to every individual Jew is duty-bound to ensure that his employees are engaging in proper conduct, and thus must introduce policies with the aim of preventing employees and third parties from working in a sexually hostile environment.
Moreover, our duty to promote a safe worksite is underscored by our mandated love of our fellow man, as Sefer ha-Hinukh observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat aseh</i> 219.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One should act with his friend as he is accustomed to behave for himself, to protect his property and to prevent that injuries befall him … If he injures his property or pains him, he has transgressed this positive commandment.</span>
Consequently, the <i>weltanschauung</i> of Halakha based upon the notion of love of our fellowman and <i>arevut</i> would entail that the employer properly screen his potential employees by interviewing them and contacting their references. And once employed, the employee ought to be supervised and receive training in proper sexual behavior.
Furthermore, Halakha is not merely concerned with the prevention of improper sexual misconduct in the workplace. Failure for a yeshiva or any Jewish institution for that matter to deal with actual abusive behavior occurring under their watch entails a violation of “And thou shall restore it to him.” Summarizing the interplay between <i>mitzva</i> of <i>lo ta’amod al dam re’ekha</i>, the obligation to assist somebody in peril, and “And thou shall restore it to him,” the duty to restore a lost object to its owner, R. J. David Bleich writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Judaism and Healing</i>, Ktav: NY 1981, 1, 3–4.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The obligation to save the life of an endangered person is derived … from the verse “Nor shall you stand idly by the blood of your fellow …” The Talmud and the various codes of Jewish law offer specific examples of situations in which a moral obligation exists with regard to rendering aid. These include the rescue of a person drowning in a river, assistance to one being mauled by wild beasts, and aid to a person under attack by bandits …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This obligation is predicated upon the scriptural exhortation with regard to the restoration of lost property, “And you shall restore it to him” … On the basis of a pleonasm in the Hebrew text, the Talmud declares that this verse includes an obligation to restore a fellow-man’s body as well as his property …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A latter day authority, R. Yehudah Leib Zirelson, in his Teshuvot Atzei ha-Levanon, no. 61 argues cogently that the obligations posited by the Gemara … apply under non-life threatening circumstances no less than in life-threatening situations. The verse “And you shall restore it to him” … mandates not only the return of lost property, but <i>a fortiori</i>, preservation of life as well … Accordingly, declares Atzei ha-Levanon, restoration of health to a person suffering from an illness is assuredly included in the commandment “And you shall restore it to him.”</span>
In short, the divine imperative of “And thou shall restore it to him” is not limited to the recovery of lost objects but equally encompasses the restoration of psychological well being, as well as physical health, of a fellow Jew.
This obligation is enforceable, as is evident from the immunity granted to the rescuer for any injury committed during the saving of the recued party. Additionally, despite the fact that the rescuer has the right to sue the rescued party for any financial expenses incurred during the rescue operation,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 264; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 265; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 267:26, 380:4.</i> nonetheless, the failure to restore health does not result in any legal consequences.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Rotze’ach u-Shemirat ha-Nefesh</i> 1:14, 16.</i> The duty is a halakhic-moral obligation that a Jew must comply with in order to fulfill the requirements of Heaven, i.e., <i>hayav be-dinei shamayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>din shamayim</i>, which generally cannot be dealt with by an earthly Jewish court, may be addressed in a <i>beit din</i> under certain prescribed conditions. See Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i>, 174, 188–190.</i>
To state it differently, a Jewish institution is not only obligated based upon the norms of love of one’s fellowman and <i>arevut</i> to professionally create and implement policies regarding hiring, which entails background checking and fingerprinting, supervising, and training of employees regarding sexual misconduct. Employee training should deal with such matters as meeting alone with students, appropriate physical contact, suitable topics of conversation, and going to students’ homes and having students in their homes. Implicit in such a mandate is that the yeshiva as an employer is duty-bound to serve as a <i>shomer</i> over the bodily integrity of its students.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 359, 461; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:48; <i>Maharik</i>, supra n. 18; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot To’ein ve-Nit’an</i> 5:2. One of the primary objections to this view is that <i>hilkhot shomerim</i> is conventionally understood as limited to the guarding of movable objects rather than human beings. See <i>Shemot</i> 22:6–9; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 227:19; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 176:48. For an employer’s liability as a <i>shomer</i>, see infra nn. 105–107.<br>Whether the institution and the employee serve as an <i>apotropus</i>, a guardian vis-à-vis the children, is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> Any suspicion of sexual abuse should be recorded and investigated, and the individual should be monitored. As we have seen, whereas the halakhot of labor relations preempt an employer’s responsibility for bodily injury caused by his employee to a third party, here, when dealing with an institution that is servicing children and therefore acting in a custodial, caretaker capacity, they mandate that certain administrative policies be established and implemented.
Moreover, should an actual act of abuse occur, prompt action ought to be taken against the employee by discharge based upon the halakhic imperative of “and you shall restore it to him,” i.e., insuring the psychological health of the victim of abuse. Finally, assuming there is a credible allegation of abuse and there are reasonable grounds that the abuse transpired (“<i>raglayim le-davar</i>”) or actual knowledge of an act of abuse, the employer must comply with the mandated reporting laws of the state where the abuse occurred, and if required by law, ought to notify the civil authorities regarding the incident.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83b in the name of <i>Ritva</i>; R. Sinai Adler, <i>Devar Sinai</i>, (Yerushalayim: 5760), 45–46 (R. Elyashiv’s opinion); “A Treatise Regarding Your Friend’s Blood” (Hebrew), 15 <i>Yeshurun</i> 634, 641 (5765) (R. Elyashiv’s opinion), <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, vol. 4, 207, 210 (R. Elyashiv’s opinion). See also <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, vol. 4, 207, 208 (R. Waldenburg’s opinion).<br>However, if the alleged abuse was based upon flimsy evidence, such as a suspicion or rumor, there would be no grounds for contacting the civil authorities.<br>Implicit in the permissibility to contact the civil authorities is that there exists no prohibition of <i>mesirah</i>, of informing to a government, which conducts itself by the rule of law such as a democracy. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 388:7; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 19:52.<br>However, there are some <i>Poskim</i> who contend that the interdict against <i>mesira</i> applies when one causes a Jew to be incarcerated and the punishment for the particular offense is more severe than Halakha prescribes. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:8, 5:9; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i>, <i>HM</i> 5 (new edition). Cf. <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83b.<br>Nonetheless, the prohibition is inapplicable to an individual who is a danger to society, such as a pedophile. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 388:12; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 388:59.</i> The aforementioned policies represent what may be best described as a yeshiva’s zero tolerance policy vis-à-vis employees who may be or who are child predators. These administrative guidelines concretize how to fulfill our obligations of love of one’s fellowman, <i>arevut</i>, rebuke, and active intervention to assist a fellow human being in peril, and thus transform the unconcerned ruggedly individualistic American Jewish bystander into a Jew fulfilling his covenantal imperatives of care for the plight of one’s fellow Jew.
Furthermore, failure to employ a policy of dismissal entails a violation of <i>afrushei me-issura</i>, which minimally is a violation of a rabbinic prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 3a.</i> or maximally a transgression of a biblical interdict.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Berura</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i>, <i>Sha’ar ha-Tziyun</i> 347:8.</i> As a member of our covenant-faith community, a Jewish employer, like every Jew, has a duty to prevent the commission of a transgression (<i>le-afrushei me-issura</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet ha-Vav</i>, <i>kelal</i> 26 (3).<br>There is a dispute whether <i>afrushei me-issura</i> is limited to an <i>issur</i> (prohibition) being committed in one’s home and one’s <i>reshut</i> (domain), or whether the obligation to prevent another individual’s transgression extends to a situation in which the <i>issur</i> potentially could be transgressed outside of one’s home and domain. See <i>Imrei Bina</i>, <i>Hilkhot Dayanim</i> 9; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 3:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 3:1. Given that the potential for transgression of <i>issur</i> here deals with an employee who is working in an employer’s facility, it would seem that even <i>Imrei Bina</i>, who generally limits invoking the <i>issur</i> beyond one’s home, would argue that such a situation is equivalent to having the potential <i>issur</i> being violated in one’s home and would concur with Ketzot ha-Hoshen and Netivot ha-Mishpat that it is incumbent upon the employer to prevent the occurrence of such <i>issurim</i>.</i> The interdict of <i>afrushei me-issura</i> is grounded either in our covenanted responsibility of <i>arevut</i>, the obligation to guarantee that our fellow Jew observes Halakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 19.</i> or based upon in the mitzva of admonishing a neighbor who is straying from the dictates of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ketav Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 83.</i> To allow an employee who is under suspicion of being an abuser or is actually engaging in pedophilia to roam the workplace without supervision and accountability is a travesty.
In sum, based upon the foregoing presentation, the yeshiva, as an employer, is halakhically obligated to implement certain administrative policies to ensure a safe environment for its students. Yet, should abusive behavior be perpetrated by one of its employees, a yeshiva that has implemented such policies, similar to any employer, would not be vicariously liable for his worker’s sexual misconduct.
<b>IV. “<i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i>” – An Avenue towards the Recognition of an Employer’s Vicarious Liability</b>
The remaining question is whether there are any halakhic grounds to hold an employer who implemented such policies liable for an employee’s sexual misconduct? Clearly, should a labor agreement or an insurance policy deal with an employee’s liability for injury caused by the employee, the agreement dictates the conditions and scope of institutional responsibility for such <i>hezek</i> perpetrated by the employee. However, in the absence of an agreement addressing this issue, is an employer responsible? Will an employer always be held responsible for employee sexual misconduct, or will he be exempt from liability should he demonstrate that hiring, supervisory, and retention policies were in place at the time of the alleged act of abuse?
Given that the abuse transpired in New York City, seemingly the doctrine of “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>,” lit. “the law of the kingdom is the law,”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 28a; <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a–b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 54b–55a.</i> may serve as an avenue for a the victim to file suit in <i>beit din</i> against his abuser. In accordance with Rema, which is the accepted view amongst the majority of <i>Poskim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Doveiv Meisharim</i> 1:76.</i> <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is applicable to all matters that fall under the rubric of “<i>le-takanat bnei ha-medina</i>,” for the benefit of the citizenry.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:14, 369:11.</i> As understood by <i>Rema</i> elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369. And, in fact, scattered throughout his <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> rulings, <i>Rema</i> offers concrete examples of applying civil law to instances involving social interaction. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:14, 154:18, 356:7, 369:11.</i> any legislation relating to social interaction is to be subsumed in the category of <i>le-takanat bnei ha-medina</i>, and therefore requires Jewish compliance. In contemporary times, legislation relating to labor relations is one of the many examples of a law that is <i>le-takanat bnei ha-medina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 106/5756, Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit</i> v. <i>Va’ad ha-Hinukh shel Agudath Yisrael</i> (unpublished decision); File no. 5513-35-1, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit</i> v. <i>Ploni</i>, August 11, 2005; File no. 1323-35-1, Ashdod Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni</i> v. <i>Menahel Mosad Almoni</i>, July 13, 2008.</i> Numerous Israeli <i>dayanim</i> including Rabbis Izrirer, Sherman, and Tzadok<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1323-35-1, supra n. 59; File no. 8085481, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Mosdot Plonim v. Plonit</i>, September 16, 2009.</i> invoke Rema’s approach in halakhically recognizing civil labor law. It is clear in these cases that our desire to foster a sexually safe working environment facilitates proper social interaction. As such, seemingly the doctrine of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> may serve as a vehicle for addressing whether Halakha ought to recognize an employer’s vicarious liability in cases of an employee’s sexual misconduct.
Let’s briefly present how New York courts have dealt with employer’s vicarious liability as it relates to sexual harassment and abuse. A review of the law in New York City will demonstrate how our matter has been resolved differently in the late 1990s in comparison to more recent years. Sexual harassment claims, including but not limited to sexual abuse, have been resolved in New York in pursuance to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (“Title VII”) and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”) which is codified in part in the New York City Administrative Code.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">New York City Administrative Code, section 8-107.</i> Various New York courts have noted that claims brought under NYCHRL are to be resolved in the same fashion as claims advanced under Federal Title VII and have been rendered in accordance with two United State Supreme Court decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Fierro v. Saks Fifth Avenue</i>, 13 F. Supp. 2d 481, 487 (SDNY 1998); <i>Moore v. Sam’s Club, et al.</i>, 55 F. Supp. 2d 177 (1999); <i>Wahlstrom v. Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co</i>., 89 F. Supp. 2d 506, 523 (SDNY 2000); <i>Duviella v. Counseling Service of Eastern Dist. Of NY</i>, 52 Fed. Appx. 152, 153 (2d Cir. 2002); <i>Kercado-Clymer v. City of Amsterdam</i>, <i>et al.</i> 608 F. Supp. 203 (2009).</i> In 1998, the United States Supreme Court in two separate decisions, <i>Faragher v. Boca Raton</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">524 US 775 (1998).</i> and <i>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">524 US 742 (1998).</i> furnishes the guidelines that shield the employer from federal sexual harassment claims. Assuming the plaintiff has proven sexual harassment by an employee who exercised managerial or supervisory responsibility, the employer must prove that (1) he exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any harassment; (2) action was taken against the offending employee (e.g., discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment), and (3) made use of any preventive and corrective mechanisms to avoid the harm. Upon demonstrating compliance with these safeguards, the employer was exempt from responsibility for his employee’s misbehavior. These guidelines were endorsed by NY courts.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Fierro v. Saks Fifth Avenue</i>, 13 F. Supp. 2d 481 (1998); <i>Ehrens v. Lutheran Church</i>, 385 F. 3d 232 (2d Cir. 2004); <i>Vione v. Tewell</i>, 12 Misc. 3d 973, 820 NYS 2d 682 (NY Sup. Ct. 2006)</i>
In effect, these secular legal guidelines are a concretization of the notions <i>of arevut</i>, love of one’s fellow man, <i>afrushei me-issura</i>, and “and you shall restore it to him,” which, if implemented, serve to promote a work environment which is free of sexual harassment and abuse.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See infra n. 75.</i>
Applying the <i>Farager-Ellerth</i> guidelines to our scenario, should student abuse have occurred in 2008 at the hands of a New York City yeshiva principal or teacher <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">An individual qualifies as a supervisor if he or she is authorized to hire, fire, promote, demote, and reassign the employee, or if his recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decision maker(s). See <i>Ellerth</i>, 118 S. Ct. at 2269.<br>Furthermore, even if that individual is not empowered to change a person’s employment status, such as to hire and fire, if he is authorized to direct another employee’s day-to-day work activities, he or she qualifies as a supervisor. See <i>Faragher</i>, 118 S. Ct. at 2280. As such, a teacher would qualify as a supervisor.</i> and the school had established and implemented hiring, supervision, and retention polices concerning abuse, the yeshiva would have been exempt from liability. However, if the yeshiva was negligent regarding any one of these policies, in light of New York court decisions, a <i>beit din</i> invoking the doctrine of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> may have imputed responsibility to the yeshiva and the school would be required to pay civil damages. Placing an employee in a position to cause foreseeable harm, harm which the injured party most probably would have been spared had the employer taken reasonable care in supervising or retaining the employee, serves as grounds for imputing employer liability.
Subsequently, over a decade later in 2009–2010, some New York courts abandoned applying the <i>Farager-Ellerth</i> guidelines for addressing lawsuits brought under NYCHRL. In <i>Zakrzewska v. The New School</i>, a federal court in the Southern District of New York concluded that the <i>Farager-Ellerth</i> guidelines for harassment liability do not apply to claims under NYCHRL. Additionally, the court concluded that NYCHRL creates vicarious liability for the acts of managerial and supervisory employees, even when the employer has exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any such harassment.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zakrzewska v. The New School</i>, 598 F. Supp. 2d 426 (2009).<br></i>
Answering a question certified to it by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the New York Court of Appeals in <i>Zakrzewska v. The New School</i> acknowledges that state and local civil rights law must be interpreted in light of federal law. Moreover, the language of New York City Administrative Code imputes vicarious liability for the employer, even if he complies with the <i>Farager-Ellerth</i> guidelines and has created a safe workplace.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Section 8-107 (1) (a); <i>Zakrzewska v.

The City of NY, et al</i>., No. 11 Civ., 4958 (DLC) (S.D., NY, October 10, 2012).</i> In effect, the courts have precluded the use of the <i>Farager-Ellerth</i> guidelines as an avenue for an exemption of an employer’s vicarious liability rather than rejecting them.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In this fashion, the New York courts interpreted the cases in a way that did not contradict the established precedent of the US Supreme Ct. decisions.</i> As such, in accordance with New York law, a New York City yeshiva would be liable for child abuse even if it had established and implemented policies that promote a safe work place, such as producing records relating to retention, supervision, discipline, termination, and complaints or investigations regarding an employee accused of sexually abusing a student. To state it differently, concerning abuse, a New York City employer is strictly liable.
However, most <i>Poskim</i> contend that the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is inapplicable when dealing with judge-made law such as US Supreme Court and New York court decisions, because generally the law, as interpreted by the courts, evolves and is ever changing.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 65a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:109, 6:254; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 26 (end); <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:3, <i>Sma</i>, ad locum. 21; <i>Teshuvot Mahariz Enzel</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:176; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:41; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Moshe</i>, 1:39, 2:116; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Tzedaka</i> 33:1; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 3:455; Avraham Sherman, “National Custom in Labor Relations” (Hebrew), 18 <i>Tehumin</i> 245–247 (5758); File no. 335906/3, Tel Aviv-Yafo Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v.

Cf. <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:86, who argues that judge-made law regarding matters unrelated to taxes ought to mandate compliance based upon <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>; Shlomo Daichovsky, “Partnership Doctrine – Is it <i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i>?” (Hebrew), 18 <i>Tehumin</i> 18, 27–29 (5758); <i>PDR</i> 16, 296, 301; File no. 3369-21-2, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

In others, judge-made law similar to legislation requires interpretation (see infra n. 73) and therefore ought to fall under the rubric of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina.</i></i> And, in fact, as we have shown, New York law has evolved from initially absolving an employer from liability in situations in which hiring, supervision polices were operative, and subsequently to mandating responsibility even when said policies were implemented. In the minds of these <i>Poskim</i>, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is to be invoked only with regard to a determinate body of law, i.e., statutory law.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">And even though historically, the law of the monarchy required the king’s interpretation, the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> would remain applicable. See <i>Teshuvot Kerem Shlomo</i> 31 (R. Netanel’s opinion). Cf. R. Shimshon Morfogu who claims that any law that requires interpretation, even monarchial interpretation, need not be followed. See <i>Kerem Shlomo</i>, op. cit.; Shmuel Shilo, “<i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i>” (Hebrew), Academic Press: Yerushalayim, 1974, 188-189.</i> And, therefore, New York law which is judge-made law would not be recognized based upon <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Secondly, there are <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to Shakh’s posture who contend that should secular law contradict Halakha, the latter trumps civil law. See <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA HM</i> 73:39; <i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 81; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:69. Consequently, since Halakha rejects the notion that an employer assumes vicarious liability in cases of an employee’s abuse, therefore civil law fails to be binding by dint of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>.</i>
Consequently, secular law memorialized in judge-made law will not provide the grounds for addressing whether an employer ought to be responsible for the abuse committed by his employee. Hence, should a victim of child abuse lodge a monetary claim against the New York City yeshiva in <i>beit din</i>, arguing that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> should serve as the grounds for justifying his claim, it may be rejected.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">On the other hand, NYC law, which mandates that an employer establish and implement policies regarding hiring, supervision, and retention, would be recognized by many <i>Poskim</i> based upon <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>. This conclusion is based upon R. Moshe Sofer’s teaching, “If the matter would be submitted to us, we would have legislated it!” See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 44.<br>The background for Hatam Sofer’s ruling relates to the nineteenth-century Eastern European regulation that only licensed wine brokers may sell wine and liquor. Concerned with the monopolistic ramifications of this civil law and its attendant economic harm foisted upon non-licensed wine brokerages, members of a Jewish community ask Hatam Sofer to express his opinion regarding this legal regulation. In reply, Hatam Sofer argues that it is desirable to regulate economic competition, and, in fact, there is precedent in Jewish legal history demonstrating that earlier decisors as well as communities protected the right of people to earn a living, and therefore this civil legislation makes sense. He therefore concluded that had the Jewish community been empowered in his time to pass such legislation, it would have been done without hesitation. As such, the civil legislation ought to be affirmed. This notion of “if the matter would be submitted to us, we would have legislated it!” reverberates in subsequent nineteenth-century and twentieth-century rulings regarding various commercial matters. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen HM</i> 259:3; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>YD</i> 2:75, 77; <i>Teshuvot Hit’orerut Teshuva</i> 232; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot Doveiv Meisharim</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 1:87; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 12:83; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 10:201; <i>PDR</i> 6:382 (R. Zolty, R. Elyashiv, and R. Nissim’s opinions). Similarly, in our scenario, in contemporary times if <i>Poskim</i> would have been empowered to pass legislation, policies regarding hiring, supervision, and retention would have been promulgated in order to promote a safe working environment as a vehicle for engendering love of one’s fellow man and preventing the commission of transgression. As such, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is applicable<i>.</i> Alternatively, it ought to be validated based upon Rema’s view that matters that are legislated relating to social interaction are to be recognized based upon <i>dina de-malkhuta dina.</i> See supra text accompanying nn. 56–60<i>.</i><br>Whether an employer is accountable in a <i>beit din</i> for failure to implement hiring, supervision, and retention policies, or liable for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of an employee who engages in pedophilia is beyond the scope of this presentation.<br>The implicit assumption of this notion “If the matter would be submitted to us, we would have legislated it!” is that the legislation does not stand in contradiction to any Halakha. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Reuven</i>, vol. 2, 23 (5).<br>In fact, in other situations such as <i>hilkhot apotropsus</i> (laws of guardianship), due to changed conditions, Jewish communities legislated <i>halakhot</i> and in certain instances this legislation became part and parcel of the corpus of Halakha. See <i>Teshuvot Yismach Lev</i>, <i>HM</i> 8; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 290:16; <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 2, 97–99.</i>
<b>V. “<i>Minhag</i>” – An Avenue towards the Recognition of an Employer’s Vicarious Liability</b>
Though the doctrine of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> may not serve to address our situation, nonetheless <i>minhag ha-medina</i>, national or local practice, may be a more halakhically promising approach for dealing with our issue at hand.
Halakha establishes the guidelines for setting up various types of commercial relationships, including but not limited to <i>shutafut</i> (partnership), <i>arevut</i> (surety), and labor relations. At the same time, Halakha recognizes the ability of parties to enter into agreements that may be at variance with the guidelines set down by Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Parties may determine their own business relationship, provided that the arrangement complies with a proper form, i.e., <i>kinyan</i>, and is not violative of any <i>issurim</i>, prohibitions, such as theft or the interdict against taking <i>ribbit</i>. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 305:4; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 38:5, <i>HM</i> 291:17, 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1.</i> As such, any issues between the parties would be resolved in accordance with the provisions of their mutually agreed-upon arrangement.
If there is a <i>minhag</i> dealing with a certain matter in monetary affairs, even though the <i>minhag</i> does not have the endorsement of a rabbinic authority or communal leadership, and the origin of the <i>minhag</i> is non-Jewish,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Though there is a long-standing halakhic dispute whether a monetary custom practiced by the community on their own is effective without rabbinic or communal endorsement, the classical restatements have either explicitly or implicitly ruled that a monetary custom has an independent status. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:10, 218:19, 229:2, 230:10, 232:6, 330:5, 331:12; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 72:5.<br>Concerning the validity of a monetary <i>minhag</i> that is grounded in non-Jewish practices, see <i>Teshuvot Nediv Lev</i> 12; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:111; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Avraham</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yisrael</i> 172; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 1:10; <i>Teshuvot Oholei Tam</i> 202; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yosef</i> 21; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72<i>.</i></i> we presume that whoever signs off on a commercial agreement or obligates himself to an individual intends to obligate himself in accordance with the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mehira</i> 16:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhosot le-Ramban</i> 288; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:662; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 342; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 107,128; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 73; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 72:21.</i> So for example, if a business agreement fails to be finalized in accordance with a <i>shtar</i> (recognized halakhic-legal document), nevertheless, should the <i>minhag</i> validate the transaction based upon commercially accepted modes of undertaking an obligation, the agreement would be halakhically valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:125; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 2:229; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 314.</i> Or if there is a <i>minhag</i> that a partnership undertakes responsibility for a <i>hezek</i> caused by one of its partners, the partnership is liable even though such responsibility was not articulated in the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:48. For additional examples, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:268, 4:125, 6:254; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 54; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 413.</i>
This rule that when one enters into a transaction one is bound by local custom even if the parties fail to mention the practice in their agreement extends equally to labor relations. In the absence of a labor agreement specifying the daily hours of employment, the Mishnah, for example, communicates to us that one follows the prevailing practice, which is to begin work later in the morning and return complete work prior to the evening hours. And upon employment, should the employer insist in pursuance to the <i>din</i> that the laborer begin work early and end late, given that the original agreement does not address this subject, the <i>minhag</i> of beginning work late and finishing early becomes one of the mutually agreed upon terms of the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1.</i> However, should the parties have mutually agreed prior to the onset of employment that the hours of work would begin early and end late, such an agreement would trump the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a, s.v. “<i>ha’sohair</i>”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83a, s.v. “<i>ha-so’hair</i>”; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:3.</i>
To understand the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i> in general and in regard to our scenario in particular, let’s briefly present the building blocks for establishing the authority of <i>minhag</i>. For a <i>minhag</i> to be binding, three conditions must be obtained. Firstly, the custom must be clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 33; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 413.</i> Secondly, it must be practiced throughout the country or the locale that is practicing the behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 23:12, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 9:1, <i>Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 7:8; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:2; <i>Teshuvot Maharik ha-Hadashot</i> 65.</i> The presumption that the parties intended <i>minhag</i> to be determinative when entering into the agreement is predicated upon the fact that the custom is “<i>pashut</i>” (widespread), otherwise one cannot assume that this is the parties’ intent. The criteria for ascertaining if a <i>minhag</i> is “<i>pashut</i>,” are subject to debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Many of the sources cited infra in nn. 86–101 have been culled from R. Kleinman, “National Laws – Is there an expectation that people contract in accordance with them even if they possess no actual knowledge of them?” (Hebrew), 33 <i>Tehumin</i> 82, 90–91, nn. 31–36 (5773).</i> One approach is that the <i>dayan</i> is the arbiter who will determine the frequency of the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Rosner, <i>Mishpat ha-Poalim</i> 88, n. 43.</i> Some argue that the <i>minhag</i> must be prevalent on a daily basis.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 61; <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:81; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 149, n. 17.</i> Others contend that it must have been practiced at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 342; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 436; <i>PDR</i> 4:128.</i> Furthermore, according to many <i>Poskim</i>, the parties to a business agreement, including but not limited to a labor agreement, need not possess knowledge of the actual existence of the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:125, 6:254; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Maharashach</i> 2:229; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 338:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 314; <i>Teshuvot Teshu’ot Hain</i> 55, cited in <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>EH</i> 53:12.<br>Cf. <i>Erekh Shai</i>, who argues that <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:36, 61:9, 71:33 disagrees and <i>Aharonim</i> endorse his view. See <i>Erekh Shai</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:7. See also <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 53:20.</i>
The autonomy of <i>minhag</i> and its effectiveness to define commercial ties are not limited to practices that transpire in the business community. According to most <i>Poskim</i>, one can grant halakhic validity to civil legislation by virtue of <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">R. Kleinman, “Civil Law as Custom: Jewish law and Secular Law – Do they Diverge or Converge?” 14 <i>The Review of Rabbinic Judaism</i> 11 (2011).</i> In other words, as contemporary <i>Poskim</i> such as R. Zolty, R. Feinstein, R. Elyashiv, R. Waldenburg, R. Y. Weiss and R. Lavi note, a <i>minhag</i> may emerge from civil legislation.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:86 (9), 7:126;<i>Ateret Devora</i> vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 44; <i>PDR</i> 8:162, 12:176, 179, 16:296, 310, 312; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:55; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 4:3; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 5:30.<br>Obviously, some <i>Poskim</i> may restrict the power of a monetary custom and thus refuse to legitimate a piece of civil legislation. For example, even if there is a <i>minhag</i> to accept a civil will, many decisors have rejected this <i>minhag</i>. See ch. 1.</i> The concept of <i>minhag</i> is not limited to a practice in a locale that is frequent, widespread, and clear, but equally extends to any law that is widespread, clear, and exists in statutory form and/or frequently interpreted by the courts. To state it differently, the existence of civil laws regulating labor relations does not mean that ipso facto it is to be recognized as a <i>minhag</i> that ought to govern an employment agreement. For <i>minhag</i> to be determinative, according to certain opinions, it has to have transpired at least three times, which must be attested by two witnesses. However, if the definition of a <i>minhag</i> being “<i>pashut</i>” <i>is</i> that it is a daily occurrence, then the testimony of two witnesses is insufficient. In our scenario, unless the prevailing practice is clear, its existence must be demonstrated by inquiring from numerous individuals whether <i>yeshivot</i> utilize employment contracts prepared by attorneys that provide that disputes be resolved in accordance with secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 13:21; <i>Teshuvot Admat Kodesh</i> 1:31; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, <i>EH</i> 45:4.<br>If Torah-observant Jews have their contracts prepared by an attorney, it is clear that their intention is to have any differences resolved by civil law. See File no. 1/35/8935, Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, <i>Mosdot Plonim v. Kuf &amp; Vav</i>.</i> Then and only then one may contend that <i>minhag</i> as reflected in secular law is “<i>pashut</i>” and therefore determinative, serving to resolve contentious issues.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 103; <i>Admat Kodesh</i>, supra n. 92; <i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 2, 14.<br></i>
Just as any <i>minhag</i> may serve to define the terms of a business agreement even though the parties are actually unaware of its existence, so too <i>minhag</i> will establish the choice of law that will govern the commercial arrangement. In other words, even if the yeshiva and the employee in their agreement did not specifically mention that civil law ought to govern any contentious issues by dint of the existence of a <i>minhag</i>, absent any provision to the contrary, their intent is to enter into the agreement on the basis of local law. Furthermore, the <i>umdana</i> (assessed expectation) which we encounter regarding <i>minhag</i> is that the law is applicable – even its details, independent of the fact that the parties are ignorant regarding the details of the applicable law and/or that the law is subject to change.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 1, 314–315; <i>Mishpat ha-Poalim</i>, supra n. 86, at 92; Kleinman, supra n. 85, at n. 58. For a discussion of this view, see <i>Teshuvot Beit Reuven</i>, vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 172–173.<br>However, R. Sha’anan contends that in situations in which the details of the law are contingent upon judge-made case law, one cannot argue that a <i>minhag</i> has been established. See File no. 3448583, supra n. 72. In other words, <i>minhag</i> must reflect clear-cut law. See text accompanying n. 72.<br>Alternatively, one can invoke the halakhically recognized notion that governing civil law serves to define people’s expectations. For example, a driver injures a pedestrian and the insurance company reimburses the victim for the injury incurred. Subsequently, the driver contacts the victim and argues that, in accordance with Halakha, he is obligated to pay him less than the compensation that he received from the insurance company. Therefore the victim should reimburse him the difference between what he received and what he ought to have been entitled to in pursuance to Halakha.<br>Given that the driver’s right to drive is based upon his possession of a driving license, which is recognized by civil law, and civil authorities have allowed him to drive provided he has insurance, his obligations as a driver are defined by secular law. As such, R. Zvi ben Ya’akov concludes that the amount of compensation is based upon civil law rather than Halakha. See <i>Mishpatekha le Ya’akov</i> 5:26.<br>Similiarly, given that every educational institution is obligated by law to register with the state and comply with certain licensing and approval requirements, therefore the institution’s expectations are that they are governed in all matters with civil law. As such, every educational institution in NYC expects to follow their legal responsibility vis-à-vis pedophiles. Consequently, whether the institution was aware of the governing law regarding vicarious liability is irrelevant. Their expectation was that their multifarious activities would be based upon legal compliance rather than Halakha. Awareness of the details of law does not factor into the expectations of the institution.</i> The assumption is that the parties may avail themselves of the services of an attorney in order to ascertain the state of the law. Therefore, ignorance of the details of the law is no excuse. Moreover, when invoking <i>minhag</i>, we assume that people who accept the authoritativeness of <i>minhag</i> not only assume that the details may be unfamiliar to them but that the content may vary from time to time. Nevertheless, they are ready to manage their commercial ties in accordance with the <i>minhag</i>, namely the law. As such, even if the <i>minhag</i> is “<i>pashut</i>,” that labor relations in the network of New York City <i>yeshivot</i> are being governed by New York City labor law, the fact that there is no awareness regarding a specific labor law or that the New York City law regarding a particular labor law has changed since the date their agreement was consummated, is immaterial.
In a series of <i>teshuvot</i> dealing with bankruptcy law, tenancy law, and labor law, R. Moshe Feinstein endorses the notion that <i>minhag</i> reflects civil legislation and may be invoked as determining a matter even if the parties expressly fail to mention the norm emerging from the <i>minhag</i> in their commercial agreement.
Moreover, in accordance with R. Feinstein’s view, even if the local custom differs from Halakha, the custom will prevail due to the fact that it was the parties’ intent to have their matters resolved in accordance with custom, namely secular law, even in a case of a specific law which generally may be unknown by the populace.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72, 75, 2:55.<br>The rationale is that <i>minhag mevatel Halakha</i>, custom overrides the law. See Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Yevamot</i> 12:1; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1.</i> As Hazon Ish observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1. For further discussion, <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 2, 189–190.<br>Obviously there is a distinction between Hazon Ish, who is utilizing <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> as a yardstick for determining the content of the <i>umdana</i> and R. Feinstein’s posture, which invokes <i>minhag</i> as the guideline for defining the parties’ expectations. The differing results in whether one adopts the rule of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> or <i>minhag</i> is beyond the scope of our presentation. Suffice it to say that the problems that we encountered attempting to resolve our case via the avenue of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> we will not necessarily confront when we employ the notion of <i>minhag</i> to resolve our case. For example, whereas there are numerous authorities who would limit the invoking of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> to matters of statutory law (see supra text accompanying n. 73), concerning the scope of <i>minhag</i> it may encompass case law.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The law of the kingdom determines the expectation of the people. Since we customarily abide by the law of the kingdom under certain prescribed conditions, the law influences people, who then decide to rely on civil law.</span>
Addressing the question whether an employer can dismiss a worker without cause, R. Feinstein writes, “Any custom that they may stipulate is in actuality Torah law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:75. See also, <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72.</i>
Adopting such a perspective is not limited to the issue of dismissing a worker without cause. As noted hundreds of years earlier by Rashba,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n.15.</i> even though generally Halakha exempts an employer from liability for bodily injury caused to his worker, nevertheless <i>minhag</i> may serve as the grounds for workman’s compensation. Similarly, though generally Halakha exempts an employer from liability for an employee’s act of abuse, <i>minhag</i>, namely the governing law, ought to serve as a basis for obligating a yeshiva to compensate for an employee’s sexual misconduct.
Invoking Rashba and R. Feinstein’s approach,<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Whether Rashba and R. Feinstein would invoke their approach regarding our issue and arrive at this conclusion, we leave as an open question for now.<br>Rashba’s ruling is predicated upon a Tosefta’s discussion of a ship that was sailing at sea and encountered a storm that threatened to sink it, and some of the freight was thrown overboard in order to lighten the ship. Relying upon maritime custom, the Tosefta’s ruling is that the loss be divided according to the weight of the cargo, rather than the property owners’ wealth. See <i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:7 which was accepted as normative Halakha. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 272:15, 17.<br>On the basis of this ruling, Rashba concludes that <i>minhag</i> will be determinative regarding an employer’s responsibility for bodily injury caused to his employee while on the job. In other words, despite the fact that Tosefta deals with the halakhic-legal strength of <i>minhag</i> concerning property loss and Rashba is focusing upon an employee’s loss due to bodily injury; nonetheless, in Rashba’s mind the two cases are to be treated alike, i.e., governed by <i>minhag</i>. And therefore, we can argue that though Rashba’s position regarding the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i> deals with an employer’s responsibility for a worker’s bodily injury, his perspective may extend to an employer’s requirement to compensate a victim of abuse that is perpetrated by one of his employees!</i> we can now address our scenario. A child was abused by his principal or teacher in 2012 at a yeshiva located in New York City. In the absence of an insurance policy or an employment agreement that addresses whether a yeshiva is liable for abuses caused by one of its employees, we may invoke that <i>minhag</i> ought to serve to determine the parameters of the yeshiva’s liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Should the labor agreement explicitly state that the yeshiva is absolved from any monetary claims in the event of student abuse, it is a subject of debate whether the parties’ agreement trumps a <i>minhag</i> that mandates liability. See <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i>, <i>YD</i> 97; <i>Teshuvot Lev Arye</i> 2:37; <i>PDR</i> 8:80; Y.Yifrach, “A Labor Agreement in variance with the National Custom,” (Hebrew), 3 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 276 (5755); A.Sherman, “National Custom in Labor Relations,” (Hebrew), 18 <i>Tehumin</i> 245 (5758); Y.

Plonit</i>, September 16, 2009.</i> As such, though the applicable <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> that deal with labor relations do not obligate a yeshiva to compensate a victim of abuse monetarily, nonetheless, <i>minhag</i> as reflected in New York City law may serve as grounds for such monetary relief.
Said conclusion is premised upon three propositions. Firstly, regardless of whether the yeshiva and employee mutually agreed in their labor contract that any disputes that may arise be resolved according to Halakha by a <i>beit din</i>, the <i>umdana</i> is that even God-fearing Jews intend that <i>minhag</i>, namely that governing civil law, ought to be factored into arriving at a decision. Secondly, New York City statutory law as well as the courts’ interpretation of the law is reflective of <i>minhag</i>. In other words, the <i>minhag</i> factors into consideration the fact that details of the law may change due to the varying opinions of court justices even after a yeshiva’s labor agreement has been signed and/or the abuse transpired.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hut Shani</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ribbit</i>, 186–187; R. Tzvi ben Ya’akov (oral communication); Kleinman, supra n. 85 at 89, n. 39, at 93, n. 60. For a discussion of this view, see <i>Beit Reuven</i>, supra n. 94.</i> Moreover, <i>minhag</i> is authoritative even if the law<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">For the validity of <i>minhag</i>, even if an individual is unaware of the <i>minhag</i>, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1068, 3:17; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 144b, s.v. “<i>ho</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 54; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 413; <i>Teshuvot ha-Tashbetz</i> 1:133; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 314; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72, 75.</i> or details of the law, such as an employer’s vicarious liability, are unknown to the parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat ha-Poalim</i>, supra n. 86, at 92. Cf. <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA EH</i> 66:48, who contends that the <i>minhag</i> must be known by everyone in order for it to be construed as the parties’ intention to be bound by it.</i> As such, the content of the <i>minhag</i> is determinative. Finally, even though New York City law as interpreted by the courts differs substantially from Halakha regarding the issue of a yeshiva’s vicarious liability, nonetheless the law as articulated by the courts trumps the <i>halakhot</i> of employment relations. To state it differently, even though the norms of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> concerning labor relations would exempt the yeshiva from liability for the teacher’s sexual misconduct, nonetheless <i>minhag</i>, namely applicable New York City law in 2012, would impose liability upon the yeshiva regardless of whether it had proper hiring, supervision, and retention policies in place prior and during the time of incident of abuse. And therefore, should a monetary claim by a victim of abuse be advanced against the yeshiva in 2012, the school ought to be held halakhically responsible based upon the import of <i>minhag.</i>
Finally, a reply to the contention that this <i>minhag</i> is to be a labeled a “<i>minhag garua</i>,” a practice devoid of logic and purpose,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Reuven</i>, supra n. 94, at 100–104 in the name of <i>Ramban</i> and <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>. See <i>Tosafot Bava Batra</i> 2a, s.v. “<i>be’gvil</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 477.</i> due to the fact that the norms of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> do not impute employer liability for an employee’s sexual malfeasance, nevertheless the employer may be responsible for the following reason. If one endorses the minority view that one individual can be a <i>shomer</i> for another person’s bodily integrity,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 48. The implication of viewing the yeshiva and its employees as <i>shomerim</i> regarding other matters is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> then an employer such as a yeshiva may be viewed as a <i>shomer</i> who is protecting his students, and should abuse occur “under his watch,” he ought to be monetarily responsible, like a parent who is construed as a <i>shomer</i> vis-à-vis his/her minor children.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:106; Z. N. Goldberg, “Guarding an Object which does not belong to the Bailor,” (Hebrew), 14 <i>Tehumin</i> 200, 205 (5754) seem to limit <i>shemira</i> to young school children. Whether said conclusion is applicable to children of majority age we leave as an open question. Suffice it to say that if somebody guards an asset and he is hired to perform other work, he becomes a <i>shomer</i> over the asset if the guarding is related to the other work. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 638; <i>Teshuvot Shai le-Moreh</i> 15. Assuming, as we stated, that <i>hilkhot shemira</i> are applicable to human beings, therefore if a teacher is hired for teaching, he becomes a <i>shomer</i>, because the <i>shemira</i> is related to the other job, namely teaching.</i> To state it differently, a yeshiva as a <i>shomer</i> must oversee its employees and ultimately its students “<i>ke-derekh ha-shomerim</i>,” lit. “in accordance with the standard amongst bailees.”<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 42a.</i> “<i>Ke-derekh ha-shomerim</i>” will vary from locale to locale.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 3:21; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 42a; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 333; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:18.</i>Absent any institutional guidelines and policies, its scope and parameters may be defined by <i>minhag</i>, namely the governing law. Consequently, even though the yeshiva may have established and implemented a policy of supervising its employees, nevertheless, should an employee engage in abuse, New York City law may find the yeshiva monetarily responsible for such misconduct, even though the yeshiva did not act negligently. In short, <i>minhag</i> trumps <i>hilkhot Hoshen Mishpat</i>, which would have exempted the employer from responsibility.
Various objections may be leveled against implementing <i>minhag</i> as an avenue to resolve whether the yeshiva ought to be vicariously liable for one of its employee’s misconduct. First, as we have seen, given that the application of <i>minhag</i> may vary depending upon the posture of New York law regarding our issue of an employer’s liability, it means that the <i>minhag</i> is unclear and therefore fails to serve as a vehicle for addressing our matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Kleinman, supra n. 85, at 90, at text accompanying n. 48, n. 61 (R. Bareli’s opinion).</i> If the <i>minhag</i> is unclear, how can one presume that the parties intended that it govern their relationship? To state it differently, the applicability of <i>minhag</i>, similar to the invoking of <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i>, requires that the governing law be statutory rather than judge-made law, which may be ever-changing.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 344858/3, Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, June 1, 2011.</i>
Second, unless it is crystal clear that the parties desired that contentious matters be resolved in accordance with <i>minhag</i>, namely civil law rather than <i>hilkhot Hoshen Mishpat</i>, there are no grounds available for invoking the <i>umdana</i> that <i>minhag</i> ought to prevail.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Kleinman, supra n. 85, at 89, text accompanying n. 39 (R. Ben Ya’akov’s opinion).</i> Since American law allows arbitration courts, including <i>battei din</i>, to resolve matters of labor relations according to Halakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The norms of civil law are applicable only if the secular government insists that their laws be followed. See <i>Aliyot de-Rabbeinu Yona Bava Batra</i> 54a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:895, 6:149; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 228, 495; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369 (4) in the name of R. Ya’akov Yisrael; <i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 188.</i> one cannot assume that parties who appear at a <i>beit din</i> implicitly intend to have their differences resolved in conformity with civil law. As Maharashdam notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 327.

<span class="poetry indentAll">If we have even a slight doubt, we should not follow a <i>minhag</i> … and when you want to uproot the <i>din torah</i> from its place, you must produce a proof …</span>
In other words, the existence of the <i>minhag</i> must be widespread and clear, namely people’s awareness that secular labor law is governing one’s commercial affairs. Absent such awareness, we invoke Halakha, which would mean that an employer would be exempt from responsibility for his worker’s misbehavior.
Moreover, admittedly, individuals may have the intention to resolve their matters in pursuance of <i>minhag</i>, namely the governing New York City law, but details of the law may be unfamiliar to them. Consequently, <i>minhag</i> may not be determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hut Shani</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ribbit</i>, supra n.101.</i> However, should the practice of legally imposing vicarious liability upon an employer, even in the context of a safe workplace, have been known to have occurred in one jobsite three times, or once in at least three different places, or that many people are aware that the law mandates employer’s vicarious liability, then and only then may we invoke <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">A. Bareli, “The Details of the Law – Are they to be subsumed under <i>Dina de-Malkhuta Dina</i>?” (Hebrew), 26 <i>Tehumin</i> 353 (5766).</i>
Furthermore, given that New York City law has changed since the consummation of the labor agreement between the yeshiva and the employee, the <i>minhag</i> at the time of the execution of the labor agreement (namely, New York law prior to <i>Zakrzewska v. The New School</i>) ought to prevail, and therefore the yeshiva ought to be exempt from responsibility.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hut Shani</i>, supra n. 101.</i> Consequently, for all or any of the foregoing reasons, imposing an employer’s vicarious liability in cases of an employee’s abuse lacks halakhic foundation.
In conclusion, though <i>hilkhot</i> Hoshen Mishpat, including but not limited to labor relations, mandate that a pedophile, regardless of whether he sexually misbehaves during the time of employment or after hours, is personally monetarily liable for his own behavior and his employer is not. Nonetheless, according to Rashba and R. Feinstein’s approach,<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 100.</i> one may conclude that should the parties’ expectations be that <i>minhag</i>, namely, secular law, obligate them in their commercial relations and should the law mandate an employer’s liability for his employee’s sexual misconduct, the employer would be monetarily liable. Said conclusion is predicated upon the fact that the parties did not mutually agree in their labor contract that the employer would be exempt from responsibility for any sexual misbehavior that may be perpetrated by his employee in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, should the labor agreement exempt the employer from liability for his employee’s sexual misconduct, the contract is binding, and should a <i>minhag</i> mandate liability, the terms of the contract trump the <i>minhag</i>. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1, <i>Rema</i>, ad locum, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 332:2; <i>Teshuvot Zera Emet</i> 1, <i>YD</i> 97; <i>PDR</i> 8:78, 81; File no. 6186601, Tzfat Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

Cf. <i>Radakh</i>, <i>Shitah Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 83a, s.v. “<i>ha-sohair</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Melamed le-Hoeil</i>, <i>OH</i> 40; Sherman, supra n. 100.<br>However, should the <i>minhag</i>, namely the law, impute an employer’s liability and prohibit parties from agreeing that an employer would be exempt from liability for his employee’s misconduct, then the <i>minhag</i> trumps a labor contract that exempts the employer from responsibility. See <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:8; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:4, 103:7. Cf. <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:8.</i> Others, as we noted, have explicitly or implicitly dissented from this position and argued that <i>minhag</i> fails to serve as an avenue for mandating an employer’s liability.
Unlike New York law, in Halakha, there is generally no statute of limitations in advancing such claims for employer liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 98:1 and supra, ch. 3.</i> Even if the alleged act of abuse was perpetrated twenty or forty years ago, a <i>beit din</i> is empowered today to hear claims against an employer, such as a loss of educational opportunities, diminishment of salaries, reimbursement of health care expenses, and noneconomic claims such as pain and suffering.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">For a contemporary <i>beit din</i>’s authority to render a decision regarding <i>nezikin</i> claims and its legal enforceability, see supra, ch. 3.</i> Nevertheless, such a <i>beit din</i> decision would be unenforceable in some states such as in New York.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">In certain states such as NY, given that there is a statute that expressly provides that such a claim is time barred in court, it would be equally time barred in an arbitration such as a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. See NY CPLR, Section 7502. In short, though halakhically there is a basis for a victim of abuse filing a claim against his employer in <i>beit din</i>, nevertheless, in NY a statute of limitations will apply which will result in the claim being time barred, and thus a <i>beit din</i>’s decision imposing employer liability would be legally unenforceable.<br>Many states such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington rule that statutes of limitations are inapplicable to arbitration proceedings. See <i>Manhattan Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors, Inc.</i>, 173 Cal. App. 4th 1040, 1051 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 2009); <i>Owings and Merrill v.

Deciding between the competing arguments in our case will be the sole prerogative of the <i>Posek</i>. The relative strength of each argument applicable to our case, its effectiveness and plausibility, will hopefully be tested within the framework and constraints of future halakhic decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">One may very well contend that the abuser in the institutional setting is, in effect, the agent of the employer. The care and safekeeping of children in a yeshiva or youth organization as well as adults in various institutional settings have been entrusted to the employer and he in turn has entrusted their care with the rabbi, administrator, teacher, or health care professional. He was employed to discharge the institution’s mission and responsibility. He abused that special position in which the institution has placed him to discharge certain responsibilities.<br>The question is: assuming the employer establishes and implements the policies against sexual harassment, does Halakha maintain that he remains responsible if abuse transpires “under his watch” as a <i>meshale’ach</i>, as a principal who appointed his employee as an agent to carry out a mandate? We have refrained from examining our issue via the lens of <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> (agency).</i>

Chapter 5; The Status and Role of a To'ein Rabbani in the Beit Din Process

<b>The Status and Role of a <i>To’ein Rabbani</i> in the <i>Beit Din</i> Process</b><br>Generally, a <i>to’ein rabbani</i>, i.e., rabbinical advocate, is an individual who is well versed in the Shulhan Arukh (in particular Hoshen Mishpat and Even ha-Ezer) and <i>Poskim</i>, as well as knowledgeable in civil law. He is hired by a party to represent a litigant who is appearing at a <i>din torah</i> proceeding (case) and will advance claims on behalf of his client and respond to counterclaims of the opposing party. Numerous <i>Poskim</i> invoke the Talmud Yerushalmi’s appellation “<i>anetlar</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:1. This source, as well as some others in our presentation, have been culled from Nahum Rakover, “The Jewish Law of Agency in Legal Proceedings” (Hebrew), Yerushalayim: 1972, 192, 308–353; H.

See infra n. 16.</i>
To fully understand whether a <i>to’ein</i> is to be recognized as a participant in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding dealing with monetary matters, we need to briefly outline various building blocks that define civil <i>beit din</i> procedure. Firstly, though Halakha recognizes the ability of parties to appoint agents to represent them in their daily affairs, nonetheless, there is a mandate that in a <i>beit din</i> proceedings, both parties appear in front of the panel in order for the <i>dayanim</i> to ascertain the truth. Consequently, to avoid inaccuracies in the reconstruction of the facts and the articulation of the arguments by the litigants, there is a prohibition to hear arguments from a <i>meturgamen</i>, i.e., a translator.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Though most <i>Poskim</i> claim that this prohibition applies only to the testimony of witnesses (see <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:331; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:14) others argue that it equally applies to the litigants’ presentations. See <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Teshuvot Pe’er Hador</i> 102; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Makot</i> 6b; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i> (in the name of <i>Rambam</i>), <i>Shavuot</i> 13a.</i> As such, the parties themselves have to be present to speak to the <i>beit din</i> panel.
Should a party exhibit difficulty in expressing himself, there is an obligation incumbent on the <i>dayan</i> under certain prescribed conditions of “<i>petah pikha le-ilaim</i>” (lit. “open your mouth for the mute”), i.e., to assist the litigant in pleading his case.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:9; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:22. Such license equally applies when one litigant is sharp and bright and the other is na•ve and honest. See <i>Hafetz Hayyim</i> (Palache) 102:5.</i> Moreover, though a <i>dayan</i> may not communicate to a party any new arguments,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 21:10; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:8. Cf. <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:14.</i> nevertheless halakhic arguments such as procedural matters (the validity of a woman and/or minor’s testimony), or halakhic shortcomings in an agreement such as <i>asmakhta</i> (the lack of firm resolve to negotiate an agreement), or the inability to obligate oneself or transfer something due to the fact that it is <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i> (something which is not yet in existence) may be disclosed to a litigant.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Be’er Sheva</i> 71; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:16; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 67:33.</i> Additionally, depending upon the facts of the case, a <i>dayan</i> can articulate arguments on behalf of a recipient of a gift, an heir, or a buyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 67:29, 38; 81:3; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 62:16.</i>

Simultaneously, the <i>dayan</i> “walks a tightrope” and must refrain from becoming an advocate for a particular party.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 1:8; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 21:11, 23:10; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:10.</i> Advocacy of a particular position may teach the party to lie or advance arguments that are false, incorrect, or inaccurate, designed to bring about a miscarriage of justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Avot</i> 1:8.</i> Echoing the words of the Rambam,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 21:11.</i> Radvaz aptly notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radvaz</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, supra n. 12.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One requires a great degree of focus and incisive perception to distinguish between the one matter [permissible pleading on behalf of a party] and avoiding being an advocate [for a particular party].</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">We do not say in every situation “<i>petah pikha le-ilaim</i>,” it depends upon the opinion of the <i>dayan</i> … and he should not engender suspicion …</span>
Consequently, it is unsurprising to find that <i>Poskim</i> are critical of a <i>dayan</i> who is a member of a <i>zabla</i> panel (acronym for <i>zeh boreir lo achad</i> – each litigant chooses their <i>dayan</i> and the two <i>dayanim</i> then choose a third) who advances arguments of deceit on behalf of the litigant who chose him, rather than serving as an unbiased and disinterested <i>dayan</i>, advocating arguments on behalf of the party who chose him that are halakhically sound.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:2; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 13:4; <i>Teshuvot Panim Meirot</i> 2:159; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 8:300, 302; 9:285; <i>Teshuvot Even Yisrael</i> 8:90.</i>
The requirement of integrity and “distancing onself from falsehood” extends itself to everyone, including <i>to’anim</i> as well as <i>dayanim.</i> The prevalence of unethical practices used by some <i>to’anim</i> to win their cases, such as fabricating arguments that are factually and/or halakhically incorrect, training their clients to submit false claims, or misconstruing the facts, have led some <i>Poskim</i>, including Rif, Ri Migash, Rashi, Ramban, Ran in the name of Rambam, possibly Maharam of Rothenburg, Beit Yosef, Darkhei Moshe, Bah, Mabit, R. Shmuel Kali, R. Yair Bachrach, and R. Ovadiah Hadaya to prohibit their appearance and participation at a <i>beit din</i> proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ri Migash</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30b, s.v. “<i>matnei</i>”; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Avot</i> 1:8; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30a; <i>Ran</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Cremona ed., 175, 246; Lvov ed., 126; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1; <i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1; <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 33; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> 121; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 156; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 5, <i>EH</i> 63.<br>Though many <i>Rishonim</i> such as R. Meir Abulafia, Rabbeinu Peretz of Corbeil, and Rivash oppose allowing a <i>nitva</i> (defendant) to appoint a <i>mursheh</i>, nevertheless, the validity of a <i>nitva</i>’s appointment of a <i>mursheh</i> is irrelevant to our issue concerning the legitimacy of employing a <i>to’ein</i>. Similarly, though Rambam opposes the use of a representative for the <i>nitva</i>, his rulings specifically address the institution of a <i>mursheh</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i>, 372, 411. In fact, Ritva aptly observes that Rambam never expresses a view regarding the propriety of a <i>to’ein</i> in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. See <i>Ritva</i>, supra n. 3. Cf. <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Avot</i> 1:8, <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i> (Blau edition) 272.<br>As Meiri, Tashbetz, Ritva, and a contemporary <i>beit din</i> are aware or aptly observe, there exists a difference between an <i>anetlar</i> (<i>to’ein</i>) and a <i>mursheh</i>. A <i>tove’a</i> (plaintiff) may transfer to the <i>mursheh</i>, the outstanding debt due from the <i>nitva</i> and in effect the <i>murshe</i>, who has power of attorney, becomes the <i>tove’a</i>. However, given that the <i>nitva</i> is incapable of transferring anything to another individual, it is impossible for him to appoint a <i>mursheh</i>. See <i>Bava Kama</i> 70a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Geonim</i>, Harkavi ed., 180; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i>, Blau ed., 411; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 439; <i>Mateh Shimon</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:4.<br>On the other hand, an <i>anetlar</i> is authorized to represent either party in the <i>beit din</i> pleading without the issuance of a <i>harsha’a</i>, i.e., a power of attorney. See <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 18a, <i>Shavuot</i> 30a; <i>Tosafot Ri ha-Zaken</i>, <i>Shitat Kadmonim</i>, <i>Avoda Zara</i>, 3:126; <i>Ritva</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:206.<br>As aptly pointed out in a recent decision, people tend to use the words “<i>mursheh</i>” and “<i>anetlar</i>” interchangeably without realizing that that there is a halakhic distinction between the two institutions. See File no. 1-13-002793529, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Avraham Greif v. Chaya Greif</i>, April 4, 2005.<br>Based upon the foregoing, given that in situations of <i>harsha’a</i> it is a halakhic impossibility for a <i>nitva</i> to appoint a <i>murshe</i> (see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30a; <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1), therefore, the diverse views regarding whether a <i>nitva</i> may appoint a <i>mursheh</i> in effect would be identical to their views whether a <i>nitva</i> may appoint a <i>anetlar</i>. Consequently, we are able to discern their views regarding the propriety of appointing an <i>anetlar</i> for a <i>nitva</i> from their views regarding the appointment of a <i>mursheh</i> for a <i>nitva.</i> See text accompanying nn. 15–18.<br>The aforesaid rulings regarding <i>harsha’a</i> are therefore irrelevant regarding the propriety of allowing a <i>to’ein</i> in a <i>beit din</i>.<br>Nevertheless, we have been able to extrapolate Rashba and Ritva’s views regarding the status of a <i>to’ein</i> based upon some of the rulings relating to a <i>murshe.</i> See infra text accompanying nn.18–20, 28–29.<br>For the interdict to “distance oneself from falsehood,” see <i>Shemot</i> 23:7; <i>Shavuot</i> 30b–31a; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>YD</i> 402:12; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot To’ein ve</i>-<i>Nitain</i> 16:9; <i>Teshuvot Rama me-Fano</i> 55.</i> And in fact, in the past, some communities passed legislation prohibiting the appearance of any counsel for a proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 5:288; <i>Kerem Hemed</i> 2, <i>Takanah</i> 170; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, <i>HM</i> 6:1; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:12.</i> The results of this position are that <i>dayanim</i> address the halakhic issues without availing themselves of outside assistance and are capable of dealing with the litigants and their machinations, as well as offering limited counsel to the parties on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, some decisors assume that a <i>dayan</i> could “walk the tightrope” of assisting a litigant in articulating his claims, without engaging in any behavior where the <i>dayan</i> assumes the role of an advocate for a litigant.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30b, s.v. “<i>gemara</i>”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30b, s.v. “<i>u-leinyan</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i>, 2:393; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, supra n. 12; <i>Radvaz</i>, ad locum; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:9.<br>The same conclusion equally applies to <i>to’anim</i>. See <i>Shabbat</i> 139a; <i>Rambam</i>, <i>Commentary to Mishnah</i>, <i>Avot</i> 1:8; <i>Hafetz Hayyim</i>, supra n. 5.</i> As such, there is no need to have a <i>to’ein</i> in attendance at a <i>beit din</i> proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">My personal experience of over fifteen years in <i>dayanut</i> has shown that sometimes such expectations of a <i>dayan</i> being able to help a litigant are realized in a particular <i>din torah</i>.

On the other hand, other <i>Poskim</i>, including Arukh, Rabbeinu Hananel, Ri ha-Zaken, Rashba, Ra’ah, Meiri, Maharik, Urim ve-Tumim, R.

We have concluded in accordance with some <i>Aharonim</i> that Rashba allows the presence of a <i>to’ein</i> for the plaintiff in all circumstances and allows a <i>to’ein</i> to appear on behalf of a defendant provided that the defendant communicates his claims to him. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:743, 2:393, 404; 3:141, 6:210.

See <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i>, <i>Avot</i> 1:8.</i> For some <i>Poskim</i>, even if the <i>to’ein</i> received a <i>ketav harsha’a</i> from the litigant authorizing the <i>to’ein</i> to appear in the absence of his client, the litigant must be present at the actual <i>beit din</i> proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7b, s.v. “<i>she’moah</i>”; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1, <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i>, infra n. 32; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 4:1; <i>PDR</i> 2:142.

See <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1 (end); <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:2.</i> And some <i>Poskim</i> argue that prior to the <i>to’ein</i>’s actual presentation, the litigant should submit his claims and arguments to the <i>beit din</i> panel.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i>, 2:404; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:14.</i>
The role of a <i>to’ein</i> expresses itself in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>edut</i>, i.e., testimony. Generally speaking, a person must refrain from testifying in a matter from which he may benefit, i.e., <i>noge’a ba-davar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 354; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i>, 37:21; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 80.<br>Regarding a <i>mursheh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 123:11 concurs. However, <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 23 concludes that permitting such testimony is disgusting. In contemporary times, Rabbis Roth, Broth and Hadaya sanctioned such a practice. See Shochetman, supra n. 1, at 67, n. 157. Additionally, see supra n. 16.</i> One of the rationales for this Halakha is that we are suspicious that such an individual would submit tainted testimony. Seemingly, one would expect that a <i>to’ein</i> who is a <i>noge’a ba-davar</i> refrain under all circumstances from submitting testimony on behalf of his client. Nevertheless, some <i>Poskim</i> argue that as long as the <i>to’ein</i>’s remuneration is based on his time investment rather than his ability to win the case for his client, he is not construed as a <i>noge’a ba-davar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rif</i>, Leiter ed., 157; <i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 119; <i>Panim Meirot</i>, supra n. 15; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 5:351; Appeal 1/58/711 (Unpublished Decision, The State Archives, Meichal 4796, File no. 99/36) cited by Shochetman, supra n. 1, at 67, n. 152.</i> and therefore his appearance in a <i>beit din</i> under such conditions is permissible. In other words, <i>Poskim</i> who permit halakhic advocacy argue that one cannot summarily assume that all <i>to’anim</i> lack credibility, and therefore deny their appearance in <i>beit din</i>. This is why we do not assume a <i>to’ein</i> who receives compensation for his services based upon his time investment will lie on behalf of his client.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">However, if their compensation were based upon demonstrating positive results for his client, such testimony submitted by the <i>to’ein</i> to the <i>beit din</i> would be inadmissible. See <i>Mispatekha le-Ya’akov</i>, 2:36 (14).</i> Adopting the perspective of the aforesaid <i>Poskim</i>, there is a presumption that a <i>to’ein</i> will vigorously pursue his client’s objectives with integrity and a sense of fairness. In effect, though these <i>Poskim</i> were well aware of the Mishnaic and Midrashic exhortations against rabbinic advocacy due to the potential for corruption,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 1:8; <i>Mekhilta de-Rabbi Yishmael</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i>, <i>Parsha</i> 20; <i>Rabbeinu Yona</i>, <i>Commentary to Avot</i> 1:8.</i> they hold that there is nevertheless a presumption of credibility and that the <i>to’ein</i> possesses the ability “to walk the tightrope.”
However, what if a <i>to’ein</i> undermines his <i>hezkat kashrut</i>, i.e., presumption of credibility, because he received compensation linked to the outcome of a case, or for another reason? Would <i>Poskim</i> prohibit his advocacy in future <i>dinei torah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even in the absence of such a provision, a <i>beit din</i> operating under the Israel Chief Rabbinate is empowered to impose monetary penalties against a <i>to’ein</i> who acts improperly. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; File 875507-1, Supreme Beit Din, <i>To’ein Rabbani Almoni v. Ploni</i>, November 7, 2012.</i> For example, even though in general Rashba rejects the possibility of appointing <i>to’anim</i> for various reasons, including issues of credibility,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See supra nn. 16 and 18.</i> nevertheless under certain circumstances, such as a <i>dayan</i> prone to error or a defendant incapable of articulating his arguments, Rashba permits their appearance.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashba</i>, supra n. 22.</i> Similarly, though Ritva admittedly is aware that an <i>anetlar</i> may advance claims grounded in falsehood, nevertheless he allows his appointment, in part based upon the instructions of his teachers, Ra’ah and Rashba.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 30b, s.v. “<i>ve-khi teima</i>.” Cf. <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 31a, s.v. “<i>to’ein</i>”; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 154.</i>
A few hundred years later, R. Hayyim Benveniste of seventeenth-century Izmir, Turkey railed against the deceptive practices of <i>to’anim</i> and contended that it is prohibited for a <i>to’ein</i> to advance arguments that are devoid of truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A position that was echoed by <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 123:32.</i> but he refrained from outlawing their appearance in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i> 2:90.</i> During the same century in Poland, R. Shmuel ben David ha-Levi, renowned author of <i>Nahalat Shiva</i>, described the rabbinic advocates as those “who search the books for logical argumentation and <i>halakhot</i> which are right in their eyes, and in the majority of instances they ingest the waste and throw out the food when they realize that the Halakha did not agree with them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nahalat Shiva</i> 44.</i> Here again, the <i>Posek</i> does not prohibit the continued use of a <i>to’anim</i>, but advises the <i>dayan</i> to rebuke them for their improper conduct. The renowned seventeenth-century <i>Posek</i>, R. Shabbetai ben Meir ha-Kohen (known by the acronym “Shakh”) of Vilna and later of Holesov, Moravia lambasted <i>to’anim</i> who “are deceptive … even in a matter which is devoid of reality,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 31.</i> yet he refrained from advocating the abolition of the institution of rabbinic advocacy, as can be seen in the his subsequent ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1.</i>
Subsequently, in one of the lengthiest <i>teshuvot</i> dealing with the prohibition of litigating one’s matters in secular court, R. Avraham Hayyim Rodriguez of eighteenth-century Livorno, Italy criticizes in the most trenchant terms those who proceed to civil court to address their litigious matters in order to avoid appearing in a <i>beit din</i> serviced by <i>to’anim</i>, whom he describes as those who “distanced themselves from truth and justice and drew closer to falsehood … and communicated to the <i>dayanim</i> matters that never came into the mind of the litigant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Orah le-Tzadik</i>, supra n. 3. See <i>Teshuvot Hukat Mishpat</i> 2:3.</i> Yet, here again, the <i>Posek</i> continues to proscribe a Jew from litigating his case in civil court, and does not ban the practice of rabbinic advocacy in <i>beit din</i>. To state it differently, despite the <i>to’anim</i>’s deceptive tactics, R. Rodriguez refrains from issuing a <i>heter arkaot</i>, permission to litigate their case in civil court.
This posture continues to persevere to this very day among various contemporary <i>Poskim</i>. Addressing a twentieth-century situation of a crafty and conniving <i>to’ein</i>, an opposing party exclaims that he is unable to defend himself against such an individual and demands that R. Shmuel Gaimazian of Yerushalayim prohibit the <i>to’ein</i>’s appearance at the <i>din torah</i>. In a succinct <i>teshuva</i> comprising nine lines, R. Gaimazian denies the questioner relief and concludes with the following words,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Tzedek</i> 139.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In a place where it is customary that a defendant has a <i>murshe</i> (loosely translated as a <i>to’ein</i>), he must stand with the opposing party for resolution of the case and he cannot argue in such a manner.</span>
Though criticizing <i>to’anim</i> who manipulate the system to promote their client’s best interests, R. Yosef Elyashiv and R. Yehezkel Roth, the Karlsberg Rebbe, do not raise the possibility of abolishing the institution.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He’arot le-Masekhet Ketuvot</i> 52b; <i>Teshuvot Emek ha-Teshuva</i> 6:542.</i> Finally, a few years ago, in possibly one the most scathing and detailed critiques of the tactics of <i>to’anim</i> who display the art of deception and obfuscation recorded in our <i>sifrei teshuvot</i> (responsa literature), R. Yehuda Bracha in his <i>teshuva</i> concludes based on his experience that one is permitted to be a <i>to’ein</i> provided one serves with a sense of fairness and integrity. Here again, the <i>Posek</i> refrains from banning the institution of <i>to’anim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Birkat Yehuda</i> 3:3.</i> In 2009, R. Avraham Drabermediker, a Yerushalmi <i>dayan</i> and an author of a treatise on <i>beit din</i> procedure concurred with R. Bracha.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Seder ha-Din</i>, 515–516.</i>
Optimally, as we mentioned, there is a need for a <i>to’ein</i> to abide by the prohibition against advancing arguments of falsehood and fabricating evidence,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Supra text accompanying n. 20.</i> yet as we have shown, the views of <i>Rashba</i>, <i>Ritva</i>, R. Hayyim Benveniste, R. Shmuel ben Dovid ha-Levi, <i>Shakh</i>, and Rabbis Rodriguez, Elyashiv, Roth, Gaimazian, Bracha, and Drabermediker direct us to the conclusion that a <i>beit din</i> hearing may be conducted where a litigant is utilizing the services of an unscrupulous <i>to’ein.</i> The expectation is that the <i>to’ein</i> will exhibit credibility.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rotenburg</i>, Levov ed., 127.</i> But, should he display tactics of deception, as halakhically objectionable as such behavior may be, the aforementioned <i>Poskim</i> do not seek to outlaw the institution of rabbinic advocacy.
A review of some of the <i>teshuvot</i> reveals various reasons for permitting a litigant to avail himself of the services of a <i>to’ein.</i> First, attuned to the varying capabilities of a <i>ba’al din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 14a (bottom).</i> some <i>Rishonim</i> observe that “there are some people who are clever and know how to contradict the words of their antagonists.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 14a, s.v. “<i>dina</i>”; <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i> in the name of <i>Gilyon Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 14a; <i>Tosafot ha-Rosh</i>, ad locum in the name of <i>Rivam</i>; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 51a. See also, <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 31a, s.v. “<i>zeh</i>.”</i> The inference to be drawn from this statement is that some individuals are unable to articulate their arguments. Hence, one may avail himself of the services of a <i>to’ein</i> if he is incapable of pleading his case due to the lack of requisite skills in articulating his claims, incapable of formulating questions aimed at evoking the opposing party’s reply, or bereft of the talent to read and understand legal documents and financial records. Sometimes, a party is incapable of responding to the opposing party’s questioning and/or is high-strung and emotionally irate, which stymies the party’s self-expression.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Geonim</i>, Harkavi ed., No. 206; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 123:17; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Shavuot</i> 31a; <i>Hoshen ha-Ephod</i>, supra n. 20; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, <i>pesakim</i> 217; <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 122:1; Shlomo Shapiro, 13 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 343, 348 (5768). Cf. <i>Teshuvot Temim De’im</i> 62; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 13:32; 123:32.</i> Hence, the presence of an intermediary such as a <i>to’ein</i> who is well-informed regarding the facts and claims of the contentious matter may serve to “moderate the atmosphere” and articulate his client’s position based on his scrutiny of the facts and review of the documentation.
Second, as we mentioned, a <i>dayan</i> must be very careful in maintaining his role of independence, being “above the fray.” Consequently, to preempt the possibility of transforming a <i>dayan</i> into an attorney advocating the claims for one party, the role of assisting the litigant in articulating his claims should be the province of the <i>to’ein</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yahel Yisrael</i> 102.</i> Clearly, the <i>to’ein</i> must foster the promotion of justice rather than serve as an advocate fabricating lies.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta</i>, <i>Parshat Mishpatim</i>, <i>parsha</i> 20.

A cursory glance of their <i>piskei din</i> reveals that the <i>dayanim</i>, while in the presence of <i>to’anim</i>, may nevertheless serve in an advisory capacity to the litigants.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:404; <i>PDR</i> 1:5, 9; 4:175; 10:273; 14:71.</i>
Third, R. Yosef Alfandri offers a historical reason for the value of having <i>to’anim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Porat Yosef</i>, supra n. 3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is nice and pleasant that Torah scholars be <i>murshim</i>, because they can search the sources of the <i>Poskim</i> … and show it to the <i>beit din</i>.</span>
Clearly, in this community of nineteenth-century Constantinople, the Torah scholarship of the <i>to’anim</i> contributed to fill the gaps of knowledge found among the local <i>dayanim</i>. In fact, today, there are some <i>to’anim</i> who are more proficient in Halakha than some individual <i>dayanim</i> and/or some <i>beit din</i> panels in some major cities around the United States. As such, the expertise of the <i>dayanim</i> remains a factor in retaining <i>to’anim</i>. Implicit in such an argument is that the <i>dayan</i>, who albeit is less knowledgeable than a particular deceptive <i>to’ein</i>, has the learning skills to scrutinize the merits of the <i>to’ein</i>’s halakhic presentation, and if need be, to seek halakhic counsel<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, even if the <i>dayan</i> is halakhically proficient, some <i>Poskim</i> mandate that under certain prescribed conditions one seek advice from another arbiter prior to rendering a <i>psak din</i>.

Fourth, despite Sma and Shakh’s<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Text accompanying nn.15, 23, 31, and 35.</i> repeated reservations regarding the appointment of a translator or a <i>to’ein</i> because of his lack of credibility,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 13:12, 17:14, 123:1, 124:1.</i> nevertheless since both litigants have voluntarily accepted the jurisdiction of the <i>beit din</i> and implicit in such acceptance is that <i>to’anim</i> will participate in the <i>beit din</i> process, Sma and Shakh conclude that the practice should be permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:14; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:1.

Finally, other <i>Poskim</i> validate the appearance of a <i>to’ein</i> based upon <i>minhag</i> (custom) either construing it as if the litigants have consented to this institution or without grounding it in the consent of both litigants.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 119; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 104; <i>Sma</i>, supra n. 54; <i>Shakh</i>, supra n. 54; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 124; <i>Tumim</i>, ad locum 1; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Shmuel</i> (Kali) 121; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot She’al Ha’ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 17; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 124:2; Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i>, 120; <i>Sefer Seder ha-Din</i>, supra n. 40, 512.</i> Consequently, echoing the words of Aruch ha-Shulhan and Tumim, R. Eliav Shochetman of Yerushalayim, an internationally renowned expert on <i>beit din</i> procedure communicated to this author the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In a written communication dated April 26, 2012 to this author (on file with this author).

<span class="poetry indentAll">I do not know on what basis a <i>beit din</i> has the authority to prohibit the appearance of <i>to’anim</i> given that the <i>minhag</i> that developed is that both the plaintiff and the defendant can have representation in <i>beit din</i>.</span>
Attesting to this ongoing <i>minhag</i>, recently handed down <i>piskei din</i> appear on the web on a weekly basis from <i>battei din</i> under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate and/or from Eretz Hemdah-Gazit network, in which litigants are represented by <i>to’anim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One should not draw a conclusion that other Israeli <i>battei din</i> follow suit. For example, in Yerushalayim, a <i>beit din</i> in Ma’alei Adumim, which serves a <i>dati leumi</i> populace, and the <i>beit din</i> ha-Yashar ve-ha-Tov, which attends to the needs of the yeshiva community, both prohibit the use of a <i>to’ein</i>.</i>
Whether the <i>minhag</i> of having <i>to’anim</i> depends on the decision of the litigants remains an open question. Implementing Radvaz and Hazon Ish’s view that the consent of both litigants is required in order to permit <i>to’anim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 2:753; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 4:7–8. Additionally see, <i>Dinei Mamonot</i> vol. 1, 263.</i> to the best of my knowledge there is at least one standing <i>beit din</i> in the New York metropolitan area which insists that both parties must demand the services of a <i>to’ein</i> in order to permit their appearance and participation at a <i>beit din</i> proceeding.
Consequently, absent the mutual agreement of the litigants to have <i>to’anim</i>, if one party requests a <i>to’ein</i> and the opposing party refuses to have one, the pending <i>din torah</i> will be resolved without the services of a <i>to’ein.</i> However, echoing the words of Sma, Hazon Ish, and the Beit <i>Din ha-Gadol</i> in Yerushalayim,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:14; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 4:7; File no. 113002793529, infra n. 74. See also, <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:404; <i>Tur SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 9:7.</i> the overwhelming majority of <i>battei din</i> in the New York metropolitan area will allow the appearance of a <i>to’ein</i> by one party even if the opposing party decides to proceed without the services of a <i>to’ein</i>, or if the opposing party requests that the <i>beit din</i> hearing take place without the presence and/or participation of <i>to’anim</i>.
In sum, explicit or implicit in the position espoused by Rashba, Ritva, R. Benveniste, R. Shmuel ben Dovid ha-Levi, Shakh, and Rabbis Rodriguez, Elyashiv, Gaimazian, Bracha, and Drabermediker is the recognition of all or some of the aforesaid reasons for why litigants as well as a <i>beit din</i> panel would want to avail themselves of the services of a <i>to’ein</i>. To state it differently, though there is a consensus that a <i>to’ein</i> is <i>not required</i> at a <i>beit din</i> proceeding, nevertheless, even if the <i>to’ein</i> may be of dubious credentials, there may be a redeeming value in retaining him. And in fact, generally speaking the <i>minhag</i> today is to allow <i>to’anim</i> to participate in <i>beit din</i> hearings. In effect, the ramifications of their posture is that while in certain instances the <i>dayan</i> may have to assume the daunting challenge of traversing a minefield of lies attuning himself to the deceptive tactics of a <i>to’ein</i>, the redeeming qualities of a <i>to’ein</i> together with discernment and halakhic acumen will help him arrive at a coherent and persuasive decision based on the halakhic cogency of the claims. If one is permitted to continue a <i>beit din</i> proceeding which entails a <i>din merume</i>, a proceeding marked by a fraudulent monetary claims contrived by a <i>to’ein</i>, this means that under such circumstances it is incumbent upon a <i>dayan</i> to persevere, carry forward the <i>din torah</i>, and arrive at a <i>psak din shel emet</i>, a ruling reflective of the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For the various guidelines how to deal with deceit and fraud including under what conditions a <i>dayan</i> ought to recuse himself from continuing to adjudicate a case, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i>, Blau ed., 58; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 68:20, 77:4, 107:6; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1209, 2:148, 283; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 108; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 2:881; <i>Radvaz</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 24:3; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 232, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 710; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 108; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 40; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 119; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:3; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:12–13; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:5; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 75:1; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:9 in the name of <i>Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:142 and <i>Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 91; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 76; <i>PDR</i> 9:331, 349–351.<br>Though the rulings emerging from these aforementioned <i>sifrei psak</i> and <i>sifrei teshuvot</i> deal with a fabricated claim advanced by a litigant, nonetheless these rulings ought to be applicable to a <i>to’ein</i>’s argumentation which is marked by manipulation.</i>
Well aware of the machinations of the “<i>yetzer ha’ra</i>” (the evil impulse) and the existence of deception in the human persona, the late R. Eliyahu Dessler, <i>mashgiach ruhani</i> (spiritual supervisor and advisor) of the Ponevezeh Yeshiva in Eretz Yisrael observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, Yerushalayim, 1987, 60. A similar idea was echoed approximately two hundred years earlier by R. M. Luzzatto. See <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, <i>perek</i> 3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since bribery blinds the learned and man cannot discern his own faults, how can we ever arrive at the truth? … The answer is that bias never completely conceals the truth … the inability of the <i>yetzer</i> to obscure the truth entirely is the direct result of the Creator’s ever abiding kindness to his creatures. Every individual has the capacity of determining in his own heart where the actual truth lies.</span>
As Vilna Gaon observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Perush ha-Gra</i>, <i>Mishlei</i> 6:4.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The <i>dayanim</i> have to be proficient also in the way of the world in order to avoid a fraudulent judgment. If they will fail to have expertise in these matters even if they are well versed in Torah scholarship, the judgment will not be true.</span>
A Jew’s mission to discern between truth and manipulation equally extends to a Jew who assumes the mantle of <i>dayanut</i> who must deal with litigants and <i>to’anim</i> who may exhibit duplicity and deceit. Even if a litigant fabricates an argument in order to instill fear in the opposing part’s mind and heart, it is a <i>dayan</i>’s mandate to inform him “you are speaking a lie.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:12. Cf. others who contend that one can advance arguments (rather than claims) that entail deception. See. <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 2:17; <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 38, <i>helek</i> 1 (end) in the name of <i>Ra’avad</i>; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 75:57.</i> In other words, a <i>dayan</i> must be capable of discerning truth from falsehood regarding a litigant’s argumentation. We can expect no less from a <i>dayan</i> confronting a <i>to’ein</i>’s pleadings.
On the other hand, there are <i>battei din</i> today that prohibit the appearance of a <i>to’ein</i> at a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. For example, in Yerushalayim there is at least one <i>beit din</i> that will outlaw <i>to’anim</i> due to their deceptive tactics and another <i>beit din</i> that will ban them because the panel wants to hear from the litigants directly rather than through an intermediary.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Seder ha-Din</i>, supra n. 40, 516; Y. Freis, <i>av beit din</i> (presiding <i>dayan</i>) for a <i>beit din</i> in Ma’alei Adumin, Yerushalayim, in a written communication dated August 16, 2013 to this author.</i>
In conclusion, the propriety of allowing a <i>to’ein</i> to participate in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding is subject to controversy. Should a <i>to’ein</i>’s behavior be marked by deceit and manipulation, it is a matter of halakhic debate whether it then becomes the <i>dayan</i>’s responsibility to recuse him from this <i>din torah</i>. It is the prerogative of the <i>Posek</i> and/or <i>beit din</i> to decide what policy it ought to pursue regarding these matters.
<b>Addendum</b>
The foregoing presentation shows that there is a divergency of halakhic opinion regarding the propriety of retaining a <i>to’ein</i> of dubious credentials for a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. Despite the highly objectionable presence at a proceeding of a <i>to’ein</i> that is crafty and deceptive, nonetheless as we have shown, there are <i>Poskim</i> who fail to ban the institution and nonetheless trust that a <i>dayan</i> will have the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood and arrive at a credible decision. And there are others who prohibit a <i>to’ein</i>’s appearance and are unwilling to rely upon the <i>dayan</i>’s ability to persevere and attain the <i>emet</i>, the truth, for the parties involved.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, there are other reasons for these differing positions regarding the retaining of a <i>to’ein</i>.</i>
This halakhic debate is not limited to our issue regarding the propriety of having a <i>to’ein</i> present at a <i>din torah</i>. In fact, there are numerous instances regarding <i>beit din</i> procedure where we encounter a controversy regarding the parameters of halakhic judicial ethics in general and the willingness to trust a <i>dayan</i> to render a proper <i>psak din</i> in particular. For example, prior to knowing that he would serve on a case, a <i>dayan</i> hears <i>ex parte</i> the arguments from one party and communicates to the party his opinion regarding the merits of the <i>tove’a</i>’s pleadings. Is that rabbi permitted to serve as a <i>dayan</i> for that pending matter? If a rabbi hears the arguments of only one side and offers his view concerning the matter, some <i>Poskim</i> are concerned that he has crystallized his position and therefore will not be receptive to weighing the evidence and arguments of the opposing party submitted at the time of the <i>din torah</i>. As such, he would be invalidated from serving as a <i>dayan</i> for the <i>din torah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 17:120.</i> However, others would permit him to be retained as a <i>dayan</i> for the proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 3:97; <i>Teshuvot Maharlbach</i>, <i>Kuntres ha-Semikha</i> 147; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 79; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:9. In such a situation, <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:5 and <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 17:11 require that the rabbi disclose to the opposing party that he heard the arguments of the opposing side prior to the proceeding. And should the party consent to the rabbi’s participation, he is permitted to serve on the <i>din torah</i>.</i> Here again, the question is: Can we trust the <i>dayan</i> to issue a credible <i>psak</i> or not after having heard the arguments <i>ex parte</i> from one party?
Another example of a debate that centers around our willingness to trust a <i>dayan</i> that he will hand down a credible decision deals with the procedures implemented in a <i>zabla</i> proceeding. Many <i>Poskim</i> will allow a <i>boreir</i> to speak prior to and during the proceeding with the party who has selected him.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>HM</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:143; <i>Teshuvot Mahari of Pozen</i> (Rav of Magen Avraham) 77; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 13:3–4; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:88; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo</i> 22; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 9:136; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 8:302; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Shalom</i> (Krauss) 1:83; File no. 1158-68, Beit Din Yerushalayim 11:20, 23 (in the name of R.

See also, <i>Kesei Mishpat</i> 13.</i> In fact, some <i>shtarei borerut</i>, arbitration agreements, explicitly state that the <i>boreirim</i> may receive unequal compensation. In other words, parties may explicitly agree that a <i>dayan</i> may be a <i>noge’a ba-davar</i>, an interested party.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 218; <i>PDR</i> 7:225, 259 (R. Goldschmidt’s opinion). However if, for example, one party refuses to accept such an arrangement regarding unequal compensation, the compensation for the two <i>borerim</i> must be equal. See <i>Kesei Mishpat</i>, supra n. 71.</i> Here again, some authorities place their trust in <i>borerim</i> who conduct <i>ex parte</i> communications with their party and receive compensation for their services in an amount that exceeds the renumeration received by the opposing <i>boreir</i> from his party and still trust that they will retain their integrity and issue a proper ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In the event that a <i>boreir</i> is delinquent in his responsibility, the <i>shalish</i>, who is the third <i>dayan</i> chosen by the <i>boreirim</i> with the consent of the litigants, is prohibited from conducting <i>ex parte</i> communications with the parties, and receives the same renumeration for his services from both litigants, will render a credible <i>psak din</i>. See <i>Maharash Engel</i>, supra n. 68; <i>Panim Meirot</i>, supra n. 15.</i> In short, despite the disparity between the various judicial practices, the common thread that underlies all of these practices is that some <i>Poskim</i> are ready and prepared to trust in a <i>dayan</i>’s integrity to render a credible judgment under extenuating circumstances. As such, just like a <i>dayan</i> prior to a hearing who heard the arguments from one party in the absence of the opposing party, we trust in his ability to reach a just decision. Similarily, we trust that a <i>boreir</i> can advance sound and credible halakhic arguments for his client despite the fact that he may be engaging in <i>ex parte</i> communications with his client and may be receiving more compensation than the opposing <i>boreir</i>. Given such a posture, one can readily understand that many contemporary American and Israeli <i>Poskim</i> entrust a <i>dayan</i> with being able to deal with a <i>to’ein</i> of dubious credentials rather than advocating the abolishment of the institution.
Such conclusions will raise the eyebrows of individuals such as attorneys who have been imbued with a code of professional judicial ethics that looks askance at such practices. As noted by the <i>Beit Din ha-Gadol</i> in Yerushalayim, the halakhic guidelines for judicial responsibility may be markedly different than that of a civil code of judicial ethics.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See File no. 113002793529, <i>Beit din ha-Gadol</i>, April 4, 2005; File no. 8123782, <i>Beit Din ha-Gadol</i>, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, September 27, 2011. In fact, in situations in which Halakha is divided over the propriety of a particular judicial practice, some decisors who may personally ascribe to the view which is in variance with the prevailing professional code of judicial ethics may opt to align their posture with the view of the legal code rather than be subjected to the aspersions cast upon them by attorneys! For such concerns, see File no. 8123782, op. cit.<br>If there would have existed halakhic unanimity that a rabbi who hears <i>ex parte</i> the arguments of one party may serve on the case as a <i>dayan</i> and that a <i>boreir</i> is allowed to engage in <i>ex parte</i> conversations with the party who chose him and receive from him compensation exceeding the amount remitted to the opposing <i>boreir</i>, there would still be a basis for outlawing such practices based upon <i>Hatam Sofer</i>’s teaching, “If the matter had been submitted to us, we would have legislated it.” In other words, even if the halakhic consensus would be to sanction such judicial practices, given that civil legislation in the format of professional codes of judicial ethics proscribes this conduct, invoking Hatam Sofer’s <i>sevara</i> (halakhic logic) decisors would choose to prohibit these practices. See infra ch. 8, “Dual Real Estate Commission, Illegal Contracts, and Civil Law.”</i> Obviously, in the United States, a <i>beit din</i> ruling is viewed as a binding arbitration decision provided the panel complies with the rules of civil arbitration. As such, the propriety of the particular judicial practice adopted by the panel, as well as requirements of proper disclosure to the parties of the potential prejudice of a <i>dayan</i>, must pass muster with the provisions of arbitration law. Failure in compliance with civil law requirements may result in a civil court vacating, nullifying the <i>beit din psak din</i>. As such, even if a particular judicial practice has halakhic approval, should it stand in variance with the rules of civil code of judicial ethics, a <i>beit din</i> ought to refrain from adopting such a practice based upon <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Given that civil arbitration law mandates that an arbitration panel, including but not limited to a <i>beit din</i>, is required to comply with certain rules of civil procedure, Halakha recognizes such a mandate based upon the doctrine of <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i>. Whether this rule is valid biblically or rabbinically is a matter of debate. See <i>Avnei Miluim</i>, <i>EH</i> 28:2; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA EH</i> 28:3; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 314; <i>Teshuvot Binyan Tzion</i> 2:15. Failure for a <i>beit din</i> to comply with a particular arbitration procedure entails the violation of an <i>issur</i>, a prohibition. See <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 28a, <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a; <i>Teshuvot Maharshach</i> 2:219.</i> the law of the kingdom is the law, as well as avoid running the risk that its decision will be vacated by a civil court.

<b>A. Spousal Rape, the Grounds for Divorcing an Adulterer, Retrieving Electronically Stored Information Incident to Divorce, and <i>Nezikin</i> Claims</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Rochel Rabinowitz v. Ya’akov Rabinowitz</i></span>
Ya’akov Rabinowitz (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>) and Rochel Rabinowitz (hereafter: <i>Tova’at</i>) have been married in accordance with Halakha for ten years and reside in New Jersey. Rochel begins to suspect that her husband is having an affair. Rather than hire a private detective to observe her husband’s activities, she decides to engage in some “self-help discovery.” The <i>tova’at</i> boots up the family computer, which both the husband and wife use without passwords, and logs into the <i>Nitva</i>’s e-mails that had already been read and were in “post-transmission storage.” Among the e-mails she finds are numerous communications to and from a woman, one of the <i>Nitva</i>’s co-workers; the e-mails are intimate and of a romantic nature. After her discovery of these e-mails pointing to her husband’s engagement in an extra-marital affair and hearing rumors of his behavior, the <i>Tova’at</i> offered them as evidence during divorce proceeding for consideration by the <i>beit din</i> as grounds for obligating her spouse to deliver a <i>get</i> to her. Additionally, people observed him interacting with this woman.
Two years ago, the <i>Nitva</i> moved out of the marital home and he continues to refuse to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.
The above parties signed a <i>shtar borerut</i>, an arbitration agreement empowering this <i>beit din</i> panel to resolve this matter according to the applicable portions of the Shulhan Arukh and <i>Poskim</i>.
<b><i>Tova’at</i>’s Claims</b>
Based upon the production of the <i>Nitva</i>’s e-mails which reveal that over a period of a few months he has been engaging in an extra-marital affair, which exposes him to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) such as AIDS, as well as the fact that various individuals have submitted testimony that the <i>Nitva</i> has been seen in the company of this woman, the <i>Tova’at</i> is requesting that the <i>beit din</i> obligate the <i>Nitva</i> to deliver a <i>get</i> to the <i>Tova’at</i>.
Moreover, in the few times that the <i>Nitva</i> engages in conjugal relations, <i>Tova’at</i> claims that <i>Nitva</i> came to her incessantly during the night, insisted on repeated intercourse, forced her to engage in unnatural cohabitation, leaving her intolerably sleepless and exhausted.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Reply</b>
Though <i>Nitva</i> admitted that these e-mails were from his computer, nevertheless <i>Nitva</i> argues that he never wrote them. In addition, he argues that even if he is the author of these e-mails, it is a violation of Federal and NJ law as well as Halakha to submit evidence in marital disputes that has been unlawfully retrieved from electronically stored information. Furthermore, even if this improper conduct happened, <i>Nitva</i> claims he continuously protected his spouse by using a condom. Since a condom is highly effective in preventing HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), herpes simplex, hepatitis B, and gonorrhea, <i>Nitva</i> claims that he is not endangering his wife’s health and therefore a <i>get</i> should not be granted. Finally, the fact that he has been in the company of this woman does not mean that he is engaging in an illicit relationship with her. In the absence of definitive proof that he committed adultery, there are no grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to direct him to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.
<i>Nitva</i> admits to <i>Tova’at</i>’s claim of spousal rape, but argues that Rambam writes that a wife must be attentive to all his wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 14:7, 15:18.</i> In fact, unnatural conjugal relations without his wife’s consent is seemingly sanctioned in a Talmudic dictum that states, “A husband may do whatever he wishes to his wife.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 20b.</i>
In short, alleges <i>Nitva</i> unconditional intercourse is what a Jewish marriage is all about, and therefore, there are no grounds for giving his wife a <i>get.</i>
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Retrieval of Electronically Stored Data: New Jersey Privacy Law and the Halakha</b>
In pursuance to the terms of the <i>shtar borerut</i>, this matter is to be resolved in accordance with Halakha, and the norms of <i>minhag</i>, custom, do not dictate that this issue be addressed through the lens of NJ law. Nonetheless, since the <i>Nitva</i>’s defense in part relies upon New Jersey law, we have chosen to address the state of NJ law regarding this matter.
In reply to <i>Nitva</i>’s contention that the retrieval of electronically stored information incident to divorce is a violation of both Halakha as well as secular law, we beg to differ.
The passage of Federal Wiretap Act and NJ Wiretap Act in 1968 recognized a right to privacy in communications by prohibiting recording conversations through wiretaps on phones or hidden microphones. In 1986, due to technological advances, Congress amended the Wiretap Act with the passage of the Electronic Communications and Privacy Act (ECPA), and a few years later New Jersey amended the NJ Wiretap Act with provisions identical to the ECPA, prohibiting intentional interception of electronic communications such as cell phone conversations and e-mails.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">18 USC Sections 2701–2711 (2000); NJSA 2A: 156A-27 (a) (West 2000).</i>
The leading case regarding the accessing of a spouse’s e-mail in New Jersey is <i>White v. White.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">344 NJ Super. 211 (Ch. Div. 2001).</i> This case dealt with a husband filing a motion to suppress e-mails stored on a family computer hard drive which had been submitted to the court in order to buttress his wife’s divorce action alleging marital infidelity. Firstly, the court held that the language of the NJ Wiretap Act contains no explicit exemption for any wiretapping or any electronic communication by an aggrieved spouse. As noted by the court, it is already settled law in New Jersey that an inter-spousal exception does not exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Scott v.

Consequently, the court addressed the legality of the wife’s interception of her spouse’s e-mails. Following in the footsteps of <i>Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. US Secret Service</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">36 F. 3d 457, 461–464 (5th Cir. 1994).</i> the court held that since the e-mail was accessed while in electronic storage, i.e., saved in the husband’s file cabinet rather than acquired during electronic transmission, such interception does not run afoul of the NJ Wiretap Act.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 4, at 220.</i> Messages read and saved are not within the scope of the NJ Wiretap Act. This understanding of federal and state legislation protected the right of a spouse to access e-mail stored on the hard drive of a family computer which could be accessed by all.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Had the husband failed to give consent to access the computer, such interception would not have been authorized. See supra n. 4, at 221.</i> Neither the system nor the files accessed were password protected. In other words, whether a spouse has a password-protected e-mail account will be the determinative factor in deciding whether access to e-mail stored on a hard drive of a family computer is unauthorized. When access is available to both spouses, as in <i>White v. White</i>, access is not considered to be without authorization.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Subsequent to the <i>White</i> decision, there has been NJ legislation enacted that would have considered intercepting e-mails post-transmission without authorization as a criminal offense. See NJSA, Section 2C:20–23 (q). See infra n. 13.</i> Other state jurisdictions have also endorsed this approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazard v. Hazard</i>, 833 SW 2d 911 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991); <i>Trulock v. Freeh</i>, 275 F. 3d 391 (4th Cir. 2001); <i>State v. Appleby</i>, 2002 WL 1613716 (Del. Super. 2002).</i>
Finally, cyber-snooping may entail the invasion of privacy. Relying upon the seminal article authored by Dean Prosser,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">William L. Prosser, “Privacy,” 48 <i>Cal. L. Rev</i>. 383 (1960).</i> the authors of Section 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts recognize intrusion as grounds for invasion of privacy. To establish this tort there must have been an invasion of someone’s physical space. In accordance with the aforementioned section of the Restatement, a claim for an alleged intrusion obtains when the individual exhibited an “objectively reasonable expectation of seclusion or solitude in the place, conversation or data source.” Clearly, marriage does not deprive one of individual autonomy, but at the same time, each spouse does relinquish a certain degree of privacy. In <i>White v. White</i>, the court concludes that given that both spouses, albeit separated, had access to the computer (i.e., without password protection) and used it, there never existed an expectation of privacy. Hence, the wife’s access to her husband’s e-mails is not to be construed as an intrusion upon his privacy.
Based upon the foregoing, given that the <i>Nitva</i> consented to his wife’s access to the computer and given that her access was limited to the e-mails stored on the hard drive, therefore from a legal standpoint, we are at liberty of assessing the import of these e-mails in arriving at our conclusion over whether there are grounds for divorce or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Accessing e-mails from a computer’s hard drive may run afoul of the NJSA Section 2C:20–31, which was passed in 2003. Yet, as we explained, such actions will not violate the Wiretap Act. In other words, whereas <i>White v. White</i>, which was handed down in 2001, drew a distinction between the different types of storage in a computer, no such distinction is found in the above-cited legislation. Given that there is no case law dealing with this question and its impact on divorce matters, we continue to assume that the <i>Tova’at</i> would be exempt from criminal liability.</i>
Now, let us turn to how Halakha addresses these issues. Addressing whether there is exists a “marital home” exception to the <i>halakhot</i> of privacy, R. Shlomo Daichovsky states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 14:321, 331.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are grounds that between a husband and wife one cannot speak about an “invasion of privacy,” since in the <i>ktav tena’im</i> [the agreement which memorializes the conditions of the engagement] that are prepared prior to the marriage it states: “They will refrain from any fraudulent conveyance or hiding anything from each other but they should live together with love and affection …” … This is a personal obligation to refrain from hiding or disclosing matters.</span>
Years later, R. Daichovsky elucidates the parameters of this notion of marital privacy,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1217661, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Almonit</i>, June 29, 2004.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In respectful families, it occurs frequently that either the husband or the wife read letters which are designated for their spouse or listen to telephone conversations which are for the other spouse, without receiving permission. Also, it happens that a spouse inspects the personal items of his spouse … Ought we consider them transgressors of the law? In my opinion, in matters between a couple there is no concept of individual privacy, their common zone of privacy is one unit … in the sphere of emotions and asset acquisition. How can one speak of an invasion of a spouse’s privacy, when the essence of marriage is the expansion of personal privacy into common privacy? Even if the couple is quarreling, as long as the marital tie persists or as long as there is no <i>beit din</i> divorce judgment, there continues to exist collective privacy …</span>
Recently, R. Avraham Meisels of Netanya Regional Beit Din reiterates R. Daichovsky’s line of argumentation.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 851788-2, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, May 7, 2012. See an earlier Netanya decision, file no. 3680-21-3, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, May 4, 2008.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Given that the prospective couple at the time of the wedding do not sign off on the <i>tena’im</i> and given that the <i>tena’im</i> is not drafted as a <i>bona fide shtar</i>, a halakhic-legal document, mutually obligating the couple to recognize a “marital exception” to the halakhic guidelines of individual privacy, the inclusion of such a phrase has been described as “<i>shufra d’shtara</i>” (lit. “the grace of an agreement”), a clause added for stylistic purposes, and has no halakhic import.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am ve-Da’at</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, 18; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:110. See this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 187–189.</i> Furthermore, the assumption of marital privacy is that the couple is living “together with love and affection.” However, clearly in cases of domestic instability, a spouse may very well have no reluctance to disclose her spouse’s secrets.</span>
However, seemingly such a notion of a marital exclusion regarding privacy emerges from the <i>halakhot</i> of bailment. When an owner entrusts a <i>shomer</i>, i.e., a bailee, with an item to be guarded in the home of the bailee, it is assumed that the wife and sons, who are financially dependent upon the father,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:20.</i> and other members of the household of the bailee, will be involved in guarding the object.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:20–21.</i> There is a presumption that a family member who resides with the <i>shomer</i> is treated as an extension of the <i>shomer</i> and assumes the same responsibilities as the <i>shomer</i>. Similarly, we should conclude that all members of the household who reside in the same place may open the letter sent to the husband/father. Consequently, it is understandable to find that the rabbinic legislation which was passed in the eleventh century during the time of R. Gershon prohibiting an individual from opening up another’s letter only encompasses non-family members.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 334.</i>
Such a position is seemingly open to challenge due to the difference between the matter of <i>pikadon</i> (i.e., bailment) and opening up another person’s letter without his permission. Whereas, the grounds for proscribing against the opening of a letter entail the commission of an <i>issur</i> (prohibition) such as theft, <i>geneivat da’at</i> (lit. “stealing of the mind”) or borrowing without consent,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Halakhot Ketanot</i> 1:276; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 3:47; <i>Teshuvot Hikekei Lev</i> 1, <i>YD</i> 49.</i> the case of <i>pikadon</i> entails expanding the scope of monetary liability of the <i>shomer</i> to apply to members of his household. But it seems that drawing an analogy between two such different <i>halakhot</i> as <i>pikadon</i> and opening up a friend’s letter is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 130b.</i> Though in certain places the Talmud states, “We don’t derive rulings in monetary matters from matters of <i>issur</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 19b.</i> nevertheless, in other cases the Talmud does draw such analogies.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 6b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 47b. See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17, 53–57.</i> Consequently, there is a basis for the conclusion that Halakha recognizes spousal immunity in cases of privacy intrusions in the marital home akin to the extension of bailment responsibilities to all members of the family household.
Nonetheless, R. Asher ben Yehiel (known by the acronym “Rosh”), argues that one cannot assume that a husband desires to have his secrets disclosed to his wife by invoking the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>pikadon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Orhot Hayyim</i>, Klein ed., NY 5745, p. 47.</i> Stated differently, there is a zone of privacy even in the context of a husband and wife according to Rosh.
Subscribing to Rosh’s approach to marital privacy, are there grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to accept as evidence the e-mails that were opened up by the wife? If the conduct is prohibited, on what basis can a <i>beit din</i> accept evidence that was obtained improperly? In fact, R. Shlomo Goren prohibited any disclosure of contents of a letter without having the permission of the sender and receiver of the letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo Goren, “<i>Seder Nashim”</i> (Hebrew), 25 <i>Tehumin</i> 369 (5765).</i>
Notwithstanding this view, our position embodies the view well articulated many years ago by the renowned Israeli Supreme Court Justice Professor Silberg:<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe Silberg, Talmudic Law and the Modern State, New York: Burning Bush, 1973, 82.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We see clearly that Jewish law does not establish a causal connection between the commission of an offense and the voiding of a civil contract … The violation of the law or morality is one thing, and the legal validity of the contract is another – to the extent that the fulfilling of the contract itself does not activate the offense … Precisely because Jewish law does not distinguish between law and morality, and that practically every performance of an obligation is at the same time a fulfillment of a religio-moral commandment – as in “the commandment” of repaying a debt of monetary obligation – the non-fulfillment of a contract entered into through a violation of law will only turn out to be an additional offense to supplement the original one committed by the transgressor.</span>
In other words, the universe of Halakha encompasses varying matters; some of them are identified as “<i>issur</i>” and other as “<i>mamon.</i>” As R. Avraham Sherman aptly observes, there are numerous occasions in which committing an <i>issur</i> does not have halakhic consequences for a related monetary issue. For example, even though the execution of a sale is prohibited on Shabbat, should it transpire, the sale is valid, and therefore both the seller and buyer have to abide by the consequences of the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 14, 293–294.</i> Similarly, though the <i>Tova’at</i> may have engaged in an <i>issur</i> by opening her husband’s e-mail, nevertheless the electronic communication is admissible in <i>beit din</i> in order to ascertain whether in fact there are grounds for the couple becoming divorced.
Addressing the nature of marriage, R. Malkiel Tenenbaum notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:144.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The matter of engagement and marriage between a husband and wife are no different than other <i>kinyanim</i>.</span>
Alongside the matters of personal status – namely <i>ishut</i>, which prohibits each spouse from living with a third party – the essence of marriage deals with the civil obligations between spouses, such as spousal support and medical care. Lest one conclude that R. Daichovsky’s advocacy of the notion of marital privacy inexorably leads to the inability of a <i>beit din</i> to “pierce the veil” of a couple’s privacy in order to cull information for the determination of various personal status and halakhic-legal consequences of divorce, he concludes,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Text accompanying n. 13. See also, <i>Hikekei Lev</i>, supra n. 21.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A <i>beit din</i> has been chosen to inquire into the problems of the marriage and draw its conclusions. The status of a <i>beit din</i> is akin to a doctor, and it is incumbent upon each party to present the problems relating to the marital life, even if in the process he exposes the inappropriate conduct of his spouse.</span>
Notwithstanding the Rosh’s view about marital privacy, in our scenario, as we will demonstrate, no infringement of the husband’s privacy transpired due to the wife’s decision to read his e-mails. To arrive at this conclusion, we need to examine the prohibition of opening up somebody else’s letter. Our assumption is that R. Gershon’s legislation would have not been limited to the opening letters of others but would have also included our scenario, opening e-mail messages. Both entail a disclosure of information and therefore would be equally prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Tzvi Spitz, “Eavesdropping” (Hebrew), 3 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> 338, 339 (5758).</i> As R. Sherman states,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 14, at 292.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Clearly, there is no principled difference between communication of matters between two people via a letter or transfer of information via a technological device … and all the reasons offered by the authorities to prohibit viewing a letter sent by one person to a friend apply …</span>
The language of the legislation regarding opening another individual’s letter is the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kol Bo</i>, 116; <i>Torat Hayyim</i>, supra n. 21.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One should refrain from reading a letter sent by a man to his friend without his knowledge and without his permission.</span>
Seemingly, both the knowledge and permission of the sender are required for a third party to read the letter. In another text of the legislation, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenburg</i>, Prague ed., 1222; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 102.</i> “And if he disposed of it, one is permitted [to read it].”
That being said, let’s examine how Halakha treats the requirement of obtaining permission prior to reading somebody else’s letter. Regarding a letter that has been thrown out, R. Moshe ben Haviv concludes that a third party may read it in accordance with the provision of the legislation.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Kol Gadol</i> 1:102. However, if a sealed letter were thrown away, there would be grounds to argue that one may not open it. See <i>Teshuvot Halakhot Ketanot</i> 1:59.</i> Even though the legislation requires knowledge that the author consents to its reading, the fact that it has been disposed of by the recipient of the letter is sufficient to allow a third party to read it.
Applying these guidelines to our case: Electronic communication read and/or downloaded from a family computer that is not password protected are analogous a letter that was discarded by an individual who was unconcerned whether his message would be read or not. Hence, a wife’s foray into her husband’s computer that is not password protected is not to be construed as an invasion of her husband’s privacy. In addition, the fact that the husband was unaware that his wife read his personal e-mail would still not demonstrate an infringement of privacy. Once the computer is not password protected, there is an implicit assumption that the husband has waived his right to know whether in fact his e-mail communications have been opened.
Alternatively, the avoidance of the commission of <i>issurim</i> trumps privacy concerns. As R. Daichovsky writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 15.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The obligation of <i>beit din</i> is to prevent a man from being in a marriage of <i>issur</i> … and where we are dealing with a biblical prohibition, there is no deference of respect accorded to human dignity and we are not concerned about his privacy.</span>
Without delving into the difference between human dignity and privacy,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, the two terms are not interchangeable. An instance may entail a violation of human dignity and not privacy infringement. Conversely, another situation may involve an infringement of privacy, but human dignity is not at stake.</i> neither halakhic notion will override a negative commandment of the Torah. Applying this conclusion to our scenario of the alleged adultery, there are two <i>issurim</i> which impact upon the halakhic integrity of the marriage. Firstly, as we know, it is incumbent upon the husband to engage in <i>onah</i>, i.e., conjugal relations. As the Torah teaches us, “<i>she’era kesuta ve-onatah lo yigra</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot</i> 21:10. Whether the <i>mitzva</i> is derived from the word “<i>she’era</i>” or “<i>ve-onata</i>” is subject to debate. See <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Yishmael</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i> 3, ed. Horowiz-Rabin, 258–259.</i> – “her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights, he shall not diminish.” The abstention from engaging in this <i>mitzva</i> generates a transgression of a negative precept.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat lo ta’aseh</i> 59, Chavel ed.; <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 69.</i> Should there be a fear that a husband will travel away from the marital home against his wife’s will and thereby result in an inability for the wife to live with him, a <i>beit din</i> will issue a restraining order against his right to travel.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 76:5.</i> Given that the husband finds satisfaction from his illicit relationship, he may choose to abstain from fulfilling his <i>onah</i> obligations with his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:16; File no. 2109-13-1, Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 18, 1999. The citation of these sources is simply to corroborate that <i>Poskim</i> were aware of the consequences of a husband engaging in an illicit relationship.</i> Should the husband be deemed a <i>moreid</i> (lit. “rebellious”) due to his failure to comply with the dictates of the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>onah</i>, he is obligated to divorce her.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Derisha</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 77:2; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 77:2; <i>PDR</i> 7:75, 78.</i> Secondly, the actual commission of adultery entails the transgressing of an <i>issur</i>.
On the other hand, though there is no halakhic duty upon the wife to have conjugal relations with her husband, a wife is bound to her husband (<i>meshu’abedet</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The utilization of <i>shi’abud</i>, i.e., servitude, is not to be construed as ownership. See J. David Bleich, “<i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i>: Annulment as a Solution to the <i>Agunah</i> Problem,” 33 <i>Tradition</i> 90, 116 (1998).</i> as an incident of the establishment of the marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 6b; <i>Nedarim</i> 15b; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:20; <i>Teshuvot Tzit Eliezer</i> 1:42 (4).</i> provided that he remains faithful to his wife. In our scenario, in light of her husband’s conduct she is repulsed by having to live with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 77 (end).</i> engendering mental anguish and stress<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">S<i>ee Ha’amek Davar Bereshit</i> 34:2, <i>Devarim</i> 22:24; <i>PDR</i> 8:124, 141.</i> leading to abstaining from engaging in conjugal relations. Her obligation ceases to exist in such a situation and she may separate from him, leave the marital home, and/or request a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 77:3; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:1.</i> As one contemporary <i>Posek</i> notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Mordechai Gross, “The Obligation of <i>Onah</i> when the Wife is Suspicious of her Husband” (Hebrew), 5 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> 90–91 (5758).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">On this condition she didn’t bind herself in marriage, since the duty of <i>onah</i> mandates a meeting of the minds between them.</span>
In addition, the husband’s adultery has certain detrimental financial results to the marriage. As Aguda rules (cited authoritatively by
Rema),<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Aguda</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 65b, <i>siman</i> 77; <i>SA</i>, <i>Rema</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:1.</i> one of the grounds for divorce from an adulterer is based upon the fact that such conduct has a financial impact upon the marriage. The illicit relationship creates financial havoc as well as a breach of love and trust in the marriage. “An adulterer wastes money,”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Aguda</i>, supra n. 49.</i> as assets that could have been expended for maintaining the domestic household are being earmarked for illicit conduct.
In short, the husband and woman who engage in an adulterous relationship destroy the family unit both halakhically, by the married couple’s mutual refusal to live with each other, as well as by unconsciously diverting funds that were destined for the husband’s family. Focusing upon the rationale for outlawing adultery, a <i>beit din</i> observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:5, 13.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is not because of the sin that was committed … but rather because of the destruction of marital life resulting from the husband’s behavior.</span>
Applying these guidelines to our case, which deals with electronic communications read and/or downloaded from a family computer that is not password protected, clearly the exposure of an act of adultery that entails the potential breakup of family living serves as grounds for infringing upon the husband’s privacy. Even the potential loss of money trumps protecting the privacy of electronic communications. As R. Yosef Kolon points out, the mitzva of <i>hashavat aveida</i>, restoring lost property to its owner, trumps Rabbeinu Gershon’s edict against opening up somebody else’s communications.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 110.</i> In other words, recovery of lost assets under any circumstances trumps privacy considerations.
Even if the case had dealt with a password-protected computer, similar conclusions would have been drawn. The halakhic legislation enacted during the life of R. Gershon was to facilitate the continued observance of Halakha rather than allow the committed to falter due to the commission of prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:557.</i> Moreover, should the wife’s reading of her husband’s e-mails be deemed an infringement of his privacy as well as inadmissible as evidence in <i>beit din</i>, this would prevent the <i>beit din</i> from being able to determine the facts on the ground, namely, whether in fact there is a basis for divorce. In concluding his essay, R. Spitz states,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 31, at 328. See also Netanya Beit Din, supra n. 16.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are instances where reading personal communications … is for the purpose of sustaining the Torah and establishing religion in place. In these situations and the like, we are allowed to look … at confidential materials, and the edict of <i>R. Gershon</i> is inapplicable.</span>
Finally, as pointed out by Aguda, and subsequently by Rema and others, the primary reason for a wife’s right to divorce her husband is grounded in the potential medical danger to herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 48. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1; <i>Teshuvot Ma’aset Moshe</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 17; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 115; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 3:30; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 39:5; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 39:9; <i>Teshuvot Nish’al Dovid</i>, <i>EH</i> 46; <i>PDR</i> 5:280; Tel Aviv Beit Din, infra n. 101.</i> There is the clear possibility that due to the husband’s illicit affairs, he has been exposed to the contraction of AIDS and other STDs and is therefore a potential danger to his spouse’s health and life. Lest one argue that the husband’s use of a condom eliminates the potential of contracting any of these STDs, condoms, like all contraceptives, are not 100% foolproof. Frequently, condom failure is due to human factors, such as the failure to use a condom consistently or incorrect use of the prophylactic. Sometimes, condoms stored in excessive heat for an extended period of time may also fail. Though the use of a condom is highly effective in preventing AIDS, and a study has shown that even among individuals with repeated sexual contact, 98–100% of those who used latex condoms correctly and consistently did not become infected,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">“How Effective are Latex Condoms in Preventing HIV?” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/faq/faq23.htm.</i> nevertheless, their use does not eliminate the risk entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Prevention message in response to Pl 106–554, CDC, July 5, 2001.</i>
Based upon the foregoing, given that many times condom failure is due to human factors, the question is whether Halakha would sanction a wife’s exposure to the distinct possibility that she may contract AIDS. In addition, we should consider the mental stress the wife may experience as the result of the potential risk. The question is whether such concerns of being infected by STDs by one’s spouse and mental stress generated by such endangerment serve as grounds for dissolving a marriage.
Dealing with a case of a husband diagnosed with AIDS and whether the wife must continue to remain in the home, a Tel Aviv <i>beit din</i> rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 2109131,Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 18, 2009.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In our times, regretfully the AIDS disease has spread and we cannot comfort the wife that she should continue to live with her husband and rely upon him that he will be vigilant in complying with proper protocol …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We know many men who have died from this disease even though they followed proper protocol and due to the fact that once they engaged in sex with no protection, they were infected by this disease …</span>
Though this case deals with a husband who already is a victim of AIDS, the halakhic recognition of the human factor in condom failure, which increases the risk of infection to a wife, would equally apply to our scenario in which the husband has yet to contract HIV.
Even though the aforesaid study found that the contraction of AIDS is a minimal risk by those who use a condom, the possibility of condom failure still looms and therefore such a situation would be labeled a “<i>safek sakana</i>,” lit. “a doubt of danger,” and therefore under such circumstances, a wife’s right to divorce exists.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’vyah</i>, <i>Teshuvot of Rabbi Rothenburg</i>, Cremona ed., 165; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, supra n. 41; <i>Teshuvot Be’er Mayyim Hayyim</i> 7; Eliav Shochetman, “The Disease of AIDS as Grounds for Divorce” (Hebrew) 25, <i>Mishpatim</i> 19, 34–35 (5755).<br>It should be no different if spousal assault occurs and there is a danger to the victim’s life; there would be grounds for delivery of a <i>get</i>.

Moreover, should the husband have actually contracted HIV or any other STD and the wife agrees to continue living with him, there is no Halakha that states that should the wife suddenly experience emotional stress regarding the potential danger, that she cannot change her mind and demand a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 53.</i>
In short, should a wife suspect that her husband is a womanizer, the concerns of potential or possible infection, as well the engendering of stress due to her spouse’s engagement in extramarital affairs, serves to justify invading her husband’s personal communications, even those found on a password protected computer.
In sum, reading e-mail communications of one’s spouse from a computer with password protection and discovering that one’s husband is an adulterer is not construed as an invasion of privacy. The potential medical endangerment to the wife’s life, coupled with the likelihood of family breakdown, both in terms of the absence of conjugal relations and possibly undermining the fiscal stability of the home, justify opening up a husband’s personal communications. Such grounds trump the legislation during the time of R. Gershom that one cannot open up a person’s letters without his permission. Moreover, as we have shown, given that we are dealing with a home computer without password protection, even in the absence of the aforesaid extenuating circumstances, a wife would be allowed to access her husband’s e-mails without his express permission.
<b>2. The <i>Nitva</i>’s Admission of Adultery</b>
Given the admissibility of an e-mail communication as evidence, seemingly we can corroborate the wife’s allegation that her husband is an adulterer, and therefore, there would arguably be grounds for having him deliver a <i>get</i> to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 1; <i>PDR</i> 1:139, 141; 8:124,126, 216, 225; 14:300, 311. For another case regarding adultery, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17, 212–213.</i> In effect, the e-mails should be construed as the husband’s admission that he in fact committed the adultery.
This conclusion can be justified based upon the principle of “<i>hoda’at ba’al din kemay’ah edim dami</i>” (lit. “the admission [of liability] by a litigant is akin to one hundred witnesses”). However, one might protest that this rule applies only to monetary matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 1:10; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 3b.</i> but in <i>dinei nefashot</i>, criminal matters, we invoke the doctrine “one cannot render oneself a wicked person”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 9b.</i> as per the well-known ruling of Rambam,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 18:6.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is a scriptural decree that the court shall not put a man to death … on his own admission … For it is possible that he was confused in mind when he made the confession …</span>
We nevertheless contend that the rule of <i>hoda’at ba’al din</i> is applicable here. Self-incriminating statements are inadmissible regarding criminal matters; however an admission of liability regarding an adulterous relationship, which can destroy a family, is a dispute between two individuals in which admission is acceptable evidence.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 34:36 in the name of <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 21, 2:3; <i>PDR</i> 1:5, 13; 14:300, 311. Cf. <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>EH</i> 154, <i>ha-gaha</i> 45 in the name of <i>Mishpat Zedek</i>; <i>Teshuvot Mahane Hayyim</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 45.<br>In fact, a wife’s testimony of her husband being an adulterer is admissible. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:1.<br>Recently, a <i>beit din</i> awarded monetary damages based upon a husband’s admission that he was physically abusive towards his wife. See File no. 25449-2, Ashdod Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, November 9, 2013.</i>
In lieu of two witnesses testifying that the act of adultery transpired, an adulterer’s admission will suffice. Seemingly, such an admission occurred. In a recent case of the Be’er Sheva Regional Beit Din, the panel concluded that a husband’s placement of an ad on the internet looking for a wife, accompanied by his personal information along with his picture, would be admissible as evidence to prove that he was a womanizer.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 040135832211, Be’er Sheva Regional Beit Din, February 26, 2007, cited in <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i>, <i>gilyon</i> 15, 3.</i> However, with all due respect, we disagree that such evidence may serve as an admission regarding his actions. There is no demonstrable proof that the husband placed these materials on the internet. In fact, the same lack of proof is equally applicable to our scenario. The “admission” was extrapolated from a series of e-mails, rather than having been heard from the adulterer himself. Addressing e-mails found on a cell phone a recent Netanya <i>beit din</i> decision states,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, supra n. 16.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We cannot rely upon what is written there since the writing is electronic writing, and clearly we cannot identify who wrote these words.

See <i>Teshuvot Emek She’ela</i> 17 and <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>EH</i> 34.</i> in the case of an e-mail, absent the presence of witnesses at the time of writing, there is no possibility for ascertaining whether the husband wrote the e-mail, in particular given that the computer was not password protected.</span>
<b>3. The Evidentiary Standards to Corroborate the <i>Nitva</i>’s Adultery</b>
In the absence of a husband’s admission, R. Alexander Zuslin concludes<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Aguda</i>, supra n. 49.</i> that we require “<i>eidim</i>, witnesses, who observed him with the woman in the manner of adulterers.”
The question is whether R. Zuslin’s ruling mandates that the actual fornication be observed. Based upon Hagahot Maimoniyot, which has been authoritatively cited by R. Feinstein,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hagahot Maimoniyot</i>, <i>Teshuvot ha-Shayahot le-Sefer Nashim</i> 1; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh Yevamot</i> 2:8; <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 178:16; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>YD</i> 1:47, <i>EH</i> 1:22, 24, 82.</i> we find the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is in particular with regard to the conjugal act that we construe that witnesses to a couple’s seclusion are considered witnesses that the couple engaged in sex. The reason is because we say, “Can fire touch straw and not ignite it?” Furthermore, he is not ashamed in her presence. Moreover, we cannot observe “the paint stick in the tube” as that would be abhorrent.</span>
In effect, Hagahot Maimoniyot is suggesting two different justifications why witnesses are not required to observe the act itself. Firstly, there is an <i>umdana</i>, i.e., a logical inference based upon the facts that when individuals are isolated and secluded from the outside world, they are unable to control their drives, and the sex act will transpire. Secondly, even though there does not exist absolute certainty that the act occurred, nevertheless due to the difficulty of such an observation and the fact that it is an embarrassment, Halakha suffices with mere contact of body parts rather than mandating observation of the act itself.
However, in the absence of a husband’s admission or the actual observation of the act by <i>eidim</i>, normative Halakha, as codified by Rema, states,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:1.</i> “If witnesses saw him with adulterers, some say that he can be coerced to give a <i>get.</i>”
In other words, whereas R. Zuslin requires actual testimony of the event and Hagahot Maimoniyot maintains that contact between bodies is required to label him an adulterer, some argue we can coerce him to give a <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">For the type of coercion and whether in actuality Rema concurs with this opinion is subject to debate and beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> provided only that he was seen amongst other adulterers. This approach has been subscribed to by various Israeli <i>battei din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1212720, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, March, 7, 2001 cited by <i>ha-Din ve-Ha-Dayan</i>, <i>gilyon</i> 6; File No. 8501062, File no. 059835603211, Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, May 5, 2002 cited by <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i>, <i>gilyon</i> 2.</i> This conclusion is not limited to situations in which the husband is in physical proximity to other adulterers. Even if he converses with women on the internet on websites that are pornographic, that will serve as grounds for labeling him an adulterer.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1215162, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, Tammuz 13, 5766.</i>
Furthermore, a Netanya <i>beit din</i> relied upon “<i>kala de-lo pasik</i>” (a persistent rumor), which in the eyes of the panel creates virtual certainty (<i>umdena mukhahat</i>) that the conduct has happened.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 067596809211, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, April 26, 2004.</i> The <i>beit din</i> is distinguishing between a firmly established rumor and <i>a</i> “<i>rinnun be-alma</i>” (a mere rumor), which does not serve as evidence that the alleged incident took place. R. Eliyahu ben Hayyim (known by the acronym: Ranah) suggests that there are two conditions that have to be obtained in order for the rumor to be labeled a “<i>kala de-lo pasik</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 2:41. See also <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Hayyim</i> 2:52; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>OH</i> 25; <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 53:7.</i> First, the rumor must have been heard by many individuals and not have subsided. Second, one must ascertain the source of the rumor. If one finds that the initiator of the rumor is an enemy of the alleged abuser, the rumor will be discounted. Based upon the foregoing, in our case, we are dealing with a persistent rumor and we therefore have grounds to direct the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.
In short, in the absence of a husband’s admission or the presence of a two <i>eidim</i> who observed the act, other forms of evidence, such as contact between the two bodies who allegedly are engaging in an illicit affair, the association of the husband with a circle of adulterers, and persistent rumors, all serve as evidentiary standards to determine whether the husband is in actuality an adulterer. As R. Moshe Sofer aptly notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:94.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It seems that the Torah did not require [two <i>eidim</i>] except when the <i>beit din</i> did not know without the two witnesses. But a matter that is clear to them without having to trust witnesses is as if they observed it on their own. And just like if the <i>beit din</i> witnessed the event themselves, the Halakha would be handed down without <i>edut</i> … Similarly, if at every stage the <i>beit din</i> knows clearly the matter without the trustworthiness of a witness, they are empowered to judge without testimony, and it is not subsumed under the category of “upon two witnesses.”</span>
Given that the parties signed off on an arbitration agreement, this panel is empowered to resolve whether there are grounds for a divorce judgment based upon <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i>, 3:142; <i>Teshuvot Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 3:32:3.</i>
Finally, in accordance with Rema and other <i>Poskim</i>, given that the adulterer has continued in his illicit affair, engages in conjugal relations with his wife on a sporadic basis, exposes his wife to the possibility of contracting STDs, and is contributing by his behavior to the breakdown of his family, we would seek rabbinical counsel, and had this case transpired in Eretz Yisrael we would have discussed the possibility of coercing the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 65; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, supra n. 41; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:67; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6, <i>EH</i> 106; <i>PDR</i> 12:26. Given that coercive measures are only possible in Eretz Yisrael, such a possibility would not materialize in the Diaspora.</i> However, even though the <i>Nitva</i> was not forewarned regarding the impropriety and consequences of his conduct,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17, 205–206.</i> we will now <i>obligate</i> him to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 133; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 45; <i>PDR</i> 8:257.

<b>4. The <i>Mitzva</i> of <i>Onah</i> and Spousal Rape</b>
In <i>Bereshit</i>, we encounter a description of the first marriage between a man and a woman,
<span class="poetry indentAll">And therefore man shall leave his father and mother, cling to his wife and they will become one flesh.</span>
A literal interpretation of this verse has led English and American jurists from the eighteenth century through the early twentieth century to subscribe to Blackstone’s legal depiction of marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">William Blackstone, <i>Commentaries on the Law of England</i>, Oxford, 1768, 1:422,430–431</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law, that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband; under whose wing, protection, and cover she performs everything … Upon this principle of a union of person in husband and wife, depend almost all the legal rights, duties, and disabilities, that either of them acquire by the marriage.</span>
More recently, the idea was well captured by law professor Lawrence Friedman,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Lawrence Friedman, <i>A History of American Law</i>, NY 1974, 184. See this writer’s, “A Comparative Analysis of a Wife’s Capacity to Pledge her Husband’s Credit for Domestic Necessaries in Anglo-American Law and Jewish Law,” (hereafter: Domestic Necessaries) 13, <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 213,215–220 (2000).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Essentially, husband and wife were one flesh; but the man was the owner of the flesh.</span>
Accepting such a position has led Lord Matthew Hale to conclude that a husband cannot be guilty of spousal rape because,
<span class="poetry indentAll">By their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">M. Hale, “The History of the Pleas of the Crown,” 629, S. Emlyn ed., 1778.</i></span>
As recently as the year 2000, the majority of American states continue to invoke this marital exemption rule, which is rooted in the outdated notion that a wife is the property of her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Jill Hasday, “Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape,” 88 <i>California L. Rev.</i> 1375 (2000).</i> and preempts prosecuting a husband for marital rape.
Seemingly, the halakhic recognition of “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>” (lit. “his wife is like himself”) embodies the same notion propounded by common law jurists. But in fact, a cursory glance of its use in the Talmud leads us to a different conclusion. Due to “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>,” a husband lying near his wife may recite <i>keriat shema</i> and would not be distracted from the prayer, a wife of a priest cannot submit testimony regarding a blemish of a first-born animal, and a portion of damages awarded to a wife are payable to her husband. On the other hand, a wife may not lay her hands on an animal sacrifice as an agent on behalf of her husband even though “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 24a; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 76b; <i>Bekhorot</i> 35b; <i>Menahot</i> 93b.</i> In all these instances, the concept of “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>” is invoked to demonstrate the psychological unity of the marriage rather than as an impingement of the wife’s legal rights, such as executing contracts or acquiring property.
In addressing the notion of marital privacy, R. Daichovsky elaborates on this psychological dimension as defining the marital ties:<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 15</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In respectful families it occurs frequently that either the husband or the wife read letters that are designated for their spouse or listen to telephone conversations that are for the other spouse, without receiving permission. Also, it happens that a spouse inspects the personal items of his spouse … Ought we consider them transgressors of the law? In my opinion, in matters between a couple, there is no concept of individual privacy, their common zone of privacy is one unit … in the sphere of emotions and asset acquisition. How can one speak of an invasion of a spouse’s privacy, when the essence of marriage is the expansion of personal privacy into common privacy? Even if the couple is quarreling, as long as the marital tie persists or as long as there is no <i>beit din</i> divorce judgment, there continues to exist collective privacy.</span>
Halakha does not deny legal capacity to a wife, as it does to a minor or mentally deficient individual. In fact, “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>” has been invoked to demonstrate that a wife has legal capacity. For example, generally speaking, should an employer fail to pay his employee in a timely fashion, he violates a prohibition. If an employee is hired by a man’s wife, and does not receive his salary on time, the husband has violated the prohibition based on the rule of “<i>ishto ke-gufo.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 339:7.</i> Likewise, although a father cannot redeem his first-born son (<i>pidyon ha-ben</i>) via an agent, nevertheless a husband may appoint his wife to perform this <i>mitzva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 305:10. On the other hand, Halakha invokes “<i>ishto ke-gufo</i>” to serve as basis for a husband’s obligation to redeem his wife from captivity<i>.</i> See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 78:2.</i> Finally, regarding transactions executed by a wife relating to her husband’s properties, Ravan states,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Ravan</i> 115; <i>Domestic Necessaries</i>, supra 83, 221–235.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">All wives now are guardians of their husband’s properties and a guardian is an agent … therefore, her transactions are by virtue of her agency …</span>
According to numerous <i>Poskim</i> who adopt Ravan’s position,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:29; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 96:9; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 96:17; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 96:11; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 2:18; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 19; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 96:8; <i>PDR</i> 2:289, 292.</i> there is a <i>hazaka</i> (presumption) that creates a wife’s implied agency, provided that the wife is engaging in a business-like undertaking.
This notion of a wife’s capacity and autonomy fully expresses itself in the context of conjugal relations, which is the matter of contention in this case. The essence of matrimony is the establishment of a personal tie, i.e., <i>ishut</i>, whereby each spouse is permitted to live with one another and simultaneously prohibited to live with a third party. <i>Onah</i>, as we mentioned earlier in our <i>psak din</i>, entails the engagement in conjugal relations, and its scope and parameters define the halakhic expression of <i>ishut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Ittur</i>, <i>Ot Mered</i> 68a; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 38:12 in the name of <i>Drisha</i>.</i> Though there is no halakhic duty upon the wife to have conjugal relations with her husband, a wife is bound to him (<i>meshu’abedet</i>) as an incident of the establishment of the marriage.
Being <i>meshu’abedet</i> to her husband does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that a wife loses her autonomy and emotional integrity regarding the governance of her intimate relations. Generally speaking, there are <i>halakhot</i> governing the relationship between parties. Nevertheless, in accordance with normative Halakha, the rules relating to monetary matters may be subject to change by mutual agreement of the parties. Consequently, with regard to <i>halakhot</i> that deal with spousal support and maintenance, if the couple decides to modify the rules, such an agreement would be valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b.</i> However, according to many <i>Poskim</i>, regarding <i>onah</i>, which entails a non-financial matter, one is prohibited to modify its requirements.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">See authorities cited by <i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 6:10.</i> The inability to modify conditions in a non-financial matter stems either from the halakhic denial of an individual’s right to modify the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>onah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 6:8–10.</i> or from a lack of <i>gemirat da’at</i> (firm resolve) on the part of the individual in stipulating a condition in variance with Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 94a, s.v. “<i>ve-amar</i>.”</i> One of the rationales offered for this conclusion is that releasing a husband from his duty will only lead to emotional distress for the wife, who will be unable to engage in conjugal relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 56a; Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:2.</i>
However, in accordance with the Talmud Yerushalmi, there are other <i>Poskim</i> who argue that if the wife explicitly waives her right to conjugal relations, such a waiver would be valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>BB</i> 7:7; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 56a, s.v. “<i>harei zu</i>”; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 213 in the name of <i>Ritva</i>.</i> Once she requests a return to a life of intimacy, he becomes obligated again in the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>onah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, supra n. 94; <i>Lehem Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 15:1.</i> Moreover, even those authorities who prohibit a husband from contracting out of <i>onah</i>, nevertheless will permit him to abstain temporarily from <i>onah</i> when his wife permits him, such as while he is traveling and away from their home for an extended period of time.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 62b; <i>SA</i>, <i>Rema</i>, <i>EH</i> 76:5.</i> Here again, she may withdraw her permission at any time.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 6:10; <i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, supra n. 94; File no. 3426-21-3, Tel Aviv Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, January 28, 2008.</i> On an ongoing basis, though a couple may engage in unnatural form of intercourse, a husband cannot force himself upon his wife against her wishes. As <i>Poskim</i> rule, a husband cannot compel conjugal relations, much less insist upon engaging in unnatural intercourse with his spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 25 in the name of <i>Ra’avad</i>; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 25:2.</i> These <i>halakhot</i> are a reflection of the overarching need that intercourse must be consummated in joyful circumstances rather than in situations of wrath and tensions.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 15:17; <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 240:3.</i>
One of the unforeseeable and unintended consequences of spousal rape is that the wife may be physically injured by the husband’s conduct. The fact that <i>onah</i> is a <i>mitzva</i> does not create an exemption for injury.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Bava Kama</i> 6:13; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 418:12; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 207.</i> Hence, Hazon Ish contends that engagement in the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>onah</i> does not serve as a defense.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 11:21.</i> Even if the husband unintentionally injured his wife due to losing his self-control, i.e., <i>ones</i>, a situation that can occur through engaging in conjugal relations in general and spousal rape in particular, we nevertheless have the rule “<i>adam mu’ad le-olam</i>,” a person is always deemed forewarned.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 378:1.</i> Based on this reasoning, numerous <i>Poskim</i> argue that it is the husband’s responsibility to foresee the possibility of potential injury, and therefore if injury transpired, he is responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 11:21.</i>
The foregoing presentation demonstrates that the husband’s <i>onah</i> obligation under certain prescribed conditions can be circumscribed, and the wife’s <i>shi’abud</i> to conjugal relations does not translate into coerced cohabitation. In fact, as we have shown, a concern for the wife’s physical and emotional integrity expresses itself in the <i>halakhot</i> governing <i>onah</i>.
That said, if a wife wants to refrain from <i>onah</i> then she must demonstrate the reason(s) for her refusal to cohabit. Should her claim(s) be corroborated, the <i>beit din</i> will issue a judgment that the husband ought to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.

<b>Final Thoughts: The Awarding of <i>Nezikin</i> Claims against the Abuser</b>
Given her husband’s ravishment and coercive tactics and the <i>beit din</i>’s ruling to obligate the giving of a <i>get</i> and the husband’s continued refusal to give one, had <i>Tova’at</i> argued for a monetary award for <i>tza’ar</i> (psychological pain) and for <i>boshet</i> (embarassment) due to <i>Nitva</i>’s improper conduct during conjugal relations, would there be grounds for such monetary relief?
<b>A. The Authority of <i>Beit din</i> to Award a <i>Nezikin</i> Claim</b>
Generally speaking, there is a requirement of having a <i>beit din</i> composed of <i>mumhim</i> (i.e., <i>dayanim</i> who have received classical ordination handed down from Moshe Rabbeinu) who are empowered to award <i>kenasot</i> (i.e., penalties) including but not limited to <i>nezikin</i> (damages such as recovery for bodily harm and medical care). However, in contemporary times in the absence of <i>mumhim</i>, the power of <i>beit din</i> stems in part from the parties’ willingness to accept the <i>beit din</i>’s authority, and therefore the awarding of <i>kenasot</i> is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shita Mekubezet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 89b, s.v. “<i>ve-gedolei ha-mehabrim</i>”; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 3:1; <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:1;</i> In effect, by the acceptance of the <i>beit din</i>’s authority via the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (i.e., a symbolic act of undertaking the duty to abide by the <i>psak</i> of the <i>beit din</i>), the parties agree to obligate themselves to remit such monies should an award be rendered. This obligation is effective even though the parties do not explicitly state in the <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement) that the <i>dayanim</i> may issue a decision regarding a <i>nezikin</i> claim that may entail a <i>kenas</i>. Secondly, since the parties empower the <i>beit din</i> to resolve their matters in accordance with <i>peshara</i>, the panel may resolve matters dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kenasot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:2; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda</i>, <i>HM</i> 1 which is cited authoritatively by <i>Pit’hei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:3; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:32; Yoezer Ariel, <i>Dinei Borerut</i> 187.</i>
Alternatively, in accordance with a <i>takanah</i> (legislation) enacted by the <i>Geonim</i> and “the <i>minhag</i> of <i>battei din</i>” (the practice of rabbinical courts), a panel is empowered to employ their discretion in determining the amount of the monetary award and inform the batterer that this amount will appease the victim. This amount will be final even if the figure arrived at by the panel is unacceptable to the victim. As elucidated by the <i>Poskim</i>, the grounds for this award are to deter others in the community from emulating the batterer’s conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Geonim</i>, B. Lewin ed., <i>Ketuvot</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i> 477; <i>Teshuvot ha-Geonim</i>, <i>Sha’arei Tzedek</i>, vol. 4, <i>sha’ar</i> 1, 19 in the name of R. Sherira Gaon; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:2–3; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:11; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:5, 420:38, <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i>, A.

In short, though the <i>shtar borerut</i> in our case does not state that <i>nezikin</i> matters will be resolved by this panel, nevertheless this panel is empowered to address these issues for one or more of the following reasons: (1) by accepting the panel’s authority via the signing of the <i>shtar</i> accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>, a panel may address these matters; (2) since the <i>beit din</i> is authorized to implement a <i>peshara</i>, they have such empowerment to resolve these issues; and (3) in accordance with rabbinic legislation and <i>“</i>the <i>minhag</i> of <i>battei din”</i> such matters may be addressed.
<b>B. Evidentiary Standard for Determining Spousal Rape</b>
To award damages, the victim of the alleged abuse must demonstrate that the actual event(s) transpired. In the absence of a criminal conviction by a civil court,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the veracity of a court’s findings, see ch. 3, n. 66.</i> the admission of guilt by the perpetrator<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, regarding <i>dinei nefashot</i>, criminal matters, the rule is “no man may render himself a <i>rasha</i>, a wicked person.” See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 9b. However, concerning claims dealing with monetary matters, we invoke the rule that “a man’s own admission of guilt has the power of one hundred witnesses.” See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 3b; <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 21, 2:3; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur HM</i> 34:36; <i>PDR</i> 1:5, 12–13; 15:119, 122.<br>For acceptance of a husband’s admissibility of his improper conduct as grounds for divorce, see <i>Sefer ha-Aguda</i> in the name of <i>Maharam</i> 77; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:1.</i> or two adult Jewish male witnesses attesting to the occurrence<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 19:15; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 408; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 408:1.</i> is adequate proof for <i>beit din</i> to render an award. In the absence of a husband’s admission or two male witnesses corroborating the event, in situations of assault where males were absent, the testimony of the victim of abuse, who generally speaking is ineligible to submit testimony, would be admissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 353; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:14; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>HM</i> 58, cited by <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 35:9.</i> To state it differently, though a woman’s testimony is not viewed as <i>edut</i> (testimony) that a <i>dayan</i> is obliged to accept and follow, a <i>dayan</i> may nevertheless recognize that her words possess veracity and rely upon her words, i.e., <i>ne’emanut.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>HM</i> 36:11; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 36:10; R.

The acceptability of a woman’s testimony is not limited to events that she observed as an outsider that transpired with other individuals, but extends equally to events in which she was a participant.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 129; <i>Osaf Piskei Din shel ha-Rabbanut ha-Rashit le-Eretz Yisrael</i>, vol. 2, 11, 13–14 (5745). Cf. A. Sherman, “Accepting Invalid Witnesses for a Divorce Claim, Monetary Matters, and Battery” (Hebrew), 5 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> 101 (5758).</i> Therefore, in the absence of any other claims leveled against her husband, if a wife claims that her husband is impotent, according to the majority of <i>Poskim</i> we may believe her, and we do not need to identify any other reason for the tensions and marital breakdown.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 57; <i>Get Pashut</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>kelal</i> 2; <i>PDR</i> 1:81, 85, 12:96, 102.</i> In our scenario, seemingly we must question whether we can trust the veracity of the wife’s contention that her husband assaulted and raped her. However, since he admitted to his actions, we have no need to cast any doubt upon the veracity of her account.
Once said evidence has been submitted to the <i>beit din</i>, it is incumbent upon the <i>dayanim</i> to examine the information, in the same fashion that any other testimony is analyzed. For example, regarding instances of battery of a spouse for which it is unclear who provoked the behavior, the husband is not believed over his wife that his wife is the provocateur of the conduct, because women have a <i>hezkat kashrut</i> (presumption of credibility).<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:3.</i> Here again, in our case, the husband’s admission absolves <i>beit din</i> from the need for further inquiry.
<b>C. A <i>Nezikin</i> Award for <i>Boshet</i> and <i>Tza’ar</i></b>
<i>Tova’at</i> is experiencing feelings of embarrassment regarding the incidents, as well as knowing that members of her community are aware of this occurrence. In a case in which an individual intended to embarrass another person,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 1:10–12</i> Halakha awards compensation for <i>boshet</i> (shame).

For example, slapping someone in the face will incur a higher award than yelling at someone.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6.</i>
In our scenario, the spousal rape did not generate any bodily injury, but there is nevertheless a concept of <i>boshet devarim</i>, lit. “shame in words,” which would encompass any feelings of embarrassment associated with this conduct. This may simply be emotional anguish unrelated to a third party’s awareness of the occurrence,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b, s.v. “<i>bezman</i>”; <i>Nedarim</i> 27b, s.v. “<i>asmakhta</i>”; <i>Kiddushin</i> 8b, s.v. “<i>maneh</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, 4:69; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:7.</i> or shame which comes from the cognizance of others regarding what transpired. In the Mishnah and Talmud, such an incident of shame does not have a fixed compensation rate.

Additionally, as we explained, although there is a <i>mitzva</i> of <i>onah</i> and a wife has a duty to be intimate with her husband, nevertheless forcible sexual relations are prohibited. Given that coerced cohabitation entails physical contact, one can advance a claim for <i>tza’ar</i>, physiological pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1; <i>Bava Kama</i> 85a; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hoveil u-Mazik</i> 2:9; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:1; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 420:16.</i> Additionally, spousal rape, similar to any rape, is a traumatic experience engendering feeling of emotional stress that prevents the victim from engaging in sexual relations in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">S<i>ee Ha’amek Davar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> 34:2, <i>Devarim</i> 22:24.</i>
Although the formal <i>halakhot</i> of <i>nezikin</i> do not recognize psychological pain,<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Nezikin</i>, ch. 11, n. 32.</i> by dint of the parties’ voluntarily accepting the authority of the <i>beit din</i>, and given that the matter will be resolved in accordance with <i>peshara</i> and that it is the <i>minhag</i> of <i>battei din</i> to mete out damages to appease the victim, therefore there would have been grounds to award the <i>Tova’at</i> damages for physiological and psychological pain and <i>boshet devarim</i>.
<b>D. <i>Tova’at</i> Waiver of Her <i>Nezikin</i> Award in Exchange for Receiving Her <i>Get</i></b>
In the event that a <i>beit din</i> obligated a husband to give a <i>get</i> and the husband’s continued refusal to give one, should the <i>beit din</i> have awarded her <i>nezikin</i> claim, had the <i>Nitva</i> argued he would be willing to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife in exchange for his wife waiving her right to this monetary award, would such an exchange result in a <i>get me’useh</i>, a coerced <i>get</i>? Generally, a <i>get</i> must be given voluntarily by the husband, and the wife must accept it voluntarily, without any coercion. In our scenario, should the husband be coerced into delivering the <i>get</i>, the subsequent execution of the <i>get</i> creates a “<i>get me’useh</i>,” a situation that means that the <i>get</i> procedure is invalid and the couple remains married. The threshold question is the following: Does a husband’s willingness to deliver a <i>get</i> in exchange for waiving a monetary debt mandated by the <i>beit din</i> constitute financial coercion which would create a <i>get me’useh</i>?
According to numerous authorities, should monetary fines be leveled against a recalcitrant husband, any subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> will be unlawful.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:40; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 50a; <i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, Mishnah, <i>Gittin</i> 8:1; <i>Bava Batra</i> 40b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 134:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot R. Bezalel Ashkenazi</i> 15; <i>Teshuvot Bigdei Kehuna</i> 56; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Emet</i>, <i>kuntres</i> 11, 4; <i>PDR</i> 15:145, 16:260.</i>
Consequently, the advancement of a monetary claim to compensate for damages due to a husband’s recalcitrance in delivering a <i>get</i> is without halakhic foundation. If such an award is forthcoming, and the husband decides to give the <i>get</i> in exchange for being released from paying this debt, the subsequent execution of the <i>get</i> will create a <i>get me’useh</i>.
Despite the foregoing, there are authorities who do not consider monetary compulsion as <i>ones</i>, duress.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Meisharim</i> 1, <i>netiv</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Ohr Zarua</i> 1:754; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Divre Ribot</i> 291; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 2:77; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 35; <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 7, 22; <i>Yad Aharon</i> 134; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch) 62:3.</i> However, there are <i>Poskim</i> who distinguish between different types of monetary and non-monetary types of coercion. Certain forms of duress will taint the subsequent execution of a <i>get</i> while others will be free from any compulsion. There is a type of damage claim that can be advanced by a divorcing wife in a <i>beit din</i> and it is labeled “<i>kefiya ke-din</i>” (legitimate coercion) and therefore avoids the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>. Numerous authorities have argued that certain kinds of pressure are not sufficiently coercive to result in an invalid divorce, provided that the coercive element emerges from circumstances unrelated to the divorce. For example, describing the following scenario, Rivash of fourteenth-century Spain and North Africa rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 232 (translation excerpted from Yehiel Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment Principles of Jewish Law,” 15 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 57, 102 (2004).) See also <i>Rivash</i>, supra n. 143.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The case … involved a person cast into debtor’s prison for nonpayment of a debt. His wife’s relatives offered to satisfy the debt on his behalf and thereby obtain his release from prison on the condition that he divorce his wife.</span>
Rivash finds no objection to execution of a <i>get</i> under such circumstances “for he was not seized in order to [compel] him to divorce [his wife] but on account of his debt; the <i>get</i> is not coerced but [the product] of free will.”
Since the husband was imprisoned for defaulting on a debt rather than as a means to coerce to give a <i>get</i>, his release in exchange for executing a <i>get</i> is not to be viewed as duress, and therefore the strictures of <i>get me’useh</i> are inapplicable. Numerous authorities such as Tashbetz, Ranah, Rema, R. Feinstein, and while serving on the Israel Rabbinical Court Rabbis Elyashiv, Daichovsky, and Shilo Rafael, endorsed the notion that coercion relating to another matter (<i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>) is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 144; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:63; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 154:21; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:137; <i>PDR</i> 11:300, 302–307, 16:271, 272–279, 275–276. For extensive treatment, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17, at 142–152.</i>
In short, these authorities concur with the view expressed hundreds of years ago by R. Moshe of Trani,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha</i>-<i>Mabit</i> 1:22 (translation from Kaplan, supra n. 145, 104–105). See further <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17, 147, n. 147.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A <i>get</i> is only considered unlawfully enforced when [the husband] is coerced with regard to the divorce. But if he is coerced with regard to a different matter, and in order to free himself from that coercion he divorces his wife, [the <i>get</i>] is not regarded as unlawfully enforced.</span>
In our scenario, we may invoke the concept of <i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>, i.e., advancing a <i>nezikin</i> claim unrelated to divorce,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">This notion of “<i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>” is to be distinguished from “<i>kefiya derech bereira</i>,” which means coercing a husband to comply with his marital duties, such as spousal support, and exempting him from his obligation by delivering a <i>get</i> to his wife. See <i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 48 and ch. 3, addendum.</i> since the <i>kefiya</i> relates to spousal rape, an act unrelated to the divorce. A <i>beit din</i> is empowered to hand down a monetary award regarding emotional stress caused due to such conduct. As such, our case represents another example of <i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>, no different than that of Rivash’s debt repayment, and it is therefore permissible and avoids the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>.
Finally, even if we were not dealing with an instance of <i>kefiya le-davar aher</i>, in various Israeli <i>piskei din</i> and <i>teshuvot</i> “obligating a divorce,” R. Elyashiv and others permit a husband whose wife does wish to accept a <i>get</i> to appease his recalcitrant wife by offering money in exchange for her accepting a <i>get</i>; the ensuing divorce is not deemed to be unlawfully coerced.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 7:11, 8:36, 9:65; File no. 2337, Supreme Beit Din, December 27, 2004; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 10. See further <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:68; <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 17,150–152.</i> Similarly, if the wife absconded with her recalcitrant husband’s assets and will release them only upon receiving her <i>get</i>, such a financial inducement is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 4:35; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 134:4; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-She’arim</i> 6.</i> Hence, in our scenario, a wife’s waiver of her monetary award in exchange for her <i>get</i> would have been permissible.

b) "A Dead Marriage" and its Halakhic Aftermath

<b>B. “A Dead Marriage” and its Halakhic Aftermath</b>
<b>Facts</b>
In Hassidic circles, <i>shiddukhin</i> is a system of matchmaking in which Torah-observant singles are introduced to one another for the purpose of marriage. Whereas in other Orthodox communities, singles may meet in different ways, in Hassidic circles, a <i>shiddukh</i> usually begins with a recommendation from a family member or friend.
Whereas in other circles, dating usually takes place in a public setting such as a restaurant, an airport, or a social/educational event, in Hassidic communities, once a match has been proposed, the prospective partners proceed to a “<i>bashow</i>,” meaning a sit-in. In a conventional <i>bashow</i>, the young man is accompanied by his parents to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple is compatible. Both sets of parents converse with each other, and eventually they walk into another room, leaving the man and woman to speak privately. Some may use the opportunity to ask relevant questions, while others want to gain a sense of whether they like each other, relying on the information that they received from the <i>shadkhan</i>. As the couple sees more of each other and the couple is satisfied that the proposed marriage will be successful, their decision is communicated to the <i>shadkhan</i>, and the engagement is announced, followed by marriage.
We are dealing here with a young couple that met each other in three <i>bashows</i>, and subsequently got engaged and married. In this particular circumstance, there was no <i>shadkhan</i>, but upon the initiative of the two families of the couple, the ensuing courting, engagement, and eventual marriage took place. After being married for four years, the couple had a baby girl. Two years later, they decided to get divorced. During their marriage, the couple had been residing in northern New Jersey in a non-Hassidic community where the <i>Tove’a</i> was employed as a financial analyst and the <i>Nitva’at</i> was a social worker, while simultaneously managing the household and engaging in child rearing, cooking, and washing.
For two years the couple had not been engaging in conjugal relations, and a year ago the husband moved out of the marital home.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
<i>Tove’a</i> argues that the <i>Nitva’at</i> was the first to request a <i>get</i> and subsequently, he agreed that he did not want to remain with her. However, he refuses to deliver a <i>get</i> to her. He admitted that he was not interested in having children.
Given that the <i>Nitva’at</i> asked for the <i>get</i>, she is not entitled to receive the value of her <i>ketuba</i>. Additionally, given that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s father-in-law gave the rent money as a gift to the couple, the <i>Tove’a</i> is exempt from repaying this money to his father-in-law. Finally, the <i>Nitva’at</i> has withdrawn all the funds from their joint account, funds that have not been expended for the domestic household, and therefore the <i>Tove’a</i> is demanding recovery of half the funds.
<i>Tove’a</i> is willing to pay child support, but he argues that the calculation of payment should be based upon the customary practice in the Hassidic community rather than civil law. Moreover, though <i>Tove’a</i> agrees that the <i>Nitva’at</i> should be the custodial parent, <i>Tove’a</i> contends that the panel should decline her request for child relocation because the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s “need” to move is really the product of her own lifestyle choice, and that consequently, he should not be the parent who is “punished” with the loss of proximity and weekday contact. Moreover, her desire to relocate is prompted by the wish to distance herself from her ex-husband, and she seeks to escape the perceived humiliation of remaining in “the father’s community.” In reply to <i>Nitva’at</i>’s contention that she requires emotional support from her parents and therefore the move is required, <i>Tove’a</i> argues his wife’s two sisters and some friends live in New Jersey and/or in close proximity to her, who would be able to provide assistance and emotional support.
Should the <i>beit din</i> determine that the <i>Tove’a</i> is obligated to give a <i>get</i> to the <i>Nitva’at</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> wants the financial claims to be resolved prior to giving her the <i>get</i>.
<b><i>Nitva’at</i>’s Claims</b>
From the onset of the marriage, <i>Nitva’at</i> never felt emotionally attached to the <i>Tove’a</i>. Though the couple met each other at <i>bashows</i>, in actuality there was never any emotional and physical attraction between them. It was a marriage orchestrated by their respective families. In fact, the <i>Nitva’at</i> contends that the <i>Tove’a</i> never wanted to have children and the child that they had was a concession to the <i>Nitva’at</i>. On numerous occasions, <i>Tove’a</i> refused to have relations with the <i>Nitva’at</i>. In the final analysis, <i>Tove’a</i> was upset that they were married, and therefore he ought to give her a <i>get</i> and pay her the value of her <i>ketuba</i>. In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s willingness to pay $250 a month for support for one child, allegedly the practice in Hassidic communities, <i>Nitva’at</i> is requesting that child support payments be calculated based upon NJ child support standards.
<i>Nitva’at</i> is petitioning this panel to allow her to relocate from New Jersey to Chicago, Illinois where her parents live. The move is necessary to accommodate a new job being offered to her in social work in Chicago, as well to provide her with parental assistance and support in raising her daughter. Such a move would be in the child’s best interests.
Moreover, <i>Nitva’at</i> claims that the $80,000 that she withdrew from their joint account represents her salary for the last six years working as a secretary, and argues based on “<i>kim li</i>,” i.e., that she adopts the opinion of the decisor who would support her claim that the salary belongs to her. Alternatively, she argues that since a year prior to the divorce proceedings <i>Tove’a</i> withdrew $200,000 from their joint account and <i>Tove’a</i> can only demonstrate that $50,000 was used in order to pay domestic expenses, and therefore, she is entitled to $75,000, which represents fifty percent of the remaining funds, as a joint account holder. Moreover, though formally speaking <i>Nitva’at</i> admits that she was the first to request the <i>get</i>, it is clear that the above withdrawal indicates that for a year prior to their decision to appear in front of this panel, the <i>Tove’a</i> was already contemplating divorce. In fact, at that time, <i>Tove’a</i> consulted with a rabbi regarding end-of-marriage matters.
Finally, <i>Nitva’at</i> is requesting $100,000, which represents the money lent to the couple by the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s father in order to pay for the first five years of rent. In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention that the aforesaid monies were remitted as a gift, <i>Nitva’at</i> argues that her father never said that these funds were a gift, and therefore should be viewed as a loan that must be repaid.
Should <i>beit din</i> determine that she has a right to receive a <i>get</i>, <i>Nitva’at</i> demands that it should be executed prior to the <i>beit din</i>’s resolution of the outstanding financial claims.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. Husband’s Obligation to Deliver a <i>Get</i></b>
Generally, the right of a wife to demand a divorce is based upon the following grounds: (1) physical defects of her spouse, such as impotence or a contagious disease such as AIDS; and (2) conduct of her husband, such as his unwillingness to support her or live with her. Halakha recognizes similar grounds for a husband to demand that his wife accept the <i>get</i> from him.
However, Rabbeinu Yeruham introduces a different ground for divorce. He rules the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Meisharim</i>, <i>helek</i> 8, <i>netiv</i> 23.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And my teacher Avraham ben Ashmael writes that it seems to him that a wife who says she does not find her husband pleasing and that he should give her a <i>get</i> and <i>ketuba</i>, and the husband says and that he likewise does not find her pleasing, but does not want to give a <i>get</i>, it is logical that we do not consider her a rebellious wife to lose her <i>ketuba</i> and <i>nedunya</i> (dowry). Rather, we wait twelve months regarding the <i>get</i>, because possibly she will reconcile. After the year, we force him to divorce her and she loses her <i>tosefet</i> (<i>tosefet ketuba</i>) and everything she received from him, because we assume that he didn’t let her take (his property) and then leave (the marriage).</span>
According to one understanding, R. Yeruham is extending the case of <i>ma’is alai</i> to a new situation. In the conventional situation of <i>ma’is alai</i>, if a husband refuses to engage in conjugal relations with his wife, the wife can say “I find him repulsive” (“<i>ma’is alai</i>”), and in accordance with some <i>Poskim</i> we coerce him to deliver a <i>get</i>. R. Yeruham argues that even if she states “<i>ma’is alai</i> and I don’t want to live with him,” after a year we coerce him to deliver a <i>get</i> lest she become an <i>agunah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 19:57, 62.</i> Another perspective on R. Yeruham’s position is offered by the Netivot ha-<i>Mishpat</i> who contends that according to R. Yeruham (as well as his teacher, Rashba), given that each spouse is a “<i>moreid</i>” (lit. “rebellious” – unwilling to engage in conjugal relations), the wife loses only her <i>tosefet ketuba</i>, and after a year we coerce the husband to deliver a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> on <i>Sefer Meisharim</i> 218b.</i>
According to an alternative interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Our reconstruction of R. Yeruham’s position is drawn from Nahum Prover, “The obligation of a <i>get</i>, return of gifts, a justified claim: regarding a couple who are not interested in each other,” (Hebrew), <i>Kenas ha-Dayanim</i>, ed. Sheinfeld and Ya’akobi, Yerushalayim: 5768, 109, 110–116<i>;Ateret Devora</i> 2:89.</i> we are dealing with a case in which there are no mutual obligations between the spouses, since one cannot speak of a sense of duty devolving upon one side if the other side equally refuses to undertake an obligation. For this reason, the issue of failing to engage in conjugal relations is a non-issue. The matter of <i>merida</i> (rebelliousness) emerges within the context of ongoing and functional marriage when one party is derelict in his or her duty in living with his spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 183; <i>Teshuvot Ohr ha-Gadol</i> 4.</i> In this case, refraining from conjugal relations is due to mutual incompatability and/or hatred. One cannot view the husband as a <i>moreid</i> when the wife has no interest in her marriage and therefore refrains from living with her husband. And similarly, one cannot view the wife as a <i>moredet</i> when the husband has no interest in living with her. The meaning of a “<i>moredet</i>” is a wife who is rebellious toward her husband who desires to live with her. And in fact, there is a procedure dating back to Geonic times that mandates synagogue announcements as a means to indirectly compel a wife to return to her spouse. In short, if the husband doesn’t want to remain married, but nevertheless wants his wife to be an <i>agunah</i>, R. Yeruham rules that we compel him to give her a <i>get</i>.
On the other hand, if the wife has no interest in remaining married and the husband wants to remain married (and there are no grounds for obligating a <i>get</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Mateh Yosef</i>, in order to apply <i>R.</i> Yeruham’s <i>psak</i> the husband must have acted improperly to his wife. See <i>Teshuvot Mateh Yosef</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 5.</i> the wife cannot claim she is an <i>agunah</i>. On the contrary, the wife is creating her “<i>igun</i>” situation, and therefore we do not obligate the husband to deliver a <i>get</i>.
In our situation, adopting the alternative understanding of of R. Yeruham, since each spouse does not want to remain married and have been separated for a year, we are dealing with a situation of <i>igun</i>. Even if the wife would have been interested in remaining married, attempts at promoting <i>shalom bayit</i> (lit. “domestic tranquility”), matrimonial reconciliation, would be impossible since the husband no longer wants the marriage to work and succeed.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">However, if the husband sincerely wants <i>shalom bayit</i> and only is willing to give a <i>get</i> because this is his wife’s wish, the ruling of R. Yeruham would be inapplicable. See <i>PDR</i> 13:268, 271; <i>Ateret Devora</i>, supra n. 4.</i> In our case, given that the <i>Tove’a</i> wants to neither engage in conjugal relations nor have children, the <i>Nitva’at</i> has no desire to remain married. In accordance with R. Yeruham’s position, one would therefore compel the husband to divorce her. This case is no different than an instance of a wife who commits adultery – the halakhic result is that she cannot live with her spouse. In such a situation, despite her improper behavior, which undermined the marriage, we do not sanction recalcitrance regarding the delivery of a <i>get</i>. On the contrary, we coerce the husband to give a <i>get</i>, as in R. Yeruham’s case.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 13: 64, 267–271.</i>
R. Yeruham’s <i>psak</i> also implies that the issuance of such a divorce judgment will occur regardless of which spouse desired to leave the marriage. Had the <i>psak</i> been contingent on the fact that the husband wanted to leave the marriage first, R. Yeruham would have said so. <i>Argumentum ex silentio</i> supports our conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 14:183, 193.</i> Consequently, in R. Yeruham’s situation, the wife was the first one who wanted to get divorced, while the husband wanted to stay married. Yet, the husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations and have children derives from his personal determination that the marriage is “dead” rather than his wife’s demand to receive her <i>get</i>, and therefore there are grounds for coercing a husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 8, at 271.<br>In other words, “a dead marriage” <i>per se</i> will not serve as grounds for obligating the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife. Additionally, there has to be grounds for the divorce, such as what transpired in our case, i.e., the husband refusing to engage in conjugal relations and to sire children. See <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:144–145; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Shmuel</i> 3:145; <i>Teshuvot ha-Gaon Avraham Herzog</i>, <i>EH</i> 154; R. Y. Herzog, <i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> 7:133–134; <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i> 3, <i>EH</i> 19; <i>PDR</i> 1:162, 4:112, 7:108–109, 112–113, 9:211, 10:173, 11:362, 364; 12:206, 13:360; File no. 698719/15, Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, July 26, 2015.<br>In 2005, there was a debate between R. I’zirer and R. Daichovsky regarding this matter. See File no. 4827-21-2, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 3, 2005 (R. Izirer’s opinion). Dissenting from R. Izirer’s view and the above view, R. Daichovsky argues in said decision that “a dead marriage” <i>per se</i> where there is no possibility for <i>shalom bayit</i> (domestic tranquility) and there has been marital separation for at least a year and a half there is a <i>“mitzva”</i> for the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> under such circumstances. For the basis for this approach, see <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:112; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 4, <i>YD</i> 15 (2); A.Z. Sheinfeld, “Prenuptial Agreement” (Hebrew), 24 <i>Tehumin</i>, 148, 154, n. 15 (R. Daichovsky’s opinion) (5762). R. Lavi argues that R. Yeruham would concur that the absence of <i>shalom bayit</i> may serve as a grounds for obligating a <i>get</i>. Whereas, for R. Yeruham, one would wait a year prior to coercing a <i>get</i>, according to R. Daichovsky and others, one must wait eighteen months before obligating a <i>get</i>.

See <i>Hayyim ve-Shalom</i>, op. cit.; File no. 810538/2, op. cit. (R. A. Sherman’s opinion). See A. Sherman, “Extended separation as grounds for obligating a <i>get</i>” (Hebrew), <i>Kenas ha-Dayanim</i> 5767, 102, 108–110 where he emphasizes that a couple’s monetary rights remain intact, such as a wife’s right to the value of the <i>ketuba</i> or support. To state it differently, R. Sherman contends that a spouse’s decision to leave the marital home serves to undercut <i>shalom bayit</i>. Nonetheless, it is the potential of engaging in sin in a situation of marital separation that propels R. Sherman to mandate the rendering of a divorce judgment. See File no. 810538-2, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, April 28, 2011.<br>In R. Lavi’s understanding, R. Palache’s position is that separation does not serve as grounds for a divorce, but rather marital separation may lead to inappropriate conduct. See File no. 3599221, Tiberias Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, November 11, 2004. As such, he agrees with R. Daichovsky that the absence of <i>shalom bayit</i> may serve as grounds for a divorce.<br>Given that in our case, the <i>beit din</i> was not fearful of improper behavior occuring during the marital separation, we did not decide to invoke <i>shalom bayit</i> as grounds for divorce, and we followed the majority opinion that contends that one needs to ascertain that that there must be grounds to issue a divorce judgment in a situation of “a dead marriage”.</i> And even if the wife suddenly has a change of heart and wants to remain married, the husband has no interest in <i>shalom bayit</i>. Consequently, to prevent an <i>igun</i> situation, after a year R. Yeruham would coerce the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Coercion of the <i>get</i> would equally apply if the wife would refuse to accept the <i>get</i>.

See <i>PDR</i> 13:267, 273; File no. 764231/6, supra n. 10.</i>
In the wake of “a dead marriage,” each side having no interest in the continuance of the marital ties, R. Yeruham’s position is to avoid <i>igun</i>, and therefore, <i>dayanim</i> in the United States would <i>obligate</i> the husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">For a contemporary understanding of Rabbeinu Yeruham’s position that the existence of <i>igun</i> serves as grounds to obligate the granting of a <i>get</i>, see File no. 470386-20, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, June 26, 2014.<br>Unlike the situation in Eretz Yisrael, in the Diaspora we are bereft of legal and institutional mechanisms that would facilitate coercion, such as physical coercion and imprisonment, and therefore under certain conditions we obligate him to give a <i>get</i>.

Messas, “<i>Safek be-Kefiyat ha-Get</i>” (Hebrew), 23 <i>Tehumin</i> 120 (2004).</i> Whereas in many instances, the grounds for divorce are based upon the conduct and/or physical defects of a spouse, here a <i>get</i> is to be given in order to avoid <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 1.</i>

Addressing this situation in which <i>shalom bayit</i> has not existed for years and there is no real possibility for reconciliation, R. Yeruham concludes that the wife is entitled to the value of her <i>ketuba</i>. A brief review here of the various rules dealing with recovery of <i>ketuba</i> monies will serve to explain the cogency of his ruling. There are three basic rules governing whether such entitlement exists: (1) If the husband demands the divorce and the wife wants to remain married, then she is entitled to the value of the <i>ketuba</i> upon divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 48b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh Makot</i> 1:1; <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 118, and for numerous <i>Aharonim</i> who authoritatively cite <i>Tur</i>’s ruling.</i> (2) If the wife did not demand a divorce and was prepared to remain married despite quarreling, and the ensuing divorce was due to the husband’s request, the monies of <i>ketuba</i> are remitted to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> (3) If the wife demands the divorce without any grounds to obligate the husband in the divorce, she is not entitled to the <i>ketuba</i> even if the <i>get</i> was arranged with the husband’s consent.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., <i>Tur</i> 154:7. However, if it is clear to the <i>beit din</i> that there are grounds for the wife to divorce her husband, then she receives the value of the <i>ketuba</i>. See File no. 854682/1, supra at n. 18; File no. 849079/2, Haifa Regional Beit Din, October 17, 2012; File no. 588903/1, Haifa Regional Beit Din, April 10, 2013.</i> In other words, if the husband demonstrates that there are grounds to divorce her, she is not entitled to her <i>ketuba</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 117:1–2, 4, 11; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 115:16; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 115:17,19; <i>PDR</i> 8:254, 259.</i> Based upon the foregoing, if the couple wants to mutually end their marriage, regardless of who may have requested the divorce initially, given that there is an outstanding obligation undertaken by the husband at the inception of marriage, according to R. Yeruham she is therefore entitled to her <i>ketuba</i>.
<b>2. The Recovery of <i>Tosefet Ketuba</i> according to R. Yeruham</b>
The standard amount of money in the <i>ketuba</i> is 200 <i>zuz</i> for a first marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 66:6.</i> Additionally, in many instances, a husband obligates himself to add to the value of the standard <i>ketuba</i> amount, and this is called <i>tosefet ketuba</i>. In Ashkenazic <i>ketubot</i>, the standard amount is 200 <i>zekukim</i> of pure silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">For the valuation of the <i>ketuba</i>, see M. Broyde and Y. Reiss, “The Value and the Significance of the <i>Ketuba</i>,” 47 <i>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> 101 (Spring 2004).</i> Usually one hundred <i>zuzim</i> are earmarked for the <i>ikar ketuba</i> and another one hundred <i>zuzim</i> are earmarked for <i>tosefet ketuba</i>.
R. Yeruham holds that with regard to delivering a <i>get</i>, the only relevant factor is the problem of <i>igun</i>. Therefore, regardless of whether the wife is at fault, when neither party is interested in continuing the marriage, the husband must give a <i>get</i>. However, concerning whether a wife receives her <i>tosefet ketuba</i> R. Yeruham’s informs us,
<span class="poetry indentAll">Upon the assumption that she would take it and leave him, he would not have given it to her.</span>
To state it differently, regarding <i>tosefet ketuba</i>, we focus on the husband’s intent at the time that he undertook the obligation to pay <i>tosefet ketuba</i> to his prospective spouse, namely, did he intend to pay her <i>tosefet ketuba</i> upon divorce? Whereas, <i>ikar ketuba</i> is a debt which is <i>ex lege</i>, created at the inception of marriage, and paid off at the time of divorce,<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 16:10. Consequently, since it belongs to her, a wife can sell her <i>ketuba</i> to her husband. However, the husband has to give her a new <i>ketuba</i>. See <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 66:5, 105:1. For a list of additional <i>Poskim</i> who argue that the wife is “<i>muhzeket</i>” in her <i>ketuba</i>, see <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:353. Cf. <i>Hiddushei ha-Granat</i> (Trop), <i>Ketuvot</i> 44 who contends that the debt is created at the time of divorce or the husband’s death. See also <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> 3, <i>EH</i> 21.<br>For a contemporary application in Eretz Yisrael of the distinction between <i>ikar ketuba</i> and <i>tosefet ketuba</i>, see File no. 593163-2, Tiberias Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, January 5, 2014.</i> <i>tosefet ketuba</i> is dependent upon the intent of the husband who undertook the obligation prior to <i>nissuin</i> (marriage) during the time of the writing of the <i>ketuba</i>.
One proposed yardstick to gauge whether the wife is entitled to receive said monies is to assess who is responsible for the fact (eventually acknowledged mutually) that the marriage is dead. One approach, taken by R. Eliezer Goldschmidt, a <i>dayan</i> who served on various <i>battei din</i> of Eretz Yisrael’s Chief Rabbinate, contends that if a husband refuses to support his wife or engages in illicit affairs, he is responsible for the downfall of the marriage and therefore, the husband is obligated to remit <i>tosefet ketuba</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:201, 221. For earlier <i>Poskim</i> who invoke this view, see <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 195; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> (Sasson) 64.</i> On the other hand, should divorce ensue because of the wife’s demands and despite the husband’s desire to continue being married, the husband is exempt from paying such monies. The rationale for this exemption is that he voluntarily obligated himself to pay these monies provided that she is willing to be married to him. Since she does not want to remain married, he no longer is obligated to pay her these monies.
However, if he is responsible for the “dead marriage” rather than his spouse, he remains obligated to pay <i>tosefet ketuba</i> (as well as <i>ikar ketuba</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:321, 324; File no. 849079-2, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, October 17, 2012; File no. 380065-5 B, Tel Aviv-Yafo Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, May 13, 2013.</i> For example, if the husband is either incapable of finding a livelihood or is sexually impotent, even though these situations are characterized halakhically as “<i>ones</i>” (duress), he is exempt to remit such monies. On the other hand, if the husband is responsible for the divorce, for example if he fails in finding a job to support his wife, he is obligated in <i>tosefet ketuba</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 26 at 219–221. Cf. <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 65b in the name of <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i>; <i>PDR</i> 8:275, 279–282 (R. Yisraeli’s opinion).</i> Eretz Yisrael’s <i>dayanim</i>, Rabbis Elyashiv, Horowitz, Ben Shimon, Sheinfeld, Sha’anan, Probar, and Ushinski, have endorsed this approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 7:275, 278; 8:321, 323–324; 13:264, 274; 14:183, 194; Provar, supra n. 4, at 115; File no. 854682-1, supra n. 18; File no. 587739-6, supra n. 18.<br>For an excellent explanation of their stance, see File no. 380065-5, supra n. 27, R. Cohen’s opinion.<br>On the other hand, if the wife demands to be divorced because of a matter that is beyond her husband’s control, she is not entitled to <i>tosefet ketuba</i>. See <i>Tosafot</i>, op. cit.; <i>PDR</i> 8:277 (R. Elyashiv’s opinion).</i>
Based upon the foregoing, given that the <i>Tove’a</i> refuses to engage in <i>onah</i> (the mitzva of engaging in conjugal relations periodically) and does not desire children, the marriage has <i>de facto</i> dissolved, a situation created by his personal choice, and therefore, he is obligated to pay <i>tosefet ketuba</i>. In accordance with R. Yeruham, she is “bolting the marriage” because of what her husband voluntarily did or refrained from doing, and therefore she is entitled to <i>tosefet ketuba</i>.
<b>3. A Husband’s Justifiable Claim</b>
Generally, upon a <i>beit din</i>’s determination that a <i>get</i> ought to be executed, the question arises whether the <i>seder ha-get</i> (the arrangement involved in the giving of the <i>get</i> by the husband to the wife) should be performed prior to the convening of a <i>beit din</i> or whether the panel should first resolve the outstanding end-of-marriage issues which are in dispute. This question is matter of controversy<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">R. Menashe Klein and R. Shimon Ya’akobi, “The Giving of a <i>Get</i> and Financial Arrangements: Which Precedes the Other?” (Hebrew), 22 <i>Tehumin</i> 157 (5762); File no. 8811-64-1, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, September 6, 2009.</i> and in the NY metropolitan area, the policy of the majority of <i>battei din</i> is to address the parenting and financial issues relating to the marriage prior to the <i>seder ha-get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Even the few <i>battei din</i> in New York City that have a policy to execute a <i>seder ha-get</i> prior to addressing the other matters will invariably deal with the end-of-marriage issues prior to the <i>seder ha-get</i> in a situation in which the husband insists on resolving the outstanding matters before giving a <i>get</i>, lest he become recalcitrant and refrain from delivering a <i>get</i> to his wife.</i>
In our scenario, the <i>beit din</i> panel had issued a judgment that the husband is obligated to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife. Given that the husband is obligated to give a <i>get</i> in order to avoid an <i>igun</i> situation, the question is: Can the <i>Tove’a</i> insist that the <i>beit din</i> panel address and resolve his financial claims prior to the actual delivery of a <i>get</i>? Seemingly, since his wife is refusing to accept her husband’s stance regarding these claims, she is in effect creating an <i>igun</i> situation, and the obligation to give a <i>get</i> disappears. Consequently, these financial matters may be resolved prior to the issuance of a <i>get</i>. Given that the the wife’s claims are only being advanced due to “the dead marriage,” which in retrospect is the result of the husband’s behavior, therefore it seems that most <i>Poskim</i> conclude that the <i>get</i> ought to be given up front, and any outstanding claims should be resolved in <i>beit din</i> afterwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid Bass, “The Establishment of Conditions by the Husband who is Obligated to Give a <i>Get</i>” (Hebrew), 25 <i>Tehumin</i> 149, 149–151 (5765); <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devora</i>, vol. 2, 646,650–657.</i>
Nevertheless, the minority view of Maharashdam,<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 41.</i> which validates a husband’s right to stipulate that his claims must be resolved prior to giving a <i>get</i>, has found support in some <i>piskei din</i> of Eretz Yisrael’s Chief Rabbinate.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 5:68, 79 (R.

Some authorities have argued that his position embraces a husband’s right to stipulate claims that are unrelated to the <i>get</i>. Others have understood his position more narrowly, as referring to conditions related to the <i>get</i> itself.

In our case, since the husband’s monetary claim regarding the funds from the joint account is “a condition which is easily to comply with,” and there is a risk that failing to accede to his request may lead him to become intransigent regarding the <i>get</i>, the <i>Tove’a</i> does not have to deliver the <i>get</i> prior to this matter being resolved by the panel.
<b>4. Standard for Calculating <i>Mezonot ha-Yalda</i> (Daughter’s Support): In Accordance with the Child’s Social Standing, His Needs, or <i>Minhag ha-Medina</i>?</b>
As we know, a wife’s maintenance is assessed based upon her husband’s financial position and social status, provided that it is not lower than the standard of living she was accustomed to when living with her parents. If the husband’s standard of living is lower, he is obligated to support her according to the higher standard.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 70:3, 73:3.</i> In fact, Pnei Moshe notes that a woman’s standard of living should be maintained in accordance with the standard of living in her father’s home.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pnei Moshe</i>, Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Ketuvot</i> 5:6, s.v. “<i>ha-bat</i>.”</i> However, others argue that if the husband cannot afford his father-in-law’s standard of living, he is not obligated to provide it.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:309.</i>
In accordance with Talmud Bavli,<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 68a.</i> a man must provide for his daughter in accordance with “<i>kevodo</i>,” i.e., his level of dignity. In other words, if the father is wealthy, then the standard will be that of a wealthy individual, and if he is poor, it will be the standard of a poor person. As R. Nahum Gertler, a <i>dayan</i> serving on a Rehovot <i>beit din</i>, aptly noted, the majority of <i>Rishonim</i> subscribed to this approach, a view which resonates amongst contemporary <i>Poskim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 68a, s.v. “<i>ha be-akhila</i>”; <i>Tosafot</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>mai lav</i>”; <i>Tosafot Shantz</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>mai lav</i>”; <i>Tosafot ha-Rosh</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>mai lav</i>”; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 190; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 6:12; <i>Shiltei Gibborim</i> on <i>Rif</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4; <i>Piskei Riaz</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4:4; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 112:15 (compare with <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 73:5); <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 114:7 in the name of <i>Rosh</i>.<br>For contemporary <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to this position, see <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:106 (end); <i>PDR</i> 2:3, 8.</i>
Nonetheless, implicitly relying upon a passage in Talmud Yerushalmi,<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 5:6.

See <i>Teshuvot Hina ve-Hisda</i> 3, 45:1; <i>Teshuvot Lev Mavin</i>, <i>EH</i> 138 (end); <i>Teshuvot Lev Hayyim</i>, <i>EH</i> 71:1; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, op. cit.; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>EH</i> 1:106, <i>YD</i> 1:143. Yet, it has been suggested by others that this approach is synonymous with the view that a daughter’s needs ought to be satisfied. See <i>Teshuvot Havot Binyamin</i> 2:42.</i> Elaborating upon the standard, R. Yehoshua Maman observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Emek Yehoshua</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 19:3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One is obliged to support them according to their needs … and their social station and how they were customarily supported prior to the divorce.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Necessities are not measured by what is necessary in another city, but what is sufficient for them accordance to the practice of their city.</span>

There is a third yardstick for calculating a daughter’s support, a standard that was established at the inception of the marriage of the now-divorcing couple. According to certain <i>Poskim</i>, a father’s duty of child support is grounded in his obligation to support his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 65b, s.v. “<i>yotzei</i>”; <i>Ran</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i>, end of <i>perek af al pi</i>; <i>Mishneh le-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 12:14; <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 71; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 91:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Lublin</i> 79; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 52, <i>YD</i> 1:143, 4:43<br>For <i>Poskim</i> who validate a <i>minhag</i> in monetary matters without receiving rabbinical approval (“<i>minhag vatikin</i>”), see this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 234, n. 20.

<b>5. Relocation of Child after Divorce</b>
Upon divorce, should there be any differences regarding with which parent a child ought to live, Halakha argues that custody contests ought to be resolved in accordance with <i>tovat hayeled</i>, namely, the child’s best interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 82:2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Maharam me-Padua</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:62; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:123, 360; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 82:7; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 123; <i>Teshuvot Perakh Mateh Aharon</i> 2:110; <i>Teshuvot Darkhei Noam</i>, <i>EH</i> 26; <i>PDR</i> 1:65, 145; 7:3. See further, this writer’s, “Child Custody: A Comparative Analysis,” 14 <i>Israel Law Review</i> 480 (1979).</i>
Such considerations should equally be factored into whether to approve a custodial parent’s request for relocation. As we know, the divorce of parents undermines the child’s sense of attachment and stability. Optimally, a child would want his divorcing parents to be amicable, communicative with each other and live close enough to each other. When a custodial parent seeks to move to a different geographical location, the best possible post-divorce situation for the child is threatened.
Given that following divorce, as few changes as possible should be made in the life of a child, in arriving at “a best interests” determination, a <i>beit din</i> must consider the following factors: each parent’s reasons for seeking or opposing the move, the quality of the relationships between the child and the parents, the impact of the move on the quality of the child’s future contact with the noncustodial parent, and whether the child’s life may be enhanced economically, emotionally, and educationally by the relocation.
Halakhically, in the wake of a custody battle, a daughter remains with her mother in order to be instructed in the ways of <i>tzniut</i>, modesty, and <i>midot</i>, halakhic-moral propriety.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashba</i>, supra n. 63; <i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 63; <i>Darkhei Noam</i>, supra n. 63; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 1:55.</i> Given that this is a <i>hazakah</i>, a presumption that may be rebutted if the facts dictate that child placement with the mother may undermine the child’s best interests,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:263; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 10; <i>PDR</i> 1:173, 176.</i> how does Halakha address the case of a mother who wants to relocate to another geographical region, which will prevent the father from regularly spending time with his daughter?
In reply to this question, R. Yosef ben Lev contends that the daughter may move to another country in order to be with her mother. Firstly, when the Talmud states, “The daughter is forever with the mother,”<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 102b.</i> it means barring certain exceptions,<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">And moving away from her father is not one of these exceptions.</i> a daughter always remains with her mother. For example, an older daughter’s welfare does not mean that she must be with a mother who is licentious or a prostitute.<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharival</i>, supra n. 64.</i>
Strongly disagreeing with this position, R. Shmuel de Medina contends that should the move expose a daughter to interactions with people of immoral character, then such relocation is impermissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 63.</i> In other words, relocation must serve the child’s best interests. Since the child’s welfare should be a priority in any relocation decision, the larger family unit cannot be neglected. The goal is to <i>preserve</i> what is sound and successful. Hence, if during the marriage, there existed a healthy relationship between the noncustodial parent and the child, absent any extenuating circumstances, the ties should continue upon divorce of the parents.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 82; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 82:7; <i>PDR</i> 1:114, 118, 158, 176.</i> Consequently, optimally the postdivorce family is “binuclear,” where a child is living in two households. As R. Shmuel de Medina exclaims,
<span class="poetry indentAll">Is it possible that a man has only one son … who lives with him and his being is emotionally tied to his son and when he sees that the young man no longer is here, he dies and his father is anguished … one cannot fathom this …</span>
In other words, relocation must be justified based on the child’s best interests, which entails assessing whether the child’s detachment from his noncustodial parent may psychologically impact upon him and leave long-term effects upon his personality development.
Following in the footsteps of Rabbis S. de Medina and D. ben Zimra, numerous <i>Poskim</i> will evaluate child relocation through the lens of the child’s best interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shufrei de-Ya’akov</i>, <i>EH</i> 60; <i>Teshuvot Lev Mavin</i>, <i>EH</i> 139; <i>PDR</i> 1:158; File no. 7529-23-2, <i>Ploni v.

Plonit</i>, September 6, 2011; File no. 290277/7, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, May 29, 2013.</i> Such a position flows inexorably from the notion that visitation rights for a noncustodial parent who lives in proximity to the custodial parent is granted based upon a determination that such privileges are in the child’s best interests, regardless whether we are dealing with a son<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Such visitation privileges will allow a father to educate his son in Torah. See <i>Mishneh le-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:17; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 82:7.</i> or a daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 586034/4, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, January 16, 2011; File no. 586034/4, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 25, 2012. Implicit in said conclusion is that the father has certain educational responsibilities vis-à-vis his daughter. See <i>Tosafot Shanz</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 82a; <i>Tosafot Yeshanim</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 82a; <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 343:1, 615:2, 640:3; <i>Shemirat Shabbat ke-Hilkhata</i> (1st ed.), <i>perek</i> 32.</i>
Based upon the parties’ argument, this panel finds that relocation would undermine the halakhic recognition of the binuclear family. <i>Nitva’at</i>’s contention that a job opportunity and parental support would lend credence to her petition for the move lacks foundation. Unlike other professions, there are numerous employment opportunities in the area of social work in northern New Jersey. Moreover, the <i>Nitva’at</i> has the emotional support of her siblings who reside in close proximity. The impact on the quantity and quality of the child’s future contact with the noncustodial parent must be provided for, even at the expense of the redeeming value of the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s parental emotional support her in the post-divorce situation. Consequently, we decline the <i>Nitva’at</i>’s request to relocate to another state that is far away from the daughter’s father.
<b>6. A Father-in-Law’s Claim to Recover Support Monies Provided to his Children: Are the Monies a Loan or a Gift?</b>
For the first three years of their marriage, <i>Nitva’at</i>’s father-in-law paid the couple’s rent. In effect, although halakhically a husband is obligated to support his wife including providing “a roof over her head,” here the wife’s father was paying his son-in-law’s outstanding obligation. Realizing that the <i>Tove’a</i> was not earning sufficient money to cover the rent, the father-in-law decided to pay the rent. At the time as well as later, there was no mention that said monies were a gift to the couple. Consequently, on behalf of her father,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Since the father did not sign the <i>shtar borerut</i>, a <i>shtar harsha’a</i>, an authorization document, was prepared and signed by the father authorizing his daughter to advance a claim on his behalf. Upon the signing of the document, the <i>shtar borerut</i> (which was signed by both the husband and the wife) was amended to include the father-in-law as a <i>tove’a</i> against his son-in-law.</i> <i>Nitva’at</i> argues that her father is demanding that said monies be returned to him. <i>Nitva’at</i> contends that even if one would view these monies as gifts, such distributions would have not been forthcoming had <i>Nitva’at</i>’s father, the donor, realized that the couple would eventually become divorced. Buttressing her posture, she invokes Mordekhai’s ruling that deals with a testator who earmarked a portion of his estate to <i>tzedaka</i>. Subsequently, the testator’s relatives lost their assets and third parties claimed that the earmarked assets for <i>tzedaka</i> should be given to the testator’s relatives. Given that one can invoke the <i>umdana</i> (inferential fact finding) that had the testator known that his relatives would be in need of funds, he would not have designated said monies for <i>tzedaka</i>, Mordekhai rules that the monies ought to be distributed to his needy relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 493.</i> A similar conclusion was reached by Maharam of Lublin.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Lublin</i> 105.</i>
Countering the <i>Nitva’at</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> unravels the logical weakness of opposing party’s view. If one accepts <i>Nitva’at</i>’s argument, then in any situation in which relations deteriorate between a donor and recipient, the gift should be returned, because had the donor known that relations would sour, he would never have gifted the item to the recipient. Comparing this case to that discussed by R. Yom Tov Zahalon, <i>Tove’a</i> argues that this is impossible:<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharitz ha-Hadashot</i> 117.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a <i>sefer Torah</i> was donated to a synagogue, and subsequently relations soured [between synagogue and the donor], can one allow him to take the Torah and sell it based upon an <i>umdana</i>!</span>
Consequently, <i>Tove’a</i> contends that although the relations have radically changed between the father-in-law and the <i>Tove’a</i>, one cannot therefore utilize an <i>umdana</i> regarding a future development as grounds to recover these assets. To ascertain whether <i>Tove’a</i> must repay the rent, we must look at the time that the gift was given, rather than at what would occur in the future. When the gift was given there were harmonious relations between the couple, and therefore the gifting did not entail any contingencies. Had the father-in-law stipulated that his giving of the gift was predicated upon continuing marital ties between the couple, then there would be grounds for rescinding the gift. However, in our scenario, no such stipulation was ever advanced.
In our opinion, <i>Tove’a</i>’s arguments demonstrate the correct understanding of the contours of an <i>umdana</i>. As Tosefta and Talmud observe, if a man’s son travels abroad and the father hears that his son passed away and therefore gives away his assets to a third party, if his son subsequently appears, the gifting is null and void.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 4:14; <i>Bava Batra</i> 132a.</i> Clearly, the gift was predicated upon a fact that never transpired, i.e., his son’s death. In our situation, however, we cannot revoke the father-in-law’s gift by invoking an <i>umdana</i> because the gift was not based on an error. At the time of the gift, the couple was actually married. The fact that in the future, circumstances would change and the couple would divorce, does not serve as a grounds for invoking an <i>umdana</i>.
The remaining issue is whether the rent money ought to be returned to the father-in-law due to the fact that one cannot enrich oneself at the expense of others.

Assuming both parties concur that it was not specified whether the money was a loan or a gift, seemingly the <i>Tove’a</i> who argues that his intent was to lend the money is <i>bari</i> (certain), whereas the <i>Nitva</i> is in doubt whether in fact it was a loan.

<b>7. <i>Tova’at</i>’s Claim for <i>Ma’aseh Yadeha</i> (Handiwork)</b>
In exchange for being supported by her husband, a wife is obliged to do domestic work that is normally performed by wives enjoying a certain standard of living. In Mishnaic and Talmudic times, wives engaged in domestic chores such as cooking, baking, and washing, and contributed economically to the family by engaging in weaving wool in the marital home. Such work became an obligation upon a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 59b.</i> Subsequently, in certain places during the Middle Ages, wives embarking on other “career choices” chose to embroider and spin linen. These “female occupations” became obligatory upon a wife, and as such, income earned from this work belongs to the husband in exchange for his financial support of his spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 21:1.</i>
As the centuries progressed, almost all vocations became “gender neutral,” women began working outside the home, and consequently, occupations such as working in a factory, teaching, and secretarial work are not activities that a wife must perform.<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:82, 2:223, 3:208, 8:307.</i> In other words, in exchange for spousal support, a wife engages in certain domestic chores and economic activities in her household. However, a wife’s employment in the marketplace is not to be understood as reciprocation for her husband’s support.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Meir</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 80:1; File no. 833474/12, Ashkelon Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, September 2, 2013.</i> As such, if a wife manages a household and exerts additional time effort to earn money in the marketplace, such work may be labeled <i>ha’adafah al yedei ha-dehak</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 7:290, 8:275, 304.</i> If a wife exerts herself more than usual (<i>ha’adafah al yedei ha-dehak</i>), it is a matter of debate whether this “surplus” belongs to her or to her husband. Consequently, a husband who contends that his wife’s earnings should belong to him may very well lose in advancing such a claim in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 80; <i>PDR</i> 1:91, 94, 2:223, 226, 6:32, 8:275, 278, 279.

The invocation of this rule rests on the assumption that when a dispute is submitted to a <i>beit din</i>, the panel has to determine which claimant is entitled to retain certain assets. In Halakha, there is a concept whereby one of the claimants is considered as the one who is in possession of the disputed item (the <i>muhzak</i>), while the other claimant wants to “extract” this asset and transfer it to himself. As R.

(2) Even if one rejects the merits of employing the <i>kim li</i> argument, nevertheless her husband’s agreement to have his assets jointly held with hers in the same account entitles her as a partner to half those assets.

Chapter 7; Decisions in Hoshen Mishpat

a) The Scope of an Investment Broker's Responsibility

<b>A. The Scope of an Investment Broker’s Responsibility</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Menachem Levy vs. People’s Bank, Levi Cohen</i></span>
On June 1, 2011, the above parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve their dispute according to applicable portions of Shulhan Arukh and <i>Poskim</i>. As noted above, Menahem Levy is filing suit against Mr. Cohen personally, as well as against People’s Bank, Inc. Both parties submitted their differences and disputes in reference to Cohen’s services provided to Menahem Levy to this <i>beit din</i>. Having given said matters due consideration and having heard all parties testify as to the facts of said disputes and differences, this panel does decide and agree as follows:
<b>Facts</b>
Menachem Levy (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>), a long-time banking client of People’s Bank in New York, NY, a bank owned and managed by Torah-observant Jews (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>), met with Levi Cohen (hereafter: Cohen), an Orthodox Jewish broker at the bank’s newly created brokerage firm (which inadvertently failed to file incorporation papers at the time) to discuss investing. In his forties at the time, Cohen had previously placed his money in insured certificates of deposit. At the meeting, Cohen prepared a comprehensive financial analysis, which included evaluations of <i>Tove’a</i>’s financial portfolio, his net worth, debt management, retirement finances, estate planning, and insurance coverage.
Prior to investing with the brokerage firm of the bank, <i>Tove’a</i> received certain written materials to read regarding the risks associated with the stock investments and signed off on paperwork to open up his account. Cohen signed off in his capacity as an employee of People’s Bank, Inc. Among the provisions of the customer agreement relating to the discretionary account are the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll">The client agrees that he has read and understood the risks involved in trading on a securities exchange … The broker shall conduct its business, as it relates to the services defined herein, in a commercially reasonable, legal and ethical manner … and that the broker’s affairs with client have been conducted in a professional manner. All investments involve risk, and unless you provide individualized recommendation to me, I or my agent are responsible for determining the suitability of any trade, investment, investment strategy and risk associated with my investments.</span>
With the consent of the <i>Tove’a</i>, Cohen was empowered to determine whether to buy or sell stock funds without any prior instructions from the <i>Tove’a</i>. To state it differently, Cohen was managing a discretionary account on behalf of the <i>Tove’a</i>. Cohen invested half his money in these stocks. The other half, which was to be invested in conservative bonds, was placed in a discretionary account wherein there is a duty to execute an order promptly in accordance with the <i>Tove’a</i>’s instructions and best interests. Prior to the economic meltdown of 2008, Cohen abstained from following the <i>Tove’a</i>’s instructions to purchase a bond. Subsequently, the market plunged and the product subsequently declined in value.
Though Cohen held a professional liability insurance policy, and therefore commercial practice is that parties proceed directly against the insurance company, nevertheless, at the time of the convening of this <i>beit din</i> panel, <i>Tove’a</i> had not and was inclined not to commence a suit in civil court against the insurance company.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
<i>Tove’a</i> claims that a special relationship existed between Cohen and himself, which imposed a duty on the defendant to convey sound financial advice to him. Additionally, it appeared that Cohen held or appeared to hold special expertise relating to investment planning, and therefore <i>Tove’a</i> relied on him that the information provided to him was financially sound.
Cohen induced the <i>Tove’a</i> to buy securities by misrepresenting the level of risk, such as illiquidity, deferred contingent sales charges, and unusual political and economic risks. In reply to Cohen’s argument that written disclosure and signing off on the potential risk of such investments precludes a claim for negligent misrepresentation, <i>Tove’a</i> claims that he had no prior investment experience regarding stocks, the written materials were difficult to comprehend, and he didn’t understand what he was signing. In reply to Cohen’s argument that no special relationship had been established between the parties, <i>Tove’a</i> argues that Cohen’s credentials as an investment planner, his preparation of a comprehensive financial analysis of <i>Tov’ea</i>’s holdings, and his receipt of compensation for his services <i>ipso facto</i> creates a relationship of trust and confidence rather than an expression of “curbside advice.” Like others, Cohen is a licensed broker, who passed examinations and had passed certain education requirements. His conduct is subject to regulation by the government and industry self-regulatory organizations.
Admittedly, Cohen informed himself of his client’s investment objectives and general financial situation, so as to ensure that each security would be suitable to his client’s investment objectives and financial situation. On the basis of his due diligence, he recommended setting up a discretionary account for the purchase and sale of stocks and a non-discretionary account for the purchase and sale of conservative bonds.
Regarding the stock investments, though Cohen was authorized to buy and sell without the <i>Tove’a</i>’s prior authorization, nevertheless, Cohen failed to heed red flags that indicated a potential depreciation of his stock investments and the <i>Tove’a</i>’s stocks decreased in value, resulting in a loss of $300,000.
<i>Tove’a</i> is suing People’s Bank and Cohen personally. Though Cohen is employed by a corporate entity, nevertheless, he is not a shareholder in the bank, and therefore, he allegedly is personally liable for his conduct.
<b>Cohen’s Claims</b>
Given that the <i>Tove’a</i>, as an investor, was provided with written materials disclosing the risks, and signed off on his accounts, which indicated that that the investment involved a degree of risk, <i>Tove’a</i> has no claim for negligent misrepresentation. Moreover, <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention that there was a special relationship between them implies a relationship that extended beyond the typical arm’s length business transaction, but such ties did not exist. Nobody from the bank initiated such contact with <i>Tove’a</i>, no one induced the <i>Tove’a</i> to forego performing his own due diligence, and no individual repeatedly vouched for the veracity of the allegedly deceptive information. The requisite relationship of trust and confidence did not exist, and therefore, Cohen argues that he is exempt from responsibility for any losses from both the stock investments and the potential bond purchase. Finally, given that Cohen served in the capacity of an employee of the bank, any award handed down by the <i>beit din</i> must be paid by the bank, which is incorporated, rather than by him.
Given that <i>Tove’a</i> may proceed against the insurance company, which protects Cohen’s professional activity as a broker, <i>Tove’a</i> has no right to “double dip” should he decide to file a civil suit and recover monetary damages from the insurance company. Consequently, in the event that there would be a <i>beit din</i> award, it should be contingent upon the fact that <i>Tove’a</i> shall refrain from filing suit in court against the insurance company.
<b>Discussion</b>
Generally speaking, given that we are dealing with monetary matters, Halakha allows the parties to determine their own business relationship, provided that the agreement complies with proper form, i.e., a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking an obligation), and that it does not violate any prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur HM</i> 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1.</i> Consequently, if the written memorandum between the broker and client varies from the <i>halakhot</i> of Hoshen Mishpat (halakhic civil law), the agreement will be valid and binding upon the parties.
In our case, among the terms of the brokerage agreement was the following: a presentation of the financial services to be provided, the rate of compensation, and the broker’s obligations. Prior to signing the agreement, Cohen brought the contents of a risk disclosure letter to the notice of the <i>Tove’a</i>, and in the written agreement it states that he has read and understood the risks involved in trading on a stock exchange. When one invests in securities and becomes aware of the attendant risks, it means that he has accepted that his investments may decline in value.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 47b, s.v. “<i>shela</i>.”</i> In the agreement, there was no standard “no reliance” disclaimer that neither party was relying on any advice, statements, or recommendations (whether written or oral) of the other party regarding any transaction. Absent any agreement to the contrary, such an arrangement will exempt the broker from responsibility for any negligent behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 94a; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 116; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1. Cf. R. Barukh of Regensburg, <i>Ohr Zarua</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 297.</i> Finally, the agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause whereby any differences will be resolved by a <i>beit din</i>. As such, this panel has been empowered by the parties to address the matters in dispute in accordance with the provisions of the signed written agreement.
At the initial hearing, the question arose whether the matters in dispute would be resolved according to the canons of Hoshen Mishpat or according to <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> (commercial practice) as expressed in federal and state law as well the broker-dealer selling practice rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations such as the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange. The <i>Tove’a</i> contends that the <i>halakhot</i> of Hoshen Mishpat should govern the proceeding, and Cohen advanced pleadings for <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> to be the basis for resolving their issues. Without having to address the halakhic propriety of invoking <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, given that the parties were in disagreement regarding how to have their differences resolved, this panel decided to render a <i>psak din</i> (decision) grounded in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>.
At first glance, such a decision runs counter to an oft-cited <i>teshuva</i> (responsum) authored by R. Shlomo ben Avraham ha-Kohen (known by the acronym <i>“</i>Maharshakh”)<i>,</i> a sixteenth-century authority in Salonika, Turkey, who addressed a similar scenario.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 2:229.</i> There was a dispute relating to a civil contract. One party wanted the matter resolved in a <i>beit din</i> and the opposing party wanted the matter resolved by a merchants’ panel that was located in Venice, Italy where the transaction took place. Maharshakh ruled that since both parties were relying upon commercial custom to govern their affairs, the matter ought to be resolved by the civil panel of businessmen. Seemingly, in our instance, the engagement of the <i>Tove’a</i> and Cohen was premised upon the fact that commercial practice would prevail. Consequently, we should opt to render a decision based upon civil law.
However, a closer reading of the <i>teshuva</i> reveals that the <i>psak</i> was contingent upon two facts. Firstly, there must be evidence that the parties relied upon commercial custom to govern their relationship. Secondly, in Venice, the <i>minhag</i> was to resolve commercial issues in front of laymen of professionals rather than a <i>beit din</i>. In our situation, the provisions of the brokerage agreement do not attest to any intention that their affairs be determined by <i>minhag ha-soharim.</i> On the contrary, the pre-dispute arbitration clause in their agreement designates the forum for resolution to be a <i>beit din</i>. Our decision to resolve this matter according to the canons of Hoshen Mishpat is thus not contradicted by the aforementioned <i>teshuva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It would seem that if both parties were operating with the expectation that their disputes would be resolved by <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, then Maharshakh would rule that the <i>beit din</i> would determine the claims based upon <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>.</i>
In reply to <i>Tove’a’s</i> claim that he failed to understand what he was signing, once the client reads a prospectus, a risk disclosure statement, and signs off on a brokerage agreement, he cannot subsequently claim that he did not understand what he signed or that he failed to read all the provisions of the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 61:13; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA HM</i> 45:3. For a contemporary application of this rule regarding a brokerage agreement, see <i>PDR</i> 9:16, 25.</i> In effect, by failing to find others who would explain the agreement to him, he is in effect relying upon his broker and is obligated to the terms of the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 45 in the name of <i>Ramban</i>.</i> Hence, <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention that he did not understand what he read when he signed the bank’s customer agreement lacks foundation.
<b>1. Reliance Factors That Establish a Broker’s Responsibility</b>
A claim for negligent misrepresentation entails a communication, in the course of one’s employment or profession, of an unintentional false representation of information for the guidance of others in their commercial transactions. In our situation, a broker advises a client and misrepresents certain information regarding securities investments. Relying upon this advice, a purchase or sale of securities is executed and losses are incurred.
Addressing which factor(s) engender responsibility for negligent misrepresentation, there is a debate whether a “<i>mumheh</i>” – in our case, a licensed investment broker – who performed his due diligence by proffering advice and erred, is exempt under all circumstances. Unable to resolve the controversy, R. Yosef ibn Lev, a sixteenth-century authority therefore rules, “In cases of doubt we do not extract money.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ibn Lev</i> 3:30</i>
Implicit in his position is that if an arbiter feels he cannot resolve the situation, he should abstain from deciding the merits of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. Adopting such a view inexorably leads to the conclusion that one cannot find any monetary relief in filing such a suit against an investment broker who was paid for his services and acted negligently.
However, the more widely accepted position is that receipt of payment, “the pecuniary interest,” serves as the foundation for the expert’s responsiblity for lack of due diligence in communicating advice. As Shulhan Arukh states,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>HM</i> 306:6</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If he charged for his services, he is obligated to pay even though he is an expert and does not require further training.</span>
Relying upon the venerable views of Rambam and Rosh, Shakh concurs with Shulhan Arukh’s decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 306:11.</i> This position is reflective of normative Halakha.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 328–329, <i>Nezikin</i> 170, n. 57.</i>
Assuming that such a claim will be heard in <i>beit din</i>, pursuant to Shulhan Arukh and Rema, the prerequisite for liability is that the professional advisor is remunerated for his services and that the client has relied upon his advice, either by an actual statement communicated to the investment advisor or because the circumstances indicate an apparent reliance upon the advisor.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 106:6. For further discussion, see this writer’s, “The tort of negligent misrepresentation in investment planning: a comparative analysis,” 19 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 141 (2011) which can be accessed at www.yutorah.org.</i>
Even though we are dealing with a <i>Tove’a</i> who invested conservatively, depositing his monies in bank CDs, and who is relatively na•ve regarding the securities market, clearly we are dealing with a broker who performed his due diligence in communicating to his client the risk of such investments. Furthermore, by opening up these various accounts and signing off on the customer’s written memorandum, the <i>Tove’a</i> accepted or understood the nature of the risk and voluntarily chose to subject himself to that risk.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 301:10; 380:1.</i> Given that Cohen forwarded materials for the <i>Tove’a</i> relating to securities, and also explained “the market risk” to him and that “past performance does not guarantee future results,” there was an implicit assumption of risk which exempts the broker from responsibility for ensuing losses. Clearly, <i>Tove’a</i>’s assumption of risk was limited to receiving sound investment advice.
<b>2. The Halakhic Consequences of Securities Investment Losses due to a Broker’s Inaction in Selling</b>
Given that the <i>Tove’a</i> was informed regarding the risks of his investment, is there a basis for concluding that the <i>Nitva</i> remains liable? A broker handling a discretionary account decides whether to sell or buy without receiving any instructions from his client. To execute transactions in a professional fashion, the broker must be duly informed of market fluctuations that affect his client’s interests and objectives, and must provide ongoing counsel regarding the risks entailed in purchasing or selling securities. Granted a power of attorney, the broker is authorized to execute transactions without the client’s prior approval.
Despite the existence of red flags that indicated a potential depreciation of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s investments, Cohen refrained from selling, and losses were incurred. This matter must be examined within the context of <i>hilkhot shemira</i> (bailment), <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> (agency), and <i>hilkhot nezikin</i> (damages). Absent terms of the customer agreement stating otherwise,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if the customer agreement would state that the broker is liable for all damages, then he would be responsible even for indirect damages. See <i>Teshuvot Imrei Bina</i>, <i>HM</i> 2; Z. N. Goldberg, 11 <i>Yeshurun</i> 602–603 (2002).</i> generally speaking, given that the damage was only indirect (<i>grama</i>) and “one who causes indirect damage is exempt from responsibility” (“<i>grama be-nezikin patur</i>”),<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 60a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 22b.</i> one might at first glance assume that Cohen is exempt from compensating the <i>Tove’a</i> for his losses. According to most authorities, an action is a direct cause of the ensuing damage (“<i>garmi</i>”) if the damage is instantaneous and inevitable (“<i>bari hezeka</i>”), such as destroying someone’s note of indebtedness. However, if the damage is not inevitable or instantaneous, the damage is labeled <i>grama</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 22b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:17. Such a conclusion may be inferred from <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 140; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 4, <i>HM</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot le-Horot Natan</i> 3:99.</i> However, given that Cohen is a professional broker and is paid for his services, he is liable for his negligence in failing to sell the securities in a timely fashion.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> and <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 306:6; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yitzhak</i> (Abulafia) 24.</i> This conclusion is predicated upon construing a broker as incurring responsibility based on the norms of <i>hilkhot nezikin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:53, 3:107; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:114; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 234:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 179; <i>Teshuvot Maritz Yeshanot</i> 156; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:16; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 10:294; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 5:102.</i>
Alternatively, for those who argue that one cannot advance a claim for negligence based on <i>hilkhot nezikin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, arguably one may contend that the broker’s inaction did not cause losses that were “<i>bari hezeka</i>,” and therefore, he is exempt from paying for the damages. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 386:3; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 21; <i>Pnei Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 17.</i> or espouse the view that a professional broker who is paid and erred is in the category of an <i>ones</i>, i.e., an unpreventable accident, and is therefore exempt from any errors that might have been committed or omitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 99b, s.v. “<i>eima</i>”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 99, s.v. “<i>amar</i>”; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 10:5.</i> Cohen may be nevertheless responsible by virtue of his status as a <i>shomer sakhar</i>, i.e., paid bailee, who is liable for negligence including loss<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 94a; Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Kil’ayyim</i> 7:3; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 306:12; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 131; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:142. Though no <i>kinyan</i> was executed, once the client entrusts his assets to a broker, <i>hilkhot shemira</i> are applicable. See <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 99a, s.v. “<i>tiknu</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 8:15; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:359. Others learn that pursuant to <i>Tosafot</i> and <i>Rosh</i>, the commencement of work generates <i>hilkhot shemira</i>. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 307:1.</i> and therefore subject to <i>hilkhot shemira</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 6; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:16; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:34.</i> Though Cohen never explicitly accepted the responsibility to safeguard the assets, nonetheless, in this respect he is no different than any employee who receives compensation, who is obligated to safeguard the material he works with,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 293:1.</i> and if he causes a loss, he is responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 74:1, 307:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 291:12.</i> Alternatively, in light of the client’s reliance upon Cohen, as a professional broker compensated for his expertise, he is responsible for any negligence and ensuing loss, even if the loss was not <i>bari hezeka</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>HM</i> 19.</i> Finally, the circumstances indicate, i.e., there is a <i>giluy da’at</i>, that the monies have been transferred from the client to the broker, and therefore, <i>ipso facto</i>, the planner is entrusted with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 291 (in the name of <i>Rosh</i>); <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:291; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 291:2.<br></i>
Regardless of the rationale that establishes the ties of <i>shemira</i>, one of the consequences of Cohen’s status as a <i>shomer</i> is that he is responsible for his inaction. Addressing this point, R. Yosef Trani deals with an agent who was remunerated and empowered to sell merchandise but failed to finalize the sale. In the interim, the goods declined in value. Though in terms of <i>hilkhot nezikin</i>, he would be exempt from responsibility (since the situation would be labeled as <i>grama</i>), however given that the <i>shaliach</i> is also a <i>shomer</i>, he is liable for acts of <i>grama</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, <i>HM</i> 110.</i> Similarly, one may conclude that if a broker is aware of the potential decline of securities, he would be responsible for ensuing losses.
Implicit in invoking <i>hilkhot shemira</i> as defining one of the identities of an investment planner,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Our presentation explicitly assumes that a broker’s identity is governed by various realms of Halakha, such as <i>nezikin</i> and <i>shemira.</i></i> is that a broker’s duty of care encompasses protecting the market value of the securities. If a Jew deposits <i>hametz</i> with a fellow Jew on the eve of Pesach and the Jewish bailee neglects to sell the <i>hametz</i> to a gentile before the onset of Pesach, the owner of the <i>hametz</i> is forbidden to derive benefit from it after Pesach. Moreover, according to most authorities, the s<i>homer</i>’s responsibility is limited to ensuring the preservation of the actual physical state of the <i>hametz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 38a; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30a, s.v. “<i>le-tzorkho</i>”; <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 443:4; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 3:18; <i>Mishnah Berura</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>OH</i> 443:16; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:16.</i> The fact that the owner of the <i>hametz</i> will be unable to benefit from the foodstuffs after Pesach is not the <i>shomer</i>’s responsibility. Similarly, it would seem that the safeguarding of the value of securities from market fluctuations is beyond a s<i>homer</i>’s mandate.
However, there are <i>Poskim</i> who note that in cases of potential devaluation of currency or depreciation of documents such as a lottery ticket, a <i>shomer</i> is duty-bound to redeem this currency or be liable for failing to be aware of the lottery ticket’s expiration date.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 1:112; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:593; <i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham</i> 105; <i>She’elat Ya’avetz</i> 1:85; Barukh Kahane, <i>Shomerim</i>, 351–354.</i> Similarly, we may conclude that an investment planner, by dint of being a <i>shomer</i>, is obligated to keep abreast of market fluctuations, and if he fails to sell an investment that demonstrates the potential to decline in value, he is liable for the loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This conclusion is predicated upon the fact that the lost value of an investment, albeit is an example of <i>hezek she’ane nikar</i>, indiscernible damage; nonetheless one is liable for the loss.

To assess whether, in fact, there are grounds to view Cohen’s inaction as an act of negligence, we inquired with two experts in securities investments as to whether the decline in the value of the securities was due to the financial integrity of the companies or “the halo effect” of the financial markets. Depending on its source, the decline ought to have propelled Cohen to either sell or refrain from selling these securities. Addressing an insurance agent who failed to collect an award from an insurance company and subsequently went bankrupt, Maharshakh states,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 2:46. For the hiring of experts in other matters such as appraising the value of property or movables, see <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:15; 103.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It appears that this matter should be clarified by expert merchants, and if they feel he has been negligent according to the custom of the merchants, he is … obligated to pay.</span>
In our scenario, the expert testimony of both financial planners was that Cohen’s inaction was due to his failure to keep abreast of the market fluctuations and therefore he is obligated to pay <i>Tove’a</i> for his losses.
<b>3. Corporate Liability or Broker’s Personal Liability?</b>
Generally speaking, directors, officers, and shareholders of a corporation are not personally liable for the financial obligations of the corporation. One of the reasons for accepting this rule, known as the limited liability rule, is because there is an assumption that when individuals engage in transactions with corporations, everyone will abide by civil law, which validates this rule. Implicit in this position is that regarding monetary matters, “<i>matneh al ma she-katuv ba-torah, tena’o kayam</i>,” i.e., we can stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah and establish our own agreements regarding our commercial transactions. In other words, though Halakha imputes personal liability to these individuals, Halakha permits us to adopt the norms of civil law, which precludes them from being personally responsible for any debts. In effect, individuals have not only agreed to comply with secular law but also with “<i>minhag ha-soharim</i>,” i.e., commercial practice. Alternatively, others contend that pursuant to “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>,” i.e., the law of the kingship is the law, Halakha imparts validity to limiting liability of shareholders, directors, and officers.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Batzri, <i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 2, 315; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Halva’a</i> 7:17, <i>Shutafut</i> 1:33; <i>Brit Yehuda</i> 7:25–26; <i>Moadim u-Zmanim</i> 3:269; <i>PDR</i> 6:322, 10:278.</i> However, given that Cohen was an employee for People’s Bank, Inc., rather than a shareholder, director, or officer, the limited liability rule cannot shield him from personal liability for his improper behavior.
The question is, given the fact that Cohen signed off on the customer agreement as an employee of People’s Bank, will Cohen’s employer be responsible for his actions, or will he be personally liable for his failure to sell the securities in a timely fashion? As we explained, the identity of a broker is molded by the <i>halakhot</i> governing <i>nezikin</i> and <i>shemira.</i> However, there is another realm of Halakha which impacts a planner’s identity, namely <i>hilkhot shelihut</i>, i.e., the laws of agency, and <i>hilkhot sekhirut</i>, i.e., labor relations law, which replies to our question. Generally speaking, agency is formed on the basis of a verbal commitment, a written agreement, or the conduct of the parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 35:5; <i>HM</i> 182:1.</i> In our scenario, in the absence of an oral or written agreement explicitly stating that Cohen is the <i>shaliach</i> of the <i>Tove’a</i>, <i>Tove’a</i>’s authorization to have Cohen open a discretionary account is nevertheless equivalent to appointing Cohen as his agent. Numerous <i>Poskim</i> have construed a broker as a <i>shaliach</i>, either due to the services he provides,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 22; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 6; <i>Sefer Meishiv be-Halakha</i>, 138–140, 170.</i> or because he is employed by the <i>Nitva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham</i>, <i>YD</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Shick</i> 157.</i> To put it differently, Cohen’s responsibilities are defined not only by <i>hilkhot nezikin</i> and <i>shemira</i> but also by <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> and <i>sekhirut po’alim</i>. As a <i>shaliach</i>, the broker is to manage the account in his client’s best interests. If the broker undermines his client’s best interests, such as by failing to address potential loss of investment, the client can raise an objection,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 85a, 99b.</i> “<i>le-tikunei shedartikh ve-lo le-avutei</i>,” i.e., “You were commissioned to act for my benefit, not to my detriment!”
The question that remains is whether the <i>Nitva</i> or Cohen is liable to pay for the losses. There is a proscription against damaging another person’s property.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The nature of the <i>issur</i> is subject to debate. See <i>Yad Rama</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 26a; <i>R. Tam</i>, <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i> 522; <i>Rabbeinu Yona</i>, <i>Masekhet Avot</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 108:10; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 378; R. Yosef Trani, <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>, <i>Shekhenim</i> 9; Zalman N. Goldberg, 1 <i>ha-Yashar ve-Hatov</i> 5 (5766).</i> In addressing the case of a <i>shomer</i>, Rambam writes, “Anyone who acts negligently is a <i>mazik</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 2:3</i>
The moment that a person obligates himself to be a <i>shomer</i>, in acting negligently he becomes a <i>mazik</i>, even in situations of <i>grama</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Revid ha-Zahav</i> 42.</i>
Consequently, once the <i>issur</i> of causing damage occurs, the <i>mazik</i> must pay for losses caused even indirectly. As we have demonstrated, Cohen is liable for damages due to the harm that he perpetrated. In effect, Cohen’s inaction caused damage, and although it may have been indirect,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n.15.</i> since the damage involved violation of an <i>issur</i>, at first glance, one would conclude that Cohen is responsible for his conduct. But as a <i>po’eil</i>, his behavior is merely an extension of the work of the employer, “<i>yad po’eil ke-yad ba’al ha-bayit</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 10a; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 105:1; <i>Ohr Sameach</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 9:11; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafin</i> 11.</i> And although we generally invoke the rule that “one cannot be an agent for a prohibited act,” and therefore one would conclude that the employer (<i>meshaleiach</i>) ought to be exempt from responsibility, here, the status of the broker as a <i>po’eil</i> trumps his status as a <i>shaliach</i>, and therefore <i>Nitva</i> ought to be responsible.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, supra n. 43, as understood by <i>Teshuvot Sh’oeil u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 2:110; <i>PDR</i> 16:205, 208 in the name of <i>Imrei Tzvi</i>.</i> However, most authorities contend that the rule “one cannot be an agent for a prohibited act” applies to a <i>po’eil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahrit Algazi le-Hilkhot Bekhorot le-Ramban</i> 4:50; <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i> 182:1; <i>Teshuvot Shivat Tzion</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:20.</i> and therefore, given that Cohen committed an <i>issur</i> by harming the <i>Tove’a</i>’s assets, he is responsible.
<b>4. The Scope of the Monetary Award</b>
Reuven, a landlord, leases his house to Shimon contingent upon Shimon taking out fire insurance. Shimon fails to insure the property and the house burns down. Since Shimon agreed to assume the responsibility of a <i>shomer</i> by dint of agreeing to take out insurance, R. Hayyim Segelovich concludes that Shimon acted negligently and therefore Reuven is entitled to full compensation for his home.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekor Hayyim</i> 22.</i> Other authorities have concurred with his view.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 183; <i>Teshuvot Shnei ha-Meorot ha-Gedolim</i> 12; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 108; <i>Maharshakh</i>, supra n. 33; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 333:3.</i> Analogously in our case, Cohen, by virtue of the fact that he is a <i>shomer</i> and <i>shaliach</i>, is obligated to fully compensate the <i>Tove’a</i> for his losses.
<b>5. A <i>Beit Din</i> Award and an Insurance Award – “Double Dipping”</b>
Based upon the foregoing, <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to receive full compensation for his losses. Given that <i>Tove’a</i> may proceed against the insurance company that protects Cohen’s professional activity as a broker, Cohen argues that he has no right to “double dip,” should he recover monetary damages from the insurance company. Consequently, any <i>beit din</i> award should be contingent on the fact that <i>Tove’a</i> fails to recover monetary damages from the insurance company.
Addressing the case of a tenant who assumed liability for a loss due to fire, and subsequently, the landlord bought fire insurance, Ohr Sameach rules that even though the insurance company will reimburse the landlord for the loss, nevertheless, the tenant still remains bound to pay the landlord for the identical loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 6:7.</i> Since the tenant assumed an unconditional obligation to pay for fire damage, the tenant must pay the landlord even if the landlord will not suffer a loss (due to insurance compensation). Most authorities subscribe to this position of double indemnity.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 4:7; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av</i> 2:50; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meshiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 3:129; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 21:58; <i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 2:10.</i> Consequently, as long as the insurance company allows the landlord to benefit from double compensation, such benefit will be halakhically valid. Similarly, in our case, as long as the terms of the insurance policy will allow for <i>Tove’a</i> to recoup his losses twice, Halakha will validate both the <i>beit din</i> award and insurance award.
<b>Decision</b>
1. Menahem Cohen is hereby obligated to pay <i>Tove’a</i> $300,000.
2. <i>Tove’a</i> is permitted to file suit in court against the insurance company.
3. All other claims and applications are hereby denied.

b) Piercing the Corporate Veil

<b>B. Piercing the Corporate Veil</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Century Affiliates vs. Rabinowitz Properties</i></span>
On February 1, 2011, the above parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve their dispute according to applicable portions of Shulhan Arukh and <i>Poskim</i>. Both parties submitted their disputes in reference to various claims advanced by Century Affiliates (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>) against Mr. Dine of Rabinowitz Properties of Bethesda, Maryland (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>).
<b>Facts</b>
Pursuant to a contract, dated July 1, 2010, <i>Tove’a</i> was represented by Levi Fried and <i>Nitva</i> was represented by Moshe Dine. According to the agreement, <i>Tove’a</i> performed certain environmental protection work on behalf of the <i>Nitva</i>. Nine months after the work was completed, some outstanding invoices remained unpaid. At the time, Mr. Dine was the CEO of Rabinowitz Properties, a corporate business whose partners, directors, and mangers were Jewish, and <i>Nitva</i> held the controlling interest in this business entity.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that it was his understanding, based upon the trust relationship developed over years in business dealings with <i>Nitva</i>, that if Rabinowitz Properties would fail to pay the outstanding debt, Dine would serve as a guarantor and personally pay it. In fact, the <i>Nitva</i> said to the <i>Tove’a</i>, “You need not worry. Our assets are secure.”
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Reply</b>
Given that <i>Nitva</i>, as CEO of Rabinowitz Properties, acted at all times as a representative of the corporation, <i>Nitva</i> argues that, in accordance with the accepted doctrine of the limited liability rule, he is not personally liable to pay a corporate debt. All of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s invoices were paid from corporate accounts rather than from <i>Nitva</i>’s personal financial accounts. Moreover, <i>Nitva</i> claims that at no time did he communicate to <i>Tove’a</i> that he construed these outstanding monies as a personal debt. Though <i>Nitva</i> admits that he communicated to <i>Tove’a</i> that “You need not worry, our assets are secure,” nevertheless <i>Nitva</i> meant that our company assets are now secure and therefore bills will be paid. In fact, <i>Nitva</i> subsequently realized that some of the <i>Tove’a</i>’s work was below industry standards, and as a result, refused to pay the unpaid invoices. To put it differently, <i>Tove’a</i>’s work and <i>Nitva</i>’s interaction with the <i>Tove’a</i> was inextricably linked to corporate past, present, and future rather than connected to <i>Nitva’s</i> “personal piggy bank.”
<b>Discussion</b>
The threshold question is how Halakha views a corporation. Dating back to the English case <i>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.</i> (1897), common law views a corporation as an artificial person. It is a legal fiction recognized by civil law.
As explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem Elon ed., <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i>, Yerushalayim, 1975, 160.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Legal person [is] a body of men or of property which the law, in imitation of the personality of human beings, treats artificially as subject of rights and duties … The classic example of a legal person is the corporation … The corporation has usually … the following characteristics: a name common to the aggregate of its component individuals … ; a life independent of the lives of its components; the possession of privileges or rights, liabilities or duties, which do not inhere in its membership as individuals …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Jewish law did not recognize the type of ownership implied in the idea of a corporation. Common ownership is ordinarily expressed in terms of partnership [<i>shutafut</i>] … The salient differences whereby partnership may be distinguished from the corporation are: the continued existence of the partnership is dependent upon the lives of the partners; the rights, liabilities and duties associated with a partnership inhere almost directly in the individuals members of the association …</span>
<b>1. The Nature of a Corporation: <i>Tzibur</i> v. <i>Shutafut</i></b>
Consequently, it is unsurprising to find that most authorities view the corporation as a <i>shutafut</i>, i.e., a joint effort of partners.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, vol. 1, 3:31; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>YD</i> 158; <i>Teshuvot ha-Elef Lekha Shlomo</i>, <i>OH</i> 238; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 3:1, 7:26; <i>Mishneh Halakhot</i> 6:277, <i>Teshuvot Maharshag</i>, <i>YD</i> 3; <i>Pnei Mavin</i>, <i>YD</i> 119; <i>Teshuvot Melamed le-Hoeil</i>, vol. 1, <i>OH</i> 91, vol. 2, <i>YD</i> 3, 9; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:20; <i>Minhat Elozor</i> 2:22; <i>Minhat Petim</i>, <i>YD</i> 160; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 189; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi</i>, <i>YD</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 28; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>OH</i> 1:90, 4:54.</i>
However, a minority of authorities construed the corporation as an independent entity. To buttress their conclusion that the corporation is an artificial person, authorities look for parallels of associations dating back to the time of the Mishnah and Talmud that are construed as independent entities. For example, municipal governments known as “<i>bnei ha-ir</i>” were empowered to address the political, economic, social, and educational matters of the local Jewish community.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 11:23; <i>Bava Batra</i> 8b.</i> The authoritative governing body of this corporate body was the “<i>shiva tovei ha-ir</i>,” i.e., the seven notables of the city who were elected by the local citizenry. For numerous authorities, this panel was viewed as being an independent body with a life of its own, untrammeled by the <i>halakhot</i> that are applicable to private individuals. For instance, in contradistinction to a private agreement, a <i>kinyan</i> (symbolic act of undertaking an obligation) is not required in order to impart validity to a public agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 6:19, 21; <i>Mordekhai Bava Metzia</i> 457–458; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:8–9.<br>Nonetheless, if the promise was given without authorization, the promise is unenforceable. For example, if the promise was given without prior approval of the majority of the seven elders or undermined the welfare of the community, the promise is null and void. See <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 666; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>HM</i> 61; <i>PDR</i> 6:166, 173.</i> Therefore, if the municipal body makes a promise, the body is duty-bound to comply with it, even though it is not legally enforceable in a <i>beit din</i>.
A few decades ago, this notion of the <i>tzibur</i>, i.e., the community, was extended beyond the confines of the seven elders of the city to encompass political agreements of political parties in a democratic state. In a case brought to an Israeli <i>beit din</i>, three political parties were running for election for a municipal council under a joint list. The parties executed a written agreement that if only two of the first three candidates were elected, the second would withdraw in favor of the third. As expected, only two were elected, but the second candidate refused to resign. Among the arguments advanced by the plaintiff in <i>beit din</i> was that no proper <i>kinyan</i> was performed, and consequently, the written agreement had no validity. The <i>beit din</i>’s reply was that:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 4, at 181. This conclusion is contingent upon the fact that the public promise obligates both parties. However, should the recipient of the promise fail to be obligated, the public may retract its promise. See <i>Teshuvot Be’er Yitzhak</i>, <i>YD</i> 3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Communal leaders … should not advance the claim that they don’t have to comply with the duties they agreed to because they are not legally binding. Words and promises, in particular those regarding the public, are matters of holiness … The public may not break its pledges …</span>
Pursuant to some <i>Aharonim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i> 3:190; <i>Teshuvot Tzofnat Paneach</i> 184; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:54, 124; <i>Yad Shaul</i>, 47; <i>Teshuvot Zera Avraham</i> (Zemba) 4:21–24.</i> given that Halakha views the <i>tzibur</i> as an independent entity, we similarly ought to recognize a corporation as a separate entity. Just as the public association is governed by its own rules, similarly corporate life has its own practices.
<b>2. The Limited Liability Rule</b>
Regardless of how one construes a corporation as a partnership or as an artificial person, everyone agrees that Halakha validates the limited liability rule. Pursuant to this doctrine, shareholders are immune from liability for corporate torts and debts beyond their investments in the corporation’s stock.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Frank Easterbrook &amp; Daniel Fischel, <i>The Economic Structure of Corporate Law</i> 40 (1991).</i> Even those <i>Poskim</i> who construe a corporation as a general partnership, and as such personally obligate each and every employee for an ensuing liability, they nevertheless invoke the limited liability rule. In other words, despite the fact that a corporation is viewed as a <i>shutafut</i>, generally speaking, directors, officers and shareholders of a corporation are not personally liable for the financial obligations of the corporation. Moreover, even R. Yeshayahu Bloi, who argues that every shareholder is an owner of the corporation because his investment may result in profit or loss,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Brit Yehuda</i> 2, n. 59. Implicit in R. Bloi’s position is that incurring a profit or loss regarding an investment is an indicator of ownership. In other words, should the corporation incur losses, either the corporate profits will be divided among the shareholders, and they will receive less because of the losses; or, should corporate dissolution occur, the shareholders will receive less money than they invested.<br>Whether from a secular legal perspective stock ownership is in fact a species of private property is subject to debate. See Milton Friedman, “The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits,” <i>NY Times</i>, September 13, 1970 (Magazine section); Melvin Eisenberg, “The Conception that the Corporation is a Nexus of Contracts and the Dual Nature of the Firm,” 24 J<i>. Corporate Law</i>, 819, 825 (1999); Ronald Green, “Shareholders as Stakeholders,” 50 <i>Washington</i> and Lee L. Rev. 1409, 1413–1416 (1993); Stephen Bainbridge, <i>Director Primacy: The Means and Ends of Corporate Governance</i>, UCLA School of Law Research Paper No. 02-06.</i> nevertheless admits that barring certain extenuating circumstances, each and every shareholder is shielded by the limited liability rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 8.</i>
Various reasons are advanced for recognizing this rule. In monetary matters, “<i>matneh al ma she-katuv batorah, tena’o kayam</i>,” i.e., one can stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah and establish his own agreements and <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, i.e., commercial custom, or “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>,” i.e., the law of the kingship is the law, imparts validity to limiting liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Halakhot</i>, supra n. 2; E. Batzri, <i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, vol. 2, 315; <i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Halva’ah</i> 7:17, <i>Shutafut</i> 1:33; <i>Brit Yehuda</i> 7:25–26; <i>Moadim u-Zmanim</i> 3:269; <i>PDR</i> 6:322, 10:278.</i>
Despite the fact that upon forming a corporation, no individuals or group of individuals sits down and explicitly agrees among themselves to comply with this rule, nevertheless in the words of R. Ezra Batzri, a retired Israeli <i>dayan</i> states,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dinei Mamonot</i>, supra n. 10; <i>PDR</i> 19:9, 16. It is a subject of debate whether the lack of personal liability for corporate debt is because the concerned did not accept to pay or because the creditor waived the liability. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban Bava Batra</i> 126b; <i>Rashba</i>, <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 56a.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In spite of the fact that not every individual is knowledgeable in all the facets of secular law, he accepts their norms … and he can apprise himself of the law before executing an agreement [with the corporation].</span>
Since the corporate member can ascertain what the law states regarding liability, the corporate law has validity by dint of <i>minhag</i>, even if no individuals sought legal advice. This <i>minhag</i> requires compliance not from the members of the corporate entity, but also from third parties who engage in business with the enterprise.
Similarly, the late R. Bloi, <i>dayan</i> of the Edah Haredit Beit Din in Yerushalayim, argues that if the <i>minhag</i> is widespread, there is a presumption that the individual acted in accordance with the <i>minhag</i>, even if he was unfamiliar with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Hoshen</i>, <i>Sekhirut</i> 7, n. 17; see ch. 4, section 5.</i>
There is a widespread <i>minhag</i> that the limited liability rule applies to a corporation. Prior to the formation of the corporation, the prospective members of the corporation had the ability to afford themselves of legal consultation for the purpose of ascertaining the import of the limited liability rule. Consequently, the limited liability rule is operative.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:36; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>Hiddushin</i> 71:25; <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 71:3, <i>Urim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 71:10 disagree and argue that a party must know of the <i>minhag</i>. Therefore, even if others know, he is not obligated to follow the <i>minhag</i>. As such, the limited liability rule would only be applicable if the prospective member of the corporation is familiar with the rule.<br>Nonetheless, as R. Gatinyo notes, “The words of the respected early and later authorities demonstrate that they all concur that we follow the local practice … and it is not dependent on whether they know of the existence of the custom.” See <i>Teshuvot Tzel ha-Kesef</i> 33.<br>For the grounds to impute liability based on the fact that one could have afforded himself legal consultation in order to ascertain his responsibilities, see File no. 1-35-8935, Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, <i>Mosdot Plonim v. Kuf &amp; Vav</i>, November 1, 2004.</i>
<b>3. The Limited Liability Rule and <i>Shi’abud Nekhasim</i> without <i>Shi’abud ha-Guf</i> or <i>Apotiki Meforash</i></b>
In fact, two <i>pesakim</i> (decisions) issued by <i>battei din</i> in Eretz Yisrael echo the same approach. In one <i>din torah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:315</i> the <i>beit din</i> examined whether managers and workers bear any personal responsibility for corporate debt. In addressing this question, the panel debated whether Halakha recognizes a <i>shi’abud nekhasim</i> (an encumbrance of assets) in a situation such as an outstanding corporate debt, where there exists no <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i> (personal obligation to pay the debt). Unable to decide whether one should subscribe to the view that Reuven can place a lien on his own assets for the sake of Shimon without Reuven having any personal duty to Shimon, the <i>beit din</i> concluded that, based upon <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> and <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, these corporate employees were exempt from liability. Though this <i>din torah</i> (<i>beit din</i> proceeding) did not address our scenario of a corporate officer who controlled the corporation, the thrust of their reasoning does not indicate the existence of any distinction between a corporate owner and a corporate manager.
Seven years later, another <i>din torah</i> in Eretz Yisrael dealt with a <i>Tove’a</i> who had commissioned the services of a corporation and claimed an outstanding debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 10:273, 288–290.</i> The <i>Nitvaim</i> (defendants) argued that the business’s original owners were deceased, and that the <i>Nitvaim</i> had inherited ownership of the company. The question posed to the <i>beit din</i> was whether the heirs should be considered the <i>nitvaim</i>, in which case debt recovery would be difficult, or whether the <i>Nitva</i> was actually the corporation, which is an independent entity and therefore liable.

See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 13:20; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 36. Even according to those <i>Poskim</i> who argue that it would be ineffective for future assets (see <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:278; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> and <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, 201), it would be valid due to the fact that a corporation has the status of a <i>tzibur</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 546; <i>PDR</i> op. cit., at 323. Obviously, such a conclusion presumes that a corporation is a separate entity rather than a <i>shutafut</i>.</i>
Alternatively, R. Yitzhak Weiss, R. Shmuel Wosner, and Machon Lehoro’ah, a <i>beit din</i> in Monsey, New York, contend<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 10:145; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 5, <i>HM</i> 306; <i>Meishiv be-Halakha</i> 97.</i> that responsibility for debt incurred by a corporation is based upon the institution of “<i>apotiki meforash</i>,” i.e., user’s security interest. In other words, corporate management may establish a lien on the company’s assets without imposing any personal liability upon themselves, the shareholders, and employees. In effect, a creditor can recover his debt from the designated asset(s).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 226:1; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 117:6; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 2.</i> The only manner by which a creditor’s right of recovery from the <i>apotiki</i> is extinguished is by paying the debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, the invoking of the institution of <i>apotiki meforash</i> to justify the limited liability rule has its limitations. For example, according to <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 15b, s.v. “<i>ho</i>,” <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i> 15b, <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i> and <i>Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 16b, the creditor can recover <i>shevach</i> (accrued profits) of <i>apotiki meforash</i> above his actual debt. Clearly, in a corporate context, a creditor may recover his debt and nothing more. Other <i>Poskim</i> disagree.<br>Secondly, according to <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 36b and <i>Rashba</i> (<i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:981), <i>shemita</i> (the seventh year which annuls debts) nullifies an <i>apotiki</i>. Again, within the corporate context that would mean that <i>shemitah</i> will extinguish all outstanding corporate debts! However, if one understands the limited liability rule as recognizing that there can be <i>shi’abud nekhasim</i> without <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i>, then <i>shemita</i> does not nullify corporate debts. See <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 67:25. However, see self-contradictory ruling of <i>Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 66:43, that argues that a <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i> remains.<br>Finally, one may argue that invoking the institution of an <i>apotiki meforash</i> to understand the corporate limited liability rule is unfounded. Whereas, concerning the <i>apotiki meforash</i> we are dealing with debtor who has a <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i>, regarding a corporation, the shareholders have no <i>shi’abud ha-guf.</i></i> Moreover, though <i>apotiki meforash</i> may serve to explain the absence of personal liability for corporate employees, it does not exempt them from complying with <i>issurim</i> such as <i>ribbit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 71a, s.v. “<i>ve-yisrael</i>.” The absence of <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i> does not mean that there is no <i>issur</i> of <i>ribbit</i>. See <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 169:9–10. Contra <i>Teshuvot Maharshag</i>, <i>YD</i> 5.</i>

<b>4. The Scope of the Limited Liability Rule</b>
Even if Halakha allows one to benefit from the limited liability rule, is there a distinction between an individual who owns this business enterprise and one who only invests in it? In other words, will the limited liability rule serve as a shield for an individual who owns and controls a corporation? R. Tzvi Yehuda Ben Ya’akov, a <i>dayan</i> in Tel Aviv, addresses the following question: If a corporate stockholder suddenly becomes an <i>aveil</i> (mourner), given that he is proscribed from working during the days of <i>shiva</i>, is there a prohibition upon the corporation to engage in work during the time of his <i>shiva</i>? In other words, does one identify “his work” as the work of the corporation, or do we view his shares as an investment in the labor of others, and the corporation’s work is not considered “his work”?
Initially, R. Ben Ya’akov draws a distinction between two types of shareholders. If a shareholder simply has an investment in the corporation, then any labor performed during his <i>shiva</i> is construed as the work of others in the corporation. However, if the stockholder has a controlling interest in the corporation, then any work engaged by the corporate network during his <i>aveilut</i> is “his work,” and the corporation should be closed during this period. In effect, the litmus test for determining whether the corporation should remain open is whether the <i>aveil</i> has a controlling interest or merely a shareholder investment. Given that R. Ben Ya’akov admits that a corporation is a separate entity, at the conclusion of the <i>psak din</i>, he leaves the question open.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 1: 39 (10).</i> However, subsequently, in the next volume of his <i>teshuvot</i>, he affirms that a shareholder who is in control of a corporation is to be treated differently.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:12 (5).</i> Such a distinction has been endorsed by some <i>Poskim</i> regarding issues relating to <i>hametz</i> and <i>ribbit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:124; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 3, <i>YD</i> 63.</i> In our scenario, given that <i>Nitva</i> had a controlling interest in the company and was in control of the day-to-day operations of Rabinowitz Properties, in accordance with R. Ben Ya’akov’s line of reasoning, possibly he should be personally liable for any outstanding corporate debt.
However, it is our understanding that R. Ben Ya’akov’s <i>teshuva</i> is limited to <i>hilkhot aveilut</i> and does not impact upon the issue of a corporate owner’s personal liability for corporate debt. In other words, there are <i>Poskim</i>, who like R. Ben Ya’akov accept the limited liability rule, and yet with regard to <i>issurim</i> such as <i>ribbit</i> and <i>hametz</i>, rule that one must refrain from loaning money to a corporation without a <i>heter iska</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">A business partnership structured such that <i>hilkhot ribbit</i> are not violated.</i> and that an individual cannot buy shares in a Jewish-owned corporation that transgresses Shabbat. The same conclusion ought to apply regarding the <i>issur</i> of engaging work during one’s <i>aveilut</i>.
As R. Menashe Klein states,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 6:277 (p. 171).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Clearly it is prohibited to lend with interest to a corporation due to the fact that in actuality it is a partnership, akin to any partnership … with the <i>tenai</i> (stipulation) that the corporation is exempt from any <i>shi’budei ha-guf</i> (personal encumbrances) … if the corporation sustains a loss … But this does not remove the owners from their ownership rights … and if they borrow money with interest, it is their monies which were borrowed …</span>
In short, according to R. Klein and others,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dinei Mamonot</i> vol. 1, 182; 2, 319–320.</i> the corporate hierarchy, namely the owner, and for that matter every shareholder, officer, and manager, are required to comply with <i>issurim</i> such as <i>ribbit</i>, yet at the same time they are shielded from personal liability for corporate debt based upon the limited liability rule. In short, the recognition of the limited liability rule protects the corporate hierarchy from incurring personal debt, but will not shield them from individual responsibility for compliance with <i>issurim</i> such as <i>ribbit</i>, <i>shemirat shabbat</i>, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">One would assume that those <i>Poskim</i> who recognize the corporation as an artificial person would argue that the corporation is not a lender, and therefore <i>hilkhot ribbit</i> and/or <i>chametz</i> are inapplicable (see <i>Tzofnat Paneach</i>, supra n. 6; <i>Yad Shaul</i>, supra n. 6; possibly <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>YD</i> 158), and those <i>Poskim</i> who recognize it as a <i>shutafut</i> would contend that a corporation is like any lender and therefore <i>hilkhot ribbit</i> are applicable (see <i>Teshuvot Melamaid le-Hoeil</i> 1, <i>OH</i> 9; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi</i>, <i>YD</i> 126). But that is not necessarily the case. For example, there are authorities who would construe the corporation as an artificial person and yet <i>hilkhot ribbit</i> would be applicable. See <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 6.<br>However, the common denominator of the authorities is that corporate debt is to be paid by the corporation rather than by the shareholder. Yet, we must note the problematic opinion of one authority that a shareholder who is a lender may recover outstanding corporate debt from the corporate managers. See <i>Moadim u-Zemanim</i>, supra n. 10, at n. 1.</i> As R. Shternbuch exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Moadim u-Zemanim</i>, supra n. 10.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If the limited liability rule would mean that ownership is totally nullified from the shareholders … then each husband would establish a corporation with his wife or family members … and we would say from henceforth, his food does not belong to him but to the corporation, and one would be able to keep <i>hametz</i> in one’s home during Pesach … and one would be exempt from affixing a <i>mezuza</i> to his doorpost and keeping Shabbat … !</span>
Though regarding <i>hilkhot aveilut</i>, an individual with a controlling interest in a corporation will define corporate work as “his work” during <i>shiva</i>, nonetheless, such a determination will not mean that this officer is personally responsible for outstanding corporate debt.
Clearly, had <i>Nitva</i> verbally agreed to personally guarantee the outstanding invoices, such an agreement would have been binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah cited in <i>Bava Batra</i> 175b.</i> Assuming the <i>Tove’a</i> can demonstrate that he had personally agreed to guarantee payment of the outstanding debt, i.e., <i>arevut</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> would be obligated to pay personally.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 129:2; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 129:8. According to others, this <i>arevut</i> (guarantee) is contingent upon the debtor stating, “I am relying upon you.” See <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 129:7; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura</i> 4, 1:45; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:102; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 142.</i> Just as the corporate veil does not shield an individual from the need to abstain from engaging in <i>issurim</i> such as refraining from violating the interdicts against <i>ribbit</i> and <i>hametz</i>, similarly, one must be trustworthy in one’s business commitments. And, should a corporate employee knowingly accept a certain corporate obligation as his own personal duty, he becomes personally liable. Following in the footsteps of R. Yitzhak Weiss and R. Shmuel Wosner,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 19.</i> R. Shlomo Amar, Eretz Yisrael’s former chief rabbi rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo Amar, “Obligations and Responsibilities of Directors of Financial Institutions” (Hebrew), 33 <i>Tehumin</i> 15, 24 (5773). See also <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 65–110.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">… Even though practically speaking, a corporation is like an “<i>apotiki m’forash</i>,” and the owners are not personally liable, rather the corporate assets [are the asset-based liability], nevertheless, the director, who is hired as a professional … and is paid in accordance with his expertise, clearly must act responsibly and refrain from being negligent in his work, and any negligence … is construed as <i>peshiah</i> [halakhic negligence], … and an employee is liable at least like a bailee …</span>
However, in our scenario, contrary to <i>Tove’a</i>’s allegations, such a relationship had never materialized, generating negligent conduct on the part of the <i>Nitva</i>. The communication of the <i>Nitva</i>’s message, “You need not worry, our assets are secure,” can easily be interpreted as meaning that the corporate assets are secure and payment will be forthcoming. Possibly, this promise did not envision any future corporate inability to satisfy the debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 80.</i> In fact, if such an exchange would have occurred between two individuals in a private or non-corporate business setting, such an interpretation would be plausible, and one would have to prove that the <i>Nitva</i> was in actuality undertaking to be a guarantor in order to extract money from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 131:6.</i> Had our scenario been one in which the corporate entity eventually filed for bankruptcy and failed to satisfy the debt, and the financial condition of the company was known to <i>Nitva</i>, he would have been personally liable for damages as a <i>mazik</i>, i.e., a tortfeasor committing negligent misrepresentation, regardless if the corporation is halakhically construed as an independent entity or as partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 129, 7; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 7–8; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 129:2; <i>Divrei Geonim</i> 78:14; <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 9:419, 421.</i> On the other hand, if <i>Nitva</i> were unaware of the pending financial debacle, he would not be personally liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 19:9, 20.</i> However, the circumstances surrounding our case did not transpire within the context of any corporate bankruptcy. As such, <i>Nitva</i> is personally exempt from compensating the <i>Tove’a</i>.
In our case, both Fried and Dine signed off on the contract and riders executed between their respective LLCs. In effect, the contract and riders of two corporate enterprises and their signatures accompanied by a contract memorialization of their respective roles as President and Vice President conveys to us that both <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i> are implicitly accepting the limited liability rule.
<b>5. Piercing the Corporate Veil</b>
One of the advantages of incorporating a business is liability protection. As noted, forming a corporation creates what is called a “corporate veil,” a division been the business entity and the personal assets of the shareholders, officers, and directors of a corporation. If challenged in a lawsuit, IRS action, or other action, the veil of liability protection may be pierced and these individuals may be held personally liable for its debts.
Pursuant to section 19 of the rider of the AIA document executed by the parties, the choice of law provision is the law of Maryland in resolving all matters with Rabinowitz Properties. Though the parties to this <i>beit din</i> (arbitration) proceeding have not expressed whether this matter ought to be resolved according to Hoshen Mishpat or Maryland law, we have chosen to resolve this matter of “piercing the veil” both according to Halakha and Maryland law.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Secondly, even in the absence of this choice of law provision, as we noted in the text accompanying n. 10, one of the justifications for accepting the limited liability rule is “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>”. Consequently, we are addressing our case based on civil law as well as <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>.<br>Piercing the corporate veil entails holding an individual such as a shareholder personally liable, whereas enterprise liability offers a mechanism for holding the entire corporation liable. For this distinction, see <i>Walkovsky v. Carlton</i>, 223 N.E. 2d 6 (NY 1966).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>A. Halakha</i></span>
As we noted, a corporate officer, like any corporate employee, must refrain from transgressing certain <i>issurim</i> such as <i>ribbit</i> and Shabbat. Yet, simultaneously, he is protected by the limited liability rule, and therefore is exempt from personal liability for any outstanding corporate debt. However, should the controlling interest of a corporation reside with one individual, as is our case, the possibility exists that the corporation has either been established or functions as a mere tool or business conduit for the benefit of that individual. Should the major stockholder and one who is in control siphon off corporate assets by failing to report income, failing to comply with corporate formalities, and the like, such actions label him as a <i>gazlan</i> (thief),<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Halakhot</i>, supra n. 29.</i> and he would be personally liable for the corporate debt.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, other employees of the corporate who would siphon assets and fail to comply with certain corporate rules such as reporting income would equally be personally liable for corporate debt. See supra n. 29.</i>
As a <i>beit din</i> in Yerushalayim rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">File No. 379/63, <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 9:419, 421.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In certain instances we attribute the duties and rights of the corporation to the shareholders … One of the situations is if the corporate owner uses the corporation to commit fraud or do an injustice to another individual. In such an instance, we can obligate the owner personally… . and this is like any <i>tenai</i> [stipulation] in monetary affairs, in which we follow the stipulation. This applies when the original intention of the owner was to exploit the corporation. However, if this was not his initial intention, but nevertheless, “down the line,” the assets were not collectible, one cannot collect from the personal assets of the shareholders of the corporation.</span>
As R. Wosner argues, if a corporate officer with a controlling interest dissipates the corporate accounts and funnels the funds into his own account, the corporate shield is lifted and he is personally liable for corporate debts.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i>, vol. 8, <i>HM</i> 306. In the event that there was negligence such as misrepresentation, the shareholders are personally liable for any monetary harm. See <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 10:133.</i>
To put it differently, some of the relevant halakhic<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Whether a particular factor may be legally relevant will vary from one state jurisdiction to another.</i> factors for a <i>beit din</i>’s determination to pierce the corporate veil are as follows<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">A scrutiny of all the facts relating to the affairs of the corporate entity based upon document production and testimony would be required prior to a determination of fraud.</i>: (1) Commingling of corporate funds and other assets with personal financial instruments; (2) An individual’s treatment of the corporation’s assets as his own; (3) An individual holding out that he is personally liable for the corporate debt; (4) Failure to report corporate income; (5) Concealment and misrepresentation of the identity of the corporate ownership and management; (6) Use of the corporate entity to transfer to it the existing liability of another person or entity; (7) Use of a corporation as a subterfuge for illegal transactions; (8) <i>Nitva</i>’s control of the corporation is so complete as to constitute control of policy and finances. Such domination is then used to commit fraud, and the contravention of the duty owed to <i>Tove’a</i> caused injury.
In our scenario, none of the above factors were even raised as ground(s) to pierce the corporate veil, much less proven.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>B. Maryland Law</i></span>
The grounds for “piercing the veil” may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Given the aforementioned provision in the agreement, we will address how courts in Maryland dealt with this matter.
Despite the proclamation that a court may pierce the corporate veil to enforce an equity consideration, arguments that have urged corporate piercing for reasons other than fraud or a necessity to enforce a paramount equity (which has not been defined) have failed in Maryland courts.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Our presentation of Maryland law in part has benefited from the work of John Moye, <i>The Law of Business Organizations</i>, 6th ed., 180–192. See <i>Residential Warranty v. Bancroft Homes Greenspring Valley, Inc.</i> 126 Md. App. Ct. at 307, 728 A. 2d at 789 (1999); <i>Antonio v. Security Services of America</i>, <i>LLC, et al</i>. US District LEXIS 72148 (D. Md. July 16, 2010).</i> In <i>Travel Committee, Inc. v. Pan American World Airways,</i>
Inc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">91 Md. App. 123, 138, 603 A. 2d 1301 (1992).</i> the Court cited a Fourth Circuit South Carolina opinion in <i>DeWitt Track Brokers v. W. Ray Flemming Fruit Co.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">540 F. 2d 681, 685 (4th Circ. 1976).</i> which states:
<span class="poetry indentAll">… When substantial ownership of all the stock of a corporation in a single is combined with other factors clearly supporting disregard of the corporate fiction on the grounds of equity and fairness, courts have experienced “little difficulty” and have shown no hesitancy in applying what is described as the “alter ego” or “instrumentality” theory in order to cast aside the corporate shield and to fasten liability on the individual stockholder.</span>
Invoking the “alter ego theory” which allows one to disregard the corporate fiction where a corporation either is established or functions as a mere tool or business conduit of another individual, the <i>DeWitt Truck Brokers</i> enumerates the factors which establish that the alter ego exists:
<span class="poetry indentAll">These include: whether the corporation was grossly undercapitalized, the corporation’s failure to observe corporate formalities, non-payment of dividends, the debtor’s corporation’s insolvency, the dominant stockholder’s siphoning off corporate assets, the non-functioning of other officers or directors, the absence of corporate records and the corporation’s status as a façade for the stockholder’s arguments …</span>
Legally, the reasoning is sound. Moreover, this reasoning has been applied in other American courts. But it is only that: a <i>persuasive</i> opinion. It has no binding effect on any of the Maryland courts, because it was applying the law of South Carolina. In fact, Maryland courts have adopted a restrictive approach to corporate veil piercing and limited it to instances of fraud. In fact, in various holdings, the court ruled that even if a sham corporation were set up for the sole purpose of evading legal obligations, no piercing would be permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Ames-Ennis, Inc.</i>, 275 Md. at 309, 340 A. 2d, at 233–234 (1976); <i>Dixon vs. Process Corp.</i>, 38 Md. App. at 655, 382 A. 2d at 900 (1978).</i> Based upon the foregoing presentation of Maryland law, there is no basis for invoking the alter ego doctrine.
Even if one would argue that enforcing “a paramount equity,” i.e., the application of the alter ego theory, serves as another reason to pierce the corporate veil, in our instance, based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, no proof was shown that provided sufficient grounds for disregarding the corporate entity.
In sum, pursuant to both Halakha and Maryland law, in the absence of a demonstration of fraud, a claim for recovery of corporate debt from a corporate officer is without foundation. Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, there was demonstration of fraud. In effect, <i>Nitva</i>, while serving as CEO of Rabinowitz Properties, was protected under the limited liability rule.
In short, <i>Tove’a</i>’s discovery attempt to uncover improper behavior such as fraud or total disregard of the corporate entity to satisfy <i>Nitva</i>’s personal agenda in order to impute <i>Nitva</i>’s personal liability lacks foundation.
<b>Decision</b>
1. <i>Nitva</i> is hereby exempt from personal liability for any corporate debts incurred by Rabinowitz Properties.
2. All other claims and applications are hereby denied.
3. Any provision of this decision may be modified with the consent of both parties.

c) Non Compete Agreements

<b>C. Non-Compete Agreements</b><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">A non-compete agreement or what is sometimes called a restrictive covenant is a contract in which a party agrees to be restricted in some regards as to future conduct.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Moshe Peking vs. Aaron Levy</i></span>
On February 1, 2009, the above parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve this matter according to applicable portions of Shulhan Arukh and <i>Poskim</i>. Both parties submitted to this <i>beit din</i> their differences and disputes in reference to various claims advanced by Aaron Friedman, the owner of Moshe Peking (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>) against Ilan Assaf (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>). Having given said matters due consideration and having heard all parties testify as to the facts of said disputes and differences; this panel does decide and agree as follows:
<b>Facts</b>
From May 1995 through April 2003, Ilan Assaf was employed as a chef by Aaron Friedman of Moshe Peking, which was located in the orthodox Jewish commercial neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Among the terms of the restrictive covenant agreement signed by the parties at the commencement of <i>Nitva</i>’s employment were the following:
1. Employee acknowledges that it is essential to the success of the Employer that the business and the affairs of the Employer be kept in the strictest confidence. Employee shall not at any time disclose to any person any information (financial or otherwise) relating … to the business or relating to any trade secrets of the Employer, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, customer lists, information relating to costs, information relating to present and contemplated services and products such as menus, recipes, dish presentations etc … Should the employee decide to resign his employment or should he be terminated the aforesaid information remains the proprietary information of the former employer.
2. Employee hereby covenants and agrees that he shall not for a period of five (5) years following departure from Employer’s employ, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever including, without limitation, or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any person, as agent or shareholder, or in any other capacity such as independently carry on or be engaged in such a business in the Orthodox Jewish commercial neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
3. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement to be unenforceable in whole or in part, including without limitation as to duration and/or territory, the parties hereby direct the court to reduce the scope of such provision to that which is reasonable in the circumstances.
4. Any disputes and differences regarding this Agreement shall be resolved by Beit Din Tzedek, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
In effect, the parties executed two forms of restrictive covenants. In accordance with section one, there is a non-disclosure agreement which prohibits the disclosure of the employer’s proprietary information to a third party during the period of his employment as well as prohibiting the employee to disclose said information to others upon his decision to resign from his job or upon termination. And, in pursuance with section three, there is a non-compete agreement which restricts the employee from working for a competitor or independently establishing his own business in the same trade.
In April 2003, <i>Nitva</i> left <i>Tove’a</i>’s employ and opened his own restaurant in the same neighborhood. In May 2005, Ayala Friedman, chef-owner of Moshe Peking in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sued her former chef, Ilan Assaf, now chef and part owner of King David’s Restaurant.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
In his complaint, the <i>Tove’a</i> alleged that the <i>Nitva</i> pirated the <i>Tove’a</i>’s menu, recipes, and dish presentations, and such conduct is a flagrant misappropriation of his intellectual property’s rights. According to <i>Tove’a</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> had copied a novel culinary creation (rather than a recipe for a dish already in existence in the culinary public domain such as fettucine alfredo, marinated skirt steak, chicken breast, or apple strudel), which <i>Tove’a</i> maintained was a signature dish at Moshe Peking. Unlike many dishes such as apple pie, which are not original to a chef, our culinary creation is novel. Since cuisine is frequently copied and imitated in the culinary industry, damages should be awarded due to the piracy. Furthermore, <i>Tove’a</i> alleges that <i>Nitva</i>’s opening of a competitive restaurant in his neighborhood immediately after his departure from Moshe Peking was a breach of the terms of the restrictive covenant agreement. In short, the piracy and the absence of geographical separation and market separation have deprived the <i>Tove’a</i> of a livelihood and are paving the way toward his financial ruin.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
<i>Nitva</i> admittedly copied the cuisine and the methods of presentation. In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s copyright claim, it is his understanding that neither Halakha nor civil law, for that matter, would afford protection to <i>Tove’a</i>’s business investments. Secondly, though <i>Nitva</i> agrees that he signed off on a restrictive covenant agreement, nevertheless, pursuant to section three of said document, the agreement is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. Protecting Cuisine and Dish Preparations under the Rubric of Secular Copyright Law</b>
In addressing the protection of a literary or artistic creation, R. Yosef Nathanson, opines:<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i> 1:44.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let not our perfect Torah be viewed as not being at least equal to their idle conversation; that is something that reason rejects …</span>
Invoking s<i>evara</i>, i.e., halakhic logic, R. Nathanson asserts that if non-Jewish society’s “idle conversation,” i.e., secular law, provides copyright protection for artistic creations, <i>a fortiori</i> Halakha must do no less.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas, American law and other legal systems limit the span of time for copyright protection, R. Nathanson argued that the right was perpetual and transferable.</i> Subsequently, R. Yitzhak Schmelkes contendes that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, i.e., the law of the kingdom is the law, propels Halakha to impart recognition to an individual to publish his manuscript.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>YD</i> 2:75; <i>HM</i> 80. However, unlike R. Nathanson’s view, supra text accompanying n. 1, once the secular copyright protection expires, R. Shmelkes argues that one loses one’s entitlement to the work.</i> A similar view was espoused by R. Shimon Sofer.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hit’orerut Teshuva</i> 1:232.</i>
A recent secular legal presentation of our matter has been described in the following fashion,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Emily Cunningham, “Protecting Cuisine under the Rubric of Intellectual Property Law: Should the Law Play a Bigger Role in the Kitchen?” 9 <i>J. High Technology Law</i> 22, 24, 26–27 (2009). All footnotes for the text of the citation have been deleted.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The culinary industry generally views cooking as a derivative art. Chefs … draw inspiration from a multitude of places, borrowing and expanding on fellow chefs’ ideas and deriving new dishes from them. Many chefs freely admit that they base their dishes on versions that they have previously seen or eaten …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The scope of the law is set forth in section 102 of the Copyright Act of 1976 and extends to literary, musical, dramatic, choreographic, pictorial, graphic, architectural, and sculptural works …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Derivative works, which originate from a preexisting work and recast, transform or adapt that work, require additional considerations for copyrightability.

<span class="poetry indentAll">Copyright laws traditionally have not protected individual recipes. The US Register of Copyrights notes that “mere listings of ingredients as in recipes, formulas, compounds or prescriptions are not subject to protection [unless] [they are] accompanied by substantial literary expression in the form of an explanation … or when there is a combination of recipes, as in a cookbook.” The rationale for this is that an individual recipe is a process of creating something, rather than a creative literary expression …</span>
Given that the culinary industry and secular law<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel Serv. Co</i>., 499 US 340, 345 (1991); <i>Publ’ns Int’l, Ltd. v. Meredith Corp</i>., 88 F. 3d 473, 480 (7th Cir. 1996); <i>Lambing v. Godiva Chocolatier</i>, 142 F. 3d 434 (6th Cir. 1998); 1 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i>, Section 2.18 {1} (2005).<br>The law would equally fail to afford the <i>Tove’a</i> trademark protection for the cuisine and dish preparations. For the difference between trademark and copyright protection, as well as concluding that these matters are not a protectable trademark, see Cunningham, supra 5, at 28–32.</i> view cooking as a derivative art, the aforementioned <i>Poskim</i> would conclude that there are no grounds for affording copyright protection to the <i>Tove’a</i>’s cuisine and dish presentations.
However, there are a few authorities who claim that there exists a property right of any expression of wisdom, independent of its recognition by civil law. For example R. Shimon Shkop notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei R. Shimon Shkop</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is agreed according to the law of the Torah (and the laws of the nations) that any individual who invents [creates] something new in this world, he is its owner in every respect and right.</span>
In another work, R. Shkop argues that if an employee creates a utensil by “the toil of his hands,”<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei R. Shimon Shkop</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 4.</i> this utensil belongs to the employee by dint of the rule <i>yad po’eil ke-yad ba’al habayit</i>, lit. “the hand of the worker is like the hand of the employer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 10a, s.v. “<i>omar.</i>”</i> He concludes that R. Hayyim Soloveitchik of Brisk also espouses this view. Rabbis Naftali Tzvi Berlin, Hayyim Sofer, Elyashiv, Y. Weiss, and Feinstein, have also subscribed to this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i>, <i>OH</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Mahane Hayyim</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 49; Nachum Weisfish, <i>Mishnat Zekhuyot ha-Yotzer</i> (Hebrew), (2002) 115 in the name of R. Elyashiv; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 9:153; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>OH</i> 4:40, <i>HM</i> 19.</i> Adopting this approach, in contrast to secular law, Halakha would extend protection to ideas, procedures, processes, methods of operation, etc. As such, a culinary creation would be afforded protection. Even though this is not a creative literary expression, a new dish is nevertheless a new process of creating something and therefore subject to protection.
However, the majority of <i>Poskim</i> reject the notion that Halakha recognizes copyright as a property right.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 10; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei De’ah</i> 1:145, 148; <i>Teshuvot Parshat Mordekhai</i>, <i>HM</i> 7–8; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>HM</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i> 259; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 41, 79; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>YD</i> 156; <i>Teshuvot Yeshu’ot Malko</i>, <i>HM</i> 22; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yeshayahu</i> 12; <i>Teshuvot Shem Arye</i> 1, <i>HM</i> 20; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:157; <i>Ohr Sameach</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shabbat</i> 1:8; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:129; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 4:202; <i>Teshuvot va-Yeshev Moshe</i> 1:1–3, 5; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:202; <i>Teshuvot Pe’at Sadekha</i> 158; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Zvi</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sehanim</i> 18; R.

Rabbis M. Feinstein, Elyashiv, Y. Weiss, and S. Wosner who argue that Halakha recognizes such a right. See supra n. 10 and Y. Cohen, <i>Emek ha-Mishpat</i>, vol. 4, 2.</i> Firstly, the history of <i>haskamot</i>, i.e., rabbinic approbations given prior to the publication of Jewish books, attests to the fact that the prohibitions on republishing the works invoked in these approbations, as well as the grounds advanced by authorities to protect people’s creative investments, were based on rabbinic legislation, trade guild legislation, custom, civil law, unfair completion, and the like, and not on the idea of copyright.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Haskama</i> to <i>Sha’agat Arye</i>, Brin 1796; <i>Parshat Mordekhai</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, <i>HM</i> 57. For additional sources, see Nahum Rakover, <i>Zehut Yotzrim be-Mekorot ha-Yehudim</i> (Hebrew), Yerushalayim, 1991.</i>
Though to the best of our knowledge there is no extant <i>teshuva</i> that addresses the alleged privacy of cuisine and dish preparations, nevertheless, based upon the following two <i>teshuvot</i> we are able to discern how Halakha will address these claims. R. Yehezkel Landau, an eighteenth-century <i>Posek</i>, addressed the following scenario: A scholar paid a publisher to print his commentary alongside the text of the Talmud. Upon completion of the printing process, the publisher kept the typeset characters and used them to print his own edition of the Talmud, without the additional commentary. The scholar argued that since he had paid for typesetting those characters, any accrued profits from this edition should belong to him. On the other hand, the publisher claimed that since he owned the typeset characters, the scholar was unable to recoup the profit from the character layout.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 12.</i>
Relying upon the Talmudic rule that if the publisher derives benefit and the scholar sustained a loss (i.e., <i>zeh nehene ve-zeh haser, hayav</i>), R. Landau argued that since the publisher benefited from the scholar’s payment for the character arrangement, the publisher is obligated to remunerate him for the value of the accrued benefit. In other words, the obligation to provide compensation depends on the fact that one derived benefit from someone’s labor (i.e., the character layout) rather than the fact that it was the publisher’s property.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. R. Barukh Frankel-Te’omim, who claims that the characters belonged to the publisher. See <i>Hagahot Barukh Ta’am</i>, <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i> 2:35b.<br>Others argue that the scholar has either a partial-proprietary right or a right in the creation of the typeset arrangement. See <i>Divrei Malkiel</i>, supra n. 12; <i>Yeshuot Malko</i>, supra n. 11. However, our reading of the <i>teshuva</i> does not bear out these conclusions.</i> Though he is obligated to compensate the scholar for his use of the character layout, nevertheless, should the publisher accrue any profits from utilizing this arrangement, R. Landau does not mandate that the publisher disgorge his profits. Turning to our scenario, if Halakha mandates responsibility for unjust appropriation of someone’s time and effort in developing a process (e.g., a typesetting layout), <i>a fortiori</i>, it obligates an award in a case of piracy of a culinary dish.
Approximately a hundred years later, R. Malkiel Tennenbaum, “the Lomza Rov,” responded to the following situation: An individual received a governmental license to sell his newly created product, namely, sweet and fragrant water, and he sold this water with a governmental seal. Should another person sell a similar water composition with such labels, R. Tennebaum contends that it would be a case of unfair competition, and the competitor would be duty-bound to compensate the original seller for any losses incurred by the marketing of this competing product.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Divrei Malkiel</i>, supra n. 12.</i>
In sum, according to R. Tennenbaum and R. Landau, individuals’ creations and discoveries are protected by indigenous categories of <i>hasagat gevul</i> (unfair economic competition) and <i>zeh nehene ve-zeh haser</i> (loosely translated as “unjust enrichment”) rather than any copyright doctrines such as property rights. Similarly, pirating a novel culinary dish conceptually matches R. Tennebaum and R. Landau’s cases, and would therefore find redress on similar grounds.
At first glance, given that the damage was only indirect (<i>grama</i>), and there is a ruling that “one who causes indirect damage is exempt from responsibility” (“<i>grama be-nezikin patur</i>”),<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 60a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 22b.</i> one might assume that <i>Nitva</i> is exempt from compensating the <i>Tove’a</i> for his losses. According to most authorities, an action is considered to be a direct cause of damage (“<i>garmi</i>”) if the damage caused is instantaneous and inevitable (“<i>bari hezeka</i>”), such as one who destroys someone’s note of indebtedness. However, if the damage is not inevitable or instantaneous, the damage is labeled <i>grama</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 22b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 9:17. Such a conclusion may be inferred from <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 140; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 4, <i>HM</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot le-Horot Natan</i> 3:99.</i>
However, it should be noted that there is an authoritative opinion, albeit in variance with the majority view, that there really is no distinguishing characteristic between <i>garmi</i> and <i>grama</i> actions. According to this view, for punitive purposes, i.e., <i>kenas</i>, Hazal classified usual and frequent injuries as <i>garmi</i>, and unusual and infrequent injuries as <i>grama</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 386:3; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 386:10.</i> The underlying reason for attaching responsibility is to deter individuals from harming their fellow men.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">See supra <i>Rema</i>, n. 12; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 386:20.</i> In this view, the ground for responsibility would be that piracy is an act of <i>hezek</i>, i.e,. damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 12; <i>Levush Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 15.</i> Alternatively, deriving benefit from someone else’s asset is akin to theft, and therefore one must pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 371:10.</i>
Given that the panel was unfamiliar with the culinary industry, and pursuant to the requirements of secular arbitration law,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Domke on Commercial Arbitration</i>, 3rd ed., 29:13.</i> the panel hired an independent investigator of the industry in order to ascertain whether cuisine is frequently copied in the culinary industry or whether our case is an isolated incident. Based upon the testimony of the professional expert, as well as the findings in the trade literature,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">See Cunningham, supra n. 6, at 22–24.</i> the <i>beit din</i> concluded that such occurrences are commonplace. As such, pursuant to this position, we awarded <i>Tove’a</i> damages for the unjust enrichment<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">The implicit assumption is that <i>zeh nehene ve-zeh haser</i>, wherein one individual benefits and in the process economically harms another, one is obligated to pay, similar to any <i>mazik</i>. See <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i> in the name of <i>Rambam</i>, supra n. 12; <i>Levush Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 15:8–11.</i> and harm incurred by unfair competition.
<b>2. Protecting a Novel Dish as a <i>Tenai</i> of the Non-Disclosure Agreement</b>
One of the terms of the non-compete agreement is the following non-disclosure provision:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Employee acknowledges that it is essential to the success of the Employer that the business and the affairs of the Employer be kept in the strictest confidence. Employee shall not at any time disclose to any person any information (financial or otherwise) relating … to the business or relating to any trade secrets of the Employer, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, customer lists, information relating to costs, information relating to present and contemplated services and products such as menus, recipes, dish presentations etc …</span>
Should we view the agreement to preempt the <i>Nitva</i>’s use of the cuisine and/or dish preparations as a <i>tenai</i> (i.e., a condition) of any future employment in the industry, such a condition gives rise to the following issues: (1) <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i> (something which is not yet in existence); (2) <i>davar she-ein bo mamash</i> (something lacking physical property).
Regarding the new food creation, it did not exist at the time of the signing of this agreement. Consequently, though certain recipes and dish preparations were in existence at the commencement of the <i>Nitva</i>’s employment, and are therefore in the category of <i>davar she-ba la-olam</i>, this new dish, which was developed subsequent to the agreement, would be labeled as <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>. On the one hand, such a <i>tenai</i> would be effective only regarding items that existed at the time of the signing of the agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 209:12; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 209:8.</i> On the other hand, the condition would be ineffective regarding the recipe that was developed subsequent to the signing of the agreement. This conclusion is contingent upon the fact that the <i>Nitva</i> would own these recipes and dish preparations. Given that at the time of the signing of the agreement, these items were not in existence, <i>Nitva</i> can therefore never assert ownership over them. However, if he <i>obligates</i> himself to refrain from misappropriating these items, then Halakha recognizes this obligation even regarding instances of items that will surface at a future date.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 95:10 in the name of <i>Rema</i>; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 18; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 209:4. For the identical reasoning in validating a promissory note, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 246.</i> Therefore, <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to receive compensation for his loss.
Clearly, a <i>tenai</i> which entails a new dish meets the tangibility requirements<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">See infra text accompanying nn. 29 and 31. This conclusion is predicated upon two facts: that the word “shall” in the agreement is a term of obligation, and that a <i>kinyan</i> was executed. In the absence of either requirement, the agreement would be validated as a <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a commercial form of undertaking an obligation), which is effective regarding something not yet in existence.</i> and therefore is a <i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>. As such, the <i>tenai</i> is valid and <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to receive compensation for his loss.
<b>3. The Validity of Undertaking an Obligation Not to Compete</b>
According to the Halakha of obligations, i.e., <i>hit’hayivut</i>, in order for an agreement to be legally effective, certain language must be utilized in the agreement. For example, the use of language such as “I obligate myself to pay John Doe such and such,” “I undertake to pay … ,” “I am obligated to pay … ,” or “I admit that I am obligated to pay John Doe such and such,” are all terms of undertaking an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:13; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:173; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 29.</i> The common denominator of these different terms of accepting a commitment is that the person is being <i>meshabed nafshei</i>, i.e., “committing himself” <i>now</i>, by transforming himself into a debtor now. Consequently, a promise to give an object that entails a future action has no legal validity.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>kinyan devarim hu</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:1.</i>
One of the terms of the non-compete agreement is the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Employee hereby covenants and agrees that he shall not for a period of five (5) years following departure from Employer’s employ, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever including, without limitation, or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any person, as agent or shareholder, or in any other capacity, carry on or be engaged in such a business in the Orthodox Jewish commercial neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</span>
The aforesaid provision provides that in the future (“shall”) the <i>Nitva</i> will not open up a competitive business for a period of five years. In terms of <i>hilkhot hit’hayivut</i>, such an undertaking fails to be binding for two reasons. Firstly, in the absence of being <i>meshabed nafshei</i> now, one cannot endow a commitment that will occur in the future with halakhic validity. Moreover, one cannot obligate oneself to refrain from engaging in a certain conduct, i.e., to abstain from opening up a competitive business.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 278; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:87, 3:20; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:94; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:31; <i>Teshuvot Tosafot Re’em</i> (Taubes) 3:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 274; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> 1, <i>HM</i> 31; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:582; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 582; <i>Teshuvot Erek Shai</i> 205; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:18; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:6; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 209; Zalman N. Goldberg, “The Definition of Religious in a Contract” (Hebrew), 17 <i>Tehumin</i> 181 (5758).<br>Had the agreement stated, “If I open up a competing enterprise, I obligate myself now to pay you,” the <i>Nitva</i> would have been responsible. See <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 114–115; <i>Sma</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:18; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:24; <i>Divrei Hayyim</i>, op. cit.</i> To effectively undertake an obligation, there must be an immediate <i>halot</i>. Namely, for a <i>hit’hayivut</i> (and, for that matter, for a transfer of ownership) to be effective, it must be predicated upon a <i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>, i.e., something that is tangible, possessing height, width, and depth.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>R. Hai Gaon</i>, <i>Mekach u-Memkar</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 2; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 22:13. This rule of tangibility applies equally to undertaking obligations such as partnership agreements or employment agreements. See See <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1, 3; <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 3a, s.v. “<i>ve-khi</i>.”</i> Obligating oneself to do something or to refrain from doing something are illustrations of a <i>davar she-ein bo mamash</i>. Hence, this agreement’s provision is ineffective in obligating the <i>Nitva</i> to refrain from opening a business.
Nonetheless, given that the (albeit improperly drafted) non-compete agreement was a condition of his employment, we can speak of “a meeting of the minds” regarding the impermissibility to open a competitive enterprise, and therefore the agreement is effective. And, in fact, in accordance with certain authorities,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 9; <i>Teshuvot Perakh Mateh Aharon</i> 1:14.</i> one Israeli <i>beit din</i> validated a non-compete agreement for this reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:336.</i> Alternatively, since this condition was a clause ensconced in his former employment agreement and in exchange for his agreement to be employed and carry out this condition (as well as others) he received wages, he is obligated to comply with the condition.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mateh Aharon</i>, supra n. 33, at 13–14; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> vol. 1, <i>HM</i> 2; <i>PDR</i>, supra n. 33, at 344. Cf. others who contend that one cannot contract a salary with an employee that entails abstaining from an action. See <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sehirut</i> 18.</i> Thirdly, should an individual benefit from what another individual gave him in exchange for refraining from acting in a certatin fashion, he is obligated to comply with this <i>tenai</i> (condition).<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 280. In effect, Rivash agrees with other decisors who claim that one can undertake a personal obligation to abstain from certain behavior. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:18. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 33 who concurs with Rivash’s posture, albeit for a different reason.</i> Finally, assuming civil law will recognize the employment of the word “shall” as denoting an obligation, then Halakha will recognize this agreement as a “<i>kinyan situmta</i>” and it is therefore valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 42; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:15; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:5.</i>
In short, in addition to infractions in the form of unfair competition and unjust enrichment, the <i>Nitva</i>’s piracy of the cuisine and dish presentations were in violation of a <i>tenai</i> memorialized in the non-compete agreement, which proscribed the <i>Nitva</i> from misappropriating the <i>Tove’a</i>’s cuisine and dish arrangements. As such, damages will be awarded.
<b>4. The Application of <i>Hasagat Gevul</i></b>
Even in the absence of a non-compete agreement, we need to examine whether the <i>Nitva</i> is subject to certain restraints based upon the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>hasagat gevul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">For a contemporary application, see <i>PDR</i> 3:336, 4:200.</i> As Talmud states,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 21b.</i>

<b>5. The Legal Enforceability of the Non-Compete Agreement</b>
One of the provisions of the non-compete agreement is the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll">In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement to be unenforceable in whole or in part, including without limitation as to duration and/or territory, the parties hereby direct the court to reduce the scope of such provision to that which is reasonable in the circumstances.</span>
Since the aforementioned term of the agreement has been mutually agreed upon by the parties, generally a <i>beit din</i> must address whether the agreement which was executed in Wisconsin and deals with a Wisconsin business entity, is legally enforceable in a secular court, or whether it would be as a violation of federal law<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">15 USC section 2.</i> or state law, or contrary to public policy.
Generally speaking, in common law systems, restrictive covenants are unenforceable. Nonetheless, a non-compete agreement is an exception to the rule provided that the agreement mandates the minimal degree of conduct to protect the employer’s business interest, the restraint does not incur undue hardship upon the employee, and the restraint is not contrary to the public interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">E. Farnsworth, <i>Contracts</i>, 5.3 (1982).</i> Additionally, Wisconsin law requires that an agreement must provide a reasonable territorial limit and time limit.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Wisconsin Statute, Section 103.465 (2007–2008);</i> These requirements have been examined in Wisconsin case law.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>State Arms Gun Co. v.

In light of the fact that this panel did not award any monies to the <i>Tove’a</i> relating to <i>Nitva</i>’s entry into the marketplace, we may abstain from deciding whether we need to scrutinize the non-compete agreement from a secular legal perspective and the circumstances serving as the grounds for an arbitration award.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Whether we would examine this matter from a secular viewpoint would be dependent on whether we recognize that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is applicable in dealing with non-compete agreements.</i>

d) Promises! Promises! The Validity of a Real Estate Binder Agreement

<b>D. Promises! Promises! – The Validity of a Real Estate Binder Agreement</b>
<b>Facts</b>
A real estate binder agreement was signed by the parties regarding the purchase of a property in New Jersey. As memorialized in the agreement, certain conditions, such as ten-day attorney review, would have to be complied with prior to drafting the real estate contract. The parties agreed that the conditions had been obtained. However, the buyer (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>) subsequently withdrew his offer to purchase the property. The matter was submitted to <i>beit din</i> for resolution.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
Admittedly, no detailed contract of sale was executed between the parties. Nevertheless, the seller (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>) argues that their real estate binder agreement should be viewed maximally as a preliminary agreement where the conditions had been obtained and therefore should be binding. Moreover, upon compliance with the conditions in the agreement, and relying upon <i>Nitva</i>’s readiness to execute the purchase, the <i>Tove’a</i> purchased another piece of real estate that was underwritten by a mortgage. The <i>Tove’a</i> claims that he does not have the financial wherewithal to own two pieces of real estate simultaneously and that he is incurring financial losses. Consequently, <i>Nitva</i>’s decision to withdraw his offer to purchase the property has caused him financial harm, and <i>Nitva</i> should therefore be responsible to compensate for his losses. Finally, unable to purchase some securities due to the breach of the promise, <i>Tove’a</i> contends that <i>Nitva</i> ought to be responsible for <i>Tove’a</i>’s failure to profit from anticipated securities investment.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s arguments, <i>Nitva</i> claims that the agreement to purchase was at best only a promise that contemplated the signing of a more detailed formal contract. Therefore, even though all the conditions of the agreement were obtained, he nevertheless had the option to withdraw from the deal and lose the earnest money, i.e., the money that serves as a security deposit to hold the property for the purchaser. Moreover, he never thought that the deal would fall through and therefore never contemplated that he would have to pay the earnest money. Furthermore, the fact that <i>Tove’a</i> undertook certain financial commitments that he cannot meet and that <i>Tove’a</i> failed to profit from certain investments is not <i>Nitva</i>’s responsibility.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. Does a Real Estate Binder Agreement Constitute a Halakhically <i>Bona Fide</i> Offer to Purchase Property or Not?</b>
Conventionally, upon reaching an oral agreement regarding the purchase of real estate, both parties sign a broker-prepared real estate binder that is subject to attorney review. The binder specifies the buyer and seller, and describes the property being sold. The agreement is an offer to purchase this real estate under certain conditions under which the seller would be willing to sell the property. These conditions include the specific purchase price, inspection, property conditions, and financing arrangements. These conditions are contingencies that allow the potential purchaser to walk away from the agreement if all of the conditions are not met by the purchase date. The agreement was signed by both parties and was accompanied by earnest money. If the seller accepts the offer, the earnest money is held in escrow. When the transaction is finalized, the deposit is applied to the buyer’s costs. If the offer is rejected, the earnest money is returned to the buyer, since no binding contract has been executed. Should all the conditions be met and the potential buyer withdraw his offer, he loses his deposit. Though the agreement contemplates the possibility of the parties signing off on a formal written contract, nevertheless by signing this retainer agreement, the parties are obligating themselves to finalize the sale contingent upon certain conditions being satisfied. As the real estate binder agreement states, it is “an offer to purchase.”
<b>A. Is it a Halakhically Binding <i>Hit’hayivut</i> in Terms of the <i>Halakhot</i> of <i>Hi’yuvim</i>?</b>
This agreement will be examined from two diametrically opposed perspectives: the offer to purchase as a halakhically binding <i>hit’hayivut</i>, obligation, and as a halakhically binding agreement based upon civil law.
From the perspective of the rules of <i>hit’hayivut</i>, a real estate binder, which entails an offer to purchase, is an obligation between parties to behave in a certain manner in the future, which has been characterized by the Talmud as a <i>kinyan devarim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 3a, s.v. “<i>kinyan devarim</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3.</i> For a <i>bona fide hit’hayivut</i>, there is a requirement that the matter be “<i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>” (something with substance). An offer to purchase is a promise at a future date rather than a “<i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>.” Additionally, one cannot undertake an obligation if it is a “<i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>,” something not yet in existence.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 210:1. Though generally one is precluded from transferring ownership of an asset that is not yet in existence, nonetheless, if you employ the words, “I obligate myself to sell” and you execute a <i>kinyan</i>, a symbolic way to undertake a commitment, the agreement is valid. See <i>Sefer ha-Terumot</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 64: 2 (1–3); <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:24, 26; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:18; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 206:5; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i>, <i>HM</i> 26; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:26; <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sasson</i> 133; <i>Imrei Bina</i>, <i>Hilkhot Halva’ah</i> 51. In other words, though ownership of the asset has not been transferred, nevertheless there exists an obligation upon the seller to sell the asset to the buyer, an obligation that is enforceable in a <i>beit din</i>. Consequently, for example, if language of <i>hit’hayivut</i> was employed in an agreement accompanied by the execution of a proper <i>kinyan</i> regarding the purchase of a parcel of land or a house without registering the property as required by secular law, there remains an obligation upon the seller to follow through with the sale of the property by complying with the legal requirements. See <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 264; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:55.<br>In other words, the seller is not required to articulate a <i>shi’abud ha-guf</i>, to undertake personal responsibility to comply with his duty. In other words, the seller’s assets are not required to serve as a guarantee that should the sale fail to materialize, he would be responsible to pay for breaching the agreement. See <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 39:17, 60:7, 203:6; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 28; <i>Teshuvot R. Bezalel Ashkenazi</i> 11; <i>Imrei Yosher</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>HM</i> 30. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 69, 81; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 203:2, 206:1; <i>PDR</i> 14:334.<br>Whether undertaking an obligation to sell preempts the possibility that the person can sell the property to a third person is subject to debate. See <i>Mahara Sasson</i>, op. cit.; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, op. cit.</i> One cannot transfer ownership of a property that would be purchased in the future. Again, the obligation is predicated upon a <i>halot</i>, a legal status of something that has a physical property. The <i>halot</i> condition is not obtained with a property that is being offered for purchase at a future date.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 13:20; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 209:6. Others view undertaking an obligation of a <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i> as expressing the absence of <i>gemirat da’at</i>, firm resolve to undertake the obligation. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 66b.</i> In short, even if the conditions as set out in the binder agreement were met, refusal of the <i>Nitva</i> to follow up with the sale of the property cannot be enforced by a <i>beit din</i>.
Nonetheless, <i>Nitva</i> has a halakhic-moral duty to keep his word to purchase the property. The consequences of reneging upon a promise are stated in Shulhan Arukh and Rema in the following fashion:<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:7; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:11.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When one conducts and concludes commercial transactions using words only (without a formal act of acquisition), that person should stand by his word, even though none of the purchase price has been taken, nor a buyer’s mark made on the goods … Whoever withdraws from this type of transaction, whether buyer or seller, is deemed a faithless person.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Rema</i>: a person should stand by his word even though no act of acquisition has been performed, and only mere words have passed between the parties …</span>
Where no payment has been made, and the seller articulates an oral commitment to sell real estate (<i>karka</i>) or chattel (<i>metaltelin</i>) to a prospective buyer, and should either party renege on the agreement of sale, he is stigmatized as a <i>mehusar amana</i> (lit. “lacking trustworthiness”). Given that no <i>kinyan</i>, a symbolic act undertaking an obligation, has been executed between the parties, technically either party may withdraw from consummating the sale. Compliance with the promise is unenforceable. Enforceability depends upon the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>. Nevertheless, the individual who reneges from his commitment may be labeled a transgressor (<i>avaryan</i>) and publicly shamed by the community,<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 1:160; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 204:11 (in the name of <i>Ranah</i>).</i> and has violated minimally a rabbinic <i>issur</i><sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:118. Cf. others who argue that he has violated a biblical <i>issur</i>. See <i>Pnei Yehoshua</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 86a in the name of <i>Rashi</i>; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 451; <i>Sma</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:12; <i>Minhat Pe’tim</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:11.</i> provided that the parties mutually agreed upon the selling price of the item.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 49a, s.v. “<i>gamru</i>”; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 189.</i> This conclusion applies even if the promise is memorialized in a written agreement that does not comply with certain formal requirements,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">(Not necessarily all of the requirements.)</i> such as a promise to pay for a “<i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>” (something not yet in existence) or the absence of a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:38; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 209:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 4:66; <i>Minhat Pe’tim</i>, <i>HM</i> 209.</i> In short, absent a halakhically enforceable obligation, the <i>beit din</i> will not enforce his halakhic-<i>moral</i> duty to comply with his promise. Consequently, in terms of <i>hilkhot hi’yuvim</i>, <i>Nitva</i> would lose his security deposit.
<b>B. Is This Halakhically Binding as a <i>Kinyan Situmta</i>?</b>
According to the majority of <i>Poskim</i>, a contract that entails the sale of real estate will be recognized by dint of the fact that this is the commercial practice for transferring ownership from one person to another. In halakhic parlance, this is known as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>. This type of contract has been recognized for centuries and in contemporary times, provided it is valid and enforceable in the eyes of secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 13:21; <i>Teshuvot Tzmach Tzedek</i> (Schneerson), <i>YD</i> 233; <i>Teshuvot Nehar Afarsemon</i>, <i>HM</i> 15; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 26; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>HM</i> 41; <i>PDR</i> 6:202; <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 2:53.<br>For the requirement that the agreement must comport with secular law, see <i>PDR</i> 12:279; <i>Ateret Devora</i> 2:40.</i> In the absence of a signed contract, many <i>Poskim</i> have recognized the agreement as “an obligation to sell and purchase,” which would be enforceable by a <i>beit din</i> rather than as a contractual obligation to actually transfer property ownership.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 4:275, 279, 6:202, 216, 14:43, 70, 18:354, 360.</i> In other words, for the property to be transferred, the agreement must be a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, namely, recognized as legally effective by New York law.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabia v. Mattituck Inlet Mar. &amp; Shipyard, Inc</i>. 24 AD 3d 178 (2005); <i>Bonilla v. Rotter</i>, 2007 NY Slip Op. 449, NY Appellate Div., 1st Dept. 2007.</i>
The question is whether a real estate binder agreement, which is an offer to purchase, is viewed as a halakhically <i>bona fide</i> contract, like a real estate sale contract. If it has the same status as any real estate contract, then if the conditions have been obtained as outlined in the binder agreement, the seller is obligated to sell and the buyer is obligated to purchase. Halakhically, whether a real estate binder agreement is binding upon the parties depends on whether the locale in which this preliminary agreement was entered has a common <i>minhag</i> (custom) of accepting the validity of such documents. If so, one may conclude that it is binding based on <i>kinyan situmta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 66; <i>Teshuvot Maharasham</i> 6:113; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:79<i>.</i> The assumption is that a <i>kinyan situmta</i> is effective even <i>for davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:153; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 2:39; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>HM</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:26; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 66; <i>Teshuvot Sefer Yehoshua</i> 114; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:37. Cf. <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 201:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 201, <i>Hiddushin</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i> 134.<br>Whether there is an additional requirement of <i>shi’abud nekhasim</i>, namely that a person’s property serves as a guarantor by the promisor (in our case, the seller) to create a halakhically legal obligation is subject to debate. See supra n. 2. For further discussion, see <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:9.<br>Others contend that it is a “<i>hit’hayivut</i>,” i.e., the undertaking of an obligation to finalize the agreement, rather than the actual finalization of an agreement. For an analysis of both viewpoints, see <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Mishpat</i>, <i>HM</i> 36.</i> For the <i>minhag</i> to be efficacious there is a threshold requirement that it must be widespread and practiced at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 163:3, 331:1; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1. Others argue that it must transpire on a daily basis. See <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 61.</i> In effect, frequently the <i>minhag</i> is reflective of the governing civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 82; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:132; <i>Teshuvot Nediv Lev</i> (David Hazan) 12; <i>Teshuvot Nediv Lev</i> (Eliezer Hazan) 13; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:111; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Avraham</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Oholei Tam</i> 202; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yisrael</i> (Landau) 172; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 1:10; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:143; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> 3:28; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:72, 75.<br>Another (albeit minority) opinion rejects the effectiveness of the commercial practice to legitimate a <i>kinyan</i> for the following reason: Since a binder agreement was signed so that it will be enforceable in civil court, the signing was done involuntarily, and therefore, such a <i>kinyan</i> is invalid. In other words, adoption of a <i>minhag</i> must be undertaken voluntarily. Given that this practice of recognizing a preliminary agreement is grounded in law, and one of the aspects of law is its “coercive nature,” the law cannot serve as the basis of the <i>minhag</i> regarding the recognition of a <i>kinyan</i> grounded in commercial practice<i>.</i> See R. Zalman N. Goldberg’s opinion in <i>PDR</i> 12:279.</i>
Alternatively, R. Hayyim Rapaport observes, the norms of secular law determine the expectations of the parties (i.e., <i>umdana</i>) with respect to the binding nature of an agreement, and if the parties expect an agreement to be binding, then they are bound to its provisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mayyim Hayyim</i> cited by <i>Pithei Teshuva</i> HM 207:3. For an identical approach, see <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i>, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 23:2; Clearly, <i>Hazon Ish</i> would argue that one cannot validate a contractual agreement based upon civil law. See <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i>, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:11.</i>
Finally, in the absence of a <i>minhag</i> or an <i>umdana</i>, Talmud, as well as most authorities, validates a preliminary agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avoda Zara</i> 72a; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 206:1; <i>Rema</i>, ad locum.; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>YD</i> 48; <i>Tiv Kidushin</i> 50:17; <i>Teshuvot ha-Bah</i> 10; <i>Teshuvot Beit Shmuel Aharon</i>, <i>EH</i> 12; <i>PDR</i> 9:16, 40, 18:29, 31. For additional authorities, see <i>Otzar ha-Poskim</i>, <i>EH</i> 50 (44:3).<br>At first glance, it would seem that this conclusion stands in contradiction to <i>Taz</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:12; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum 15; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>Tinyana</i> 75, and others who argue that the preliminary agreement (referred to in rabbinic Hebrew as “<i>rashei perakim</i>” or in modern Hebrew as “<i>zihron devarim</i>”), similar to the document titled <i>tena’im</i> (conditions) which is signed at the time of an engagement to marry, is subject to a party’s rescission. But in fact, in this instance, the parties’ intention is to bind themselves to the actual document memorializing the <i>tena’im</i> rather than the preliminary agreement to the <i>tena’im.</i> Alternatively, the reason for the <i>tena’im</i> agreement is to remember what was was mutually agreed upon. Consequently, even those authorities would concur that a conventional preliminary agreement with the intent to be bound by the terms is valid.</i>
In our case, the <i>minhag</i> or <i>umdana</i> regarding the expectation of the parties can be ascertained by an inquiry into the common commercial practice and secular law governing the acceptance of preliminary agreements. New Jersey case law validates such preliminary agreements under the following condition: The question is whether the parties intended to be bound at the time they reached an oral or written preliminary agreement, or only at the time the formal contract was signed. Assuming, upon scrutiny of the facts, that the intent of the parties was to be bound with the signing of the real estate binder agreement, the parties are considered to be “under contract” for the real estate sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Comerata v.

To state our conclusion somewhat differently, even though the binder agreement neither comports with the requirements of a <i>hit’hayivut</i> nor complies with the technical requirements that the paper and ink of the agreement must belong to the Seller,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 20b–21a; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 191:1; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov</i>, <i>HM</i> 42.</i> nevertheless it is enforceable based upon <i>kinyan situmta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Should the Seller fail to provide the <i>shtar</i> and the ink, and should civil law fail to enforce the agreement, Halakha will refuse to validate the sale.

In our scenario, we are dealing with a binder agreement that is an example of a preliminary agreement regarding a price to purchase a specific piece of property. Given that the conditions of the binder agreement were obtained, the buyer’s decision to renege on his commitment has halakhic as well as legal consequences, namely that <i>Nitva</i> loses his security deposit.
Seemingly, given that <i>Nitva</i> did not expect to pay the security deposit, the transaction lacks the requisite <i>gemirat da’at</i>, a commitment that was made with firm intent to remit the earnest money. To state it differently, this transaction is characterized as an <i>asmakhta</i> – an agreement that lacks a presumption of firm resolve on the part of the obligator. The possibility that the purchase would fail to materialize never entered the <i>Nitva</i>’s mind, thus the contract is void, <i>ab initio</i>.
Nonetheless, if the commercial practice is to establish such a penalty, then we presume that one did intend to follow through and pay the monies should the contract fail to materialize.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 66a; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:6; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Enzel</i> 1:12; <i>PDR</i> 5:258, 270, 14:334.</i> For example, in return for a premium payment, an insurance company promises to reimburse the insured for the loss. Given that such an arrangement reflects common commercial practice, <i>asmakhta</i> will not be a factor invalidating the insurance contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, <i>HM</i> 34.</i> Similarly, the requirement of a security deposit upon signing a binder agreement is common practice in the real estate and therefore does not run afoul of the strictures of <i>asmakhta</i>.
On the other hand, based upon the fact that the agreement was subject to attorney review, the intent of the parties was not to be bound by the real estate binder agreement.
<b>2. <i>Nezikin</i> Claims Due to Reliance upon Promise</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>A. </i>Tove’a<i>’s Undertaking the Purchase of a Second Home</i></span>
Relying upon <i>Nitva</i>’s readiness to execute the purchase, the <i>Tove’a</i> purchased another piece of real estate that was underwritten by a mortgage. The <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he does not have the financial wherewithal to own two pieces of real estate simultaneously and is incurring financial losses. Consequently, <i>Nitva</i>’s decision to withdraw his offer to purchase the property has caused him a financial loss and therefore <i>Nitva</i> should be responsible to compensate for his damages.
Rambam states,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 6:24</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My teachers have ruled that if it is the custom of the land that each man (when betrothed) should make a feast for his friends or distribute money to the religious functionaries of the community, and he follows the custom of all people and then she retracts, she must refund his expenses, because she caused him to spend his money; and whoever causes another to lose money must pay for it.</span>
In a critical annotation on this ruling, Ra’avad demurs,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">… . I do not concur with his teachers regarding this matter. That indirect causation is akin to seeds in the garden that did not grow, regarding which one pays (only) the expenses. The principle of the matter is: loss of money committed by the owner of the money, even though someone else caused him (to incur the loss), that person is exempt from liability.</span>
In other words, whereas according to Rambam, breach of a promise to marry is actionable, according to the Ra’avad, damages are not recoverable. Consequently, some authorities contend that <i>Tove’a</i>’s ability to recover losses incurred by undertaking to acquire a second home is dependent whether one endorses the view of Rambam or of Ra’avad.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Berakh Moshe</i> (Galante) 5; <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 134.</i> While a minority of <i>Poskim</i> agrees with Ra’avad, most authorities, including Shulhan Arukh, concur with the position of Rambam.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:3; <i>Otzar ha-Poskim</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:3, sections 24–26.</i> Among the reasons for requiring <i>nezikin</i> (tort) liability suggested by the <i>Poskim</i> is the immediacy and direct nature of the harm (<i>bari hezeka</i>) and the injured party’s reliance upon the <i>mazik</i> (tortfeasor).<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>EH</i> 50, s.v. “<i>katav</i>”; <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i> 386:1; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i>, <i>EH</i> 68:20; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, supra n. 24; <i>PDR</i> 3:18, 31.</i>
Applying Rambam’s position to our scenario, clearly there is direct link between the <i>Nitva</i>’s failure to keep his promise and the <i>Tove’a</i>’s decision to embark on the purchase of a second property. In fact, <i>Tove’a</i> should have realized that a formal written contract had to be prepared and accepted by <i>Nitva</i> prior to arriving at the conclusion that this was “a done deal.” If someone promises another that he will do something for him, and relying upon this assurance, he expends monies, and subsequently the promisor retracted his offer, Maharik and Sefer ha-Mikneh conclude that the promisee must sustain the loss due to the fact that he should have contemplated that the promisor may change his mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 133:2; <i>Sefer ha-Mikneh</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 50; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 242:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 121.</i> Similarly, in our case, <i>Tove’a</i> should have foreseen the possibility that the deal may fall through, a frequent occurrence in real estate matters.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>B. </i>“Mevatel Kiso shel Haveiro” <i>–</i> Tove’a<i>’s Inability to Fund a Securities Investment</i></span>
Unable to purchase some securities due to the breach of the promise, <i>Tove’a</i> contends that <i>Nitva</i> ought to be responsible for <i>Tove’a</i>’s failure to profit from anticipated securities investment.
Assuming <i>Nitva</i> undertook the obligation to assume the losses and provided that the obligation does not run afoul of <i>asmakhta</i> by undertaking an obligation that is exaggerated, such an agreement would be valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 104a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 104a; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 9:4,7; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 328:1.</i> Some <i>Poskim</i> require that the agreement be in writing.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Rid</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 104a; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 328.</i>
Absent the <i>Nitva</i> undertaking an obligation, the fact remains that if the <i>Tove’a</i> relied upon the fact that his losses would be covered, <i>Nitva</i> would be responsible. Responding to the <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim, the Talmud Bavli teaches us,<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If someone gives money to his friend to serve as his agent to go and purchase wine for him during the season when the price is low, and the servant was negligent and failed to buy it, he must pay him for the wine at the low price.</span>
In our case, the promise (<i>Tove’a</i>) relied upon the promisor (<i>Nitva</i>) and incurred a loss. The Talmud concludes that <i>Nitva</i> is responsible to compensate for the losses that were suffered.
The rationale for compensation expounded upon by Ra’ah is the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva ha-Hadashim</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b. Though numerous decisors identify the authorship of this position with R. Yom Tov ben Avraham Ishbili, known by the acronym “Ritva,” in fact Ritva is citing his teacher, Ra’ah. The text identifies the view with “<i>mori ha-rav</i>” (i.e., his rabbinical teacher). Ritva’s use of this appellation refers to Ra’ah. See Yitzhak Brand, “<i>Ha-Nosei ve-Notain be-Devarim</i>: Between Contractual Obligation &amp; Tortuous Reliance” (Hebrew), 24 <i>Mehkarei Mishpat</i>, 55, nn. 107, 122–124 (5768) and this writer’s, “The Role of Detrimental Reliance in the Law of Obligations: A Comparative Analysis,” in Volume in Memory of Menachem Elon (forthcoming).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Here (Bava Metzia 73b), even though the agent did not contractually agree to assume liability [for failure to fulfill his promise], since the principal gave him money with which to purchase merchandise, and the principal would have either purchased it himself or arranged for another to do so had not the agent promised to do so, and the principal relied upon him and gave him the money based upon the reliance, for that reason the agent is liable to pay the loss caused by the reliance on his promise.</span>
As explained elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s “The Theory of Efficient Breach: A Jewish Law Perspective” in <i>The Oxford Handbook of Judaism and Economics</i>, ed. Aaron Levine, Oxford, 2010, 340, 347–348.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Ra’ah’s position contains four propositions. The first is that one does not require an agreement that explicitly stipulates that consequential damages are recoverable. The second proposition is that in the absence of such agreement, by giving money to the agent to effectuate a wine purchase at a location where the selling price was lower than others, the promisee relied upon the promisor’s compliance. The third proposition is that the words of the promisor serve as the act of inducing reliance by the promise. Moreover, in the context of Ra’ah’s posture more importantly, it is the <i>be-hahi hana’a</i> (i.e., because of the benefit created by the induced reliance that establishes a surety relationship between the two parties) he undertakes the obligation, and therefore the promise becomes halakhically binding upon the promisor and enforceable in a case of breach.”<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Barukh Kahane, <i>Arevut</i>, Yerushalayim, 1998, 78–90. In order to be granted relief, some <i>Poskim</i> require that the profit loss must be clear and definite. See <i>Ra’vyah</i> cited by <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 125; <i>Sefer Ra’vyah</i>, Deblitsky ed., No. 957; <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 69a, s.v. “<i>pirshu</i>”; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 183:1; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 178; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 22:2.</i></span>
It is the halakhic norm of an <i>arevut</i>, i.e., a guarantee, rather that the halakhic norm of promise keeping, which endows validity to the agreement. Conventionally, should the borrower default on his loan, the <i>arev</i> undertakes the obligation to pay the lender. Here, we are applying the institution of <i>arevut</i> in a non-loan transaction in order to transform a promissory obligation into a halakhically-legally enforceable duty. The breach of the promissory obligation is contingent upon the fact that the promisor induced someone to rely on his promise. Just as a guarantor’s obligation to compensate is created by the trust that is engendered by the creditor’s conviction that the guarantor will compensate him in case of a borrower’s default upon a loan, analogously, should an individual be negligent and fail to purchase wine at a lower price for another person as he promised, akin to an <i>arev</i> he is liable to indemnify him for any ensuing loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 6b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 7a; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 370; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 181; <i>Imrei Yosher</i>, supra n. 2; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 209:32; <i>Derisha</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:2; Kahane, supra n. 35 at 6, 441<i>.</i></i> Since the Ra’ah’s time, there are a few authorities who subscribed to his approach of a promissory obligation based on detrimental reliance grounded in <i>hilkhot arevut</i> and awarded damages for a loss of profits.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’vyah</i>, supra n. 35; <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Shita Mekubezet</i> on <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 176:31, 183:1, 304:2, 306:6, 333:14; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:86; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, <i>EH</i> 407; <i>Teshuvot Even Shetiya</i> 79; <i>Teshuvot Har ha-Carmel</i>, <i>HM</i> 10; <i>Divrei Geonim</i> 96:47; <i>Teshuvot Panim Meirot</i> 1:82; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 3:15; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 22:1; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hayyim</i> 1:85; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 1:93; <i>Dibrot Moshe</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 2:503; <i>PDR</i> 3:18, 30, 17:289, 295.<br>Alternatively, damages for preclusion of profits are grounded in <i>nezikin</i>, i.e., torts. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen HM</i> 333:2.</i>
For most authorities, the compensation resulting from reliance upon the promise is due the fact that the <i>Nitva</i> explicitly agreed at the time of the agreement to reimburse the promisee for any harm resulting from failure to finalize the wine purchase. Reliance upon an oral promise without providing such a stipulation does not engender financial ­liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 73b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 5:69; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 114:115; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 308; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Shomerim</i> 8; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 176:31,183:1, 304:2, 306:6, 333:14; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 22:1; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, <i>HM</i> 176:4.</i> Hence, in our case, <i>Nitva</i> promised to buy the property without agreeing to reimburse for any loss resulting from breaking his promise and therefore should be exempt from any of <i>Tove’a</i>’s losses pertaining to his inability to invest in the securities market.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">This argument would equally apply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim for incurring financial losses due to purchasing a second home.</i>
Moreover, for many, where the profit is speculative such as investment in securities, there is no recovery for lost profits.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Ra’vyah</i> 957; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 183:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:399; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 151; <i>Teshuvot Maharash ha-Levi</i>, <i>EH</i> 5; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Gezela</i> 11; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 178; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 5:125.</i> As the Talmud Yerushalmi states,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yerushalmi</i> 9:3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Rabbi Yitzhak says: Someone who prevents his friend from making a profit (<i>mevatel kiso shel haveiro</i>) has only a grievance.</span>
Given that the preclusion of profit is illustrative of a case of <i>grama</i>, i.e., indirect harm, and one is exempt for such conduct, the injured party has no grounds for recovery.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:16.</i> Consequently, in our case, <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim to recover lost profits lacks foundation.
Finally, even for those <i>Poskim</i> who would subscribe to the Ra’ah’s position, his view is predicated upon engendered trust that caused the <i>Tove’a</i>, the seller, to rely upon the <i>Nitva</i>’s promise to purchase. But, <i>Tove’a</i> should have foreseen the possibility that the deal may fall through, a frequent occurrence in real estate matters, and he therefore should have refrained from undertaking other financial deals. To state it differently, there were no grounds for the <i>Tove’a</i> to rely upon the <i>Nitva</i>’s promise. It is a case of misplaced trust. Therefore, there is no foundation to the <i>Tove’a</i>’s claims to recoup any financial losses that were caused by his actions rather than driven by the <i>Nitva</i>’s promise.
<b>Decision</b>
1. <i>Nitva</i> loses his security deposit.
2. <i>Nitva</i> is not obligated to pay <i>Tove’a</i> the profit losses incurred by him.

e) Real Estate Brokerage Agreement

<b>E. Real Estate Brokerage Agreement</b>
<b>Facts</b>
In July 5, 2008, Levi Meyer (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>), a New Jersey licensed real estate broker, entered into an exclusive brokerage agreement, known professionally as a listing agreement, with Michael Miller (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>) for the sale of his property located at 9 Meadow Lane, Paramus, NJ. The expiration date of the agreement was January 23, 2009. Pursuant to the agreement, should <i>Tove’a</i> find a buyer, he would be entitled to a six percent commission. <i>Tove’a</i> found a ready, willing, and able buyer for the property, and <i>Nitva</i> accepted an offer from Fred Nevins to purchase the aforesaid property, only to later find out that Nevins withdrew his offer. Unbeknownst to <i>Tove’a</i>, Israel Levy, another broker, showed the property to a third party and subsequently, <i>Nitva</i> sold the property to the third party on February 29, 2009. Though <i>Nitva</i> paid Levy a commission for the sale, <i>Nitva</i> refused to remit a commission to <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b><i>Tove’a</i> Claims</b>
<i>Tove’a</i> argues that he is entitled to his commission for three reasons: (1) <i>Tove’a</i> found a ready, willing, and able buyer for <i>Nitva</i>; (2) Pursuant to the agreement, if said property is sold to a third party by anyone else, <i>Tove’a</i> remains entitled to receive commission; (3) Since the offer from Nevins was accepted by <i>Nitva</i>, and negotiations between the <i>Nitva</i> and Nevins extended beyond the expiration date of the listing agreement, therefore in accordance with the provisions of the listing agreement, the brokerage commitment is extended for an additional three months. Given that the sale to Levy transpired during this three month extension, <i>Tove’a</i> earns his commission.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Reply</b>
In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s claims, though there was a ready, willing, and able buyer to purchase his property, and Nevins’ offer was signed and accepted, nevertheless, since the prospective buyer failed to execute a contract for sale with <i>Nitva</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to a commission. Secondly, in pursuance of the terms of the agreement, if a third party brokers the sale, the <i>Tove’a</i> fails to receive his commission. Finally, even though Nevins and <i>Nitva</i> admittedly executed an acceptance offer, nonetheless, subsequently, prior to the lapse of the listing agreement, Nevins requested certain modifications concerning the terms of the sale and additions regarding the property, and <i>Nitva</i> notified Nevins that he no longer wanted to sell to Nevins.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. The Validity of the Listing Agreement: A <i>Bona Fide Shtar</i> or a <i>Kinyan Situmta</i>?</b>
The real estate agreement reads as follows:
<span class="poetry indentAll">… In consideration of a Broker’s listing and endeavoring to sell the property, Owner grants to Broker the exclusive right to sell the property at the price and upon the terms set forth herein or at such price or terms upon which Owner may agree …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Upon the procuring of a Purchaser of the property during the term of this listing, Owner agrees to pay a Broker a commission of six per cent of the selling price. Broker’s commission shall be considered earned if the sale of the property is effected by Broker, by Owner, or by any third party during the term of this listing …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The term of this listing shall be extended by the period of time commenced by the date that the Owner accepts any offer presented by Broker for the property and ended by the date that negotiations with respect to such offer terminate. If negotiations with respect to an accepted offer terminate after the listing termination date set forth above, then the term shall be further extended by a period of three months from the date that such negotiations terminate …</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This Agreement expresses the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof … shall be governed by New Jersey law …</span>
Both <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i> signed off on the real estate brokerage agreement.
According to the Halakha of obligations, i.e., <i>hit’hayivut</i>, in order for an agreement, including but not limited to a real estate agreement, to be halakhically effective, certain terminology must be utilized in the agreement. For example, the employment of the terminology, “the Owner undertakes to pay,” or “the Owner obligates himself to pay,” are terms of undertaking a financial commitment that would be enforceable in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:13; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:173; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 29.</i> Hence, employment of terminology in the listing such as, “Owner may agree” and “Owner agrees,” which entails a future activity, is in halakhic nomenclature, a “<i>kinyan devarim</i>” and has no enforceability.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>kinyan devarim</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Rama</i> (Abulafia) 249 found in <i>Orhot Tzadikim</i>, Warsaw, 5662; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:1; File no. 288409-5, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, April 10, 2013.</i>
Minimally this listing agreement is an example of a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, i.e., a mode of undertaking an obligation recognized in commercial practice. <i>Kinyan situmta</i> is not only recognized as a vehicle to transfer assets, i.e., <i>hakna’a</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a; <i>Teshuvot Tzmach Tzedek</i> (Schneersohn), <i>YD</i> 233; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:26; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i>, <i>HM</i> 41; <i>PDR</i> 6:202; <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 2:53.</i> such as a real estate contract, but also as a means for undertaking obligations, i.e., <i>hit’hayivut</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 66; <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1.</i> such as an employment contract or a business partnership agreement. A real estate brokerage agreement entails a <i>hit’hayivut</i> and is an example of one of the many contracts that is halakhically recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, <i>HM</i> 194:2; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:79; <i>PDR</i> 3:368, 4:279.</i> Its validity is predicated upon the fact that it has been legally drafted properly and is enforceable according to civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:279, 291, 18:108, 112; Ron Kleinman, “<i>Kinyan Situmta</i>: Commercial Practices Regarding Modes of <i>Kinyanim</i>” (Hebrew), 24 <i>Mehkarei Mishpat</i> 243, 286 (5768).</i> A review of the terms of this listing agreement shows that it has been written in proper legal form and will be enforceable in civil court.
Moreover, in accordance with this agreement, any questions regarding interpreting its terms are to be resolved by applicable New Jersey law. Lest one challenge the basis for resolving halakhic questions in accordance with civil law, the Talmud instructs us that the operative rule in the context of monetary affairs is that “an individual may stipulate contrary to what is written in the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b; <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 38:5; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:17, 305:4; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 344:1.</i> As such, since both the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i> agreed that any differences regarding the agreement are to be resolved by applying the norms of NJ law, their agreement is a private arrangement that Halakha recognizes. Halakha will therefore resolve the differences between the parties in accordance with the dictates of civil law.
We now proceed to ascertain how NJ law has addressed the issues emerging from this dispute. In our scenario, though the <i>Tove’a</i> had produced a prospective buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase in accordance with the terms set by <i>Nitva</i>, nevertheless, no binding contract of sale between the Owner and the prospective buyer had been finalized. Consequently, <i>Nitva</i> contends that he is exempt from paying a real estate commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
In the absence of a broker’s agreement to the contrary, some NJ courts rule that a broker earns his commission by producing a ready, willing, and able buyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Marschalk v. Weber</i>, 11 NJ Super. 16 (App. Div. 1950); <i>Blau v. Friedman</i>, 26 NJ 397, 401 (1958); <i>Beckmann Inc. v. Zinke’s Rainbow’s End, Inc.</i>, 40 NJ 193, 196 (App. Div.), certif. denied, 22 NJ 219 (1956); <i>Stanchak v. Cliffside Park</i>, 116 NJ Super. 471 (1971).</i> In the event that there is a provision in the listing agreement that the commission would be “remitted on closing” or “payable when the time passes,” such provision is to be understood as determining the time of the payment of the commission rather than as a prerequisite to the broker’s entitlement to the commission.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Klipper v. Schlossberg</i>, 96 NJ L 397, 401 (Sup. Ct. 1921); <i>J. R. Tucker, Inc. v. Mahaffey</i>, 6 NJ Misc. 17 (Sup. Ct. 1928).</i>
Accordingly, if a broker produces a ready, willing, and able purchaser who agrees to buy the property on mutually satisfactory terms with the seller and enters into a sales contract with him, the broker is entitled to his commission.
However, the majority of NJ courts endorse the <i>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v. J. Johnson and A. Johnson</i> holding which states,<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ellsworth Dobbs Inc v. J. Johnson and A. Johnson</i>, 50 NJ 528, 548, 236 A. 2d 843 (1967).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When a broker is engaged by an owner of a property to find a purchaser for it, the broker earns his commission when (a) he produces a purchaser ready, willing, and able to buy on the same terms, fixed by the owner, (b) the purchaser enters into a binding contract with the owner to do so, and (c) the purchaser completes the transaction by closing the title in accordance with the provisions of the contract. If the contract is not consummated because of the lack of financial ability to perform or because of any other default of his … there is no right to commission against the seller.</span>
To this very day, NJ continues to subscribe to this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kennedy v. Roach</i>, 122 NJ Super. 361 (1973); <i>Rothman Realty Corp. v. Breck</i>, 73 NJ Super. 577 (1977); <i>Feist v. Dockside, et al.</i>, 255 NJ Super. 100 (1992); <i>Banquesource Capital v.

Ct., App. Div. 2012.</i> Based upon the foregoing, since a sales contract was never consummated between the <i>Nitva</i> and Nevins, <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to his commission.
Additionally, based upon his understanding of one the agreement’s provisions, <i>Nitva</i> contends that <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to his commission from the sale of the property to Levy by another broker. As the agreement states,
<span class="poetry indentAll">Upon the procuring of a Purchaser of the property during the term of this listing, Owner agrees to pay a Broker a commission of six per cent of the selling price. Broker’s commission shall be considered earned if the sale of the property is effected by Broker, by Owner, or by any third party during the term of this listing …</span>
In other words, <i>Nitva</i> argues that if a second broker introduces the <i>Nitva</i> to a prospective buyer and facilitates the sale of the property, only the second broker earns the commission. Such an interpretation of this provision is predicated upon the contention that the phrase, “if sold to a party who was introduced to the property during the term by broker” is modifying not only the case of a sale “after its termination” but also the case of sale “during the term of the listing.”
Such an interpretation ignores the earlier part of the clause – “if the sale is effected … by any third party” – and the clear intent of the provision to give Broker A, namely the <i>Tove’a</i>, an exclusive brokerage agreement during the term of the signed listing agreement. The fact that the owner, namely the <i>Nitva</i>, was required to pay a commission to Broker B does not reduce his obligation to Broker A, namely the <i>Tove’a</i>. <i>Nitva</i> could have protected himself either by renegotiation with Broker A prior to the sale, or by refraining from selling until the lapse of the brokerage agreement. He did neither.
Such a conclusion would be equally forthcoming according to the canons of halakhic interpretation of agreements. If one has a doubt regarding language employed in an agreement, then if there is an <i>umdana</i>, i.e., common sense meaning, to the benefit of one of the parties, we follow the <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 2:100 cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 42, <i>hagaha</i> 30; <i>Hiddushei R. Akiva Eiger</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:5.<br>Though the choice of law provision stipulates that NJ law governs, whether halakhically that means that we are directed to interpret the actual construction of the provisions of the agreement or only the actual civil law governing brokerage law we leave as an open question. Consequently, we interpreted the construction of the clauses in accordance with both legal systems.</i> In our scenario, clearly it is to the benefit of the <i>Tove’a</i> to negotiate an exclusive brokerage agreement whereby if another broker sells the property to a third party unbeknownst to him, he still earns a commission. Secondly, even if assume that that there are two differing interpretations of this clause, one which benefits the <i>Tove’a</i> and another which benefits the <i>Nitva</i>, <i>yad ba’al ha-shtar al ha-elyona</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 3 cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 42, <i>hagaha</i> 19. However, if the clause cannot be interpreted in two different ways, then the document is construed against the drafter.</i> the document is construed in favor of the drafter, namely the <i>Tove’a</i>.
Given our understanding of the aforementioned clause, the question remains whether the <i>Tove’a</i> is in actuality entitled to his commission on the sale of the property to Levy. <i>Nitva</i> sold the property to the third party on February 29, 2009. The prerequisite for an earned commission is that the sale transpired during “the life of the agreement.” In our instance, the agreement expired on January 23, 2009, so seemingly <i>Tove’a</i> should be denied his commission. Nevertheless, invoking one of the clauses of the agreement, <i>Tove’a</i> argues that he is still entitled to his commission. As the provision states,
<span class="poetry indentAll">The term of this listing shall be extended by the period of time commenced by the date that the Owner accepts any offer presented by Broker for the property and ended by the date that negotiations with respect to such offer terminate. If negotiations with respect to an accepted offer terminate after the listing termination date set forth above, then the term shall be further extended by a period of three months from the date that such negotiations terminate …</span>
Clearly, during the time of the listing agreement, there was an offer by Nevins that was accepted by <i>Nitva</i>. However, subsequently, there is a paper trail corroborating that Nevins had second thoughts regarding his offer. Nevins requested that <i>Nitva</i> add certain additions to the property and requested certain financial accommodations prior to signing the contract for sale. Due to these requests for modification of the original offer, <i>Nitva</i> orally communicated to the <i>Tove’a</i> that he no longer was interested in selling the property to Nevins. <i>Tove’a</i> claims that negotiations between <i>Nitva</i> and Nevins continued. However, he was unable to produce any documentation corroborating his claim. Given that <i>Nitva</i> produced a paper trail indicating that Nevins had retracted from the original offer and the <i>Tove’a</i> was unable to show that negotiations continued, the three-month extension of the listing agreement based upon an accepted offer was inapplicable to our case at hand. Hence, had the listing agreement been extended to April 23, 2009, then <i>Tove’a</i> would have been entitled to a commission based upon the sale on February 29, 2009. Based upon the cumulative evidence that the negotiations had ceased between the <i>Nitva</i> and Nevins prior to the expiration date of the listing agreement, there are no grounds to extend the term of the brokerage agreement. Therefore, there are no grounds for <i>Tove’a</i>’s entitlement to a real estate commission.
<b>Decision</b>
<i>Nitva</i> is hereby not obligated to pay a commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b>Final Thoughts</b>
Assuming the parties had negotiated the terms of their agreement orally and subsequently there was a dispute regarding the terms, how would Halakha address the current claims advanced by the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i>? In the absence of a written or verbal agreement to provide services, <i>Rema</i> rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:4. See also <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 246:17. Cf. <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 363:10. On the other hand, Rema contends that certain actions, such as expressing a willingness to be an <i>arev</i> (guarantor on a loan) without performing the prescribed <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking an obligation), are not actions for which one customarily receives compensation. Hence under certain circumstances, a failure to pay the <i>arev</i> will not allow him to recover from the borrower a fee for his services. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 129:22. For the reasoning underlying Rema’s view, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 64:3.<br>In civil law, a similar notion of a quasi-contractual recovery is known as <i>quantum merit</i> (“as much as he deserves”) and allows the performing party, in this case the broker, to recoup the reasonable value of services rendered is recognized in NJ law. See NJ case law cited in <i>Weichert Co. Realtors v. Ryan and Saunders</i>, 128 NJ 427 (1992), 608 A. 2d 280.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If one performs an action or benefit for his friend, [the friend] cannot say that it was done <i>gratis</i> since he never told him to do it, and he must compensate him.</span>
Numerous <i>Poskim</i> endorse Rema’s posture,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">See the list of <i>teshuvot</i> recorded in <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 70; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 2, <i>EH</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 345; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 134; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 70:28; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 246:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 246:5; <i>PDR</i> 11:278, 282–283.<br>Given the contradictory rulings found in <i>Rema</i>, op. cit., some <i>Aharonim</i> view this matter as a halakhic-legal doubt and therefore, one cannot extract money from the beneficiary. See <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 363; <i>Teshuvot Noda-be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>HM</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 119; <i>Teshuvot Doveiv Meisharim</i> 1:42.</i> contending that an individual is entitled to a fee for services rendered whether he was duly empowered by another to perform these actions, or whether he performed these services on his own initiative, provided that the beneficiary of the work did not tell him to stop or communicate to him that he would not receive remuneration for his services.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 375:1 (in the name of <i>Rosh</i>); <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 375:1; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:151. Cf. <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 101b; <i>Teshuvot Pri Tevua</i> 58; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 3:15.</i> The obligation to pay a commission exists regardless of whether the broker incurred actual expenses or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yad Eliyahu</i> (Lublin) 74.</i> His time investment may serve as the sole justification of compensation for his services. As we may infer from Rema’s words, “If one performs an action or benefit for his friend …” Rema’s words clearly inform us that remuneration is based upon “an action or benefit,” rather than linked to an outlay of expenses.
Even if the broker acted on his own initiative or at the behest of a seller, but failed to execute a <i>kinyan</i> to demonstrate that both parties resolve that the broker has been hired to perform certain services, nevertheless, by dint of benefiting from his services, the seller must pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharach Ohr Zarua</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 476; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 106; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:56; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:66; <i>Teshuvot Maharash</i> 1:37.</i> As Rav Hai Gaon exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hemda Genuza</i> 135.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Is it possible that all employees and brokers require a <i>kinyan</i>? Rather, the benefit that [the employer] receives because [the employee] works for his needs, he undertakes to obligate himself.</span>
In fact, according to certain authorities, a broker is viewed as an agent,<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:61, 2:56; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:66; <i>Teshuvot Ba’i Hayei</i> vol.1, <i>HM</i> 166; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>EH</i> 212.</i> and as such there is no requirement to execute a <i>kinyan</i>.
Moreover, even if the seller expressly states that he does not want a broker or refuses to pay him, if he subsequently benefits from the broker’s work, he is obligated to pay him.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pri Tevua</i>, supra n. 16.</i> As one <i>beit din</i> states,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 13:34, 37.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The act of sale was facilitated by the broker they wanted, and they themselves are deriving benefit from it, yet they are unwilling to pay for the brokering efforts … and they must pay the broker his commission even though they refuse to pay …</span>
Alternatively, as contended in a recent Israeli <i>beit din</i> decision, if the <i>minhag</i> as reflected in the prevailing law is to remit compensation for brokerage services, then there is a tacit assumption between the parties that the broker is entitled the market fee for his services.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 72059, Eretz Hemda-Gazit Beit Din, July 16, 2012. For precedent opinion, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:125.</i>
The question is at what point is a broker entitled to receive his commission? Assuming that a contract of sale was executed between the parties and subsequently, prior to the closing, the prospective buyer had a change of heart, is the broker entitled to his commission? Addressing this scenario, Rabbi Arye Balchover concludes,<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shem Arye</i>, <i>HM</i> 32.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since the actual act [of closing] did not transpire he can change his mind and refrain from the purchase. Therefore he is exempt from paying him … and the assumption is that he did not obligate himself unless the transaction was finalized.</span>
Such an approach, which requires both the execution of a contract for sale as well as an actual closing, resonates in the rulings of others.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda-be-Yehuda</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i>, <i>HM</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Nehar Afarsemon</i>, <i>HM</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Pe’at Negev</i> 2; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sekhirut</i> 23; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 154.</i> However, there are others who contend that the actual closing is not determinative of whether the broker earns his commission. For example, if prior to the closing, both parties decide to withdraw from the deal, the broker is entitled to receive his commission.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rif</i>, Leitner ed., 76; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Ephraim</i> 150; <i>Teshuvot Even Hefetz</i> 22.</i> On the other hand, if the change of heart is due to <i>mekach ta’ut</i>, an error in the transaction such as if the foundations of the home are not sturdy, then the broker will not receive his fee.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Pe’ulat Tzadik</i> 119.</i> Since the broker was unable to finalize the deal due to a defect in the physical integrity of the property, the seller is exempt from paying him a commission. In such circumstances, even if the broker received the commission, he must return the fee to the seller.<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Levush Mordekhai</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 15; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 136; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, <i>HM</i> 185:10; <i>Teshuvot Halikhot Yisrael</i> 66.</i>
Alternatively, the time of a commission payment is dependent upon <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, commercial practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 185:10; <i>Levush</i>, <i>HM</i> 185:10; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 50:23. See also <i>Teshuvot Maharashach</i> 2:229.</i> If the prevailing practice is that the broker’s fee is payable upon closing the deal, then and only then is the seller obligated to pay. However, if the custom is that the fee for services is contingent upon a broker identifying a willing, able, and ready purchaser, then remittance is due upon the execution of a contract for sale. In eighteenth-century Izmir, Turkey, the <i>minhag</i> was that if the broker procured a buyer and the closing was cancelled, absent any mutually agreed imposition of a penalty for the cancellation, the broker is not entitled to his fee. On the other hand, if the agreement stipulated a penalty for withdrawing from a contract for sale, then the broker is entitled to a commission from the party who defaulted on the deal.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i> vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 137; <i>Teshuvot Ruach Hayyim</i> (Palache), <i>HM</i> 185; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 6:54.</i> However, if the agreement between the parties differs from <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, the agreement trumps <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> and the terms of the agreement are determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 29.</i>
In short, in the absence of a written agreement to the contrary, a broker’s fee in NJ is payable upon the execution of a contract for sale either based on <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, which is reflective of state law, or based on the aforesaid rulings that argue that a broker’s job is completed upon the completion of the work, i.e., either the sale of the property or the actual closing.
Finally, there was discussion regarding the varying understandings of a particular clause of the agreement over whether the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to his fee if another broker had showed the property to a third party and the party subsequently purchased the property from the <i>Nitva</i> prior to the expiration of the listing agreement. Due to the vagueness of this provision as well as others, <i>Nitva</i> contends that he did not understand some of the terms of the agreement and he therefore should not be responsible to pay any commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>. Relying upon precedent, in a recent NJ case, the court states,<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kislak, Inc. vs. Abraham Schlosser and Hanco Property Management</i>, Superior Ct. of NJ, County of Middlesex Law Division, Docket No. MID-L-3229-10.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The law will not make a better contract for parties than they themselves have seen fit to enter into … The judicial function of a court of law is to enforce a contract as it is written. <i>Kupfersmith v.

This civil recognition that “<i>ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>” (lit. “ignorance of the law does not excuse”) resonates in Halakha. Addressing a scenario of a party who signed off on a document and subsequently advances the plea that he isn’t literate in the language of the document, Rashba rules that his signature obligates him to the agreement’s terms because there is a presumption that he read it prior to signing or that he relied on others to explain to him the terms prior to affixing his signature to the document.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhosot le-Ramban</i> 77.</i> This approach that ignorance of Halakha is no defense is endorsed by Shulhan Arukh and Rema.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 40:1, 45:3, 61:13; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 66:13, <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:13.</i> Under certain extenuating circumstances, such as an individual who, for emotional reasons, cannot relate to what is written, such as a bride regarding a <i>ketuba</i>, the claim that one failed to comprehend or foresee what he was signing is a defense.<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1156 cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 147:8; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim</i>, <i>EH</i> 4:14; <i>PDR</i> 9:152, 160.</i> In our case, <i>Nitva</i> was neither emotionally distraught nor were the agreement’s terms unforeseeable.
We have concluded that <i>Nitva</i> is not obligated to pay a commission, and therefore <i>Nitva</i>’s claim that the rate of commission is too high is irrelevant to our judgment. Nevertheless, we will reply to <i>Nitva</i>’s contention. Rabbi Ya’akov ha-Levi Ettinger of seventeenth-century Salonika contends that the resolution of this matter is contingent upon the scope of the Talmudic rule <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, the law of the kingdom is the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 28a; <i>Gittin</i> 10b; <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a–b; <i>Bava Batra</i> 44b–45a.</i> The question is whether the regulation of real estate matters can be validated based upon this rule. As Rabbi Ettinger elucidates, this question depends on whether we accept Rema’s view or the Shakh’s position regarding the parameters of this rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 2:111.</i> In Rema’s opinion, all matters may be subsumed under the rubric of “<i>le-takanat ha-medina</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:14, 369:11.</i> which is understood by Rema as referring to any issues relating to social interaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369.</i> Vigorously disagreeing with Rema, Shakh contends that if a particular secular law contradicts Halakha, <i>dina de-malkhuta</i> will not govern.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:39; <i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i>, <i>Likkutim</i> 16:1.

Normative Halakha follows Shakh’s position.</i> In our scenario there is no conflict between Halakha and NJ case law regarding this matter.

f) Dual Real Estate Commission, Illegal Contracts, and Civil Law

<b>F. Dual Real Estate Commission, Illegal Contracts, and Civil Law</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Century Realty Agency v. Aaron Levy</i></span>
<b>Facts</b>
Century Realty Agency (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>), a New York licensed real estate brokerage agency located in Monticello, NY that is owned and managed by a Torah observant Jew, entered into an exclusive written brokerage agreement with Simcha Cohen (henceforth: the Seller), whereby <i>Tove’a</i> would show commercial properties for sale by the Seller, and upon procuring a ready and willing buyer, <i>Tove’a</i> would receive a 6% commission from the Seller. Additionally, unbeknownst to the Seller, <i>Tove’a</i> executed a written agreement with Aaron Levy (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>) whereby, the <i>Nitva</i> would remit a 6% commission to the <i>Tove’a</i> should he, the <i>Nitva</i>, purchase the property from the Seller. Though <i>Tove’a</i> failed to sign off on the real estate commission agreement, <i>Nitva</i> signed off on the agreement.
<i>Nitva</i>’s offer to purchase the property was accepted by the Seller. At the closing, the closing documentation stated that the Seller had remitted the commission to <i>Tove’a</i>. Moreover, at the time, <i>Nitva</i>’s attorney for the closing communicated to the <i>Tove’a</i> that his client would not be paying any additional commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
The matter was submitted to <i>beit din</i> for resolution.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
Admittedly, <i>Tove’a</i> failed to sign off on the commission agreement. However, since <i>Nitva</i> signed off on a written agreement that he would remit a second commission regarding the purchase of the property, he is bound to the terms of the agreement, and therefore <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to remit the second commission. Even though <i>Tove’a</i> failed to sign off on the agreement, <i>Nitva</i> is not exempt from paying, because at the time of the agreement, <i>Nitva</i> shook hands with the <i>Tove’a</i>, in effect acknowledging his obligation to pay the commission.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
Admittedly, he signed off on the real estate commission agreement. However, given that <i>Tove’a</i> did not sign off, he is not legally bound to remit the commission. Moreover, <i>Nitva</i> argues that he shook <i>Tove’a</i>’s hand out of courtesy, namely, as an acknowledgement to the real estate agency for the brokerage services provided, rather than as a means of acknowledging that he will remit a commission to <i>Tove’a</i>. In addition, at the time of the closing, <i>Nitva</i>’s attorney communicated to the <i>Tove’a</i> that his client would not be paying a second commission.
Finally, since the property was located in New York, New York real estate law applies to the sale. Consequently, dual agency is prohibited under New York law in the absence of written disclosure to the Seller. Therefore, the agreement executed between the <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i> is an illegal contract and is unenforceable.
<b>Discussion</b>
<b>1. <i>Da’at ha-Rov</i> (The Majority Opinion)</b>
The threshold question is whether a Seller who promises to pay a commission above the market rate is obligated to pay. One view is that if the Seller promised to pay above the market rate, he is obligated to pay the promised amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 172 (in the name of R.

Other <i>Poskim</i>, relying upon the ruling of Maharam, Rema, Shakh, and others, argue that since the client can always allege that he was jesting (“<i>hashata</i>”) and therefore never seriously intended to pay such a rate, the seller is obligated to pay only the prevailing market rate.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 172 (in the name of <i>Maharam</i>); <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, <i>Hut ha-Meshulash</i> 62; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh Kelal</i> 64:3; <i>Teshuvot ha-Bah</i> 28; <i>Rema</i>, <i>Darkhei Moshe ha-Arukh</i> 264; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 86; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev</i> 2:135; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 3, 63; <i>Levush</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:7; <i>Panim Meirot</i>, supra n. 2; <i>Beit Meir</i>, supra n. 2; <i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:14–15; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 154, 186; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 58.</i> Therefore, if the seller still retains the funds and has not transferred them to the agent, he can argue that he is relying upon the <i>Poskim</i> who contend that the agent is only entitled to the market rate commission.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hukot ha-Hayyim</i> (Palache), <i>HM</i> 29; <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 264:4; <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:80; <i>Teshuvot Maharashakh</i> 2:80.</i> Even if the seller does not advance the argument in <i>beit din</i>, the <i>beit din</i> can advance this argument for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 81:1.</i> The latter position is corroborated based upon the following Halakha: If the Buyer advances to the agent a portion of the compensation, and after completing his services, refuses to pay the balance because he argues that the balance exceeds the market rate, he is exempt from remitting the balance.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 81:26; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 53; <i>Sha’ar Mishpat</i> 81:16.</i>
Based upon the foregoing, the panel adopted the position that as long as there was a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i>, the Seller would be duty-bound to pay a commission that exceeded the market rate. Similarly, in our scenario, should the Buyer have promised to pay a commission above the market rate by executing a <i>kinyan</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> would be obligated to remit the funds.
Finally, even if it there was a <i>kinyan</i>, nevertheless when you are still engaged in the matter (i.e., <i>asukim be’oto inyan</i>), one has a right to rescind the offer even though a handshake was executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 195:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 195:14; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 195:5.</i> At the time of the real estate closing (i.e., <i>asukim be’oto inyan</i>), the <i>Nitva</i> and his attorney said no such monies would be forthcoming, and therefore the commitment dissolved.
In light of the cumulative evidence that there is a dispute between the parties whether in fact <i>Nitva</i> shook the <i>Tove’a</i>’s hands acknowledging his obligation to remit the commission, the majority of the panel concluded that in cases where the fact(s) are in doubt, we invoke <i>peshara</i> (compromise)<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:5; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 12:5.</i> and obligate <i>Nitva</i> to pay one-third of the commission for services provided by the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b>2. <i>Da’at Me’ut</i> (The Minority Opinion)</b>
<i>Kinyan situmta</i> refers to a <i>kinyan</i> that is effective to undertake a commitment (i.e., <i>hit’hayivut</i>) or transfer of items (i.e., <i>hakna’ah</i>) based upon <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>. Paris in the twelfth century, thirteenth-century Provence, fifteenth-century Algeria, sixteenth-century Spain, and twentieth-century Galicia, as well as other places, a handshake was a method of <i>kinyan</i>, to undertake an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">R.

However, today the finalization of an agreement regarding a real estate commission is performed through executing a real estate commission agreement rather than a handshake.
<b>Moreover, even if some people finalize a commission agreement via a <i>tekia’at kaf</i> (handshake), such a <i>kinyan</i> will only be effective if the majority of the residents of the New York community practice this form of <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i>, beginning of ch. 7 (52a), in the name of <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Ran</i>; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 72; <i>Sdei Hemed</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet ha-Mem</i>, p. 248, s.v. “<i>u-minhag shelo</i>”; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:152.</i> And today, most residents do not handshake to finalize a real estate commission arrangement.</b>
Consequently, the fact that there exists a doubt regarding the motivation and circumstances leading up to the handshake is irrelevant. Even assuming that the handshake was executed in order to undertake a commitment to pay a commission, given that it is no longer a legally recognized vehicle to finalize agreements,<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:279; <i>Teshuvot Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 3:5.</i> it cannot be viewed as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>.
Though, to the best of my knowledge, there is no explicit discussion regarding the propriety of a broker receiving two commissions, one from the Seller and one from the Buyer, nevertheless an inference can be drawn from a dispute amongst <i>Rishonim</i> (early authorities) that deals with two principals who appoint a <i>shaliach</i> (an agent) to purchase an asset. The dispute emerges from the discussion in Bava Metzia regarding two principals who placed their money in a common purse, but the <i>shaliach</i> acquires the property for only one of the principals.<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a.</i> In that case, Rava rules that though the <i>shaliach</i>, in actuality, was working for only one of the principals, nonetheless the property is acquired by both principals. According to R. Meir Abulafia (Rama), Rava’s decision applies even if the <i>shaliach</i> explicitly states prior to becoming involved in the transaction that his intent is to buy for one of the principals. In contrast, Rid contends that Rava’s ruling extends only to a principal who fails to reveal his intent. However, if he explicitly states prior to the execution of the transaction that his intent is to purchase the asset for one principal only, then the asset is only acquired for that that principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 184; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 184:2; H. Zippori, “The Laws of Agency,” Section 17, Israel’s Ministry of Justice.</i> The common denominator of Rava’s position is that both principals knew that each of them appointed the identical <i>shaliach</i>, and there is a dispute regarding whether the property has been acquired by either both principals or only one of them. However, in a scenario in which one principal (the Seller) is unaware of the existence of a second principal, such agency would be invalid. Therefore, in our scenario, where the agent, the <i>Tove’a</i>, did not disclose to the Seller that there is a second principal, there would be no grounds for receiving a second commission from the Buyer, the <i>Nitva</i>.
The outstanding matter to address is the legal and halakhic consequences of the written agreement signed between <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i>. Legally, a real estate broker has a fiduciary relationship to his client and therefore has the duty not to act for a party whose interests are adverse to those of the principal, unless full disclosure has been communicated to the Seller. Accordingly, the broker cannot serve as an agent for both the Seller and the Buyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Matter of Goldstein v. Department of State, Division of Licensing Services</i>, 144 AD 2d 463, 464; <i>Kenneth D. Laub &amp; Co. v. Bear Stearns Cos.</i>, 278 AD 121, 718 NYS 2d 45, NY AD 2000; <i>Queens Structure Corp. v. Jay Lawrence Assoc.</i>, 304 AD 2d 736, 758 NYS 2d 664, NY AD 2003.</i> In particular, in our case, the existence of an exclusive brokerage agreement with the Seller is inherently at odds with any dual brokerage arrangement. There are conflicts inherent in a dual agency. The dual agent owes both the Seller and prospective buyer the same degree of care and duty as he would if he represented each alone. In many real estate dealings this is impossible due to the contrasting motivations of the Seller and Buyer, and the broker’s duty of disclosure.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">10 P. Rohan, B. Goldstein &amp; C. Bobis, <i>Real Estate Brokerage Law and Practice</i>, section 3.06, at 3–39 (1987).</i> Unlike a dual brokerage arrangement in which the parties agree to a lower standard of fiduciary ties and the broker may be acting in the Buyer’s interests to the detriment of the Seller’s interests, an exclusive brokerage arrangement propels the broker to consider only the Seller’s interests and receives the broker’s undivided loyalty. Adopting this perspective, a broker who has signed off on an exclusive brokerage agreement who decides to receive a second commission from the Buyer is in actuality accepting what amounts to a bribe. The submission of such payments subverts the brokering process and undermines the Seller’s interests. If a broker accepts two commissions, the Seller can claim that had the broker disclosed the second commission, he would have offered him a lower rate. Since the double commission was undisclosed, the Seller is unaware of the option that he could have requested a lower commission from the broker. Finally, legally, the written agreement signed between the broker and <i>Nitva</i> is an illegal contract and therefore unenforceable in a civil court.
Turning to Halakha, the threshold question is whether any <i>issur</i> (prohibition) was violated by signing off on a second commission arrangement. As we know, according to Halakha, “<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>” (the law of the kingdom is the law). According to most decisors, any matters relating to <i>karka</i> (real property), such as taxation, eminent domain, etc., require an observant Jew’s compliance.<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 3:447; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:895; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 194:2, 369:2, 6.</i> Failure to abide by the law in such instances may entail a violation of a Torah prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avnei Miluim</i> 28:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>YD</i> 314. Cf. <i>Beit Shmuel, SA EH</i> 28:3; <i>Teshuvot Binyan Tzion</i> 2:15.</i> Real estate law, including guidelines for brokerage arrangements, ought to be subsumed under this category of <i>karka</i>, and therefore would require compliance.<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> (Ettinger) 111.</i> Alternatively, pursuant to Rema, accepted by the majority of <i>Poskim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Doveiv Meisharim</i> 1:76.</i> civil law governs all matters that are “<i>le-takanat bnei ha-medina</i>” (for the benefit of the citizenry), understood by <i>Rema</i> as referring to any issues relating to social interaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 369; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:14, 369:11.</i> As we mentioned, the implementation of a dual brokerage fee without written disclosure means that the Seller has unknowingly given up his right to the agent’s undivided loyalty. As such, his illegal conduct impacts upon social interaction, in addition to falling under the rubric of <i>geneivat da’at</i> (verbal deception).
Though Shakh vigorously disagrees with Rema and contends that if a particular secular law contradicts Halakha, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> does not apply,<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 73:39.</i> nevertheless, one can infer from <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> involving two principals that the payment of two commissions to a broker is not countenanced by Halakha. In Bava Metzia,<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a.</i> Rava addresses the case of principals who place their money in a common purse, but the <i>shaliach</i> acquired property for only one of the principals. Rava concludes that though the <i>shaliach</i> is working for one of the principals, nevertheless the property is acquired by both principals. According to Rama, the <i>psak</i> of Rava applies even if the <i>shaliach</i> explicitly states prior to becoming involved in the commercial mandate that he intends to acquire the property for only one of the principals. In contrast, <i>Rid</i> argues that Rava’s ruling applies to a principal who doesn’t disclose his intent. However, if he explicitly states before the execution of the transaction that he intends to purchase the asset for one principal, then the asset is only acquired for that principal.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 184; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 184:2; H. Zippori, Multiplicity of Principals and Agents, Yerushalayim: Ministry of Justice.</i>
Based upon this dispute, in accordance with Rama, payment of two commissions without disclosure to the Seller would be permissible. Rama contends that if the <i>shaliach</i> explicitly states that his intent is to acquire in the name of one principal, the asset is acquired by both. Similarly, in our case, when the broker, as <i>shaliach</i>, is working for the Seller and Buyer, he can exhibit a sense of loyalty to both principals and therefore can receive a commission from both. On the other hand, in accordance with Rid, if the <i>shaliach</i> explicitly states that he is working for one principal only, the asset is acquired by this principal. Consequently, in our scenario, Rid would concur that there are no grounds for a double commission. If, in Rava’s case, intent to work for one principal casts into doubt his loyalty toward the other principal, if the broker fails to disclose the double commission arrangement to the Seller, we would reach a similar conclusion. Various <i>Poskim</i> including Tur and Rema follow the Rid’s opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, ibid.; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 184:1.</i> Since according to Tur and Rema there is a basis for outlawing the two-commission arrangement, Shakh would concur that one must comply with the secular legislation.
Secondly, the notion that a broker can receive a commission from both the Seller and the Buyer is also contradicted by another <i>sugya</i> (Talmudic discussion), which argues that one person cannot represent two individuals. This is the <i>sugya</i> dealing with the dividing up of a father’s assets amongst orphans. Halakha states that one is required to appoint two <i>apotroposim</i> (guardians) to deal with this transaction. As such, each <i>apotropus</i> would be able to advance the <i>zekhut</i> (right) of each orphan.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 77b and <i>Ketuvot</i> 100a; <i>Tosafot</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>borerim</i>”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 33b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva Kiddushin</i> 43a.</i> Here again, the notion that one person can represent two individuals who may have contradictory interests is rejected by Halakha. Analogously, a broker cannot receive a dual commission from the Buyer as well as a Seller without full disclosure to the Seller, lest the Seller’s interests be subverted. As such, even Shakh would agree that compliance with secular law is required.
Alternatively, we may invoke <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>, relying upon Hatam Sofer’s teaching:
<span class="poetry indentAll">If the matter had been submitted to us, we would have legislated it!<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 44.</i></span>
The backdrop for Hatam Sofer’s statement was the nineteenth-century Eastern European regulation that only licensed wine brokers may sell wine and liquor. Concerned with the monopolistic ramifications of this civil law and the attendant economic harm foisted upon non-licensed wine brokerages, members of the Jewish community approached Hatam Sofer to express his opinion regarding this regulation. In reply, Hatam Sofer argued that it is desirable to regulate economic competition, and that there is precedent in Jewish legal history for protecting the right of people to make a living, and therefore, the civil regulation makes sense. Hatam Sofer concludes that if the Jewish community had been empowered in his time to pass such legislation, they would have done it without hesitation. The notion that “if the matter had been submitted to us, we would have legislated it!” reverberates in the subsequent nineteenth- and twentieth-century rulings of Rabbis Yitzhak Schmelkes, Shlomo Z. Auerbach, Eliezer Waldenburg, Yitzhak Nissim, Yosef Elyashiv, and Shmuel Wosner who ruled in various contexts that <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is applicable to such scenarios.<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i> 75, 77:3; <i>Teshuvot Hit’orerut Teshuva</i> 232; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 1:87; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 12:83; <i>PDR</i> 6:382 (R. Elyashiv and R. Nissim’s opinions); <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 10:291.</i>
In the absence of an explicit halakhic prohibition outlawing dual agency without full disclosure to the Seller, and in light of a contrary understanding of Rava’s ruling,<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 184:1 draws other conclusions from Rava’s ruling and therefore would implicitly argue that this Talmudic discussion has no implication for the matter of the propriety of a broker accepting a double commission.</i> we nevertheless invoke Hatam Sofer’s approach that “had the matter been submitted to us, we would have legislated it!”
Common sense dictates that Halakha follow secular law by prohibiting the above type of dual agency in order to promote trust and confidence between the Seller and the broker.
Seemingly, this approach undermines Hazon Ish’s position that “everything is explicit in our Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish</i>, <i>HM</i> 16:1.</i> According to Hazon Ish, Halakha as a legal system has explicit rules that encompass the entire gamut of human relations. Hatam Sofer’s approach, which embraces secular law, seems to stand in bold contrast to Hazon Ish’s viewpoint. However, perhaps we need to translate the notion of an “explicit rule” loosely, as denoting any rule that can be inferred from Halakha. Therefore, though as we noted, there is no explicit discussion addressing the propriety of a dual agency and a two-commission arrangement, nevertheless, we may infer from the discussion of the aforementioned ruling of Rava and the teaching regarding the appointment of guardians for orphans, that Halakha would disapprove of such an arrangement.
In sum, the teachings relating to <i>shelihut</i> and <i>apotropus</i> implicitly reject the permissibility of an arrangement of dual brokerage commissions. Secondly, the execution of the agreement between <i>Tove’a</i> and <i>Nitva</i> is in contravention of <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> for one of the four forthcoming reasons: (1) Matters of brokerage are to be subsumed in the category of “<i>karka</i>”; (2) issues of brokerage are to be subsumed under the rubric of “<i>le-takanat bnei ha-Medina</i>”; (3) the secular legislation resonates in the teachings of Tur and Rema regarding agency and the discussion dealing with the appointment of guardians for orphans; and (4) secular law prohibiting dual commission fees is an example of equitable legislation and therefore should receive our halakhic stamp of approval.
In short, the agreement executed between the Seller and Buyer is an illegal and unenforceable contract under secular law. Halakhically, this agreement entails an <i>issur</i>, namely failing to comply with secular law, and at first glance, payment of such monies involves the violation of an <i>issur</i>. Hence, seemingly <i>Tove’a</i> is not entitled to these monies. And, in fact, there are some <i>Poskim</i>, notably Rabbis Y. Trani, Y. Rosannes, and K. Zuckerman who arrive at this conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 2, <i>YD</i> 38; <i>Mishneh le-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Issurei Mizbei’ach</i> 4:13; <i>Teshuvot Minhat ha-Komeitz</i> 1:117.</i>
However, most authorities rule otherwise. For example, the following agreements which involve the commission of a sin remain enforceable in a <i>beit din</i>: a loan transaction with a <i>ribbit</i> clause,<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> and <i>SA</i>, <i>YD</i> 161:11, <i>HM</i> 52:1.

<span class="poetry indentAll">We see clearly that Jewish law does not establish a causal connection between the commission of an offense and the voiding of a civil contract … The violation of the law or morality is one thing, and the legal validity of the contract is another – to the extent that the fulfilling of the contract itself does not activate the offense … Precisely because Jewish law does not distinguish between law and morality, and that practically every performance of an obligation is at the same time a fulfillment of a religio-moral commandment – as “the commandment” of repaying a debt of monetary obligation – the non-fulfillment of a contract entered into through a violation of law will only turn out to be an additional offense to supplement the original one committed by the transgressor.</span>
In other words, though, for example, there is a prohibition against the taking of <i>ribbit</i>, of submitting false testimony, of a <i>kohen</i> marrying a divorcee, of litigating one’s case in civil court, and of engaging in an illicit affair, nevertheless, as long as the actual agreement between to the parties (involving these <i>issurim</i>) complies with the norms of the halakhic law of obligations, monies are to be remitted. The illegality arises from the act of <i>issur</i> itself (e.g., taking <i>ribbit</i>, submitting false testimony) and therefore does not impact the fact that an agreement was executed that entails payment of money for undertaking the act of <i>issur</i>. Seemingly, based upon the foregoing, the <i>Nitva</i> should pay the commission. Given that the element of illegality involved in a dual brokerage fee does not invalidate the agreement, <i>Nitva</i> ought to remit the monies owed to <i>Tove’a</i>.
Nevertheless, despite the foregoing, halakhic policy is to refuse to validate such a monetary payment, because such a stance would compromise the role of a <i>beit din</i> to be vigilant in <i>afrushei me-issura</i> (preventing improper conduct).<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i> 2:98–99; <i>Teshuvot Mahane Hayyim</i> 2:21; <i>Yeshuot Yisrael</i>, <i>HM</i> 22.</i>
However, upon a closer reading of these rulings, we find that our scenario is readily distinguishable from the others. In the cases of an agreement to hire false witnesses, a matchmaker who introduced a <i>kohen</i> to a divorcee, an agreement to litigate a matter in civil court, and an agreement to engage in an illicit affair, although the agreement is prohibited, the payment is not tainted. The prohibition does not affect the monetary obligation. On the other hand, in our case, both the actual payment of the double commission and the execution of the agreement are halakhically (and legally) improper. And in such a situation, Halakha will not validate a tainted remittance of monies. For example, if there is legislation that the sale of a bottle of wine cannot exceed fifty dollars, and a Jew sold a bottle for fifty-five dollars, the seller must return five dollars to the buyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheikh</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 16; Eliav Shochetman, <i>Illegality of an Act</i> (Hebrew), Yerushalayim, 1981, 232–233.</i> In effect, this is similar to how Halakha deals with a loan transaction that has a provision for <i>ribbit</i>. Namely, the borrower can recover the principal, but the <i>ribbit</i> cannot be collected, and if he collected <i>ribbit</i>, he must return it to the lender.
Similarly, if a broker received a second commission from the Buyer, he is obligated to return the monies to the Buyer. And therefore, in our case, should we mandate that the Buyer remit a commission to the broker, it would be halakhically prohibited due to the fact that it is a violation of civil law.
Finally, there is a rule, either in accordance with the <i>din</i>, black-letter Halakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i>, <i>Helek ha-Hiddushim</i> 112.</i> or as a penalty,<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 4:16.</i> that a sinner cannot benefit from his wrongdoing.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 92b.</i> Therefore, since a double commission given to the broker is halakhically prohibited due to its non-disclosure to the Seller, which is a violation of civil law as well as minimally the interdict against <i>geneviat da’at</i>, Halakha does not permit him to benefit from his improper conduct.
Based upon the foregoing, the <i>Nitva</i> is not obligated to pay a commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
<b>Final Thoughts</b>
Finally, during the <i>dayanim</i>’s deliberations among themselves, the argument was raised that possibly if <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> demonstrated that real estate agents engaged in such a practice, we should direct the <i>Nitva</i> to remit the outstanding commission to the <i>Tove’a</i>. Upon review of <i>teshuvot</i> of <i>Rishonim</i> and <i>Aharonim</i>, one finds that the majority, and perhaps the overwhelming majority, of <i>Poskim</i> endorse the following approach of R. Moshe Feinstein:<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:75.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is clear … that in the situation of any law related to a local practice … there is no requirement that this decision be in pursuance with that of Torah scholars … Even if the custom was established by non-Jews who are the majority in that city, that custom is binding according to Torah law. It is assumed that when an agreement is executed, the inference is that the agreement conforms to local practice … and clearly, secular law is not inferior to custom …</span>
This notion that <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> is reflective of civil law resonates with many <i>Poskim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Yosef</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Nediv Lev</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 2:111; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Avraham</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i> 1:88 (5) in the name of <i>Hazon Ish</i>; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:86; <i>PDR</i> 8:162, 164 (Rabbis Goldschmidt, Elyashiv and Zolty’s opinions). For additional <i>teshuvot</i>, see D. Frimer, “The Influence of Israeli Law upon Jewish Law” (Hebrew), 39 <i>Jewish Studies</i> 134 (5759).</i> Adopting this approach leads one to the conclusion that Halakha recognizes a commercial practice that imbibes the norms of civil law.
In other words, there is an acknowledgement that there can be a <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> that emerges from the business community. The question is whether this practice will be halakhically legitimate even if it is in variance with the law. Addressing the <i>minhag</i> amongst providers of child care services that pay their employees certain social benefits which are below what civil law mandates, R. Ya’akov Eliezrov, a <i>dayan</i> on the Yerushalayim Regional Beit Din, rules that such payments are halakhically appropriate.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Eliezrov, “An Employee who Deviates from the National Practice” (Hebrew), 20 <i>Tehumin</i> 71, 72–73 (5760).</i> On the other hand, this practice is labeled a “<i>minhag garu’a</i>” (a bad practice, due to the fact that it discriminates in comparison to the other provider networks) by R. Sherman, and he therefore rules that the providers have to pay the social benefits as prescribed by civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">A. Sherman, “National Practice in Labor Relations” (Hebrew), 18 <i>Tehumin</i> 236, 240–241 (5758). For further discussion, see ch. 4 of this monograph.</i> Consequently, should we accept the former position, then a commercial practice of dual agency with a commission paid by Seller and Buyer without disclosure to the Seller would be valid. In contrast, adopting the latter approach, such a practice would be invalid because it was a “bad custom,” since the Seller loses the undivided loyalty of the broker.
However, I will refrain from addressing my position regarding whether a <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> can be in variance with civil law, since there is a threshold question as to whether such a practice actually exists. To obtain the status of a <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, the practice must be adopted by the majority of the real estate brokerages dealing in residential sales in a given locale,<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimukei Yosef</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i>, beginning of ch. 7, in the name of <i>Rashba</i> and <i>Ran</i>; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 331:1.</i> have occurred at least three times, and be widespread throughout the locale.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, ibid.</i> Additionally, R. Yitzhak bar Sheshet and R. Yair Bachrach add, the commercial custom must transpire every day. In other words, whenever a real estate commission agreement is finalized, there is a provision that both the Seller and Buyer must remit commission fees to the broker.<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 475 and <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 61.<br>The actual <i>psak din</i> of the majority opinion which was neither signed off by the <i>dayanim</i> nor was given to the parties, stated that the <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to pay the <i>Tove’a</i> one-third of the commission for services rendered by <i>Tove’a</i>. As occurs frequently, absent from the majority opinion is a rendition of the facts, the parties’ claims, and the panel’s reasoning. The reconstruction of the facts, parties’ claims, and the majority opinion was authored by this writer; the author of the minority opinion. This writer’s reconstruction of the majority opinion has not been reviewed by his colleagues. Prior to the issuance of the <i>psak din</i> accompanied by the minority opinion, at the request of the <i>Tove’a</i>, <i>Nitva</i> agreed to pay the award in installments.<br>Generally speaking, there is a prohibition to divulge which <i>dayan</i> ruled in favor of the <i>tove’a</i> and which <i>dayan</i> ruled in favor of the <i>nitva</i>. Therefore, the issuance of a dissenting opinion is at variance with Halakha. See <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 19:2. Nonetheless, if the d<i>ayanim</i> agree that their names be publicized, then the issuance of a minority opinion is permissible. See B.Z. Nesher, “Publicizing the names of dayanim in <i>beit din</i> rulings” (Hebrew), 6 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> 382, 390 (5760). In fact, the <i>minhag</i> amongst <i>dayanim</i> serving on the <i>battei din</i> under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate is to publicize their names. And in our case, the other <i>dayanim</i> on the panel agreed to disclose the author of the minority view. As mentioned, the <i>psak din</i> was not given to the parties.</i>
Addressing whether there exists in New York City a commercial practice whereby a broker receives two commissions, various real estate agencies and one attorney submitted documentation to this panel in order to ascertain the prevalence of such a practice. The submissions indicate that “it may occasionally happen,” “it is quite rare for a broker to have a dual agency … and receive two commissions,” “it occurs sometimes when there are a few potential buyers who are jumping to purchase the home,” and “commissions can, and are occasionally paid both sides.” In light of the submitted professional opinions, it is clear that dual agency coupled with two commissions occurs infrequently and therefore cannot be labeled a <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>.

g) Mekach Ta'ut, the Role of Gemirat Da'at in Undertaking Obligations in Transferring Property and Promise Keeping

<b>G. <i>Mekach Ta’ut</i>, the Role of <i>Gemirat Da’at</i> in Undertaking Obligations in Transferring Property and Promise Keeping</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Jardin Estates vs. Venetian Lanes</i></span>
On July 1, 2009, the above parties signed an arbitration agreement empowering this panel to resolve this matter according to applicable portions of Shulhan Arukh and <i>Poskim</i>. Both parties submitted to this <i>beit din</i> their differences and disputes in reference to various claims advanced by <i>Jardin Estates vs. Venetian Lanes</i>. Having given said matters due consideration and having heard all parties testify as to the facts of said disputes and differences; this panel does decide and agree as follows:
<b>Facts</b>
On September 29, 2008, Jardin Estates (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>), owned by Avraham and Sara Cohen, sold a bungalow colony located in Elizaville, New York to Venetian Lanes (hereafter: <i>Nitva</i>). At the time of the sale, a deed was issued to the <i>Tove’a</i> that granted them title to the bungalow colony. Subsequently, in exchange for the sale of the bungalow colony, a conveyance agreement assigning exclusive ownership, use, and occupancy of a bungalow unit known as “Avraham’s Tent,” was given to Mr. and Mrs. Avraham Cohen, who held the controlling interest for the <i>Tove’a</i>. The conveyance agreement reads as follows:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Agreement between Jardin Estates and Venetian Lanes, dated September 29, 2008.</i></span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Whereas, Venetian Lanes has this date purchased from Jardin Estates, the bungalow colony known as Jardin Estates located in Elizaville, New York, and</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Whereas, as part of the consideration Avraham and Sara Cohen shall have the exclusive ownership and use of one of the bungalows located at Venetian Lanes</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now therefore in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth the parties agree as follows:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">1. Avraham and Sara Cohen, their heirs and assigns shall have the exclusive use, ownership and occupancy of the bungalow located in the main house in the front called “Avraham’s Tent”.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">2. Venetian Estates shall have the right of first refusal in the event the Cohens, their heir(s) or assigns wish to sell their interest in the bungalow, said right of first refusal shall be exercised in within 30 days after written notice is given by the Cohens to Venetian Estates.</span>
Said agreement was signed by Venetian Estates and Avraham and Sara Cohen. In reply to our questioning, Mr. Cohen confirmed that the conveyance agreement was executed after the closing. And in fact, the text of the agreement supports this admission. To date, <i>Tove’a</i> has been denied access to this bungalow unit.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
<i>Nitva</i> paid <i>Tove’a</i> $500,000 for the purchase of the bungalow colony. In addition, <i>Nitva</i> made an oral commitment to pay <i>Tove’a</i> an additional $100,000 as a finder’s fee for the <i>Tove’a</i>’s services in brokering deals with the co-shareholders of the bungalow to enable him to sell the colony to the <i>Nitva</i>. As of today, said monies were not paid to the <i>Tove’a</i>.
Additionally, <i>Tove’a</i> is claiming $40,000 for the loss of use of the bungalow unit for four years (2008 through 2011) and the recouping of lost rental revenue due to his inability to occupy the unit.
In reply to <i>Nitva</i>’s argument that he only became aware of the problems with the sewer and pool after the purchase, <i>Tove’a</i> contends that pursuant to the sales agreement there is a general disclaimer of liability for defects, and therefore <i>Tove’a</i> is not responsible to compensate for <i>Nitva</i>’s outlay of expenses relating to the plumbing and pool repair.
<b><i>Nitva</i>’s Claims</b>
<i>Nitva</i> claims, with the corroboration of the President of Jardin Estates of 2007–2008, Tova Wahrman, that <i>Nitva</i> only became aware of the non-functioning sewer system and the pool after the September 29, 2008 purchase of the colony. Consequently, <i>Nitva</i> advances claims for $58,000 for pool repairs and $18,000 for sewerage repairs.
Though <i>Nitva</i> admits that an agreement was signed that transferred ownership of the bungalow unit to the <i>Tove’a</i>, nevertheless this agreement was halakhically invalid, and therefore <i>Nitva</i> retains ownership of the unit. Even if this <i>beit din</i> panel validates the transfer, <i>Nitva</i> claims that since the remainder of the bungalow colony is owned by <i>Nitva</i>, the <i>Tove’a</i> does not have a right of way to access his bungalow. Since an easement was not granted by the <i>Nitva</i> to the <i>Tove’a</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> cannot access his unit.
<b>Discussion</b>
Generally speaking, for an agreement between parties to be legally enforceable, one must determine whether the parties involved have resolved to finalize their arrangement. In Halakha, this is known as <i>gemirat da’at</i>. This condition must be obtained both in undertaking obligations, such as hiring an employee and agreeing to pay money for a service, and in transferring property such as a bungalow colony or a bungalow unit.
Our case addresses both types of <i>gemirat da’at</i>. Regarding transfer of property, we will first address the question: Given that the buyer became aware of the defective sewer system and pool after his purchase of the colony, did the buyer have <i>gemirat da’at</i> when he executed his purchase? Second, was the conveyance agreement a <i>bona fide</i> method to transfer the bungalow unit from the buyer to the seller? Finally, in terms of undertaking obligations, was the buyer’s promise to pay the seller additional monies above the selling price memorialized in the actual sales agreement halakhically enforceable?
<b>1. The Sale of the Bungalow Colony: Recovery of Costs for Sewage Problems and Non-Functioning Swimming Pool</b>
In our scenario, the buyer is entitled to purchase the bungalow colony relying upon the assumption that the seller’s representations are true. His <i>gemirat da’at</i> is obtained, in part, by receiving a bungalow colony free of defects. As Rashi aptly notes, a buyer can claim: “I did not intend to purchase an item with a defect.”<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 80a. See also <i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 47b, s.v. “<i>she-lo</i>”; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 15:6; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 40.</i>
In fact, any misrepresentation by the buyer involves <i>geneivat da’at</i> (lit. “stealing of the mind”), which entails either a violation of deception or of theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Hullin</i> 94a; <i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 403; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 228:6.<br>According to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ona’a</i> (price fraud), one is prohibited to sell an item at a price different from the market price, and when the differential between the purchase price and the market price is more than one-sixth, the sale is void. Given that both the colony and the unit are categorized as “<i>karka</i>,” immovable property, the interdict against <i>ona’a</i> is inapplicable, and therefore any misrepresentation of the properties does not entail the violation of this prohibition. (However, should there have been excessive overcharging involving a sale twice the market price, the <i>ona’a</i> interdict would have been applicable even to <i>karka</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 1:7; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 227:29; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 50–52; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 17. Cf. <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 227:29.)<br>Though the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ona’a</i> are inapplicable, nevertheless the <i>issurim</i> (prohibitions) regarding fair representation are operative.</i> If it is determined that there is a discrepancy in the sale, under certain conditions the sale is void (<i>mekach ta’ut</i>).
Due to the fact that the bungalow swimming pool was inoperative and the plumbing system was non-functioning in some of the bungalow units, <i>Nitva</i> argues that he has a right to rescind the sale. Should the <i>beit din</i> deny him that right, he should be compensated by the <i>Tove’a</i> for repairing the sewage system and bungalow pool.
At first glance, seemingly this issue may be resolved by focusing on the rulings of Shulhan Arukh and Rema. Addressing the <i>halakhot</i> of sales, Shulhan Arukh states:<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:5</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Reuven sold Shimon homes that he had in another city. Prior to the finalization of the sale, some gentiles entered the homes and vandalized them, caused smoke damage to the walls, and dismembered doors and windows. Shimon wants to rescind the sale and Reuven says that since the defect is of a temporary nature (it is repairable), he would deduct the amount of money to restore the houses to their original condition and the sale would be final. The Halakha is with Reuven.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Rema: For after all, Reuven sold a house and it may still properly be called a house. Similarly, any defect that is not structurally connected to the house (<i>be-guf ha-bayit</i>), such as an easement to access the property, or drainage pipes, which can be removed, the sale of the house is final. However, if there is a structural defect in the house, such as if the seller said that a wall was sound and it actually was crumbling, the seller is proscribed from reconstructing the wall, and anything of the like.</span>
A reading of Shulhan Arukh’s ruling would lead one to the conclusion that if the defect cannot be repaired, then the seller has a right to rescind the sale. However, should the defect be repairable, regardless of the extent and cost of the repair, then the seller’s right is limited to receiving a deduction from the purchase price.
However, the consensus of authorities is that Shulhan Arukh’s decision is based upon a decision of Rosh, who conveys to us a different understanding of this ruling. According to Rosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 96:6, which is cited by <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:5.</i> one must distinguish between whether after discovery of the defect it is still called a house or not. In our instance, ought one view an inoperative pool and non-functioning plumbing in some units as temporary defects which can be repaired, and therefore the buyer should merely receive a deduction from the purchase price, or should we say that Venetian Lanes is to be viewed as a piece of property with living units, and therefore the right of rescission of the sale exists? In explaining this position, one authority contends that the determining factor is the external appearance of the property. In other words, if it looks like a bungalow colony, it is a bungalow colony, even if it has a structural defect. Based upon this understanding of Shulhan Arukh, it would seem that Venetian Estates remains a bungalow colony, and these are temporary defects that can be remedied and paid for by the seller. However, the retention of the appearance of a bungalow is only one of the reasons to validate the sale. If it the colony would need a tremendous amount of repair, it would lose its identity as a bungalow, and therefore, there would be a right of rescission of the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Perisha</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:5. For other interpretations of Rosh’s and ultimately SA’s view, see <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 232 and <i>Ohr Sameach</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 17:9.</i>
Rema, as we read above, disagrees and argues that if there is a structural defect, for example, if the wrong construction materials were used or if there is a tottering wall, the sale is invalid. In the words of Netivot ha-Mishpat,<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 232:7.</i> by replacing a tottering wall with a sound wall, does the house receive “<i>panim hadashot</i>” (lit. “a new face”)? Moreover, Netivot Ha-Mishpat contends that if the property cannot be used, it is equivalent to a defect in the “<i>guf ha-bayit</i>,” the physical integrity of the bungalow colony, and therefore rescission is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 233:4. Cf. <i>Magen Elef</i> on <i>Makor Hayyim</i>, <i>OH</i> 437:7.</i> On the other hand, if there are defects that are external to the property, such as bad drainage, the sale is valid and any repairs for these types of defect are to be paid by the seller. Consequently, according to Rema, the inability to use certain bungalow units due to plumbing problems and a non-operative pool is to be viewed as a defect relating to the <i>guf ha-bayit</i>, and therefore the sale is invalid.
In short, according to Shulhan Arukh, the sale would be valid, but Rema would disagree. Without addressing the issue of whether this panel should follow Shulhan Arukh’s position or Rema’s view, endorsed by Netivot ha-Mishpat and others,<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:10; <i>Minhat Pe’tim</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:5.</i> our foregoing presentation assumes that there was an obligation upon the seller to disclose the defects, and that the buyer was exempt from initiating on his own an inspection prior to his purchase. Based upon these premises, we investigated what type of defect will invalidate a sale and we demonstrated that this is a subject of another controversy between Shulhan Arukh and Rema.
But in fact, as we will presently show, there was never any obligation upon the seller to disclose these particular problems, and there was a duty upon the buyer to check the colony. To put it differently, this is a case of “<i>caveat emptor</i>” – “let the buyer beware”. Given the particular circumstances of our case, as will be demonstrated, the onus of all inquiries and inspection regarding the property rests squarely upon the shoulders of the buyer, namely the <i>Nitva</i>!
The question is whether the buyer had <i>gemirat da’at</i> to purchase the bungalow colony with the attendant defects. In a situation in which the buyer could have inspected the property,<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rif</i> 153; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 15:3; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:10; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1206 (136). According to this position, even prior to purchasing the colony, if a buyer refrains from inspection, he has waived his right and therefore cannot rescind the sale. Contra <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 385; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 225; <i>Teshuvot Ranah</i> 1:40; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:5.<br>For others, only upon purchasing the colony would failure to inspect the property be construed that the buyer waived his right to inspection. See <i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, op. cit.; <i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ona’a</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i> 3:38.</i> either by himself or via the services of a third party,<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 3:223.</i> and he refrained from such inspection, it is a debate whether he can subsequently rescind the sale if defects emerge.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 7.</i> Given the debate, one cannot extract money from the seller.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 232:4; <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 8.</i> This assumes that the buyer had already purchased the property. However, if the buyer became aware of the defects prior to transferring the money to the seller, he can rescind the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, ibid., supra n. 7; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 232:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 225; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, supra n. 7. Cf. <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> supra n. 7.<br>Cf. <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 232:1 who argues that only a buyer’s use of the property will extinguish his right to rescind the sale.</i> In our scenario, the buyer became aware of the defects after the sale and paying the purchase money.
However, on the basis of the clause in the sales agreement that specifically states that the colony was being sold “as is,” <i>Tove’a</i> argues that <i>Nitva</i> has no right to advance claims for his construction and repair costs. In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s contention, most <i>Poskim</i> argue that such a clause cannot serve as grounds for rescinding a sale (i.e., <i>mekach ta’ut</i>). In order to be shielded from pleas of <i>mekach ta’ut</i>, it is the seller’s duty to specify the actual <i>mumim</i> (defects) in the property.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 16:6 (and <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 11:16); <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:7; <i>Sma</i>, ad locum 16; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 4; <i>Teshuvot ve-Shav ha-Kohen</i> 45; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:166. Cf. <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 232; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 4:136.</i> A general disclaimer of liability for defects will not be binding upon the buyer.
Moreover, <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, commercial practice, dictates that there are certain assets for which a buyer customarily does perform an inspection.<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 42b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>mekhdei</i>” (Ramban’s second answer).</i> Therefore, if the <i>minhag</i> is not to inspect a prospective buy, then if defects are found after the sale, the seller is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzedaka u-Mishpat HM</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 3:622.</i> For example, in certain times and places, the prevailing <i>minhag</i> was not to inspect courtyards and homes, and therefore Radvaz of sixteenth-century Egypt and Maharsham of twentieth-century Poland ruled that if subsequent to the purchase defects were discovered, the right of rescission is available.<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radvaz</i>, supra n. 16; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:128.</i> However, today where the <i>minhag</i> is to inspect real estate prior to an anticipated purchase, including the plumbing and pool of a bungalow colony, if the buyer fails to perform his due diligence, the right of rescission does not exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, if inspection is impractical, such as checking the plumbing system and/or a pool in the winter months, the seller has an obligation to inform the buyer of any defects and the buyer has not waived his right to an inspection. See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, supra n. 7.</i>
Such a conclusion is equally forthcoming regarding the seller’s duty of disclosure. Not only is the seller prohibited from deceiving or misleading the buyer, but if the seller is aware of any defect, he is obligated to disclose it to the buyer prior to the sale. Generally speaking, there is a duty upon the seller to disclose any defects to the prospective buyer. However, in the absence of the seller’s disclosure of plumbing and pool problems, if the buyer has the opportunity to perform an inspection, or if he refrains from asking whether there are problems, should a sale take place and he subsequently becomes aware of defects, the right of rescission does not exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Ma’akhalot Assurot</i> 8:14; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>YD</i> 1:31. Contra <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 228:6.</i>
Furthermore, even if prevailing practice does not indicate that prospective buyers inspect real estate prior to a sale, as we mentioned, if a buyer who can easily inspect the asset fails to implement such an inspection, there is a controversy whether the buyer has a right to rescind the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, supra n. 7; <i>Rif</i>, supra n. 7; <i>Teshuvot Maharit Zahalon</i> 225.</i> In this case, the buyer could have easily inspected whether the plumbing and pools were functional. And in cases of <i>safek</i> (doubt) one cannot mandate the seller to return the money.<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat Shalom</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Mahari ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 8.</i>
Finally, even if the buyer was unaware of the problems prior to the purchase and even if <i>minhag ha-makom</i>, local practice, did not indicate that inspection is in place, if the buyer utilizes the property after he is aware of the problems, he loses his right to rescind the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 15:3; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:3; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, supra n. 11.</i> Moreover, though there is an opinion that if he used the property knowing that there were problems prior to payment,<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahane Ephraim</i>, <i>Hiddushim</i> on <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mekhira</i> 15:3.</i> he could still rescind the sale, most <i>Poskim</i> disagree.<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 232:3; <i>Teshuvot Galya Masekhet</i> 10.</i> Once payment was made, the buyer’s decision to refrain from inspection is construed as <i>mehila</i> (i.e., a waiver).<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh la-Melekh</i>, <i>Mahane Ephraim</i> and <i>R. Akiva Eiger</i>, supra n. 7.</i> And in our situation, the buyer made the seller aware of these problems and requested remuneration for the repairs after the property was used and bought.
In sum, given that <i>Nitva</i> had adequate opportunity to inspect the pool and other plumbing matters during the month of September, and since there is an established practice to check these matters prior to purchase, and given that there was no duty upon the seller to disclose these defects, there existed <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the buyer upon executing his purchase. In effect, the buyer purchased the bungalow colony with its attendant non-functioning pool and plumbing knowing that he would be paying for these repairs. Consequently, there are no grounds for the <i>Nitva</i> to advance a claim for recovery of the costs of these repairs. Therefore, <i>Nitva</i>’s claim for construction costs and repairs are hereby denied. If the buyer could not advance a claim of <i>mekach ta’ut</i> years ago, there are no grounds now for asking remuneration for repairs.
<b>2. The Conveyance Agreement – A <i>Bona Fide</i> Halakhic Transfer of Ownership, a Lease, or <i>Haspa be-Alma</i>?</b>
Optimally, for an agreement to convey property or lease it to another individual, one must utilize language of <i>hit’hayivut</i>, <i>hak’naah</i>, or <i>sekhirut</i> (an obligation to transference/lease) such as “I obligate myself now to assign exclusive use, ownership, and occupancy of the bungalow.” Generally, an agreement is to be interpreted according to <i>lashon bnei adam</i> (common usage),<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 207; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:21.</i> and common usage of the word “shall” does not denote an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary</i>.</i> Consequently, at first glance, one may conclude that the terminology “… the parties agree as follows: Avraham Cohen … shall have the exclusive use …” is a <i>kinyan eitan</i> (i.e., undertaking a future event). Though Tur, Beit Yosef, and Rema cite both views regarding whether <i>kinyan eitan</i> is an effective mode to transfer assets,<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 105; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 157:2, 245:4; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 195 and 245; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 51, <i>HM</i> 157:4, 203:1.</i> numerous <i>Aharonim</i> reject its effectiveness as a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 70; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:1; <i>Sma</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:2; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, ad locum 1; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:1–2; <i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 80 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:3; <i>PDR</i> 4:275, 10:363; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 5, <i>HM</i> 5.</i> There must be language of <i>hit’hayivut</i> accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>.
Nevertheless, in drafting contracts, should the <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> employ the word “shall” as denoting an obligation, then Halakha would accept the <i>minhag ha-soharim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 68:13; <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 42; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 42:15; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 61:5.</i> and conclude that this agreement utilized proper language of <i>hit’hayivut</i>.

Upon a closer reading of the agreement, the word that attempts to create the obligation is “agrees” rather than “shall.” In other words, the agreement is to be understood as saying that the “… the parties agree Avraham Cohen … shall have the exclusive use …” As such, the agreement is stating that in the future, <i>Nitva</i> agrees that <i>Tove’a</i> will receive exclusive use, ownership, and occupancy of the bungalow. Such a provision of the agreement is a “<i>kinyan devarim</i>.” Employment of the word “agrees” is future-oriented; it does not denote obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rama</i> (R.

Mishmeret Shalom who is unsure whether this language is a “<i>kinyan devarim</i>.” See <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 207:7.<br>However, should a <i>kinyan</i> be performed relating to an agreement that fails to employ language of <i>hit’hayivut</i>, the agreement would be valid. See Rama and Rashba; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 212:1.</i>
However one cannot simply focus on the terminology “Mr. and Mrs. Avraham Cohen … shall have the exclusive use …” One must address the entire conveyance agreement. Among the provisions, it states the following:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Whereas, Venetian Lanes has this date purchased from Jardin Estates, the bungalow colony known as Jardin Estates located in Elizaville, New York, and</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Whereas, as part of the consideration Avraham and Sara Cohen shall have the exclusive ownership and use of one of the bungalows located at Venetian Lanes</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now therefore in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth the parties agree as follows:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">1. Avraham and Sara Cohen, their heirs and assigns shall have the exclusive use, ownership and occupancy of the bungalow located in the main house in the front called “Avraham’s Tent.”</span>
The essence of <i>Nitva</i>’s argument is that the legitimacy of the property transfer is based upon <i>“be-hahi hana’ah gamar u-mesha’bed nafshei</i>.” In other words, because of the benefit of being able to buy the bungalow colony, transfer of ownership of one of the units takes effect.
However, invoking “<i>be-hahi hana’ah gamar u-mesha’bed nafshei</i>” is only effective if stipulated at the time of the actual sale of the bungalow colony.<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 16b–17a; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 123b; <i>Avodah Zara</i> 63b; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bekhorot</i> 18b; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, <i>HM</i> 291:16. Whether “<i>be-hahi hana’ah gamar u-mesha’bed nafshei</i>” is a variation of a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i>, a physical act of acquisition similar to <i>kinyan kesef</i> or <i>halifin</i>, or that the expression of benefit brings the parties to <i>gemirut da’at</i> (firm resolve of the parties) and is a substitute for a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i>, is subject to controversy. See <i>Teshuvot Nahal Yitzhak</i> 40, in particular <i>anafim</i> 3–4.<br>Such barter would be valid even without a <i>kinyan</i> or the presence of witnesses provided that at the time of the agreement each party has the item in his possession. See <i>PDR</i> 6:248–249.<br>The invoking of <i>Nitva</i>’s argument is predicated upon that “<i>be-hahi hana’ah gamar u-mesha’bed nafshei</i>” is effective for transference of assets as well as undertaking an obligation. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 106b.</i> In other words, the <i>Nitva</i> would have had to stipulate at the time of the actual sale of the colony that in consideration of purchasing the colony, <i>Nitva</i> is assigning ownership of one unit to the <i>Tove’a</i>. Such a stipulation was absent from the sales agreement. In our case, the conveyance agreement was executed <i>after</i> the sale, and consequently, “<i>be-hahi hana’ah gamar u-mesha’bed nafshei</i>” is inapplicable.
What actually transpired here? Conventionally under NY law, parties execute a conveyance agreement wherein in consideration for ten dollars and covenants and promises, a deed will convey the property. To put it differently, to transfer property or a lease requires <i>gemirat da’at</i> that is expressed in utilizing a language of <i>hit’hayivut</i> accompanied by <i>a kinyan</i>. Here, the parties chose to execute an agreement that, “in their eyes,” they were <i>gomeir da’atam</i> (firmly resolved) without employing a language of <i>hit’hayivut</i> and without the issuance of a deed required by law or any <i>kinyan</i> recognized by Halakha.
In the absence of language of <i>hit’hayivut</i>, one requires the performance of an act of <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 8:6; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 207:2.</i> In our case, such an action never transpired. The question is, in the absence of a <i>kinyan</i>, can one argue that such an agreement is binding? According to many <i>Poskim</i>, where there is clear evidence of <i>gemirat da’at</i>, the <i>kinyan</i> is obtained by the <i>gemirat da’at</i>, and therefore, such an arrangement is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aliyot de-Rabbeinu Yona</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 84b; <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 123b, s.v. “<i>hakhi garsinan</i>” (as understood by <i>Rashash</i>, ad locum; R.

Moreover, even Beit Yosef and Rema, who allow parties to execute an agreement without the prescribed <i>kinyan</i>, stipulate that only a recognized <i>kinyan</i> may be utilized. For example, both Beit Yosef and Rema will permit <i>metaltelin</i> (chattel) to be transferred with <i>kinyan kesef</i> though <i>min ha-din</i>, <i>metaltelin</i> cannot be transferred with <i>kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 195; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 195:5.

The reply is that such private stipulation will be invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 198:5; <i>Shakh</i>, ad locum 10.</i>
Furthermore, in contradistinction to a private agreement, a <i>kinyan</i> is not required in order to impart validity to a public agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 6:19, 21; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 457–458; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:8–9.<br>Nonetheless, if the promise was given without authorization, the promise is unenforceable. For example, if the promise was given without prior approval of the majority of the seven elders or undermined the welfare of the community, the promise is null and void. See <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 666; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i>, <i>HM</i> 61; <i>PDR</i> 6:166, 173.</i> Therefore, if a communal institution, such as a municipal body, a yeshiva, or a synagogue, makes a promise, the body is duty-bound to comply with it. However, one of the exceptions to this rule is when dealing with the sale of land. For a land sale to be effective, the communal institution must execute a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 45.</i> Certainly in our case, dealing with the affairs of private individuals, a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i> must accompany the land transfer!
Finally, the <i>Tove’a</i> assumes that parties can create their own <i>kinyan situmta</i>, a mode of undertaking an obligation that is rooted in their own <i>gemirat da’at</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Tuv Ta’am ve-Da’at</i>, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 74, 269; <i>Minhat Asher</i>, <i>Bereishit</i> 208–209.</i> but most <i>Poskim</i> argue otherwise.

For the conveyance agreement to be viewed as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, it must be reflective of <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>, and such a <i>minhag</i> must be based upon the requirements of what secular law mandates for property transfer.

It simply means that the parties are free to execute an agreement with a <i>ma’aseh kinyan</i>. And, subsequently, it becomes their duty to receive a deed to attest to the property transfer.</i> Secular law requires the issuance of a deed as a prerequisite for property transfer, and that is not provided for in this conveyance agreement.

In other words, <i>Poskim</i> have recognized a <i>kinyan situmta</i> based upon <i>minhag ha-soharim</i> such as placing a seal on an item, a handshake, a coin transfer, etc., or based upon secular law.<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 74a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad locum; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 12:39 in the name of <i>R.

As such, the weight of halakhic opinion is to reject this conveyance agreement as a <i>bona fide kinyan situmta</i>.
Given that <i>Poskim</i> recognize our modern-day contract as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam HM</i> 280; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:8; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), <i>YD</i> 233; <i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 201:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharshag</i> 3:113; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>PDR</i> 3:363, 4:193, 275, 6:202, 14:43.</i> the question is whether the conveyance agreement generates a lease and/or use in the bungalow unit.

Krolick</i>, 96 AD 2d 695, 466 NYS 2d 788 (3d Dept. 1983).</i> As such, by dint of an easement, <i>Tove’a</i> has been granted exclusive use of the unit. Alternatively, we view this conveyance agreement as granting the <i>Tove’a</i> a perpetual lease of rent-free space.<sup class="footnote-marker">356</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly, this conclusion violates the rule against perpetuities that prohibits property transfer for an unreasonable period of time. Given that the interest granted was a present grant of a lease, the rule against perpetuities is inapplicable due to the fact that this rule deals with contingent future interests. In other words, the rule applies to a legal right to property that does not include the right to present possession or enjoyment of the property. See John Gray, “The Rule against Perpetuities,” Sec. 230 (4th ed. 1942); <i>Camerlo v. Howard Johnson Co</i>., 710 F. 2d 987, Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, 1983; <i>Bleecker Street Tenants Corp. v. Bleeker Jones LLC</i>, NY Court of Appeals, No. 12, February 24, 2011.</i>
Given that NY law will validate this conveyance agreement, Halakha will recognize this agreement conveying use and occupancy of this unit as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>.
In sum, the foregoing shows that the requirement of employing certain language and mandating a <i>kinyan</i>, must “objectively” demonstrate <i>gemirat da’at</i>. Though most <i>Poskim</i> will invalidate <i>kinyan situmta</i> grounded in the subjective intentions of the parties, nevertheless, given that secular law recognizes this agreement, Halakha also validates it.
<b>3. The Conveyance of the Ownership of the Bungalow Unit: Is it a <i>Tenai</i> of the Sale of the Colony?</b>
The question is whether there is a basis for concluding that the <i>Tove’a</i> actually owns the unit. R. Dovid Babad, a famed nineteenth-century <i>Posek</i> of Galicia, communicates to us a <i>mesorah</i> (tradition) that he received:<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havatzelet ha-Sharon</i> 2:28. This approach was adopted by some <i>Poskim</i> in areas of <i>ishut</i> (family Halakha) questions. See <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i>, <i>EH</i> 56; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 9:150.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I heard from ha-Gaon R. Barish Rapaport … that he had a <i>mesorah</i> from his Rav, ha-Gaon Noda be-She’arim, <i>Av Beit Din</i> of Lublin, that upon receiving a question to address, he would first weigh in his mind the truthfulness of the matter according to what human reason dictates and if in his estimation human reason the matter is true, then he would delve into Halakha to arrive at a decision.</span>
Even if Halakha and secular law invalidate this conveyance agreement in terms of transferring ownership from the <i>Nitva</i> to the <i>Tove’a</i>, reason dictates that there was an agreement of property transfer consummated verbally between the parties. In fact, we have a signed agreement that memorializes this arrangement. So the question before this panel is whether this arrangement was finalized <i>verbally</i> prior to the sale of the colony, and there actually was a <i>tenai</i> to consummate the sale, or was it only initially discussed and finalized after the closing? Obviously, both possibilities exist and the question is: How do we determine when the verbal agreement actually transpired? Addressing our dilemma, R. Yosef ibn Lev addresses a <i>kashrut</i> question posed to him. A <i>halef</i> (knife) for <i>shehita</i> (slaughtering) must be free of nicks. Consequently, prior to <i>shehita</i>, the <i>shohet</i> (ritual slaughterer) must have his <i>halef</i> inspected by a rabbi. In this case, the rabbi ruled that the knife was <i>pasul</i> (invalid) and therefore could not be used for <i>shehita</i>. However, another individual, unaware of the rabbi’s ruling, showed the <i>halef</i> to another rabbi who declared it kosher, and the knife was used to slaughter meat. After the animal was slaughtered, the knife was examined for a third time, and again it was ruled to be <i>pasul</i> for <i>shehita</i>.
The question is: What is the status of meat slaughtered with a <i>halef</i> that was <i>pasul</i>, but prior to the slaughtering, was found to be kosher? At first glance, we should conclude that the meat is kosher because we may assume that the knife had been repaired prior to the <i>shehita</i>. Moreover, if a <i>halef</i> is known to be kosher and subsequently is discovered to be nicked, any meat that was slaughtered with the <i>halef</i> is kosher because we may assume that the nick occurred after the meat was slaughtered. Such reasoning would lead one to conclude that the meat is kosher. However, in this case, this reasoning would have to be predicated upon the following facts: The <i>halef</i> was repaired between the first and second inspection, but was subsequently nicked before the third inspection. In light of the low degree of probability that the events occurred in that fashion, R. Yosef Ibn Lev refrained from declaring the meat kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Marharival</i> 1:57.</i>
The implications of his position are that if there is a high degree of probability that a certain chain of events transpired, then a <i>dayan</i> can invoke <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> (sound inference/common sense) and conclude that the events in actuality happened. To apply this ruling to our case, it is highly unlikely that the parties initially discussed an arrangement of transferring the unit after the closing and then prepared and executed the conveyance document. The more likely sequence of events is that this matter was discussed and finalized verbally <i>prior</i> to the closing. In other words, in consummating a real estate deal (or for that matter, any commercial transaction) concerned parties stipulate any and all of their conditions to the sale prior to the sale. There is an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> that our parties, as experienced and astute businessmen, conducted themselves according to <i>minhag ha-soharim</i>. Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, no facts exist to rebut this presumption. It is evident that the sale of the colony was contingent (i.e., a <i>tenai</i>) upon receiving ownership of the bungalow unit. And relying upon an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i>, one can be “<i>motzi mamon</i>” (extract money) from a <i>Nitva</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i>, <i>kelal</i> 69; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 1:84, 3:289; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i>, 387; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 99:8; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>,15:2; <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sasson</i> 45; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Maharit ha-Hadashot</i> 19, 42; <i>Teshuvot Darkhei Noam</i>, <i>HM</i> 52; <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 41; <i>PDR</i> 9:341, 17:321, 21:148; File No. 813075/1, Supreme Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>. Additionally, see <i>Rishonim</i> and <i>Aharonim</i> cited by <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alsheich</i> 40, <i>Sdei Hemmed</i>, <i>Ma’arechet Aleph</i>, 187 (p. 100), <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 1:15, <i>Hagahot Beit Yosef</i> 20; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:9.<br>Cf. <i>Alfasi on Ketuvot</i> 43b; <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 24:2; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 15:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:287, 3:551; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 129; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 15:2; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i> 3, <i>Mahadura Kama</i> 152; <i>Even ha-Ezel</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 8:14.<br>According to some <i>Poskim</i>, in cases in which the <i>Nitva</i>’s submissions are grounded in lies, one can invoke an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> and extract money. See <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 99:8; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i>, 3:142; <i>PDR</i> 12:75.<br>Implicit in our position is that the invoking of <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> is not limited to appraising the intent of the parties, but equally extends to assessing whether an event actually transpired. See <i>Sefer Kovetz Shiurim</i> (Wasserman) 1:580, 2:38.</i> based upon a signed <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement).<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shevut Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 65; <i>Teshuvot Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 3:32; <i>Piskei Din Yerushalayim</i> 1:209; <i>PDR</i> 9:331, 19:106; File no. 1-35-8935, supra n. 30; File no. 826201-2, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 4, 2013.</i>
Lest one challenge this conclusion due to the fact that NY law requires title transfer and issuance of a deed. In the absence of a deed, we are dealing with an illegal contract. And, in fact, according to NY law, a party to an illegal contract cannot request a civil court to help him carry out his illegal act.<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabia v. Mattituck Inlet Mar. &amp; Shipyard, Inc</i>. 24 AD 3d 178 (2005); <i>Bonilla v. Rotter</i>, 2007 NY Slip Op. 449, NY Appellate Div., 1st Dept. 2007.</i>
Moreover, to conclude that the <i>Tove’a</i> now owns the property without a title is seemingly a violation of Halakha. As we know, the consensus is that with regard to matters of <i>karka’ot</i> (land), there is an imperative to follow the laws enacted by the civil authority (“<i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i>”).<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 447 (in the name of R. Eliezer of Metz); <i>SA</i>, <i>Rema</i>, <i>HM</i> 369:8; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:29; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 83<i>.</i></i> Consequently, transferring ownership without a deed entails non-compliance with the dictates of the government, and therefore, such conduct is halakhically proscribed.<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, 2:239; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 50.</i>
However, in bold contrast to NY law, Halakha views an illegal contract very differently. Professor Moshe Silberg, a renowned twentieth-century Israeli jurist observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe Silberg, <i>Talmudic Law and the Modern State</i>, New York: Burning Bush, 1973, 82.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We see clearly that Jewish law does not establish a causal connection between the commission of an offense and the voiding of a civil contract … The violation of the law or morality is one thing, and the legal validity of the contract is another – to the extent that the fulfilling of the contract itself does not activate the offense … Precisely because Jewish law does not distinguish between law and morality, and that practically every performance of an obligation is at the same time a fulfillment of a religio-moral commandment – as “the commandment” of repaying a debt of monetary obligation – the non-fulfillment of a contract entered into through a violation of law will only turn out to be an additional offense to supplement the original one committed by the transgressor.</span>
To put it differently, the agreement is illegal only if the essential terms of the agreement are illegal. In other words, one must distinguish between the conduct that is prohibited and the actual agreement. For example, if a husband tells his wife, “I will give you your <i>get</i> (Jewish divorce) on the condition that you consume non-kosher meat,” and she eats it, she is divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 84b.</i> Or if party agrees to hire witnesses who are deceitful, the agreement is valid. Though the actual testimony is prohibited, nevertheless the agreement to hire such witnesses does not entail an <i>issur</i>, and one is obligated to comply with his duty to abide by the agreement and must remit the monies for the hiring.<sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 9:1.</i> Similarly, if an individual executes an agreement with a prostitute to engage in an illicit affair, though the affair is prohibited, nevertheless, one must fulfill one’s commitment and therefore comply with the agreement and remit money for her services.<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>EH</i> 87:25; <i>Teshuvot Sho’el u-Meishiv</i>, <i>Mahadura Revia’a</i> 3:39.</i>
In our situation, one must differentiate between the parties’ decision to transfer ownership without the issuance of a deed, which involves a halakhic violation of failing to comply with the dictates of civil law, and the undertaking of the actual agreement between the parties. In other words, though the parties are engaging in an <i>issur</i>, i.e., non-compliance with the law of the state of NY, nevertheless, <i>Nitva</i> has an obligation to fulfill the terms of the conveyance agreement, including but not limited to the transfer of ownership.
In short, the bungalow unit belongs to the <i>Nitva</i> with the <i>Nitva</i> having granted an irrevocable right to the <i>Tove’a</i> to occupy and use the unit. Therefore there are grounds for his claim for recouping lost rental revenue due to being unable to occupy the unit for a period of years.
<b>4. A Promise: Is it a Halakhically Enforceable Obligation?</b>
At some juncture in time prior to the execution of the sale of the colony, the parties agreed to the amount of the purchase, which would be paid at the closing, and <i>Nitva</i> orally promised to pay an additional $100,000 in cash for the purchase of Jardin Estates. Is such a promise a halakhically enforceable obligation?
According to the <i>din</i>, there are two components required in the undertaking of an obligation: effectuating a <i>kinyan</i> (i.e., symbolic act of acquisition) and <i>gemirat da’at</i> (i.e., a concrete articulation of the parties’ firm resolve to undertake the obligation). The act of promising reflects the absence of <i>gemirat da’at</i>, either because a promise entails executing an obligation in the future (e.g., a promise to sell goods) or a promise is in respect to transferring title of something that is not yet in existence (i.e., <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i>), such as an item that has not been produced or is not in his possession (i.e., <i>eino bi-reshuto</i>), and therefore such promises are unenforceable in a <i>beit din</i>. <i>Nitva</i>’s promise is an example of a <i>davar she-lo ba la-olam</i> because it entails the commitment to remit a sum of money in the future, i.e., upon the consummation of the purchase of a bungalow colony
The consequence of reneging upon a promise is stated in Shulhan Arukh and Rema in the following fashion:<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:7; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 204:11.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When one conducts and concludes commercial transactions using words only (the negotiation and agreement not being completed by a formal act of acquisition), that person should stand by his word, even though none of the purchase price has been taken, nor a buyer’s mark made on the goods … Whoever withdraws from this type of transaction, whether buyer or seller, is deemed a faithless person.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Rema</i>: A person should stand by his word even though no act of acquisition has been performed, and only mere words have passed between the parties …</span>
Where no payment has been made, and the seller articulates an oral commitment to sell realty or personalty to a prospective buyer and the deal is finalized,<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meiri</i>, <i>Beit ha-Behira</i>,<i>Bava Metzia</i> 49a, s.v. “<i>gamru</i>.”</i> should either party then renege on the agreement of sale, he is stigmatized as a <i>mehusar amana</i> (lit. “lacking faith”). Given that no act of acquisition (i.e., <i>kinyan</i>) has been executed between the parties, technically either party may withdraw from consummating the sale. The noncompliance with the promise is unenforceable. Enforceability depends upon the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>.
According to the Halakha of obligations, i.e., <i>hit’hayivut</i>, the promisor (in this case the <i>Nitva</i>) must obligate himself rather than promise to pay “X” number of dollars. For example, the use of language such as “I obligate myself to pay Abraham Doe such and such,” “I undertake to pay … ,” “I am obligated to pay … ,” or “I admit that I am obligated to <i>Tove’a</i> such and such” are all <i>leshonot</i> (language) of obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:6; <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:13; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 60:3; <i>Teshuvot Maharshakh</i> 3:173; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>HM</i> 29.</i> The common denominator of these different terms of accepting a commitment is that with this language, one transforms himself into a debtor <i>now</i>. Consequently, <i>min ha-din</i> – in accordance with Halakha – a promise to remit only entails a future action and therefore has no legal validity.<sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a; <i>Rashi</i>, ad locum, s.v. “<i>kinyan devarim hu</i>”; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 245:1.</i> In fact, in response to actual instances of individuals making promises in commercial matters, <i>Poskim</i> have ruled that these promises are beyond the pale of enforceability by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, <i>shoresh</i> 133:2; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 278; <i>Teshuvot Berakh Moshe Galante</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yitzhak</i> (Abulafia) 6:6.</i>
Nonetheless, despite the absence of the mention of the aforementioned monies in the closing statement, there is an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i>, i.e., it is objectively evident, that he did not waive his right to these monies. For example, Reuven sells real estate to Shimon and during the negotiations Reuven informs Shimon that he is selling the land because he is moving to Eretz Yisrael. Should Reuven cancel his move, the sale is null and void. Despite the fact that there was no <i>tenai kaful</i>, a double condition, it is objectively evident that the sale was contingent upon Reuven’s move.<sup class="footnote-marker">373</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 49b, s.v. “<i>devarim</i>”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 49b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 34:1; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:4; <i>Mishpat Shalom</i> 207:1; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Shoham</i> 60. For additional <i>Poskim</i> who endorse applying an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> in contemporary times, see <i>Teshuvot Ba’ei Hayyei</i> 1, <i>HM</i> 41.<br>Even if one would argue that one cannot invoke an <i>umdana de-mukhah</i> in contemporary times to extract monies, pursuant to the arbitration agreement that this matter is resolved in accordance with the <i>din</i> or <i>peshara</i>, a <i>beit din</i> panel is empowered to extract money from the <i>Nitva</i>. See <i>Shevut Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 65.<br>Given that we are dealing with a <i>tenai</i> that is communicated verbally, according to many <i>Poskim</i> there is no need to utilize a <i>tenai kaful</i>.

In fact, one could advance the argument that even if the <i>Tove’a</i> had not conditioned the sale upon receipt of the monies, the condition would be valid. As Rosh states,<sup class="footnote-marker">374</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 81:1; <i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:4; <i>Knesset ha-Gedola</i>, <i>HM</i> 207 in the name of <i>Rivash</i>.</i> “if the situation is such that his intentions are clear, even if he does not indicate the sale is under these conditions, the conditions are binding.” And this conclusion would be applicable even if the condition were not reiterated at the time of the closing.<sup class="footnote-marker">375</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 207:1. Cf. <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 207:19.</i>

If a person makes an oral commitment regarding a condition of the sale and fails to have this condition incorporated in the sales agreement, there is a controversy about whether this is an indication that he has waived this condition.

In sum, in construing the promise as a <i>tenai</i>, <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to pay $100,000 to the <i>Tove’a</i>.

<b>Final Thoughts</b>
<b>Access to the Bungalow Unit</b>
Does the fact that the contract fails to grant the <i>Tove’a</i> a right of way to his bungalow preclude him from accessing his bungalow? Does a person who has occupancy and use of a house fly in the air in order to access his home?<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">A similar type of argument was set forth in <i>Bava Batra</i> 64b.</i> Shulhan Arukh states,<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 214:2 (end).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If someone sells a pit or a cistern, the buyer does not have to acquire a right of way to the pit or cistern. The buyer may enter the seller’s house to go the cistern and draw water.</span>
Similarly, in our situation, upon receiving occupancy and use of the bungalow unit, the <i>Tove’a</i> does not have to formally acquire a right of way from the <i>Nitva</i>. Rather, <i>Tove’a</i> can access his home via the road of the bungalow colony that belongs to the <i>Nitva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote">Whether the right of way belongs to the <i>Tove’a</i> or he simply has use of the access road is beyond our discussion. However, some <i>Rishonim</i> view the right as strictly a <i>shi’abud</i> in the form of an easement. See <i>Rashbam</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 82a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 64b.</i>
Should the <i>Nitva</i> refuse to grant the <i>Tove’a</i> a right of way, R. Greineman argues,<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushim u-Bi’urim</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i> 64a.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When the seller refuses to sell him the access road, seemingly the buyer can nullify the sale … What is the value of a pit and cistern which have no access to them?</span>
If the buyer cannot make use of his purchase there was no purpose to his acquisition of the property. Without citing Netivot ha-Mishpat,<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 7.</i> R. Greineman ascribes to the approach that non-use of the property purchased is equivalent to a defect in the “<i>guf ha-bayit</i>,” and therefore rescission is permitted. Similarly, in our scenario, the right to occupy/use the property implicitly assumes that the <i>Tove’a</i> has access to the road(s) leading to the bungalow unit.

h) A Wayward Torah Heir

<b>H. A Wayward Torah Heir</b>
<b>Facts</b>
A father authorized his attorney to prepare a last will and testament in accordance with NJ estate law. Among the terms of the testamentary disposition was a provision that his son (hereafter: <i>Tove’a</i>) and his daughter (hereafter: <i>Nitva’at</i>) would share equally in their father’s estate.
Upon the father’s demise, <i>Tove’a</i> filed an action in civil court alleging that though the will stated that the <i>Nitva’at</i> was the executor of the estate, nevertheless, subsequently, their father changed his mind and wanted the <i>Tove’a</i> to be the executor. In accordance with the terms of the civil will, the executor was to receive remuneration for his services. Based upon the submission of cumulative evidence, the court determined that the <i>Tove’a</i> was the executor of the estate and in fact was to receive compensation for his past services. Subsequently, <i>Tove’a</i> summoned the <i>Nitva’at</i> to appear in <i>beit din</i> for the purpose of challenging the halakhic validity of the civil will.
<b><i>Tove’a</i>’s Claims</b>
Given that according to Torah law, when the heirs are a son and a daughter, the entire estate of their father is to be transferred to the Torah heir, namely the son, the <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to the entire inheritance.
<b><i>Nitva’at</i>’s Reply</b>
In reply to <i>Tove’a</i>’s claim, <i>Nitva’at</i> claims that there are various halakhic justifications for affirming a civil will. Moreover, the <i>beit din</i> should disinherit the <i>Tove’a</i> due to his decision to proceed to court to resolve the matter of the executor of the estate and then to proceed to <i>beit din</i> to deal with the halakhic propriety of the civil will. Apparently, concerning the issue of the executor, <i>Tove’a</i> believed that a civil judgment would be handed down in his favor. After receiving a civil ruling in his favor, and knowing that contesting a civil will in court would fail, <i>Tove’a</i> promptly proceeded to <i>beit din</i> to challenge the halakhic propriety of the civil will. Such forum shopping, argues <i>Nitva’at</i>, ought to be discredited by the <i>beit din</i>. Finally, <i>Nitva’at</i> advanced the claim to recoup her expenses incurred by having to appear in civil court at the <i>Tove’a</i>’s request.
<b>Discussion</b>
Without addressing the halakhic merits of affirming a civil testamentary disposition<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter Two.</i> and assuming that <i>Tove’a</i> is entitled to the entire estate as the Torah heir, we will demonstrate that he should receive only the share of the inheritance that has been earmarked for him in the testamentary disposition.
<b>1. Litigation in Secular Court</b>
The <i>Tove’a</i>’s initial decision to address this matter in a secular court is a violation of Halakha. The Torah states “<i>ve-eleh ha-mishpatim asher tasim lifneihem</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot</i> 321:1.</i> from which the Talmud expounds “<i>lifneihem – ve-lo lifnei akum</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 88b.</i> As such, the Talmud understands that there is an <i>issur</i> against adjudicating one’s claims in a non-Jewish court. According to the Midrash Tanhuma,<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpatim</i> 3.</i> subsequently codified in Mishneh Torah and Shulhan Arukh,<sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Sanhedrin</i> 26:7; <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:1.</i> one who litigates his dispute in a civil jurisdiction “has cursed and raised a hand against the Torah of Moses.” As R. Dovid ben Zimra notes, appearance before a civil tribunal demonstrates that the <i>Tove’a</i> believes that the halakhic system is false and contributes to the removal of the <i>Shekhinah</i> (Divine presence) from the Jewish community.<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 4:1190.</i> According to many <i>Poskim</i>, this is an <i>issur de’oraita</i>, a biblical prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:290; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:172; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, <i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:3; <i>Hukot Hayyim</i>, <i>HM</i> 1. Others argue that the prohibition is rabbinic in nature. See, for example, <i>Sefer Mekor Barukh</i> 32.</i>
Even if a decision would not be handed down by the secular tribunal, the <i>issur</i> of litigating in a civil court has been committed. As Shulhan Arukh states, “It is forbidden to adjudicate”<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:1.</i> – the mere appearance in a civil court activates the <i>issur</i>. Even if an individual plans to resolve the matter in <i>beit din</i> and simply wants to place pressure upon the defendant by commencing an action in court, such behavior violates the prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">B.T. Wosner, “Litigating in Civil Court” (Hebrew), 3 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> 195 (5758).</i> Similarly, attempting to forge a compromise does not allow a plaintiff to commence a claim in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Minhat Asher</i>, <i>Devarim</i> 3:1.</i> Consequently, <i>Tove’a</i>’s commencement of a claim in civil court entails a transgression of “<i>lifneihem – ve-lo lifnei akum</i>.”
<b>2. “A Sinner Should Not Benefit”</b>
Addressing the civil court’s ruling that <i>Tove’a</i> is the executor of the estate, <i>Tove’a</i>’s conduct is at variance with the rule that a sinner ought not to benefit from the fruits of his improper behavior. In the words of the Talmud, “a sinner should not profit” from his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 92b.</i> For example, though a sale of property on Shabbat will be final and deemed valid, nevertheless, if the purchaser accrued a profit from the sale, then he should donate his profits to the poor rather than benefit from his sin of negotiating a sale on Shabbat.<sup class="footnote-marker">395</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 258 in the name of <i>Rabbeinu Gershon</i>.</i> Or, generally speaking, if I appoint a <i>shaliach</i> (agent) to perform an act, I am obligated to pay compensation for the <i>shaliach</i>’s efforts. Based upon what we have explained, the same is true for a <i>shaliach</i> who performs an act that is in contravention of Halakha on my behalf. However, in light of the principle that a sinner cannot profit from his sin, should the <i>shaliach</i> advance a claim for recovery of his fee for services rendered, <i>beit din</i> will penalize him and deny him any monetary relief.<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ma’arkhei Lev</i> 113.</i> Addressing the halakhic rule that the profits earned by a professional dice player do not have to be returned,<sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA</i>, <i>HM</i> 370:7.</i> should he regularly engage in such conduct, Radvaz concludes that he should be penalized and the profits should be returned to the losers.<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:517.</i> Such conclusions were endorsed by others.<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:551, 962, 2:148; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:145.</i>
In fact, the rule that “he should not profit from his sinning” has been applied in <i>yerusha</i> matters. For example, dealing with a Torah heir who is a <i>mumar</i> (apostate), as well as a <i>yoresh</i> (heir) who murders his father in order to receive his inheritance, Rambam rules that he may be disinherited.<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rambam</i>, Blau ed., 275; Rabinowitz-Teomim, <i>Hukat Mishpat</i>, <i>perek</i> 2, <i>se’if</i> 11.</i> Obviously, the act of homicide does not impact upon his status as a <i>yoresh</i>. However, to allow a <i>yoresh</i> to receive his <i>yerusha</i> after murdering his father is a vivid illustration of a sinner benefiting from “the fruits of his sin,” and as we know Halakha disapproves of a sinner profiting from his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 92b; Eliav Shochetman, <i>The Illegality of an Act</i> (Hebrew), Yerushalayim, 1981, 250.</i>
Whether this rule of “he should not profit from his sinning” operates <i>min ha-din</i>, in accordance with black-letter Halakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Yashar le-Rabbeinu Tam</i>, <i>Helek ha-Hiddushim</i> 112.</i> or as a penal measure for one who is exploiting the halakhic process – akin to the principle “since he acted improperly, therefore, we will act improperly towards him”<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 4:16. For further discussion of this rule, see infra text accompanying nn. 21–49.</i> – is a subject of debate.
In our scenario, given that <i>Tove’a</i> engaged in improper behavior by proceeding to civil court, he should not potentially profit from his sin by receiving remuneration for past services as mandated by the civil court.
<b>3. The Rule “Since He Acted Improperly, We Act Improperly Towards Him”</b>
Regarding <i>Tove’a</i>’s decision to initially proceed to civil court in order to resolve the dispute and then to appear in <i>beit din</i> to adjudicate another matter, <i>Tove’a</i>’s conduct is reminiscent of the various <i>teshuvot</i> of Rosh dealing with fraudulent conveyances, i.e., the debtor attempts to prevent the creditor from collecting his debt by assigning his assets to a third party. In one of them, Reuven was obligated to Shimon on an oral loan, so he gave all his property to Levi in order to defeat Shimon’s claim. In reply, Rosh concludes that the transfer to Levi was a sham and we must invalidate this legal transaction. The fact that he transfered all of his assets to a third party clearly indicates that his intent was to defraud Reuven of the money entitled to him. Can one imagine, <i>Rosh</i> exclaims, that a person who is bereft of his assets would need to beg from door to door in order to receive his daily subsistence? Obviously, the transaction was a sham in order to evade his duty to repay the loan. As Rosh himself states, if one swears that he will sell his assets in order to avoid repaying his debt, it is akin to “swearing to nullify a <i>mitzva</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 8:2.</i>
As Rosh notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 78:1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Whenever anyone sought to scheme against his fellow, the Sages of the Talmud stood against him to frustrate his plan. And we shall draw inferences and reach conclusions by analogy from one case to another, for the Sages of the Talmud were unable to specify everything that would happen in the future.</span>
Consequently, on the basis of a <i>hekesh</i> (reasoning by analogy) from the facts and the ruling of Rosh (and others<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:942; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 187; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 387; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>YD</i> 133; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:170. For the role of <i>hekesh</i> in the halakhic process, see this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, 53–57.</i>), as well as the various passages in the Talmud that state “since he acted improperly, therefore, we will act improperly with him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 110a; <i>Ketuvot</i> 86a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 48b; <i>Gittin</i> 40a.</i> we conclude that in our situation <i>Tove’a</i> acted improperly by commencing an action in civil court. A Torah-observant Jew must bring all claims to a <i>beit din</i> rather than bifurcate one’s claims between <i>beit din</i> and civil court so as to exploit each institution for the sake of generating the optimum in financial profits. Such forum shopping is halakhically unconscionable.
In short, invoking both rules “since he acted improperly, therefore, we will act improperly with him” and “he should not profit from his sinning” leads this panel to the conclusion that the <i>Tove’a</i>’s behavior ought to impact upon the amount he should receive from his father’s estate.
In fact, we have a case of <i>yerusha</i> (inheritance) dating back to Mishnaic times in which Torah heirs were deprived of their rightful share due to acting improperly. <i>Tove’a</i>’s pattern of behavior is remindful of the Mishnah that recounts the story of Bnei Rokhel. The Mishnah states:<sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 9:7.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If someone distributes his property verbally, R. Eliezer states: whether he is healthy or critically ill, the properties which can be subject to a lien are acquired through money … Those which cannot become subject to a lien are acquired by <i>meshikha</i> [“pulling” – a form of acquisition]. They said to him: It occurred with the mother of the sons of Rokhel that she was ill and she said, “Give my veil to my daughter; it is worth twelve <i>maneh</i>,” and she died, and they upheld her words. He said to them: As to the sons of Rokhel, their mother should bury them.</span>
In the Mishnah, a dispute is recorded between the Hakhamim (Scholars) and R. Eliezer whether the gift of a dying man (<i>matnat shekhiv mera</i>) can be effected solely by word of mouth, or whether one requires the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>. Challenging R. Eliezer’s position, Hakhamim invoke the story of the mother of Bnei Rokhel (the name of the mother) who while dying, gifted verbally an asset to her daughter. Obviously, a verbal instruction is sufficient! In response to the challenge, R. Eliezer informs us that the Bnei Rokhel were sinners, and therefore the Scholars penalized the sons and validated the gift even though no <i>kinyan</i> was performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbeinu Gershon</i>, <i>Rashbam</i>, and <i>Meiri</i> on <i>Bava Batra</i> 156b; <i>Bah</i>, <i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 228:1.</i> In other words, in the absence of the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>, the sons should have inherited the asset, but since the sons were sinners who planted <i>kilayim</i>, a forbidden mixture of seeds, the Scholars penalized them by disinheriting them due to their improper behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Their improper behavior was the fact that they planted <i>kilayim</i>. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 156b.<br>In other words, even though their improper conduct was unrelated to their monetary entitlement to the asset of <i>yerusha</i>, nonetheless, the Scholars felt empowered to penalize them with regard to the <i>yerusha</i> due to improper behavior unrelated to the <i>yerusha</i>.</i>
In accordance with the <i>din</i>, the strict Halakha, the wicked sons should have retained their inheritance. Firstly, as the Mishnah instructs us, the ensuing punishment of violating the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kilayim</i> entails a confiscation of the field itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shekalim</i> 1:2.</i> Moreover, Shmuel’s instructions, which state “keep away from inheritance transfers from a bad to a good son, much more so when they are from a son to daughter,” <sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 133b.</i> ought to propel this panel to the conclusion that the sons of Rokhel should have retained their <i>yerusha</i> as memorialized in their father’s will. Nonetheless, the Mishnah teaches us that we are empowered to disinherit Torah heirs due to their engagement in a sin that our authorities want others to refrain from emulating (as we will explain below).
If our Hakhamim in the Mishnah or Talmud penalized a person who transgressed the <i>issur</i> of <i>kilayim</i>, a man who forced a woman to consent to <i>kiddushin</i> (halakhic betrothal), or who snatched a girl for the sake of marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">413</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 48b; <i>Yevamot</i> 110a.</i> <i>a fortiori</i>, in our situation in which the <i>Tove’a</i> transgressed an <i>issur</i> of litigating in secular court, he ought to be penalized! Lest one challenge that Mishnah’s position ought to be limited to an individual who engages in the transgression of the <i>issur</i> of <i>kilayim</i>, Pnei Mavin argues that the rabbinic penal powers extend to any <i>issurim</i> transgressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">414</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pnei Mavin</i> 1:233 (140b).</i> In fact, as we pointed out, Talmud itself invokes this penal authority regarding the transgression of other prohibitions. Such empowerment was not limited to the period of the Tannaim (scholars of the Mishnah), but was also implemented by the Amoraim (sages of the Talmud),<sup class="footnote-marker">415</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 110a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 48b; <i>Gittin</i> 40a; <i>Ketuvot</i> 86a.</i> Rishonim (medieval authorities<i>)</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">416</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:942; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 78:1–2; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 44.</i> and Aharonim (later authorities).<sup class="footnote-marker">417</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 3:873; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, <i>YD</i> 133; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:170.</i>
In fact, interestingly enough, though unaware of a <i>beit din</i>’s penal capacity and relying upon Turkish law, R. Yehoshua Ehrenburg of twentieth-century Eretz Yisrael concludes that Halakha should follow secular law and should disinherit a Torah heir who is a murderer.<sup class="footnote-marker">418</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 1:100.</i> Given that there is an oft-cited NY case, <i>Riggs v. Palmer</i>, in which an heir was deprived of her inheritance due to killing her father,<sup class="footnote-marker">419</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Riggs v. Palmer</i>, 115 NY 506 (1889).</i> contrary to Ohr Sameach’s view,<sup class="footnote-marker">420</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Sameach</i>, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 7:14. See also, <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 17:18.</i> R. Ehrenburg would argue that NY law ought to be applicable in our case. In effect, <i>dina de-malkhuta dina</i> is to be determinative in a case of a <i>yoresh</i> who acted improperly! To state it differently, had our case involved <i>Nitva</i>’s infraction of civil law, a <i>beit din</i> would have been empowered to disinherit him.
In fact, this conclusion is reminiscent, as tenuous as the connection may seem, of Hatam Sofer’s reply to the governmental legislation enacted that regulated the sale of wine and liquor in nineteenth-century Hungary. As R. Moshe Sofer notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">421</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>HM</i> 44. In fact, <i>Hatam Sofer</i> disinherited a son who assaulted his mother. See infra text accompanying n. 37.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The legislation that was enacted … is not contrary to the <i>din</i> of the Torah, rather in accordance to the Torah. And if we had the opportunity to legislate we would have legislated in this fashion.</span>
The <i>beit din</i>’s authority is not limited to a case of a <i>mumar</i> or a murderer. Exercise of such authority was invoked in various instances in disinheriting a Torah heir.<sup class="footnote-marker">422</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot va-Yeshev Moshe</i> 2:13 (such an individual is aptly described in the Torah’s words as “<i>va-yishman yeshurun va-yiv’at</i>,” “and the nation fattened and bolted the Torah.”) See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, <i>EH</i> 2:158 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuva</i>, <i>HM</i> 276:1 (a son who batters his mother).</i>
Possibly, R. Feinstein’s <i>psak</i> is applicable to our case. R. Feinstein argues if a son believes in <i>Hashem</i>, is meticulous regarding his observance of <i>mitzvot</i> between man and <i>Hashem</i>, and educates his children in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, he will receive his Torah portion. However, in a situation in which the Torah heir engages in <i>aveirot</i> between <i>Hashem</i> and man, R. Feinstein rules that he may be deprived of his portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">423</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, <i>HM</i> 2:50 (3) who argues that Hatam Sofer concurs with him.</i> Given that litigating in civil court is an example of an <i>issur</i> between man and God and according to some <i>Poskim</i>, entails an <i>issur de’oraita</i>, therefore R. Feinstein would conclude that he may be deprived of a portion of his <i>yerusha</i>.
As such, this <i>beit din</i> should use its authority<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:148; <i>Sdei Hemed</i>, <i>Asifat Dinim</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet</i> 5, <i>siman</i> 3.</i> and penalize <i>Tove’a</i> for litigating in secular court, and his share of the <i>yerusha</i> should therefore be diminished.
We are ruling that the <i>Tove’a</i> receive only a partial share in his father’s estate. Admittedly, upon death, Halakha rather than compliance with a contractual obligation informs us that estate assets belong to the Torah heir. As the Talmud states, one’s inheritance comes from <i>Hashem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 47a.</i> Yet, as pointed out, Halakha empowers a <i>beit din</i> to penalize a Torah heir for acting improperly, i.e., for engaging in <i>issur</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed</i>, <i>Asifat Dinim</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet</i> 5, s<i>iman</i> 3, 388. Such penal authority is predicated upon the capacity of a <i>beit din</i> to not only divest the propriety rights of an owner, namely the <i>bekhor</i>, but affects a valid transfer of the estate to third parties, namely the sisters. See <i>Sdei Hemed</i>, ibid., p. 387; <i>Sdei Hemed</i>, <i>Kelalim</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet Heh</i>, s<i>iman</i> 59, 176–181.</i> However, one might contend that <i>beit din</i> is perverting justice, as Rambam rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">427</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, <i>mitzvat lo ta’ase</i> 278.</i>
The <i>dayan</i> is warned to refrain from perverting the Halakha regarding one of the litigants if he knew he was wicked and sinful, Hashem has warned us to refrain from punishing him by denying him his [monetary] entitlement.
Perversion of justice is not limited to rendering a decision that favors one party, but equally extends to a <i>Posek</i> or a <i>dayan</i> who misrepresents the grounds for his ruling. Engaging in such behavior compromises the arbiter’s integrity and may entail the transgression of <i>bal tosif</i>, adding to the Torah and/or lying.<sup class="footnote-marker">428</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>, <i>mitzvat a’se</i> 465 (Chavel ed.); Zvi Chajes, <i>Darkei Ho’roah</i>, <i>siman</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 1:19:6 (addendum); <i>Arukh le-Ner</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 65b. For additional sources and discussion, see A. Frimer and D. Frimer, “Women’s Prayer Groups – Theory and Practice,” 32 <i>Tradition</i> 5, 63–69 (1998).</i> For example, a rabbi cannot claim that the commission of a particular action is a biblical violation when in actuality it is only a rabbinic infraction. Or one cannot prohibit a particular activity in order to promote peace when Halakha doesn’t recognize this rationale for proscribing this behavior.
Invoking Pnei Mavin’s words,<sup class="footnote-marker">429</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pnei Mavin</i>, supra n. 29.</i> R. Hezekiah Medini’s teachings regarding the responsibility of a <i>dayan</i> are instructive:<sup class="footnote-marker">430</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed</i>, supra n. 41 at 387.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A <i>dayan</i> should not penalize by perverting justice due to the fact that he is a wicked individual and transgressor. Even if he is wicked and a transgressor, one must judge a truthful <i>din</i> … And even though a <i>beit din</i> is authorized to mete out punishment in variance with the <i>din</i> [<i>hora’at sha’ah</i>] … it is because we want the sinner to repent … or for people to know and fear and not continue to sin … and all this applies when we do it as punishment and revenge. What is wrong is perverting justice if he does not know and he thinks Halakha obligates such action …</span>
In other words, as elucidated by R. Eliav Shochetman, the prohibition of perversion of justice applies only when the <i>beit din</i>’s judgment that is in variance with the <i>din</i> will be perceived by the public as reflecting the <i>din</i>. However, if upon deliberation a <i>beit din</i> arrives at the decision to penalize someone, then the <i>beit din</i> must clearly explain the grounds for its <i>psak din</i>. In its decision, the <i>beit din</i> must state that, in accordance to the din, he may have been entitled to receive his portion as a Torah heir, however, due to his religious impropriety in engaging in forum shopping, <i>Tove’a</i> will be penalized by diminishing his <i>yerusha</i>. It is within the province of <i>beit din</i> to employ its penal authority in order that others do not emulate his improper behavior, in this case, forum shopping.<sup class="footnote-marker">431</sup><i class="footnote">Shochetman, supra n. 18, at 242.</i> Such an approach has been invoked in a case by R. Avraham Sherman, a Yerushalmi <i>dayan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">432</sup><i class="footnote">A. Sherman, “The Prohibition against Perversion of the Verdict of a Wicked Individual In Order to Punish Him” (Hebrew), 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 70 (5763).</i>
Hence, given the halakhic precedent for invoking a <i>beit din</i>’s penal authority, we argue that such punitive measures be enforced in our scenario of a <i>Tove’a</i> who initially attempted to find relief by engaging in forum shopping for the purpose of depriving his sister of portions of an estate gifted by their father. As such, though the <i>Tove’a</i>, as a Torah heir, may have been entitled to the entire <i>yerusha</i>, due to his forum shopping, the <i>Tove’a</i> should receive only half of his <i>yerusha</i>.
<b>4. Recovery of Court and Legal Fees</b>
Finally, in reply to <i>Nitva’at</i>’s claim to recover court and legal costs incurred in secular court, generally speaking, <i>Tove’a</i> is obligated to reimburse the <i>Nitva’at</i> for such costs.<sup class="footnote-marker">433</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>HM</i> 26:7, in the name of <i>Rosh</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:172; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 1.</i> And, if for example, the parties agreed to revisit the matter of resolving who is the estate’s executor prior to his appearance in <i>beit din</i>, <i>Tove’a</i> would have been obligated to pay for <i>Nitva’at</i>’s court and legal fees which were incurred in civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">434</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Divrei Hayyim</i>, supra n. 48.</i>
Nonetheless, despite <i>Tove’a</i>’s right to revisit the case, said conclusion is predicated upon the fact that the <i>Nitva’at</i> attempted to summon the <i>Tove’a</i> to a <i>beit din</i> to determine the issue of the estate’s executor and the <i>Tove’a</i> refused to appear.<sup class="footnote-marker">435</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:89; <i>Teshuvot ve-Hanhagot</i> 5:364.</i> The filing of a <i>hazamana</i>, summons to appear in <i>beit din</i>, never happened. In the absence of initiating a suit in beit din, the <i>Nitva’at</i> acquiescene to appear in civil court prempts the possibility of revisiting the claim in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">436</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:68.</i>
However, if the <i>Nitva’at</i> failed to summon him to <i>beit din</i>, such inaction is construed as a waiver for recovery of court and litigation fees.<sup class="footnote-marker">437</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Levush</i> in the name of <i>Divrei Hayyim</i> 2:46; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i>, <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 164; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shai</i> 2:60.</i> Hence, in our case, the <i>Nitva’at</i> failed to summon the <i>Tove’a</i> to a <i>beit din</i>, and therefore, the claim for recovery of said fees is without foundation.
<b>Decision</b>
1. <i>Tove’a</i> shall receive half of the estate distribution as memorialized in the civil will.
2. The <i>Nitva’at</i>’s claims for recovery of court and legal fees are hereby denied.
