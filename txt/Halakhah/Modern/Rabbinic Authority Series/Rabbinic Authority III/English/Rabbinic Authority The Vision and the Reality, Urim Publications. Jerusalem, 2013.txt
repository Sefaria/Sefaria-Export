Rabbinic Authority III

Preface

The present volume is the third in a series of volumes intended as an introduction to a subject perhaps unfamiliar to many—rabbinic authority in our <i>halakhic</i> sources. The subtitle, “The Vision and the Reality”, points to the themes being addressed in this work.
In addressing the “<i>halakhic</i> vision” of rabbinic authority,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As we know, <i>Halakhah</i> distinguishes between the theoretical law, which emerges from an abstract study of the sources of <i>Halakhah</i>, and the law that is applied in a particular factual context, i.e. <i>halakhah lema’aseh</i>. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 130b and Talmud Yerushalmi<i> Beitza</i> 2:1 (R. Yohanan’s statements).<br>However, whereas “the vision” portion of the presentation deals with the decisions of <i>halakhic</i> authorities as as memorialized in <i>sifrei pesak</i> (restatements of <i>Halakhah</i>) and <i>sifrei teshuvot</i> (responsa), the “the reality” portion of our presentation focuses upon the <i>halakhic</i>-judicial rulings of a <i>beit din</i>.</i> we will primarily focus our attention upon the issue of the modern-day <i>agunah</i>, the wife who is unable to receive her <i>get</i> due her husband’s recalcitrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The modern-day <i>agunah</i> is to be distinguished from the classical <i>agunah</i> whose husband’s whereabouts are unknown and therefore the wife cannot obtain her <i>get</i>. Clearly<i>, get</i> recalcitrance is not a modern phenomenon. Already in the Middle Ages, the phenomenon existed in both the Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:860-861; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:8, 13; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1, 132; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 57; <i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 186; <i>Teshuvot Maharil ha-Hadashot</i> 206; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, shoresh 26,29,71; <i>Teshuvot Maharam</i> <i>Mintz</i> 11.</i>
Some of our lines of inquiry will be the following: How does <i>Halakhah</i> address the consensual nature of <i>halakhic</i> divorce? Under what conditions may a <i>beit din</i> obligate a husband to give a <i>get</i> unconditionally? In the event of a husband’s continued refusal to give a <i>get</i>, what ammunition is in the <i>halakhic</i> arsenal to address this phenomenon, a matter that our community has been grappling with for many years? Obviously, for those rabbinic authorities and communities who endorse the execution of a prenuptial agreement which obligates a spouse to give or receive a <i>get</i> in a reasonable amount of time after the spouse requests it a divorcing couple in these communities may find solace in the fact that generally the matter of <i>igun</i> (loosely translated—“being chained”—i.e. via the withholding of a <i>get</i>) will not rear its head. However, for the thousands of couples who have been married for decades without the execution of a prenuptial agreement and for those who continue to be married without availing themselves of this agreement, either out of ignorance that such a panacea exists or due to the fact that their rabbinic decisors reject their implementation, what do we have in our <i>halakhic</i> stockpile for one of these wives to wage a war against a husband’s refusal to give a <i>get</i>?
May a <i>beit din</i> direct the imposition of social and economic isolating measures introduced in twelfth century Ashkenaz known in <i>halakhic</i> parlance as “<i>harhakot</i> of Rabbeinu Tam”? Must a <i>beit din</i> have grounds to obligate a <i>get</i> (“<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>”) prior to invoking these measures or is it sufficient to render a ruling of recommending a husband to give a <i>get</i> (“<i>mitzvah le-garesh</i>”)? Are there grounds to authorize a wife to litigate her monetary claims in civil court, which may result in a husband’s willingness to give a <i>get</i>? Upon discovery that there were no <i>eidim</i> (witnesses) under the <i>huppah</i> during the time of <i>kiddushin</i> who heard the husband reciting “<i>harei at mekudeshet li</i> . . .” and witnessed the <i>mesirah</i> (the husband placing a ring on his prospective wife’s finger), or that an <i>eid</i> was (or both <i>eidim</i> were) ineligible to serve as a witness, may a ruling be handed down by a <i>beit din</i> composed or three rabbis or one rabbinic authority<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is a matter of dispute whether one requires one rabbi or a <i>beit din</i> of three in order to address matters of <i>igun</i>. For this debate, see <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen, Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> 139; <i>Rema, Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>)<i>, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 17:39; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 17: 78; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 17:124; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 17(131); <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> <i>HM</i> 3:2; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> <i>HM</i> 3:1 <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> <i>EH</i> 17:118; R. Hayyim Pelaggi, <i>Teshuvot Hikekei Lev</i>, EH 57; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Kohen, EH</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot va-Ya’an Avraham</i> 28; <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i>, Kol Shahal 13 (end); <i>Teshuvot Minhat Ani</i> 65; <i>Teshuvot Seder Eliyahu Rabba ve-Zuta</i>, 125–126; <i>Mar’ot ha-Tzovot, EH</i> 17 (158); <i>Atzei Arazim, EH</i> 17 (165); Z.N.Goldberg, <i>Lev Mishpat</i>, vol. 1, 149-150.<br>Should a hearing be conducted by a single rabbi, there is a controversy whether <i>testimony</i> submitted to the rabbi should be in the presence of three <i>dayanim</i>, namely a <i>beit din</i>. See <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, op. cit.; <i>Taz, SA, EH</i> 17:56 and <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Kama</i> 123 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 17 (155); <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 2:130; <i>Seder Eliyahu Raba ve-Zuta</i>, op. cit.; <i>Mar’ot ha-Tzovot</i>, op. cit.; <i>Atzei Arazim</i>, op. cit.; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 17 (152) in the name of <i>Brit Avraham</i>; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i>, op. cit.; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 27:9;<i> Lev Mishpat,</i> op. cit<i>.</i> Implicit in our understanding, should a rabbi be allowed to address such matters, he must have the credentials to be an arbiter, no different than being a decisor in <i>halakhic</i> ritual law but he is not viewed as a <i>beit din</i>. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Granat</i>, Nezikin 195. Furthermore, in accordance to Rabbi Michal Epstein, rabbinic approval must be sought prior to the rabbi issuing a <i>teshuvah</i> (a responsum) in <i>igun</i> matters. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> <i>EH</i> 17:139, 255.However, many <i>Poskim</i> disagree with his view. See infra chapter 8(b) text accompanying notes 57-81.</i> to be <i>mevatel</i> the <i>kiddushin</i> (loosely translated as “voiding the marriage”) and thereby obviate the requirement for a <i>get</i>? Can the invalidation of a qualified <i>eid kiddushin</i> result in <i>bittul kiddushin</i>? If a husband intentionally or unintentionally fails to disclose to his prospective spouse prior to marriage that he had a “<i>mum gadol</i>” (a major flaw) such as being impotent, unwilling to have children, gay, mentally dysfunctional, or being a criminal, are there grounds to void such a marriage and under what conditions can it be done? May a marriage be voided due to the husband’s behavior after the onset of the marriage based upon an <i>umdana</i> (the assessed expectation) that had she known prior to the marriage that he would conduct himself in a certain fashion, she never would have married him? May the marriage of a modern day <i>agunah</i> be voided based upon relying upon a minority <i>halakhic</i> view? Since in many instances voiding a marriage of a modern-day <i>agunah</i> entails the suspension of the biblical status of the woman as an <i>eishit ish</i>, a married woman can one rely upon a minority opinion to free her without a <i>get</i>? Prior to voiding a marriage, does the rabbi or <i>beit din</i> require a consultation with “a second opinion(s)”?
Under what conditions, if any, is a <i>beit din</i> empowered to give a <i>get</i> on behalf of a husband who has not given instructions to give one to his wife? There is well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> (tradition) that, in accordance with certain <i>Poskim</i> (<i>halakhic</i> authorities), a <i>beit din</i> will confer the benefit of a <i>get</i> upon the husband in the scenario of an adulterous or apostate wife who refuses to receive a <i>get</i>. Does such a <i>mesorah</i> exist regarding an <i>agunah</i> where the husband “stands and screams” that he refuses to give a <i>get</i>? In the absence of a <i>mesorah</i>, can one present a <i>halakhically</i> cogent basis for freeing an <i>agunah</i> via the vehicle of her receiving a <i>get</i> from a <i>beit din</i> due to the fact that it is an absolute benefit of the husband to give it?
The “reality” memorialized in various <i>beit din</i> judgments as well as “the vision” addresses all of these questions. Though an infrequent occurrence, we do realize that the matter of <i>igun</i> extends itself to a situation where a wife refuses to receive a <i>get</i>. Consequently, one of our <i>beit din</i> rulings responds to this issue as well.
As our <i>limmud</i> (our study) shows, in both “the vision” and “the reality” components of our presentation there exist divergent <i>halakhic</i> traditions to all of the aforementioned questions. The <i>kiddushin</i> (betrothal) relationship establishes a personal status, namely, that of a <i>mekudeshet</i> (a woman designated for a particular man and prohibited to all others).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushi</i>n 2b</i> The establishment of this personal status, known as <i>ishut,</i> renders both spouses subject to various prohibitions, e.g. sexual relations with various relatives become prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The act of <i>kiddushin</i> also creates financial duties that will be transformed into spousal duties on the completion of the marriage ceremony known as <i>nissuin</i>. For further discussion, see this writer’s “Contractual Consequences of Cohabitation in American Law and Jewish Law,” 20 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i>, 279,304–311 (2013).</i> Whereas “<i>hafka’at kiddushin</i>” as used in contemporary parlance entails retroactively annulling the marriage of a recalcitrant husband who refuses to give a <i>get</i> after being directed to do so by a <i>beit din,</i> a <i>beit din</i> engaging in <i>bittul kiddushin</i> entails one’s readiness to nullify the <i>issur</i> of <i>eishet ish</i> (the prohibition of being a married woman). <i>Hafka’at kiddushin</i>, on the one hand, assumes that the matrimonial tie was created. On the other hand, <i>bittul kiddushin</i> presumes that the marital bond was never established.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly the term <i>hafka’at kiddushin</i> is utilized in the context of a case that may be subject to <i>bittul kiddushin</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Nishmat Hayyim</i> 87 (126); <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon,</i> <i>Mahadura</i> <i>Tinyana, EH</i> 104; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 6:159.</i>
Whereas a refusal to invoke <i>bittul kiddushin</i> means that the <i>issur</i> continues to exist, the implementation of <i>bittul</i> means that the <i>issur</i> no longer exists and the wife, in the case of an <i>agunah,</i> is permitted to remarry without the issuance of a <i>get</i>. On the one hand, prohibiting <i>bittul kiddushin</i> in part is due to the lurking fear that the woman is an <i>eishit ish</i> and therefore should we permit her to remarry she would be living in sin and should she bear children, her offspring may be <i>mamzerim</i> (<i>halakhic</i> bastards).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In numerous situations we are dealing with a <i>get le-humra</i>, a precautionary <i>get</i> and therefore it is a matter of controversy whether the children are <i>mamzerim</i> or not.</i> Those who sanction <i>bittul kiddushin,</i> on the other hand, do so in part because of the fact that we want <i>to prevent mamzerut</i>, lest the <i>agunah</i> remarry without <i>halakhic</i> permission.
As such, upon studying the matter of “<i>igun</i>” we have entered into “the universe of <i>issurim</i>” (prohibitions). Consequently, it is unsurprising to find the following posture of R. Aharon Walkin, an early twentieth century arbiter. A <i>sina qua non</i> to create the <i>ma’aseh kiddushin</i> (the act of <i>halakhic</i> marriage) is the presence of two adult Jewish males who are Torah observant, not blood relatives to either the man or the woman, witness the man reciting “<i>harei at mekudeshet li betaba’at zo, kedat Moshe ve-Yisrael</i>”, observe the man transferring a ring to the woman, and see her acceptance of the ring.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 42:2, 5. Whether the witnesses who are present under the <i>huppah</i> must see the <i>netinah</i> only or equally hear his words of <i>kiddushin</i> is a matter of debate. See <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 42:4; <i>Beit Shmuel SA, EH</i> 42:12; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:101; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:82 and <i>Sha’arei Yosher, Sha’ar</i> 7, chapter 12.</i> Addressing a case of an <b><i>agunah</i> </b>who requests that her marriage be voided due to the fact that both witnesses during the <i>kiddushin</i> were invalid due to the fact that they violated the Shabbat and committed other sins, following implicitly earlier rulings, R. Aharon Walkin—who resided in Pinsk-Karlin, Ukraine responds to such a petition in the most trenchant terms,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 1:81.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is improper in my eyes to adopt this path to criticize the act of <i>kiddushin</i> eight years after the wedding . . . you must understand that such advice can destroy the purity of Israel . . . to multiply <i>mamzerim</i> in the midst of a holy nation; the marital bond from now will be not sustained. Everyone will destroy it in accordance with his will . . . And the stringency of being married (<i>eishit ish</i>) will be nullified . . . Therefore eight years after the wedding . . . we should not inquire for guidance to void the marriage . . .</span>
His view is by far not one of a “lone ranger”. A few decades earlier, concerned about “the slippery slope”, Rabbi Hayyim Berlin—the son of the renowned R. Naftali Zvi Berlin—lambasts those authorities who engage in <i>bittul kiddushin</i> by stating,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nishmat Hayyim</i>, supra n. 6. See also <i>Teshuvot Nishmat Hayyim</i> 128–129; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov,</i> <i>EH</i> 85.<br>Despite R. Berlin’s strong reservations regarding <i>bittul kiddushin</i> in this case submitted to him, in other rulings R. Berlin will invoke “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”, provided that there are other reasons to serve as grounds to void the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Nishmat Hayyim</i>, 84, 87.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">One cannot imagine the damage and the breaches that can emerge from this in our dissolute generation . . . they will begin comparing one matter to another one—in the beginning, they will permit based upon <i>umdananot</i> (assessed expectations –AYW) . . . they will permit (to remarry –AYW) every wife whose husband who has traveled overseas to America or Africa . . . And afterwards they will permit . . . if a person will promise a certain amount of <i>nedunya</i> (dowry –AYW) and subsequently it will be discovered . . . that he cannot keep his promise, they will say “in her mind she would not have submitted to this marriage” . . . and <i>mamzerim</i> will multiply in Israel.</span>
As our presentation will demonstrate, there are numerous other <i>halakhic</i> traditions which allow for the voiding of marriages under certain conditions.
Given that the propriety of voiding a marriage entails entering into “the universe of <i>issurim</i>”, the issue of being stringent or lenient regarding such matters emerges. In 1909, rabbinic controversy erupts concerning the question whether or not oil derived from sesame seeds are permitted on Pesah when the process of production prevented any possibility of leavening. Despite the opposition of various Yerushalmi rabbinic decisors, R. Kook—then rabbi of Yaffo—certified as kosher the factory that was producing the sesame oil. Responding to the concern that such a ruling would create a small opening that would eventually lead to “a breach in the wall of <i>Halakhah</i>”, R. Kook writes as follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Orah Mishpat, Orah Hayyim</i> 112.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And most importantly, I have previously written to these esteemed Torah scholars that I am aware of the character of our contemporaries. It is precisely by observing that we are ready to permit based upon plumbing the depths of <i>Halakhah</i>, they will arrive at the understanding that we are allowing it because of the truth of the Torah, and many will come, with God’s help, to listening to the voice of the instructors of Torah. But if it is discovered that there are such matters that from the perspective of <i>Halakhah</i> ought to be permitted and the Rabbis are insensitive to their burdens and pain of Israel, and allowed the matters as prohibited, this will result, God forbid, in the desecration of God’s name. Many of the transgressors of <i>Halakhah</i> will say regarding basic rules of Torah, that if the Rabbis wanted to permit them, they could have done so and the result will be that the <i>Halakhah</i> has been perverted.</span>
To state it differently, in R. Kook’s mind, “the slippery slope” is a risk associated not only with lenient judgments but equally with unnecessarily stringent rulings which may result in “the breach of the wall”.
Concerning “the breach of the wall”, these words of R. Meir Gavison, a contemporary of R. Yosef Karo, the author of Shulhan Arukh are quite instructive and incisive,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Gavison</i> 82. See also, <i>Teshuvot Re’eim</i> 36; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:43.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The Scholars were . . . especially attuned to the imminent transgressions of <i>halakhah</i>, and the licentiousness that may emerge as a result of the wife’s status as an <i>agunah</i>. For if permission for her to remarry is withheld, people will intentionally violate . . . possibly they will be unable to subdue their instincts and will surrender to temptation should we fail to identify a way of permitting them to remarry. . . . And consequently, it is therefore our responsibility to inquire for grounds on their behalf, and . . . to allow her in order to preempt any possibility of violation. And it is no minor issue to commit a sin and to cause others to sin . . .</span>
Over sixty years ago, R. Yitzhak Z. Kahana has well-documented in his classical work, <i>Sefer ha-Agunot</i>, the numerous <i>teshuvot</i> which address the acute need to offer solutions to deal with the woman whose husband has disappeared (“the classical <i>agunah</i>”) lest she remain an <i>eishit ish</i> as well as notes the well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> to rely on lenient opinions in a matter of <i>agunah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Z. Kahana, <i>Sefer ha-Agunot</i>, (Jerusalem, 5714), 7–76. See also <i>Teshuvot Yabia</i> Omer, vol. 7, EH 8. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, shoresh 30.</i> A marriage which has no prospects for “<i>shalom bayit</i>” (marital reconciliation) and therefore is “dead”, yet the wife cannot receive the desired <i>get</i> in order to rebuild her life, is deemed an <i>igun</i> matter and is deserving of the same <i>halakhic</i> consideration of seeking leniency accorded to the classical <i>igun</i> while simultaneously preserving her <i>halakhic</i>-moral persona as a <i>bat yisrael</i> (a daughter in our community). As R. Eliyahu Alfandri notes, <i>get</i> recalcitrance entails “withholding good from our friends” and as such is an infraction of “loving your neighbor like yourself” and “failing to rescue him”.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Seder Eliyahu Rabba</i> 13.</i> In contemporary times, Dayan Eliyahu Abergil characterizes a husband who is “<i>me’agein</i>” (“chain”-delay the giving of a <i>get</i>) his wife as an individual who is engaging in <i>midat Sedom</i>, sedomite conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Dibrot Eliyahu</i> 8:116</i> Denying one’s fellow man a benefit when it costs nothing constitutes egregious behavior and is identified with the sin of the people of Sedom and is a Biblical violation of the negative commandment “do not take revenge”.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dibrot Eliyahu</i>, ibid.</i>
How does one seek a solution to the matter of “<i>igun</i>”? R. Dovid Babad, a renowned nineteenth-century <i>posek</i> of Galicia, communicates to us a <i>mesorah</i> that he received,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havatzelet ha-Sharon</i> 2:28. For the implementation of this approach in the context of a commercial case, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>: <i>The Vision and the Reality,</i> vol. 2, 323–324.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I heard from <i>ha-Gaon</i> R. Barish Rapaport . . . that he had a <i>mesorah</i> from his <i>Rav</i>, <i>ha-Gaon</i> Noda be-She’arim, <i>Av Beit Din</i> of Lublin, that upon receiving a question to address, he would first weigh in his mind the truthfulness of the matter according to what human reason dictates and if in his estimation human reason the matter is true, then he will delve into <i>Halakhah</i> to arrive at a decision.</span>
Subsequently, in the twentieth century, in dealing with a classical <i>agunah</i> problem, both R. Ya’akov Breisch and R. Yitzhak Weiss invoke this <i>mesorah</i> in order to find a solution for the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov,</i> <i>EH</i> 56; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 9:150.</i>
Despite the fact that the classical <i>agunah</i> problem entails a rabbinic matter, such a methodology ought to be equally employed when facing a modern-day <i>igun</i> problem which in certain instances deals with a Biblical matter. In fact, R. Aharon Lichtenstein lays out the <i>halakhic</i>-philosophical framework for addressing the modern day <i>agunah</i> issue.
Addressing the meta-<i>halakhic</i> factors in arriving at a <i>psak din</i>, decision in general and the plight of the <i>agunah</i> in particular, following the sagacious, authoritative counsel of R. Yosef B. Soloveitchik,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Though in one of his classical essays R. Soloveitchik writes that “halakhic concepts are a priori and it is through them that the halakhic man looks at the world”, nonetheless, in rendering a<i> psak</i>, a decision the impact of the human and social factor upon decision making is noted. See Joseph B. Soloveitchik, <i>Halakhic Man</i>, Philadelphia, 1984, 3; J. B. Soloveitchik, <i>Community, Covenant and Commitment</i>, ed. N. Helfgot, Jersey City, 2005, 24-25.</i> R. Aharon Lichtenstein astutely observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A. Lichtenstein, “The Human and Social Factor in <i>Halakhah</i>,” 36 <i>Tradition</i>, 2002, 1, 3-4, 6-7.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Hora’a</i> is comprised of two elements: <i>pesak</i> and <i>pesika</i>, respectively. The former refers to codification, the formulation of the law pertinent to a given area; and it is most characteristically manifested in the adoption on textual and logical grounds, of one position in preference to others. . . . <i>Peskia</i>, by contrast . . . bespeaks the application of what has already been forged in the crucible of the learning experience to a particular situation . . . Its challenge lies in the need to harness knowledge and responsibility at the interface of reality and <i>Halakhah</i> . . .</span>
However, the cogency and legitimacy of a “human” approach to <i>pesak</i>, appears to many problematic. They would have us believe that the ideal <i>posek</i> is a faceless and heartless supercomputer into whom all the relevant data is fed and who then produces the right answer. Should this standard not be met, this shortfall is to be regarded as a failing . . . On this reading, the process of <i>pesika</i>, properly conceived and executed, bears no semblance to an existential encounter between seeker and respondent . . .
Purist proponents of this approach often cry it up as the “<i>frum</i>” view of <i>pesika</i>. In reality, however, this portrait of a <i>posek</i> is mere caricature . . . those who, at most <i>kar’u ve-shanu</i>, but certainly <i>lo shimshu</i>. As anyone who has been privileged to observe <i>gedolim</i> at close hand can readily attest, they approach <i>pesak</i> doubly animated by responsibility to <i>halakha</i> and sensitivity to human concerns. . . . And does not the whole history of coping with <i>agunot</i> reflect this concern?
In effect, for R. Lichtenstein, the human and social factor cannot operate independently of <i>Halakhah</i>. A <i>halakhic</i> decision does not reflect a moral or social fad. In short, he would agree with the aforementioned statement of R. Babad.
He would first weigh in his mind the truthfulness of the matter according to what human reason dictates and if in his estimation human reason the matter is true and is reflective of <i>halakhic</i> norms, then he will render a <i>psak din,</i> decision which is engendered by <i>yirat Shamayim</i>.
As we will hopefully demonstrate, under certain conditions many <i>Poskim</i> throughout the centuries have offered solutions to allow a modern-day <i>agunah</i> to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i>. In fact, notwithstanding the position of some <i>Poskim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra SA EH</i> 17:61; <i>Helkat Mehokeik SA EH</i> 17:47; <i>Hazon Ish EH</i> 31:12</i> under certain conditions, a <i>beit din</i> may rely upon a minority opinion as the sole grounds or as a <i>senif</i> (lit. an appendage), a supporting argument for freeing a woman from the chains of <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taz, SA EH</i> 17:15; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> <i>EH</i> 3:110; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:35; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 4(8), vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 17(8), 19(7); vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 36(10), 38(5); <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i> 2:15.</i> In addressing a crisis situation, following a well-trodden <i>mesorah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the grounds for relying upon a minority opinion in a Biblical matter and for additional <i>teshuvot</i> which address relying upon a minority opinion in Biblical as well as rabbinic matters, see infra, Chapter 8(b).</i> R. Lichtenstein, notes that a minority opinion may be relied upon even if the matter entails a Biblical injunction.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Lichtenstein, supra n. 20, at 11, n. 30</i>
Upon identifying a solution we ought to heed the words of R. Moshe Feinstein, who states,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:117.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“And it is a major prohibition “<i>le-agein</i>” (“to leave a wife in chains”) if one has the ability to address the situation and does not resolve it.”</span>
Lest one be concerned about the view of other rabbis who look askance at voiding marriages, R. Feinstein observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Diberot Moshe, Ketuvot</i>, vol. 1, 244–245.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Those who are of the opinion to prohibit are well aware the basis for permitting the matter and they should not be surprised when they hear that there are others who allow it. And if they fail to understand the grounds for permitting, they are not <i>morei hora’ah</i> (loosely translated as authorized arbiters in matters of prohibitions –AYW) and one should not be apprehensive of them at all and they must inquire into the matter and they will see the side of permitting the concern and they will no longer be surprised.</span>
As R. Sinai Sapir states,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Ani</i> 51. For earlier similar observations, see <i>Teshuvot Masat Binyamin</i> 109; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i> EH 45; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:10.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In matters such as those involving <i>agunot</i>, it is improper to collect stringencies. . . . In this situation, ‘the strength of the leniency is more powerful’, since we are concerned with <i>halakhot</i> involving lives . . .</span>
Cognizant that the condition of <i>igun</i> may entail <i>pikuach nefesh</i>, danger to life, we have chosen to use dark red as the background color for our book cover. Human blood is always red. Usually, when it is oxygenated it is a bright red. However, when it is depleted of oxygen, it is a darker red. Metaphorically speaking, <i>agunot</i> have dark red blood. Minimally, freeing an <i>agunah</i> whose life has been bereft of total control and self-determination entails the preservation of her mental health and maximally it may involve the saving of human life. My personal experience involved encountering three <i>agunot</i> who have threatened to commit suicide due to their intractable situation.
Lest one contend that seeking solutions to matters of “<i>igun</i>” is to be relegated to Torah luminaries such as R. Elhanan Spektor and R. Yosef Baer Soloveitchik, author of Beit ha-Levi, R. Yitzhak ben Dovid of nineteenth-century Kushta exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Emet</i> 9 (beginning).

Regardless of one’s rabbinic stature, an arbiter must possess the credentials to render a decision in matters of marriage and divorce. See <i>SA YD</i> 242:14; <i>SA EH</i> 49:3.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If every Torah scholar would refrain from responding and say “how can I enter this flame of a mighty blaze due to the severity of the prohibition of illicit relations (“<i>ervah</i>”)?” . . . each man, a minor one like a great one (every Torah scholar, one of minor stature like one of major stature –AYW) is obligated to seek with candles, a careful search in holes and cracks possibly he will find relief for the benefit of the daughters of Israel to save them from <i>igun</i> . . .</span>
In other words, throughout the ages, when dealing with matters of <i>igun</i>, arbiters have been engaging with the interface of <i>Halakhah</i> and reality.
In fact, commencing with the Middle Ages until contemporary times, numerous rabbis and <i>battei din</i> (rabbinical courts) alike both in the lands of our dispersion and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> have propelled themselves to “enter this flame” and have rendered decisions that have offered solutions for the matter of “<i>igun</i>”.
Even in the absence of an <i>agunah’s</i> plea to address her situation in a <i>beit din</i> should it be crystal clear that there exists an <i>igun</i> situation, a <i>beit din</i> is obligated to enter “this flame of a mighty blaze” and deal with the case. For example, in the absence of any pending litigation between the couple regarding end of marriage issues such as child support and child custody and it is clear that the husband moved to a different city or country and he has no intention to return to the marital home for the foreseeable future, a <i>beit din</i> is dutibound to intervene as <i>ba’alei din</i>, as concerned parties in terms of hearing presentations and receiving testimony even though the wife did not submit a claim for receiving her <i>get</i>. In matters of <i>issurim</i>, prohibitions such as the matter of a <i>get</i>, all members of the Jewish community are plaintiffs, parties. Consequently, a <i>beit din</i> may unilaterally initiate a hearing in a matter of <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Kiddushin</i> 27b, s.v. <i>gemorah</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 46,287; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i>, vol. 1, 13 in the name of Ramban,vol. 2, 19 in the name of R. Shimon; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> <i>EH</i> 45; <i>Teshuvot Ma’amar Mordekhai, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 92.</i>
Clearly, under such conditions a wife’s presentation accompanied with supporting evidence is required for a <i>beit din</i> panel to address the matter of <i>igun</i>.
Just as a <i>posek</i> must perform his due diligence to search for a reasoned solution, similarly, an <i>agunah</i> must persist in identifying a <i>beit din</i> or rabbinic authority who will afford her relief. Even if an <i>agunah</i> received a reply from a <i>beit din</i> or a rabbi that <i>Halakhah</i> affords no solution for her <i>igun</i>, nonetheless, many authorities permit her to revisit her case by submitting it to another rabbi or <i>beit din</i>. Lest one challenge this conclusion based upon the Talmudic rule regarding <i>issurim</i>, “if a scholar prohibited something, his colleague has no authority to permit it after it already has been forbidden”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 63b; <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a.

For many years, our Torah-observant community has encountered both here, abroad, and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, situations where a recalcitrant spouse chooses to condition the giving or the acceptance of a <i>get</i> upon receiving certain benefits such as receiving monetary remuneration from the opposing spouse, custody of a child, or having certain issues related and/or unrelated to the end-of-marriage resolved in a <i>beit din</i>. Such conduct raises <i>halakhic</i> issues which we will address in the chapters dealing with the propriety of a conditional divorce and a divorcee’s relief from the consequences of an exploitative divorce agreement.
Additionally, in the component of our discussion of “the vision” of rabbinic authority, we focus upon some of the varying <i>halakhic</i> traditions regarding the propriety of a divorcee marrying a <i>kohen</i> and we will present a comparative treatment of how the Metz Rabbinical Court of the eighteenth century and contemporary Israeli Rabbinical Courts deal with the question of dividing up marital assets upon divorce.
In this volume, we have included nine presentations inspired by reasoned opinions handed down on various <i>beit din</i> panels, including the International Beit Din located in New York City. In each presentation, we offer a rendition of the facts of the case. Subsequently, there is an analysis of the <i>halakhic</i> issues emerging from the case, followed by a <i>psak din</i>, a decision rendered by the <i>beit din</i> panel. To preserve the confidentiality of the parties involved in these cases, all names have been changed, and some facts have been changed or deleted. Realizing the controversial nature of some of the cases dealt with in this volume, we are keenly aware of Rabbi Yosef Karo’s ruling and admonition that a scholar must refrain from permitting a matter which the community views as being prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA,YD</i> 242:10</i> Yet, on the basis of a well-trodden <i>mesorah</i>, such judgments can be rendered provided that reasons are given for one’s position.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, SA, YD</i> 242:17; <i>Ba’air Hetev SA, YD</i> 242:12; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, YD</i> 242:25; <i>Mahaberet al Tenai</i>, 43; <i>Diberot Moshe,</i> supra n. 26<i>.</i></i> As such, we have offered reasoned opinions for our decisions. Whether there is a requirement to receive consent from a rabbinic authority who does not serve on the <i>beit din</i> panel prior to rendering a decision, we discuss in chapter 8, case b (end).
Both components of this monograph, namely “the vision” and “the reality” of rabbinic authority have benefited immensely from live interactions as well as telephone and e-mail communications that I had and continue to have with various rabbinical authorities in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> who serve or served as <i>dayanim</i> in the regional <i>battei din</i> and Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, the Supreme Rabbinical Court in the Chief Rabbinate network of <i>battei din.</i> As <i>dayanim</i> who 24/6 immerse themselves in “<i>the yam of the Talmud</i>” (“the sea of the Talmud”), <i>sifrei hiddushim</i> (novellae), <i>sifrei pesak</i> (restatements) and <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa), listen to parties’ claims and counterclaims, and hand down reasoned decisions primarily in the area of divorce, their insights and advice have been immeasurable.
Chapters two and three have appeared originally in the pages of <i>Tradition</i> and portions of chapter four were delivered in Fall 2013 at The Center of Jewish History in New York City in honor of the publication of Professor Jay Berkovitz’s book, Protocols of Justice: The Pinkas of the Metz Rabbinical Court 1771–1789.
Hopefully our presentation will educate our community regarding the parameters and scope of rabbinic authority in general and “shatter the silence” surrounding the various techniques towards confronting the matter of “<i>igun</i>” in particular.

Part I; Rabbinic Authority; The Vision

Chapter 1; The Consensual Nature of Halakhic Divorce

Addressing the dynamics of how a <i>Posek</i> arrives at his decision, we observe elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i> (Urim: 2013), vol. 1, 48, 53–54.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Prior to rendering a decision, the arbiter must acknowledge his own finitude in terms of the level of his own <i>halakhic</i> knowledge compared to his contemporaries and predecessors, as well as recognize the importance of rendering a <i>psak</i> (a decision) pursuant to normative <i>halakhah</i> regarding the matter he is addressing. Should compelling reasons dictate the need to deviate from normative <i>halakhah</i>, utilizing the canons of decision-making, he may render an autonomous judgment. To arrive at a <i>psak</i>, the <i>Posek</i> must delve into commentaries of the Talmud and responsa literature, which generally reveal their reasoning processes, as well the restatements and rabbinic court judgments, which are frequently devoid of proofs and explicit reasoning . . .</span>
The ability to analyze and potentially overrule one’s predecessor, whether he is the author of a <i>teshuvah</i> or a <i>sefer psak</i>, requires the arbiter . . . possesses <i>yirat shamayim</i> (religious piety) and scholarship. In his decision-making, he must weigh the significance of contrary precedent opinion and exercise logic as well . . .
. . . an arbiter must engage in a special type of logic, “<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>” (applying analogical inferences for the purpose of discerning the similarities and differences between cases), in order to address new situations . . . the practice of analogical reasoning reflects the ongoing dialectic between deference to early authorities and creative innovation . . . the engagement in <i>medameh milta le-milta</i> is thus concomitantly a stimulant and a depressant—a spur to creativity, but equally a motive for restraint . . .
In short, <i>ko’ah ha-hiddush</i> (the spur to creativity and originality) is tempered by a <i>Posek’s yirat Shamayim</i>, his commitment to thoroughly investigate the wealth of sources, and the collaborative effort of numerous authorities in the past that have confronted similar and/or identical problems.
Once the arbiter enters into the world of <i>issur ve-heter</i> (ritual law), additional factors come into play prior to him arriving at a <i>psak</i>. Decisions emerging over the centuries dealing with <i>halakhic</i> divorce law, as we will show, either explicitly invoke these considerations or implicitly utilize some of these factors prior to rendering a <i>psak</i>.
One of these considerations emerges from the nature of <i>halakhic kiddushin</i> (betrothal) and <i>nissuin</i> (marriage). Both the acts of <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>nissuin</i> entail a consensual agreement between a Jewish man and Jewish woman. It is a very special agreement that establishes a personal status, namely that the <i>mekudeshet</i> (the betrothed woman) is designated for a particular man and prohibited to all others. The establishment of <i>hezkat eishet ish</i> (the presumptive status of a married woman) renders both the man and woman subject to various prohibitions—e.g. sexual relations with various relatives become prohibited. The act of <i>kiddushin</i> equally creates financial obligations that will become spousal duties upon the consummation of the act of <i>nissuin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s “Contractual Consequences of Cohabitation” 20 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2013), 279, 303–309.</i>
The severing of matrimonial ties is predicated equally upon both parties’ willingness to marry each other. We are taught in Devarim,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 24:1 (Koren Tanakh translation with a minor variation)</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he found something inappropriate in her; then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it to in her hand and he will send her from his house . . .”</span>
Elucidating upon this Torah verse, the Mishnah, various passages in the Talmud, and subsequently the classical restatements conclude that the execution of a divorce requires the volition of the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Yevamot</i> 13:1; <i>Gittin</i> 78a, <i>Yevamot</i> 113b; <i>Mishnah Torah</i> (hereafter: <i>MT</i>), <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 1:1–2, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 1:1; <i>Tur, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 119; <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>)<i>, EH</i> 119:3,6.</i> The potential normative status of this conclusion stems from the fact that this doctrine of a husband’s free will concerning the execution of a divorce is found thousands of years ago in the Talmudic canon, whose rulings are authoritative due to the fact that there has been some metaphysical acceptance of these rulings by members of the Jewish community dating back from the days of Rambam until contemporary times.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rambam, Introduction to <i>MT</i>, Mosad ha-Rav Kook edition, p. 11; <i>Kesef Mishnah, Hilkhot Mamrim</i> 2:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter:YD)115:3; <i>Derashot ha-Ran, Drash 12</i> (42b); <i>R. Wasserman, Kovetz Shiurim</i>, vol. 2, p. 82; R. Wasserman<i>, Kovetz Inyanim</i>, pp. 194–195, 199.</i>
On the other hand, normative <i>Halakhah</i> as recorded in the Tosefta, Mishnah, various passages in the Talmud and subsequent <i>halakhic</i> rulings until the early Middle Ages rule that a husband may deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife against her wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Tosefta <i>Yevamot</i> 14:1; Mishnah <i>Yevamot</i> 14:1; <i>Yevamot</i> 113b; <i>Gittin</i> 49b, 77a, 88b<i>; Bava Metzia</i> 10b, 56b. See also, M. Friedman, <i>Jewish Marriage in Palestine</i> (Tel Aviv, 1980) vol. 1, 312–313.</i> In other words, <i>Halakhah</i> required only the husband’s consent in giving a <i>get</i>.
Subsequently, over a thousand years ago, in the eleventh century, Rabbeinu Gershom of Germany enacts seventeen pieces of rabbinic legislation (or the legislation was attributed to Rabbeinu Gershom), including one providing that <i>Halakhah</i> mandate that the wife’s consent is required prior to the husband’s delivery of the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA,</i> <i>EH</i> 119:6. For the literary sources of this rabbinic legislation, see Louis Finkelstein, <i>Jewish Self-Government in the Middle Ages</i> (New York, 1964); Shlomo Havlin, “The <i>Takanot</i> (legislation) of Rabbeinu Gershom . . . in Family Law in Spain and Provence” (hereafter <i>Takanot</i>), (Hebrew) 2 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> (1975), 200.<br>For the juridical basis for an arbiter to invoke legislation that flies in the face of explicit Mishnaic or Talmudic rulings is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> The enactment was complied with in the medieval Franco-German communities and though there was originally a time limit placed upon the validity of the <i>takanah</i> (rabbinic legislation)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 4 (14); <i>Takano</i>t, supra n. 7 at 218–219.</i>, nonetheless it is widely accepted that the enactment is still operative at least with regard to Ashkenazic Jewry to this very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:8; <i>Rema SA, EH</i> 1:10; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 14; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi, EH</i> 124; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, YD</i> 140, <i>EH</i> 120 in the name of R. Y. Ashkenazi.</i> Invoking the language reminiscent of a twentieth century liberal mind, R. Asher ben Yehiel (known by the acronym: Rosh), who resided in thirteenth-century Germany and Spain, characterizes the <i>takanah</i> in the following fashion:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It [the legislation –AYW) equalized the power of the woman to the man’s power; just like a man cannot divorce her against his will, similarly a woman cannot be divorced against her wish.</span>
That being said, one of the ramifications of marriage is the creation of the status of <i>eishet ish</i>—which means, amongst other matters, that the <i>Posek</i> must tread cautiously in releasing a married woman from the bonds of matrimony prior to ascertaining whether there are grounds for executing a <i>get</i>. Absent any grounds for permitting the divorce, should a <i>get</i> be executed it may be viewed as a “<i>get me’useh</i>” (a coerced <i>get)</i> and according to the majority of <i>Poskim</i> the <i>get</i> would be null and void.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Gittin</i> 88b, s.v. <i>mifsal</i>; <i>Rashbam Bava Batra</i> 48a, s.v. <i>ve-khein</i>; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. <i>yotzi</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:6; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Ketuvot</i> 77a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran, Gittin</i> 49a, s.v <i>get</i> <i>me’useh</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 104; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573, 2:276; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Kiddushin</i> 50a; <i>Meiri, Beit ha-Behirah, Gittin</i> 88b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 339 in the name of Rashi; <i>Maggid Mishnah, Mishnah Torah, Hilkhot</i> <i>Ishut</i> 14:8; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 41; <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Yevamot</i> 12:33; <i>Helkat Mehokeik SA, EH</i> 77:5; <i>Tur,</i> <i>EH</i> 134; <i>SA,</i> <i>EH</i> 134:7; <i>Rema, SA,</i> <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 205:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:138; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 63; <i>Beit Shmuel,</i> <i>SA, EH</i> 134:10, 13; <i>Teshuvot Maritz</i> 1:40; <i>Teshuvot Mahari</i> <i>bei Rav</i> 41; <i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 38,48; <i>Meshoveiv Netivot</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Mikhtav mei-Eliyahu, Sha’ar</i> 7, 19<i>; Teshuvot R.

Unlike civil law, a bastard in Jewish law is offspring born out of an incestuous relationship (in this case one where the wife remains married to her first husband). In fact, concern for <i>mamzerut</i>, propels Rabbi Dovid Ibn Abi Zimra to refrain from coercing a physically abusive husband to give a <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridvaz</i> 4:157.<br>For concerns for a “<i>get me’useh</i>” due to relying upon a <i>halakhic</i> opinion which is subject to controversy, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 4:41, 108; <i>Teshuvot Maharlbah</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 41.</i>
Assuming a couple mutually agrees to execute a <i>halakhic</i> divorce, the couple, with the assistance of an attorney and/or a rabbi who has expertise in <i>halakhic</i> divorce law, would draft a settlement agreement that deals with the end of marriage issues such as division of marital assets, child support, parenting arrangements in terms of custody, and visitation privileges.
In the absence of an agreement between the parties to divorce, it becomes a <i>beit din’s</i> responsibility to determine whether are grounds for obligating or—in cases where it is permitted by <i>Halakhah</i>—for compelling the husband to give or the wife to receive a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, a <i>beit din</i> rather than an individual Jew is required in order to determine whether there are grounds for coercing the giving of a <i>get</i>.

A review of<i> Netivot’s</i> actual words indicates that only with regard to compelling <i>mitzvah</i> observance an individual is able to determine whether coercion is permissible. However, Rabbis Sofer, Rofe, Gordon, and Alfandri rule that a Jew is sufficient to determine whether <i>kefiyah</i> (coercion) is proper. See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer,</i> <i>EH</i> 2:64, <i>Teshuvot Ma’aseh Hiya</i> 24 cited by <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, EH</i> 134:32; <i>Teshuvot Yehudah</i> (Gordon), <i>EH</i> 51:2; <i>Yad Aharon</i> (Alfandri), <i>EH</i> 134:20–21. See supra Preface, n. 2.<br>In situations where marital reconciliation is not feasible and the grounds for a divorce would not serve as a reason(s) to coerce or obligate a <i>get</i>, the <i>beit din</i> may rule <i>mitzvah le-garesh</i> (a commandment to divorce) or “<i>hamlatzah le-garesh</i>” (a recommendation to get divorced). See further: Yehiel Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment: Principles of Jewish Law,” 15 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> (2004), 57, 79, 136.<br>However, according to normative <i>Halakhah</i>, once a <i>beit din</i> determines that there exist grounds to compel a <i>get</i>, a civil court may coerce the husband to comply with the <i>beit din’s</i> directive without running afoul of the strictures of a “<i>get me’useh</i>”, a coerced <i>get</i>. Such coercion will not run afoul of the strictures of a coerced <i>get</i>. See <i>SA EH</i> 134:9.

Citing and expounding upon the sources of <i>Halakhah</i>, Professor Schereschewsky elucidates,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem Elon, ed. <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i> (Jerusalem, 1975), 415–417.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The wife is entitled to demand a divorce on the grounds of (a) physical defects of her husband or (b) his conduct toward her . . . in order to obtain a divorce on the grounds of physical defects the wife must prove that these preclude him, or her, from the possibility of cohabiting with each other . . . or because the defects are likely to arouse in her feelings of revulsion when in his proximity, and the like.

The grounds on which the husband may demand a divorce . . . are mainly similar to those that afford the wife this right against him . . .
In effect, these grounds of compelling the issuance of a <i>get</i> by a <i>beit din</i>, namely physical defects and inappropriate behavior of a spouse, are mentioned in the Mishnah and Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ketuvot</i> 7:9–10; Mishnah <i>Nedarim</i> 11:12; <i>Ketuvot</i> 63b, 75-76a, 77a-b, <i>Yevamot</i> 65b.</i> After the Talmudic period, the question arises whether a <i>beit din</i> may compel a husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife or compel a wife to accept a <i>get</i> from him in circumstances not mentioned in the Mishnah and Talmud. The question hinges upon whether grounds for compelling a <i>get</i> is limited to the specific examples of physical defects such as a husband who has a contagious disease or who is sexually impotent or examples of inappropriate conduct of a spouse such as wife-beating or refusal to support his wife mentioned in the Mishnah and Talmud; or could the list be expanded based upon drawing inferences by way of <i>“hekesh”</i> (analogical reasoning) to encompass other instances not mentioned in these <i>halakhic</i> compendiums?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i> 63; <i>Sefer Meisharim, netiv</i> 23, <i>helek</i> 8; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Ketuvot</i> 5:34; <i>Tur, EH</i> 9, <i>Beit Yosef</i>, ad. loc.; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 73; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 241; <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 149; <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 1, at 53–57.</i> For example, if a wife claims “my husband is repulsive to me” are there grounds to compel a <i>get</i> (or obligate a <i>get</i>)<i>?</i> Given that this claim isn’t mentioned in the Mishnah and Talmud,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Seemingly, one may contend that the plea ought to be recognized as grounds for divorce due to the fact that the wife hasn’t cast her eyes on another man.

Or to place this matter in a contemporary context, what grounds, if any, are there to compel a husband who is infected with HIV or who is a drug addict to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PDR</i> 18:71; A. Atlas, Y. Shahor, and D. Domb, “<i>Get</i> Coercion of a Drug Addict” (Hebrew) 2 <i>Divrei Mishpat</i> (5756) 135; Eliav Shochetman, “AIDS as Grounds for Divorce in Jewish Law” (Hebrew) 25 <i>Mishpatim</i> 25 (1995).</i> Such issues would be subject to the same debate that began in the Middle Ages. Given that AIDS and drug use aren’t mentioned in the Mishnah or Talmud as examples of behavior that potentially poses an endangerment to a spouse, would there be grounds under these circumstances to compel a <i>get</i>?
Seemingly, these ongoing discussions and debates in <i>Halakhah</i> relating to the grounds to compel a divorce fly in the face of our conclusion that the execution of a Jewish divorce is a consensual process. How does a <i>beit din</i> compel a spouse to give or accept a <i>get</i> if a divorce if the voluntary agreement of the parties is required? One of the rationales given for this anomaly—which is briefly alluded to in the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 48a</i>—is expanded upon by Rambam, who writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT</i>,<i> Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20. Precedential opinion may be found in <i>Rashi, Kiddushin</i> 50a. Various <i>Poskim</i> agreed with Rambam’s understanding. See <i>Tosafot Rid, Gittin</i> 88b; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:68; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, SA, HM</i> 208, <i>Biurim</i> 9. Cf. others who contend that <i>get</i> coercion is sanctioned based upon the principle of <i>hafka’at kiddushin</i> (annulment of the marriage).

<span class="poetry indentAll">A person regarding whom the Law indicates that we should force him to divorce his wife and who refuses to divorce, a Jewish court in every place and at every time beats him until he says “I am willing” and he writes a <i>get</i> and this <i>get</i> is valid . . . Why is this <i>get</i> not void, as it was the product of compulsion . . . ? Because we do not talk of compulsion apart from one who was pressured and forced to do a thing that he is not commanded by the Torah to do—for instance someone who was beaten until he executed a sale or donated a gift; but in the case of one whose evil inclination drives him to avoid doing a religious commandment or to commit a sin, and was beaten until he did the thing that he was obligated to do . . . this (subsequent conduct) is not compelled from him rather he compelled himself due to bad judgment. Therefore, someone who does not want to divorce (when <i>Halakhah</i> states that he should divorce –AYW), it follows from the fact that he wants to be part of the community of Israel that he wants to perform the religious commandments . . . and it is his (evil –AYW) inclination that is driving him and because they beat him until his inclination was subdued and he stated “I am willing” he has divorced willingly . . .</span>
Aware of the doctrine of the consensual nature of <i>halakhic</i> divorce as well as the legitimacy of a <i>beit din</i> compelling divorce under certain prescribed conditions, Rambam suggests that one must distinguish between “the real will” and “the actual will” of a Jew who is committed to <i>Halakhah</i>. The real will of this Jew is to comply with the dictates of our <i>mesorah</i> (Jewish tradition), including—but not limited to—delivering (or receiving) a <i>get</i> if <i>Halakhah</i> mandates such an action. However, his actual will, which may be driven by desires that are beyond his control, direct him (or her) to disobey the law. In such circumstances, by coercing the miscreant to obey the <i>beit din</i> by acquiescing to the divorce, we have not forced him (or her) to do what he does not want; on the contrary, we have enabled him (or her) to do what he (or she) really wants! Hundreds of years later, Immanuel Kant—and even later John Rawls—speak of the rational will as the expression of what is required or demanded by reason; a will that is free of inclinations and desires that, although rational, is imperfectly so.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">J. Hodson, <i>The Ethics of Legal Coercion</i> (Holland, 1983) 4.</i> Whereas Kant and Rawls depict this will as controlled by reason, Rambam—as a religious philosopher—defines this notion of rational choice in terms of subservience to the norms of <i>Halakhah</i>. Subsequent to Rambam’s understanding, many authorities endorse his approach that coercion serves as a vehicle to reinstate the recalcitrant spouse’s authentic will to comply with <i>Halakhah</i> and give (or receive) a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 55; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:46.</i> For example, even though a husband may feel the economic pressure to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, at the end of the day the fact that there are <i>halakhic</i> grounds to give the <i>get</i> ensures that the husband is acting voluntarily by granting a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:21.</i> And in contemporary <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where in certain instances a <i>beit din</i> will compel a recalcitrant husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife, the <i>beit din</i> panel informs him that in actuality he is giving the writ of divorce voluntarily.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 56/916, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, Unpublished Decision.</i>
As Rambam explains, the logic behind the legitimacy of a coerced <i>get</i> is that the husband does indeed want in his heart of hearts to obey the teachings of his tradition. The question is whether the “real will” to obey Torah scholars means that there must be a rabbinical consensus that there are grounds to coerce a divorce or is it sufficient for a <i>beit din</i> to render a decision even if it does not reflect the rabbinic consensus? Is the real will actualized when there is unanimity of <i>halakhic</i> opinion or when a <i>beit din</i> hands down a ruling regardless of whether it would be accepted by all decisors?
One ramification of our question emerges in the following context. Addressing the case of a husband who became epileptic, there was a dispute between Rosh, who advocates compulsion to effect a divorce, and Mordekhai, who rejects it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1; <i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 7:201.</i> In light of this controversy, Hatam Sofer, a nineteenth century Hungarian rabbi, invokes his approach to this question. He states,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:116.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even if it is clear in Heaven that <i>halakhah</i> follows Rosh, since there is the opposing opinion of Mordekhai, and we do not have anyone who can decide between them, if one forced him to divorce she is still a definitely married woman . . . The reason I say this is that a coerced <i>get</i>, even when it is enforced according to the Law and he says “I agree”, is nevertheless only fit for the reason that the authorities gave; it is presumably agreeable to fulfill the words of the Rabbis who said one should compel him to divorce – as Maimonides beautifully explained. However, this is only when it is clear to the husband that the coercion is in accordance with the Law according to every authority for if so it is a duty [in the husband’s case] to comply with the teachings of the Rabbis. However in this situation the husband will say, “Who says it is a duty to heed the words of Rosh, perhaps it is an obligation to follow the words of the Mordekhai? So if said, ‘I agree’ it was coerced and did not emanate from his heart” . . .</span>
In reply, in accordance with nineteenth century medical opinion, Hatam Sofer contends that living with an epileptic does not pose a danger to oneself; therefore there are no grounds for coercing a <i>get</i>.
One interpretation of his opinion, which is espoused by Hatan Sofer (his grandson) and R. Elyashiv, is that in cases where there is a dispute amongst <i>Poskim</i> whether there are grounds for a compulsion order, following the doctrine of majority rule will not be determinative. Given that reliance upon a majority view in a <i>halakhic</i> dispute presupposes that the debate is intergenerational, transcending geographical location and a particular time period, resulting in the absence of “give and take” between the <i>Poskim</i>, therefore we must act stringently and follow the minority opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 262; <i>Get Pashut, Kelalim, Kelal</i> 5;</i> In other words, whereas in the context of a <i>beit din</i>, one can speak of “a <i>rov gamur</i>” (an absolute majority), in a <i>halakhic</i> controversy one cannot speak of a <i>rov gamur</i> since there has been no face-to-face deliberation and debate regarding the matter. Implicitly rejecting Radakh’s and Hazon Ish’s approach that the existence of a majority opinion is to be viewed as “<i>itmar hilkhita</i>” (the <i>Halakhah</i> has been decided),<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Radakh, Bayit</i> 3, <i>Heder</i> 1; <i>Hazon Ish, YD</i> 160:3–4</i> Hatam Sofer and R. Elyashiv view “abiding by the majority” in <i>halakhic</i> controversy is readily distinguishable from the procedural rule of following the majority opinion of <i>dayanim</i> in a <i>beit din</i> proceeding. Nonetheless, we follow the stringent, albeit minority, view due to our concern for <i>hezkat eishit ish</i>. To state it in talmudic terms, “following the teachings of Torah scholars” means compliance with the dissenting view and refraining from issuance of a <i>get</i> compulsion order. To borrow Rambam’s nomenclature, the husband’s real will is to abide by the minority view, which means deference to the aforementioned <i>hazakah</i> (presumption), and therefore coercion is not sanctioned.
However, in a case of an <i>agunah</i>, they agree we would follow the majority opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatan Sofer</i> 59; <i>PDR</i> 4:164,166.</i>
In the question posed to Hatam Sofer that did not involve an <i>agunah</i> situation, given that the majority of <i>Poskim</i> do not agree that there are grounds to coerce an epileptic to give a <i>get</i>, Hatam Sofer concludes that coercive measures are unwarranted. Even if the majority view sanctioned a compulsion order, “the husband’s real will” would have failed to emerge due to the fact that there was a minority opinion.
However, upon a closer reading of his <i>teshuvah</i>, one encounters a differing understanding of Hatam Sofer’s position. As he notes regarding the precondition for coercing a <i>get</i>,
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is only when it is clear to the husband that the coercion is in accordance with the Law according to every authority for if so it is a duty [in the husband’s case] to comply with the teachings of the Rabbis. However in this situation the husband will say, ‘Who says it is a duty to heed the words of Rosh, perhaps it is an obligation to follow the words of the Mordekhai? So if he said, ‘I agree’ it (the <i>get</i> –AYW) was coerced and did not emanate from his heart . . .</span>
In other words, a husband’s constructive consent to give a <i>get</i> is predicated upon the fact that all authorities agree that a <i>get</i> ought to be coerced. Should one opinion disagree, one cannot speak of “a husband’s real will” to give a <i>get.</i>
Such an interpretation of his position resonates in the writings of Sdei Hemmed, Sha’arei De’ah, Ein Yitzhak, Heikhal Yitzhak, and Dvar Yehoshua. In fact a well-respected Sephardic <i>Posek</i>, R. Eliyahu Alfandri, endorses Hatam Sofer’s approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed</i>, vol. 7, <i>Ma’arekhet Gerushin</i> 1:15; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei De’ah</i> (Litwin) 1:119; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:2; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i>, Vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 30; <i>Teshuvo</i>t <i>Seder Eliyahu</i> 13. Though R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor of Kovno does not explicitly endorse this position, nonetheless his argumentation in resolving two cases belies such an approach. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> 2:35, <i>anaf</i> 2 (9), <i>anaf</i> 5 (34). Cf. other <i>Poskim</i> who contend that we do not employ <i>get</i> coercion where there is a <i>halakhic</i> doubt what the <i>Halakhah</i> ought to be. See <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema EH</i> 154:21.</i> If there is a <i>halakhic</i> controversy concerning whether there is a foundation for a compulsion order, constructive consent of the husband is nonexistent. Given that one of the distinguishing characteristics of <i>Halakhah</i> is its pluralistic nature,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Itzak Englard, “Majority Decision v. Individual Truth” 15 <i>Tradition</i> (1975) 137; Shalom Rosenberg, <i>It is not in Heaven</i>, (Hebrew), (Har Etzion, 1997).</i> namely the divergence of opinion concerning a particular matter, adopting Hatam Sofer’s position inexorably leads to the conclusion that anytime there is an opinion which rejects a wife’s claim as grounds for divorce, one cannot speak of a husband’s consent to grant a <i>get</i>. In effect, a husband’s imputed consent to comply with the norms of <i>halakhic</i> divorce will in many instances never transpire due to the ongoing existence of <i>halakhic</i> controversy whether there is a basis for giving a writ of divorce. Consequently, in pursuance to Hatam Sofer’s approach, a <i>beit din</i> will almost never compel a divorce judgment. Realizing the ramifications of his view, Hazon Ish exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 99:23.In fact, in situations where the accepted <i>minhag</i> is to follow the teachings of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>, though there may exist dissenting positions; one ought to comply with the former rulings. See <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 99:5. Cf. others who argue that <i>hezkat eishit ish</i> propels one to defer to any ruling that says to act stringently. See <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 242:4; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov, EH</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 39.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And Hatam Sofer’s ruling one cannot sustain!</span>
The question is which notion of imputed consent found resonance amongst the other <i>Poskim</i> who addressed whether an epileptic can be coerced to give a <i>get</i>? Is it constructive consent based upon <i>halakhic</i> unanimity of opinion serving as grounds for <i>get</i> coercion? Or is it rooted in the husband’s willingness to accept <i>beit din’s</i> authority to render a decision, a ruling that may not necessarily reflect <i>halakhic</i> consensus?
If we focus upon Hatam Sofer’s scenario of the epileptic husband various lines of reasoning have been invoked in order to arrive at the conclusion that an epileptic husband may be compelled to give his wife a Jewish writ of divorce. Despite the fact that epilepsy is neither mentioned in the Mishnah nor in the Talmud, nonetheless some draw inferences by analogy by contending that the disease of epilepsy should be viewed as “a <i>mum gadol</i>” (a major defect) no different than boils and other afflictions that are mentioned explicitly in the Mishnah and Talmud where compulsion orders may be rendered.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 28; Rabbi Yitzhak ben Meir and Rabbi Hayyim ben Yosef cited by Rosh, op. cit.</i> Others concur with the above argumentation and add that we are dealing with a disease that endangers the life of others and therefore grounds exist to coerce a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i> in the name of R. Yitzhak ben Meir, supra n. 28; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 154:19; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Gavison</i> 10.</i> Echoing the above approach, others claim that the majority or many of the <i>Poskim</i> consider epilepsy as posing a danger to others; therefore compulsion orders are to be sanctioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Asher</i> 1:45<i>; Teshuvot Maharam of Lublin</i> 1; <i>PDR</i> 4:164, 171–173, 8: 216, 218</i> To state it differently, as noted by these <i>Poskim,</i> the stringency of potential endangerment trumps the <i>hezkat eishit ish</i>!
The fact is that there are <i>Poskim</i> who agree with Rosh’s position; therefore, Maharit argues that one may rely upon these authorities despite the fact that Ra’avyah disagrees. Moreover, Maharit claims that had Ra’avyah been aware of the fact that Rabbeinu Gershom rules in favor of <i>get</i> coercion, Ra’avyah would have changed his mind. In Maharit’s, Radvaz’s and Maharhash’s words, the fact that Ra’avyah disagrees and therefore engenders a doubt whether coercion is permissible, such “a doubt should not trump what is certain”, namely following the opinion of others who mandate <i>get</i> coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:14, 113; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:53; <i>Teshuvot Maharshash, EH</i> 33.</i>
On the other hand, some <i>Poskim</i> such as Rema, Shakh, and others argue in a case of a doubt where we are dealing with <i>hezkat eishet ish</i>, one must act stringently and refrain from compelling a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, SA, YD</i> 242, <i>Pilpul ha-Hanhagot</i> <i>Hora’ot Issur ve-Heter</i>; <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 25:2; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:21; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:212; <i>Teshuvot Emunat Shmuel</i> 6. See supra chapter 8b.</i> Such a position is echoed in different contexts by other authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 242; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Ketuvot</i> 72b; <i>SA, EH</i> 11:8; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:21</i> Others argue that epilepsy does not pose a danger to others and therefore a <i>beit din</i> is not empowered to hand down a <i>get</i> compulsion order.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n.29.</i> And given that epilepsy is neither mentioned in the Mishnah nor the Talmud, some decisors consequently contend that compelling a divorce under such circumstances is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, EH</i> 154, <i>hagahah Beit Yosef</i> 6; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 154:9.</i>
In short, our brief overview of the <i>halakhic</i> controversy regarding whether an epileptic husband may be compelled to give a <i>get</i> centers on the varying canons of the decision-making process, the nature of epilepsy, and the concerns for <i>eishet ish</i>. None of the aforementioned authorities who reject <i>get</i> coercion advances the position that their position stems from the precondition of obtaining unanimity of opinion as suggested by one interpretation of Hatam Sofer’s view.
Even those who espouse <i>get</i> compulsion judgments based upon the fact that the majority supported such a conclusion<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying n. 38.</i> were implicitly contending, as we find regarding other questions, that the rule of acting in accordance with the majority is determinative rather than that the majority opinion is reflective of “a husband’s real will”, as suggested as an alternate explanation of Hatam Sofer’s view. Adopting the latter perspective would have required that one follow the minority opinion in the absence of an <i>igun</i> situation as a form of stringency and abstain from <i>get</i> coercion even in the face of the majority opinion. But, in fact, a review of the fact patterns of the cases addressed<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 44.</i> demonstrates that we were dealing with a situation where a wife was desirous of a <i>get</i>, unmarked by any <i>igun,</i> and yet the <i>Poskim</i> follow the majority view and compelled a <i>get</i> of an epileptic husband.
Our differing understandings concerning the jurisprudential basis for <i>get</i> coercion emerge from a <i>teshuvah</i> of Hatam Sofer dealing with an epileptic husband that fails to find support in the aforementioned rulings. In effect, in contradistinction to Hatam Sofer’s teaching, our review indicates that the grounds of compulsion, at least with regard to an epileptic husband, is anchored in a <i>beit din’s</i> authority to resolve this matter based upon the techniques of <i>halakhic</i> decision-making, the nature of epilepsy, and concern for <i>hezkat eishit ish</i>—as is suggested by Sdei Hemed, Sha’arei De’ah, Ein Yitzhak, Heikhal Yitzhak, Hazon Ish, and Dvar Yehoshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 33 and 35.</i>
Lest one challenge our conclusion by arguing that other <i>ilot gerushin</i> (grounds for divorce) belie an endorsement of Hatam Sofer’s view, let’s focus on two other possible grounds for coercing a <i>get</i>. One example is a husband who frequently employs physical abuse against his wife. Such behavior is not enumerated in the Mishnah and Talmud of Ketuvot as one of the instances that serve as grounds for a <i>get</i> compulsion order. Nonetheless, R. Meir of Rothenberg [Maharam] and R. Binyamin Slonik contend that if the Mishnah rules that a husband who refrains from engaging in conjugal relations for a month is grounds for coercion, <i>a fortiori</i> such ought to be the case for an abusive husband!<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague ed., 946; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 1:88.</i> Invoking the view of some Gaonim, Rabbeinu Simhah, Maharam, and Ramban, Darkhei Moshe conclude that a batterer can be coerced to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur EH</i> 154:3.To fully understand the basis of his ruling, see <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 154:10; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, EH</i> 154:18–19. See also <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i>, vol. 6, 42, Chapter 3.<br>Upon reading <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:3, many <i>Poskim</i> conclude that in a case of a batterer concludes Rosh that one cannot coerce the husband to give a <i>get</i>. However, a review of manuscripts has shown that his ruling is fragmented and the original text as found in manuscript form would lead to a contrary conclusion. See T.

On the other hand, others rely upon Rosh’s ruling that the list of cases of <i>kefiyat get</i> (coerced <i>get</i>) found in the Mishnah and Talmud Ketuvot is closed<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:3</i> and therefore one cannot adduce any inference by analogy to expand the instances beyond those explicitly mentioned in these compendiums.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Geonim, Ketuvot</i> 70; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, vol. 4, <i>EH</i> 14; <i>Teshuvot Mishpat Tzedek</i>, vol. 1, 59; <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 74 in the name of Ramban; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 8:102; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 5, <i>EH</i> 14; <i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 14:146</i> Moreover, though admittedly Rabbeinu Simhah, Ohr Zarua, and Agudah concur that coercion is permitted, nonetheless Beit Yosef opines that given the fact that well-known <i>Poskim</i> fail to agree, <i>get</i> coercion lacks foundation.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 154(end).</i> Finally, R. Moshe ben Yisrael of eighteenth-century Rhodes claims that in light of the fact that there is a <i>halakhic</i> controversy whether one can coerce an abusive husband to give a <i>get</i>, there is therefore no basis for <i>get</i> coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maset Moshe</i>, supra n. 50; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 50. These rulings are based upon the normative judgment that in a case of doubt, one refrains from coercing the giving of a <i>get</i>. See<i> SA, EH</i> 154:21,<i> Rema</i>, ad locum.</i> Lest one conclude that his position stems from implicitly adopting the Hatam Sofer’s approach that unanimity is required prior to mandating a compulsion judgment, his argumentation conveys a different message. On the contrary, R. ben Yisrael writes that we must distance us from imposing <i>kefiyah</i> in order to avoid that the ostensibly divorced woman may remarry and have children who will be stigmatized as <i>mamzerim</i>. In other words, the concern is for <i>hezkat eishit ish</i> rather than any requisite need to have a rabbinic consensus prior to <i>kefiyat ha-get</i>. In short, following in the well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> (tradition) of Tashbetz, Rema, and R. Akiva Eiger, whether battery serves as an <i>ilat gerushin</i> (a claim for <i>get</i> coercion) is within the province of a <i>beit din’s</i> discretion.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Tashbetz, supra n. 49; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 96; <i>Sefer Drush ve-Hiddush</i>, vol. 1 (end).</i>
Another ground for a <i>get</i> compulsion order, according to Shulhan Arukh, is a husband who refuses to engage in the performance of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>onah</i> (conjugal relations).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 77:1; 154:1</i> Upon the inception of marriage, a husband is obligated to engage in conjugal relations with his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 76:11,77:2</i> In other words, a husband who is sexually capable of <i>onah</i> but simply refuses to perform is labeled under certain conditions a <i>moreid</i> (a rebellious husband) and is coerced to give a <i>get</i>.
Other <i>Poskim</i> contend that the husband must also be delinquent in paying <i>mezonot ishah</i> (spousal support) prior to issuing such a compulsion judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. <i>yotzi</i>; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague ed., 946(end); <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Yevamot</i> 6:11 in the name of Rabbeinu Hannanel; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ritva</i> 122; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:68</i> On the other hand, given that this situation is absent from the list found in the Mishnah and Talmud of husbands who can be coerced, some <i>Poskim</i> reject the notion that such spousal behavior serves as grounds for a compulsion order.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 154:21 in the name of <i>yesh omrim</i>; <i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 22 in the name of Maharam</i> Moreover, Gevurat Anashim argues that a <i>beit din</i> should be concerned about the stringent opinion and therefore refrain from imposing any coercive measures in order to have a husband give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 17a.</i> In effect, his position resonates in Rema’s <i>psak din</i> that in case of doubt, one does not render a divorce compulsion decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:21.</i>
In short, in dealing with a husband who is an epileptic, batterer, or a spouse who is delinquent in his marital duty of engaging in conjugal relations, in contradistinction to Hatam Sofer’s teaching that there is a mandate to have <i>halakhic</i> unanimity prior to the issuance of a decision lest one run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>, our review indicates that the grounds for compulsion—at least with regard to these situations—is anchored in a <i>beit din’s</i> authority to resolve this matter based upon the techniques of <i>halakhic</i> decision-making and concern for <i>hezkat eishit ish</i> as we earlier suggested in the name of Sdei Hemed, Sha’arei De’ah, Ein Yitzhak, Heikhal Yitzhak, Hazon Ish, and Dvar Yehoshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 33 and 35.</i> These are judgments that may not reflect unanimity yet fail to raise the specter of a <i>get me’useh.</i>

Based upon our foregoing presentation, one would expect to find that the Israeli rabbinical courts would have weighed in on the varying grounds of coercing a <i>get</i>—either by affirming the imposition of a <i>get</i> compulsion judgment or rejecting it. One would expect to encounter some decisions supporting the compulsion order and others rejecting it. In the absence of a compulsion decree, our discussion will address the grounds that empower a panel to <i>obligate</i> a husband to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">If a <i>beit din</i> issues a judgment to coerce a divorce, the particular rulings apply equally to obligating a <i>get</i>.

So let’s address how these <i>battei din</i> dealt with compelling or obligating a <i>get</i> from an epileptic husband, a husband who refuses to engage in conjugal relations, and a wife-batterer to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. A review of the Israeli <i>battei din</i> decisions shows that given that there is a disagreement whether to coerce an abusive husband, some panels echo Rema’s ruling that in cases of doubt one refrains from either coercing or obligating an abusive husband to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying n. 40; <i>PDR</i> 3:220, 222.</i> However, should a husband’s conduct pose an endangerment to the wife, one invokes the rule “when life is endangered, there is no better argument”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, EH</i> 154</i> or “endangerment entails the need to act more stringently than concerning a prohibition”,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 28</i> and one coerces or obligates the delivery of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 65</i> Relying upon Rosh’s ruling that the list of cases of <i>kefiyat get</i> (coerced <i>get</i>) found in the Mishnah and Talmud Ketuvot is closed,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 52</i> a <i>beit din</i> would obligate a husband who was mentally deranged and engaged in oppressive battery or who attempted to murder his wife to give a <i>get</i> rather than coerce the giving of a Jewish writ of divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:8, 8:216</i> On the other hand, in instances of frequent acts of battery that do not pose a danger to life, other <i>battei din</i> grant a <i>get</i> compulsion order.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 10:3, 8</i> In fact, invoking various authorities such as Rabbeinu Simhah, Ohr Zarua, Tashbetz, Yakhin u-Boaz, and Rema, some <i>battei din</i> conclude that a wife being a victim of assault may serve as grounds for compelling or obligating a husband to deliver a <i>get</i> to his spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:77, 327,11:327; File 4927-21-1, Petah <i>Tikva</i> Regional Beit Din, Plonit v.

Concerning a husband who refuses to engage in conjugal relations, despite the presence of debate whether there are grounds to compel a <i>get</i>, nonetheless, at least one <i>beit din</i> ruled that if we are dealing with a mentally deranged husband and if the separation exceeded five years, then a <i>get</i> may be coerced. On the other hand, given that mental derangement is not one of the instances enumerated in the Mishnah and Talmud, if a husband’s sexual abstinence was for a short period, we may only obligate him to give a writ of Jewish divorce, but not coerce him.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12: 3, 8<br>Whether a husband’s abstention from <i>onah</i> on the night that his wife immersed in the <i>mikvah</i> serves as grounds for obligating a <i>get</i> is subject to debate.

See <i>PDR</i>, op. cit.194; <i>PDR</i> 3:44, 47.</i> Relying upon earlier authority, another <i>beit din</i> does not view epilepsy as a <i>mum gadol</i> (a major defect) and therefore finds no justification for <i>get</i> compulsion.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:216, 220–221</i> In contradistinction to the aforementioned panels, which focus the resolution of this issue within the context of the conventional canons of <i>halakhic</i> decision-making, R. Elyashiv, when serving as a <i>dayan</i> on the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, opine that in the absence of an <i>agunah</i> situation one cannot coerce an epileptic husband to give a <i>get</i> because there exists a dispute amongst decisors whether a <i>get</i> can be given under such circumstances.

In sum, in response to our question whether Hatam Sofer’s position holds sway in regard to <i>get</i> coercion and obligating judgments, at least as regards the cases of an epileptic and abusive husband as well as a husband who abstains from engaging in <i>onah</i>, the overwhelming majority of <i>Poskim</i> contend that such questions are solved within the context of the conventional rules of decision-making and concern for <i>hezkat eishit eish</i> rather than factoring into the equation Hatam Sofer’s position. In fact, on March 6, 1990, addressing the situation of an abusive husband, R. Shear Yashuv Cohen, serving as a dayan on the Haifa Regional Beit Din, writes the following,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 15:145,162</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even though Hatam Sofer states that coercion or duress is permissible provided “it is clear by the divorcer that the coercion is in accordance with <i>halakhah</i>, in accordance with everyone” (Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH 116) . . . Already the scholars of the generation have ruled against him, as R. Yitzhak Herzog . . . R. Elhanan (Spektor –AYW) . . . Hazon Ish . . .”</span>
And in fact our review, as circumscribed as it is, reflects R. Cohen’s assessment. Twenty-one years later, addressing whether a <i>beit din</i> may compel a husband who is non-observant to give a <i>get</i>, notwithstanding the dissenting opinion of R. Ariel Yanai, Rabbis Michoel Amos, and Shneur Pardes of Netanya Regional Beit Din explicitly rejects Hatam Sofer’s approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 467862-1, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

In conclusion, let’s place our presentation within the context of two recent assessments of the Israeli rabbinical courts’ position regarding <i>get</i> coercion. In 2004, Dr. Yehiel Kaplan, Professor of Jewish Family Law at Haifa Law School, states the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Kaplan, supra n. 13, at 114–116.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The rabbinical courts in Israel attached great importance to the stringent views of certain <i>halakhic</i> authorities, particularly the Rosh . . . and R. Moses Sofer (Hatam Sofer –AYW). According to the Rosh, the list of grounds for divorce mentioned in the Mishnah and Talmud as warranting “compulsion” to divorce is closed, and nothing can be added to it. Only in rare cases has the use of analogy enabled <i>halakhic</i> authorities to add new grounds for ‘compulsion’ of divorce . . . as the causes for compelling a <i>get</i> in the early <i>halakhic</i> sources are few and well-defined, this opinion limits the possibility of ruling that a <i>get</i> may be compelled in our day . . .</span>
Three years ago, Dr. Rami Reiner, an Israeli academic, notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">A. Reiner, 17 <i>Netuim</i> 85 (2011).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In the question of a coerced <i>get</i> regarding recalcitrant husbands, R. Elyashiv introduced a trend when he was serving on the rabbinical court that impeded almost any possibility of compelling a divorce. As the years progressed and his <i>halakhic</i> influence grew, this position became more and more the dominant trend in the rabbinical courts . . . “</span>
Both academics claim that <i>get</i> compulsion orders are a rarity and attribute this phenomenon to the persuasiveness of the authorities Rosh, Hatam Sofer, and R. Elyashiv.
So let’s address whether their assertions that <i>get</i> compulsion orders are few and far between reflect empirical reality? In 1953, the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) enacted a piece of legislation that delegated to the Israeli Rabbinical Courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters dealing with matters of marriage and divorce. Section 6 of The Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage &amp; Divorce) Law, 5713–1953 states as follows:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Where a rabbinical court, by final judgment, has ordered that a husband be compelled to grant his wife a writ of divorce or that a wife be compelled to accept a writ of divorce from her husband, a District court, upon expiration of six months from the day of making the order, on the application of the Attorney General, may compel compliance with the order by imprisonment.</span>
Even after a judgment has been handed by the <i>beit din</i> and, assuming that the recalcitrant spouse continues in his or her refusal to give or accept a <i>get</i>, the spouse who is refused the <i>get</i> must wait six months prior for the Israel’s civil system to issue an order of imprisonment. It is only after the <i>beit din’s</i> ruling has been reviewed by the Attorney General and the district court that the recalcitrant spouse will be incarcerated.
From 1953 until 1974, there were thirty rabbinical court decisions compelling a <i>get</i>. In all cases except for one,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In the wake of Supreme Court Justice Silberg’s decision during the late 1960s, Yihye Abraham was incarcerated in prison due to his refusal to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife. See <i>Attorney General v. Yihye and Ora Abraham,</i> (1968) Piskei Din 22(1), 29, 49–50. A few years ago, he expired in jail.</i> the recalcitrant spouse had a change of a heart and delivered or accepted a <i>get</i> from his or her spouse either prior to the Attorney General or district court’s review of the request for imprisonment or after the issuance of an order of imprisonment.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Zorach Warhaftig, “Coercion to Grant a Divorce in Theory and Practice” (Hebrew), 3–4 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> 153, 212 (1976–1977)</i> Nevertheless, even during this span of time, the rabbinical courts preferred to utilize moral persuasion or financial pressure in the form of ordering a substantial amount of spousal maintenance to be paid to the wife to procure a <i>get</i> from the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 210.</i>
However, in subsequent years, the Israeli rabbinical courts rendered more and more divorce judgments of “obligating a divorce” rather than compelling a <i>get</i>. In the late eighties, R. Shlomo Daichovsky, a former <i>dayan</i> serving on the Supreme Beit Din, notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo Daichovsky, “A Critique of Rabbinical Court Decisions” (Hebrew) 13–14 <i>Dinei Yisrael</i> 7,15 (1986–1988).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The possibility (referring to <i>get</i> compulsion –AYW) rarely happens.</span>
In 1995, R. Professor Shochetman, an international authority on rabbinic court procedure (in particular Israeli beit din procedure) observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Shochetman, supra n. 21 at 421.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Divorce is almost never compelled today in the State of Israel, despite the legal authority that rests in the hands of the rabbinical courts.</span>
Upon his retirement in 2007, after having concluded serving thirty-two years in the rabbinical court system, twenty years of which were on the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, R. Daichovsky offers the following thoughts to his fellow arbitrators.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">S. Daichovsky, “Appropriate Judicial Practice in the Rabbinic Courts” 4 <i>Milin Havivin</i> 141, 149 (2008–2010).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In today’s unrestrained generation, we are all aware of the overriding importance of bringing a failed marriage to a quick resolution. Neither husbands nor wives are prepared to wait indefinitely for the sought-after <i>get</i>, and if the proceedings drag on too long, they will make their own rules. The rabbinical courts in our time . . . have the full authority to work in accordance with emergency measures in certain cases. A rabbinical court can and must make use of the means brought by Rambam as emergency measures—including imprisonment—in order to arrive at a speedy resolution. <i>Get me’useh</i> does not constitute a <i>halakhic</i> stumbling block when the matter is arranged by a rabbinical court in accordance with the accepted, as stated in Rambam’s well-known words . . .</span>
In other words, R. Daichovsky implores his colleagues to invoke Rambam’s ruling that we presented, namely that coercion is legitimate means to generating the delivery of <i>get</i> by the husband to his wife provided that there are <i>halakhic</i> grounds for arriving at that determination without requiring unanimity of opinion.
Our review of some of the judgments handed down by the courts under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate between 2005 until May 2013 (that we accessed from www.daat.il via the <i>mishpat ivri</i> icon) arrives at the identical conclusion advanced by the aforementioned rabbis and academic scholars. Of the seventy-eight judgments that we reviewed, all of them—except for two judgments—obligated or recommended<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">In cases where a rabbinical court finds no grounds to issue “a compelling decree” or “obligating a divorce”, the court renders a “recommendation order” which means that it is desirable that the parties divorce. Though Israeli law regards this divorce order as a bona fide judgment [see High Court of Justice 661/77 <i>Haber v. Supreme Rabbinical Court</i>, P.D.32 (30, 329 (1978); High Court of Justice 644/79 <i>Guttman v. Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Rabbinical Court</i>, P.D. 34 (1), 443, 446–448 (1980)], it has no practical implications.</i>, rather than compelled, a divorce. In the majority of cases, the rabbinical court issued “an obligating divorce decree”. In two cases, the court issued compulsion orders.
Below please find the breakdown of judgments reviewed as per the various courts located throughout the State of Israel:
BEIT DIN HA-RABBANI HA-GADOL: 1 of 10 panels compelled a divorce. The others either obligated or recommended a divorce.
JERUSALEM REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 3 panels obligated or recommended giving a divorce and one dissenting opinion compelled a <i>get</i>.
TEL AVIV-YAFFO REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 17 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
PETAKH TIKVAH REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 4 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
ASHKELON REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 1 panel obligated to give a divorce.
ASHDOD REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 4 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
BE’ER SHEVA REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 2 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
TIBERIAS REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 3 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce, one panel compelled a divorce.
NETANYA REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 15 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
HAIFA REGIONAL RABBINICAL COURT: 17 panels obligated or recommended to give a divorce.
Subsequently, we reviewed forty-seven decisions found in 32 pamphlets entitled The Law &amp; its Decisor, a publication of the Bar Ilan University Rackman Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women (edited by Prof. Radzyner), and we found that the majority of the judgments are “obligating orders” and one is a compulsion order. (As per Professor Radzyner’s written communication to me, this series of judgments does not appear on www.daat.il.)
Given that we have only reviewed one hundred twenty-five divorce decisions on two websites, let us mention that six years ago, Professor B. Shmueli, Law Professor at Bar Ilan Faculty of Law, accessed two other sites and concluded upon his review that only a handful of compulsion orders are handed down annually.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">B. Shmueli, “What have Calabresi &amp; Melamed got to do with Family Affairs?” 25 <i>Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Society</i> 125, 155 (2010).</i> Between 2012 and 2013, there were 16 compulsion orders versus 234 decisions obligating a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See A. Radzyner, 45 <i>Mishpatim</i> 1, 52, n. 197 (5775).</i>
In other words, despite the fact that these courts have chosen to refrain from issuing compulsion orders that would have been translated into orders of imprisonment in accordance with Section 6 of The Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage &amp; Divorce) Law, 5713–1953, the rabbinical courts are issuing a divorce judgment at a lower level of enforcement, namely an “obligation to divorce”. The practical implications of such a divorce order are sometimes limited to a <i>beit din</i> mandate to enlarge the sum of spousal support for the wife or the court issuance of judgment in the form of a social sanction, directing that community pressure ought to be placed upon the husband to give a <i>get</i>. In other cases, such obligation decrees are implemented by enforcing Section 2(1) to 2(6) of the Rabbinical Courts Law (Enforcement of Divorce Judgments), which was enacted in 1995 by the Israeli Parliament. In pursuance with the aforementioned sections, in instances where a rabbinical court has rendered a judgment that <i>obligates</i> a spouse to either deliver or receive a <i>get</i> and the spouse refuses to comply with the order, passports may be confiscated, bank accounts frozen, driver’s license suspended, working in a profession regulated by law or operation of a business requiring a license may be hindered, and he/she will not be allowed to leave Israel. Since the passage of this legislation, numerous <i>dayanim</i> serving on the <i>battei din</i> under the auspices of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate have given their <i>halakhic</i> imprimatur to these restrictive orders.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 056370117-64-2, Ashkelon Regional Beit Din, 26 Sivan 5756; File no. 023574569-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, 27 Adar 5759; File no. 009150145-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, March 24, 1999; File no. 022106561-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, February 10, 2000; File no. 9217-21-2, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

Secondly, this legislation is seemingly a form of coercion and therefore should be invalid in light of our conclusion that Jewish divorce is premised upon the mutual consent of the parties. However, authorities were well aware of this issue hundreds of years ago when they endorsed similar types of measures relating to cases of “obligating divorce”. The rationale offered at the time and endorsed by many in subsequent generations is that these restrictions authored by Rabbeinu Tam entail “withholding benefit”, which involves a rational choice whether to give a <i>get</i> or be subject to these social measures—rather than involving a classic form of duress.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, YD</i> 132; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 134:64; <i>Kerem Shlomo, EH</i> 22; <i>Teshuvot Tzel ha-Kesef</i> 1:5–6; <i>Teshuvot Rosh Mashbir, EH</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i> 1,39; <i>Teshuvot Eliyahu Rabba</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Rav Bezalel Ashkenazi</i> 6,19; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 23, 8 <i>EH</i> 25.</i> In other words, these isolating measures are directed against the community to refrain from providing services to the recalcitrant spouse rather than a form of coercion meted out against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah,vol. 2, EH</i> 81.</i> Nonetheless, there are well-respected legists that construe the withholding of these benefits as an example of illicit coercion and therefore unlawful.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, Gevurat Anashim</i> 72 (end) cited in <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 154; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Krochmal) 262; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 2:18, 79, 3:102; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 108:12.<br>In fact, though many <i>dayyanim</i> have approved of these restrictive orders which entail withholding benefits (see supra n. 93–94), nevertheless these measures are an infringement, among other things, upon the recalcitrant spouse’s right of mobility. And as such it may be viewed as a form of illicit coercion.</i> To state it differently, there have been have been well over a hundred arbiters spanning a few centuries who have weighed in on all or many issues. Some of them are well respected, which means that on numerous occasions others cite their decisions authoritatively. The others, though they are proficient in <i>Halakhah</i>, are not cited as frequently and sometimes fail to be acknowledged at all in this ongoing debate. Consequently, given that there exists these well-respected authorities who oppose these measures, it behooves us to be concerned that “their voices may suddenly be heard” and translate into rabbinical court opposition to invoking these restrictive orders in cases of <i>get</i> recalcitrance.
Finally, the practical consequences of the level of divorce enforcement in the form of “obligating divorce” has been playing itself out since 2004 in various Israeli (civil) family courts, who have addressed four tortuous causes of actions against husbands who refuse to comply with a rabbinical court’s “obligating order”, a judgment that was obtained in each case after nine to ten years of litigation. In these four cases the Israeli family courts recognized a tort of negligence and awarded monetary damages to the <i>agunah</i> either based upon the husband’s refusal to comply with the rabbinical court’s obligation decree or recommendation order, which was viewed as a violation of Article 35 of Israel’s Tort Ordinance, or due to the emotional damage caused by the husband’s <i>get</i> recalcitrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Family Court (Jerusalem) 19720/03 <i>K.S. v.

In sum, compulsion orders for granting relief to a victimized spouse due to <i>get</i> recalcitrance are infrequent and “obligating divorce” judgments, albeit legally enforceable in the form of restrictive orders, sometimes do not translate into <i>get</i> compliance and under certain circumstances propel Jews to file claims in the Israeli family (civil) courts, an inappropriate response under <i>Halakhah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 26:1.</i> due to the fact that Jews must resolve their differences in a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 26:1</i> To state it differently, we review of the infrequency of <i>get</i> compulsion orders being handed down by Israeli rabbinical courts reinforces Kaplan’s and Reiner’s examination of the matter.
That being said, the outstanding question remaining is whether this infrequency of issuing such judgments ought to be attributed to these panels’ steadfast subservience to the opinions of Rosh, Hatam Sofer, and R. Elyashiv as suggested by Kaplan and Reiner. Admittedly, in a few instances Rosh declines to impose a compulsion decree;<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh, supra n. 52. Additionally, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 17:6, 43:3; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Yevamot</i> 6:11.Interestingly enough, the manuscripts of Rosh’s <i>teshuvot</i> reveal that in the situation of a deranged husband who is a batterer, Rosh does in fact conclude that you can coerce him to give a get. See T. Elitzur, “A Husband’s Violence as Grounds for <i>Get</i> Coercion” (Hebrew), <i>Weekly Portion,</i> No. 433, Israel’s Ministry of Justice.</i> yet there are other situations where Rosh invokes inference by analogy based upon the list of cases enumerated in the Mishnah and Talmud in Ketuvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1, 43:6; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh Ketuvot</i> 4:3, 5:34</i> Moreover, the failure to mandate a compulsion judgment stems from his understanding that the list is closed regarding a particular disease or spousal behavior unless one can demonstrate that a disease which is not specified is similar to a disorder which is mentioned. Such a line of reasoning occurs in many realms of <i>Halakhah</i>. For example, according to certain <i>Poskim,</i> one can only annul marriages in the various situations mentioned in the Talmud. If there arises a case that was not discussed in the Talmud, annulment is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1185, 2: 230; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef, Dinei Kiddushin</i> 7.</i> Interestingly, whereas as we found that regarding <i>get</i> compulsion decisions in certain instances Rosh considers the Mishnaic and Talmudic list as closed, nevertheless regarding marital annulment concerning a situation where a party acted improperly during the <i>kiddushin</i> ceremony, Rosh invokes an analogy to a situation cited explicitly in the Talmud!<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 35:2 (end).</i> In other words, it is within the discretion of an authority to decide whether a list is open or not. In the situation of marital annulment, Rosh argues that it is open and concerning <i>get</i> compulsion decrees in certain instances he considers it closed. And in fact other <i>Poskim</i> disagree with Rosh and refuse to infer by analogy and consider the list regarding marital annulment as closed.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Ra’avan, Gittin</i> 47b.</i>
Moreover, Kaplan’s and Reiner’s conclusions that Hatam Sofer’s and R. Elyashiv’s views “hold rein”, at least with regard to the cases of an epileptic and an abusive husband as well as a husband who refuses to engage in conjugal relations, is partially without foundation. Regarding the interpretation of Hatam Sofer’s position that requires <i>halakhic</i> unanimity prior to issuing a <i>get</i> compulsion ruling, our examination of the aforementioned <i>ilot gerushin</i> does not reveal any endorsement of this view of Hatam Sofer. On the other hand, R. Elyashiv’s understanding (which is equally Hatan Sofer’s perception of his grandfather’s approach) is manifested in some of the opinions of the <i>Poskim</i> who will refrain from issuing a <i>get</i> coercion judgment in light of a minority view that rejects mandating such coercion due to the concern for the <i>hazakah</i>.
In short, our presentation belies the approach of Sdei Hemed, Sha’arei De’ah, Ein Yitzhak, Heikhal Yitzhak, Hazon Ish, and Dvar Yehoshua,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 33 and 35.</i> that the legitimacy to coerce a <i>get</i> or not is a function of how authorities in every generation implement various <i>halakhic</i> tools to arrive at a determination. In certain instances, decisors may follow the majority opinion, which may or may not allow for <i>get</i> coercion. The fact that there is an absence of unanimity to coerce a <i>get</i> does not preclude a <i>Posek</i> from obligating a <i>get</i> based upon various grounds. Therefore, even in the absence of <i>halakhic</i> unanimity, when a husband is coerced by a <i>beit din</i> to give a <i>get</i> he is in actuality complying with the teachings of <i>Poskim</i> who employed the canons of decision-making rather than representing a rabbinical consensus regarding the pending matter. In Rambam’s words, upon giving the <i>get</i> as mandated by the <i>beit din</i> the husband is attentive to “his real will”.

Chapter 2; The Propriety of a Conditional Divorce

For many years, our Torah-observant community has encountered both here, abroad, and in Israel, situations where a recalcitrant spouse chooses to condition the giving or the acceptance of a <i>get</i> upon certain benefits—such as receiving monetary remuneration from the opposing spouse or having certain issues related and/or unrelated to the end-of-marriage resolved in a <i>beit din</i>.
Let me share two cases that I have encountered in the last few years. For over five years a wife shares a bedroom with her husband and refuses to engage in conjugal relations with him and is unwilling to accept a <i>get</i> from her husband. Knowing very well that the majority of <i>battei din</i> in New York City, barring the existence of a wife’s legal title to the marital home, will not give a wife a fifty percent share of the home upon divorce, one day the wife informs her husband that “I will accept the <i>get</i> on condition that you transfer fifty percent of the ownership of our home to me.” He transferred fifty percent of the ownership of the home to his wife but she remained recalcitrant. Subsequently, she advanced another demand that the husband honored. Yet still the wife remained adamant about refusing to receive the <i>get</i>. In another case, a husband demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars from his wife in exchange for giving the <i>get</i>.
According to <i>Halakhah</i>, dissolution of the matrimonial bond requires the voluntary agreement of both spouses; failure of one spouse to assent to the divorce action precludes execution of the divorce. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> produces a divorce that is arguably invalid, a <i>get me’useh</i> (forced <i>get</i>). Nonetheless, in the absence of a <i>beit din</i> obligating him to grant a <i>get</i>, and in the absence of a <i>minhag</i> (practice) to proscribe executing a <i>get</i> upon fulfillment of a particular condition, there exists no <i>halakhic</i> impediment for a husband to stipulate that his consent at the time of <i>seder ha-get</i> (execution of a Jewish writ of divorce) is dependent on his wife’s compliance with certain conditions, a form of divorce known as <i>gerushin al tenai</i>. For example, should he specify, “I will grant you your <i>get</i> on the condition that you give me 200 <i>zuz</i> (a coin from Talmudic times),” she is divorced and she remits it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Gittin</i> 7:5–9; <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (hereafter: <i>MT</i>), <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 8:1; <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 29:7, 143:1.</i> <i>A fortiori</i>, in the wake of the handing down of a <i>beit din</i> divorce judgment, financial as well as non-financial inducements brokered between the couple—whether to appease a recalcitrant husband or a recalcitrant wife—do not contravene the strictures against a coerced divorce. Echoing the view of earlier authorities in various judgments “obligating divorce”,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 35:2; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo,</i> <i>EH</i> 80 (2); <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Zemah Tzedek</i> 262–263.</i> R. Elyashiv permits a husband whose wife refuses to accept a <i>get</i> to appease his recalcitrant spouse by offering money in exchange for her accepting the <i>get</i>; the ensuing divorce is not deemed to be unlawfully coerced.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 7:111; 8:36; 9:65. For further discussion, see this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, vol. 1 (Urim: Jerusalem, 2013), 150–152.<br>Implicit in this conclusion is that if the recalcitrant husband receives a pecuniary benefit for granting the <i>get</i>, similar to a sales transaction (see <i>SA, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 205:12, 264:8) where he freely committed to the exchange. Therefore, the exchange is not tainted by duress. See <i>Ohr Zarua</i> 1:754; <i>Teshuvot Maharah Ohr Zarua</i> 126; <i>Beit Yosef, EH</i> 134 in the name of Rashba; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:40; <i>Teshuvot ha-Tashbet</i>z 1:1, 35 (end); <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:110; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot Maharash, Kuntres ha-Moda’ah</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 35 (end); <i>Beit Meir, EH</i> 134 (end); <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, EH</i> 125; <i>Teshuvot Mikhtav mei-Eliyahu, Sha’ar</i> 7:11–12; <i>Teshuvot Tzemah Tzedek</i> (Schneersohn), <i>EH</i> 262:9; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 291; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 167–168; File no. 2573-64-1, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, “Ploni v. Plonit,” November 3, 2005.<br>Cf. other <i>Poskim</i> who would construe the giving of monies in exchange for a get as duress. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Kiddushin</i> 50a; <i>Beit ha-Behirah, Bava Batra</i> 48a; <i>Teshuvot R. Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 93; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 134:8; <i>Keneset ha-Gedolah, EH</i> 134, <i>Hagahot ha-Tur</i> 31; <i>Torat Gittin, EH</i> 134:4. To state it differently, following in the footsteps of <i>Tosafot, Bava Metzia</i> 8a, s.v. <i>ileima me-ha</i>, these <i>Poskim</i> contend that one cannot compare a sale finalized under duress to coercing a <i>get</i>. Regarding the latter, there is an additional requirement of complying with the directives of rabbinic authorities to give a <i>get</i>. Hence, the <i>halakhot</i> of duress regarding sales are inapplicable to matters of <i>get</i>. Consequently, though <i>gemirat da’at</i> (firm resolution of the parties) is obtained by transferring money in finalizing a sales transaction, such an exchange will invalidate the giving of a <i>get</i>, which requires <i>ratzon</i> (a willingness), which is defined by complying with rabbinic authority. For conceptual differences between <i>gemirat da’at</i> required for a sale and <i>ratzon</i> mandated for a divorce, see <i>Hiddushei Rabbeinu Hayyim ha-Levi, Dinei Yibbum va-Halitzah</i> 4:16; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av</i>, vol. 1, <i>Dinnei Ones, Anaf</i> 5; File no. 467862/1, Netanya Regional Beit Din, “Plonit v. Ploni,” January 16, 2011.<br>Even if the transaction is tainted by duress, nonetheless, according to an intermediate view, if it becomes clear to the <i>beit din</i> afterwards that the husband has been appeased, then the exchange is valid. See <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot Hemdat Shlomo, EH</i> 80; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 99:2.</i> Such a conclusion equally applies to a wife’s attempt to appease her recalcitrant husband by offering a material inducement.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 16:271, 275–276.</i> In other words, the acceptance of a material inducement avoids the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>. On the other hand, for example, in our two cases, whether such inducement advanced will be recognized depends upon whether <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes such agreements as exploitative or not, a matter—albeit important and of timely concern—we will not address it here.
What happens, however, in the following case? A husband requests of his spouse that the matter of parenting arrangements should be resolved in <i>beit din</i>. The wife refuses and summons him to civil court and a decision is rendered. Subsequently, the couple appears in <i>beit din</i> in order to arrange for a <i>get</i> and the panel obligates the husband to grant a divorce to his wife. Upon hearing the <i>beit din</i>’s ruling, the husband turns to his wife and says, “I am willing to comply with the <i>beit din</i>’s <i>psak din</i> obligating me to give a <i>get</i> on the condition that you will revisit the parenting arrangements here in <i>beit din</i>.”
In the wake of a <i>beit din</i> obligating a <i>get</i>, we will present the differing views regarding this issue of a husband’s demand for certain preconditions prior to giving a <i>get</i> in general and how various <i>beit din</i> panels serving in the network of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate have addressed this matter, in particular concerning a recalcitrant husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The case of a recalcitrant husband is the more frequent occurrence than the instance of a recalcitrant wife and therefore we are dealing with the situation of a recalcitrant husband.<br>For earlier treatments of this issue of a conditional divorce, see S.

Our question deals with a husband who ostensibly desires to grant a <i>get</i> provided that a condition(s) is first fulfilled. Assuming that a <i>beit din</i> agrees that that there is an <i>ilat gerushin</i> (a ground to obligate a husband to give a <i>get</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Though much of the discussion of our topic focuses upon a <i>beit din</i> that issues a judgment to coerce a divorce, the particular rulings apply equally to obligating a <i>get</i>.

See supra, the preface.</i> may he demand certain conditions from his wife <b>prior</b> to granting the <i>get</i> at the time when other divorce matters are being addressed or resolved at the <i>beit din</i> or in civil court, which will in effect cause a delay in the <i>seder ha-get</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Both time slots (i.e. prior to the <i>seder</i> <i>ha-get</i> or during the <i>seder ha-get</i>) are viewed as “<i>asukim be-oto inyan</i>” (lit. engaged in the same matter) and therefore serve as the appropriate times to raise such conditions. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Bah ha-Hadashot</i> 90; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> (Urbach), <i>EH</i> <i>Gittin</i> 1.</i>
Addressing the situation of a childless marriage (which served as grounds for the <i>beit din</i> judgment to coerce a divorce), the husband, desirous to remarry, stipulated that his wife would receive her <i>get</i> provided that she assent to refrain from marrying any man who was a member of the Jewish municipal government. Rashba, of thirteenth-century Barcelona, Spain, rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:256.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Regardless of the circumstances, anyone who is obligated to divorce cannot stipulate that she cannot marry whomever she wants, and anyone who divorces thus (under such a condition), we coerce him to divorce with a definitive divorce (<i>get gamur</i>) without a condition.</span>
Seemingly, one may contend that Rashba’s opposition to imposing a condition <b>prior</b> to a husband’s granting a <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">One of the requirements at the <i>seder ha-get</i> (the ceremony of executing a <i>get</i>) is that either the <i>beit din</i> state that if a <i>beit din</i> decision or a term of the divorce agreement has been breached, the divorce remains valid, or the husband declare that he is giving the <i>get</i> without any compulsion or condition. However, if the actual <i>get</i> is granted provided a certain <i>condition</i> is met, should the condition be not fulfilled, the giving of the <i>get</i> is null and void. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, Mahadura Tinyana,</i> <i>EH</i> 75, Maharsham, infra n. 10.<br>On the other hand, if a wife advances a promise to her husband before the writing of a <i>get</i> and the promise remains unfulfilled the <i>get</i> is valid.

But, in fact, Rashba’s concluding words “we coerce him to divorce with a definitive divorce (<i>get gamur</i>) without a condition” teaches us that, in the wake of a <i>beit din’</i>s decision to coerce or obligate a Jewish writ of divorce under all circumstances, a precondition is proscribed.

Cf. <i>Kefiyah be-Get</i>, 75 who argues that <i>Tosafot</i> deals with a prohibition to precondition the granting of a <i>get</i> upon a wife’s waiving her right to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. Given that a wife is entitled to her <i>ketubah</i> and it is a debt that the husband owes his wife, one cannot conclude that a husband’s imposition of other preconditions could not be advanced. However, R. Algrabli and R. Amos perceive no reason to distinguish between the waiving of a right to the <i>ketubah</i> and other conditions. In all instances, the imposition of preconditions prior to granting a <i>get</i> is proscribed. See File no. 3222-25-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

Regarding the stipulation of a condition at the actual time of granting a get, the <i>minhag</i> in nineteenth century Navardok, Poland, and Lvov, Ukraine proscribes <i>gerushin al tenai</i>; in 2006, an Israeli <i>dayan</i> states that such was the <i>minhag</i> in Eretz Yisrael.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> <i>EH</i> 147:11; <i>Teshuvot Hessed le-Avraham</i> (Teomim), <i>Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 72; File no. 0027-21-1, August 29, 2004, infra n. 52.

This position is predicated upon the fact that <i>Halakhah</i> sanctions self-help (“<i>aveid inish dina le-nafsheih</i>”) and it is a condition that is “easy to fulfill.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 27b; <i>SA, HM</i> 4; <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n.10; File no. 1-64-5082, supra n. 14.</i> For example, if the amount of the stolen assets exceeds significantly the wife’s financial ability to repay them, the parties will execute a <i>get</i> and subsequently the <i>beit din</i> will address the financial issue that was the condition of the <i>get</i>. Should the wife refuse to receive her <i>get</i> under such terms, since the husband is advancing a claim that he is entitled to according to <i>Halakhah</i>, we can neither coerce nor obligate him to give the <i>get</i> because we do not perceive the wife as an <i>agunah</i>. On the contrary, she has “chained herself” regarding her <i>get</i>. Her husband is willing to grant a <i>get</i> but the impediment is created by her refusal to address her husband’s outstanding legitimate claim, which is a precondition for the execution of the <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Additionally see, <i>Shivat Tzion</i> and <i>Maharik</i>, supra n. 22, <i>Maharashdam</i>, infra n. 45; File no. 1-64-5082, <i>supra</i> n. 14; File no. 9707-21-1, supra n. 19.</i>
According to this approach, what would constitute another legitimate claim that may serve as a precondition to giving a <i>get</i>? Let us say a husband summons his wife to resolve their end-of-marriage matters in <i>beit din</i> and she refuses and proceeds to have everything (except the matter of the <i>get</i>) resolved in civil court. After the issuance of the civil court judgment, the husband informs his wife and states, “I am unhappy with how the court divided up our assets and I want to revisit this issue in <i>beit din</i> and recoup my court and legal fees which were incurred while fighting you in court. Therefore, I am demanding that we now appear in <i>beit din</i> to address these matters and a <i>get</i> will only be forthcoming provided that these matters are addressed in <i>beit din</i>.” The couple appears in <i>beit din</i> and is told that there are grounds to obligate a <i>get</i> but, in accordance with R. Schwadron and others, the husband’s demands are legitimate and therefore will insist that these matters be addressed by the <i>beit din</i> prior to the <i>get</i> process. There is a clear prohibition to litigate one’s matters in a civil proceeding and a defendant who wanted to appear in <i>beit din</i> and was denied that opportunity may proceed to <i>beit din</i> to revisit matters resolved in court<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This scenario is presented assuming the plaintiff agrees to proceed to <i>beit din</i>.</i> and recoup his court and legal fees.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur,</i> <i>HM</i> 26:7 citing <i>Rosh</i> 18:5; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:172; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:12; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> 2, <i>HM</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 162.</i> A husband therefore is entitled to revisit these matters in a <i>beit din</i>. As such, in pursuance to this view, such preconditions are permissible and must be addressed prior to granting a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 24, at 182.</i>
On the other hand, if the husband did not summon his wife to <i>beit din</i> and thus willingly appeared and resolved their matters in civil court, then should the <i>beit din</i> direct him to give a <i>get</i>, the husband cannot propose any such preconditions because <i>Halakhah</i> does not recognize that he is entitled to revisit in a <i>beit din</i> any issues that were litigated and resolved in a civil court due to his acquiescence to appear in civil court. Consequently, he cannot recoup any court and legal fees. As various <i>dayanim</i> note,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Daichovsky, supra n. 5, at 158–159; File no. 9707-21-1, supra n. 19; File no. 833000-5, supra n. 19</i> under all circumstances, <i>Halakhah</i> does not sanction a husband’s “forum shopping” and looks askance at the employment of such tactics for the purpose of either impeding the <i>get</i> process or facilitating the brokering of a more favorable divorce settlement. As such, in pursuance of a <i>beit din’</i>s divorce action to obligate a <i>get</i>, he is duty-bound to participate in the divorce process without foisting any such preconditions upon his wife.
Our aforementioned conclusions regarding a wife who summons her husband to court despite the husband’s protestation to resolve matters in <i>beit din</i>, and of a couple who both agree to have their issues handled in court rather than <i>beit din</i>, assume that we are dealing with Torah-observant Jews. However, should we be dealing with a secular Jewish couple where the wife for decades has resolved her monetary matters in civil court and her husband voluntarily appears in this judicial forum to resolve their end-of-marriage issues, one cannot countenance a husband’s request to discontinue their litigation in court and proceed to <i>beit din</i> and demand such an action as a precondition to granting a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1-64-5082 (R.

Finally, there is another approach dealing with a <i>yavam</i> who insists on the fulfillment of a condition prior to executing a <i>halitzah</i>, albeit a <i>shitat yahid</i> (a minority opinion), which as we will show has garnished significant support amongst many <i>dayanim</i> who served and/or continue to serve on panels within the network of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Given that the only accessible reasoned <i>piskei din</i> concerning a husband’s setting up a condition prior to giving a <i>get</i> are those handed down within this network, we were unable to ascertain how other panels whether they serve in the Diaspora or elsewhere treat our issues.</i> The background for this view emerges from a story that unfolds in sixteenth-century Salonika of the Ottoman Empire, where a Jewish girl was betrothed to a Jewish male peer who passed away unexpectedly. Since the couple never formally consummated the marriage, there were no children. Therefore, the boy’s brother, an older man with a wife and children, became obligated either to marry this girl due to the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>yibbum</i> or release her by means of <i>halitzah</i> (lit. untying a shoe) and thereby free her to marry another man.
The surviving brother-in-law was aware that this young woman had a Jewish uncle who desired to marry her despite the girl’s preference to marry a younger man. Additionally, the wife’s uncle was a relative of the <i>yavam</i>. Worried that the uncle’s wife (his relative) would divorce his aunt, the brother-in-law was hesitant to perform the <i>halitzah</i> and thereby facilitate the girl’s ability to marry his uncle. Seeking to protect the uncle’s wife from a potential divorce, he was willing to perform the ceremony of <i>halitzah</i> only on the condition that the uncle would refrain from marrying the young girl after the <i>halitzah</i> rite, i.e. <i>halitzah al tenai</i> (conditional <i>halitzah</i>).
Addressing the factual context of the case, R. Shmuel de Medina (known by the acronym: Maharashdam) writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Translation of the <i>teshuvah</i> is culled from Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 126.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">. . . the levir is a decent man, and his sole intention is that his brother’s widow not marry her uncle . . . and the intention of her uncle is to divorce his wife, who is the levir’s aunt, and marry the young woman. To this I say, because this matter depends on this, that it is proper for her (the widow) to make herself unavailable to this man by every stringent means possible, and the same goes for the husband of his aunt, so as to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion that is not contested or doubted, and inspires confidence so that the levir can grant the levirite release, and we will not need to resort to any sort of compulsion.</span>
Dealing with a family situation of extreme sensitivity, Maharashdam empathizes with the <i>yavam</i>’s attempt to protect the welfare of his relative, the uncle’s wife, as well as the young girl’s best interests. As such, implicitly subscribing to the view that a <i>yavam</i>’s precondition to <i>halitzah</i> is permissible and rejecting the Shulhan Arukh’s ruling,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">R. Gatinieu, a Salonikan decisor in the nineteenth century, followed in Maharashdam’s footsteps. See <i>Teshuvot Tzeil ha-Kessef,</i> <i>EH</i> 13. Cf. <i>SA, EH</i> 169:50.</i> he refrains from compelling a <i>halitzah</i> out of fear and trepidation of the dire consequences resulting in the invoking of such a position.
What was the basis for his ruling? In his introductory remarks to the aforementioned <i>teshuvah</i>, Maharashdam notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Translation of the <i>teshuvah</i> is culled from Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 112,125.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">After I wrote and signed my name to the written and signed ruling above, I constantly wondered whether I would find support for what I had written, namely, that given that the <i>levir</i> wants to grant the <i>levirite</i> release, but with the intention that his brother’s widow who is subject to <i>levirate</i> marriage . . . [to him] not [if released] marry her uncle, who is married to his aunt, if so, it is impossible to compel him grant the levirate release under any circumstances . . .</span>
But until now I have not found a source for this, and in searching the laws of [stipulating] conditions . . . I found written in . . . Hazeh ha-Tenufah that even in the case of one who grants a bill of divorce to his wife with the intent . . . that she not go to her father’s home, the divorce is effective and the condition stands. Yet no one should allow the granting of a divorce on such a condition, for there is no doubt that this condition cannot be fulfilled, as it is impossible that she should not go to her father’s home . . . If the husband granting the divorce is one of those who was compelled [by the court] to do so, and does not want to grant the divorce except on this condition, we do not listen to him, and he is compelled to grant the divorce without this condition.
Invoking Talmudic legal reasoning of “<i>medameh milta le-milta</i>” (lit. comparing one matter with another),<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For a brief discussion of the role of analogical reasoning in the <i>halakhic</i> decision-making process, see <i>Rabbinic Authority; The Vision and the Reality</i>, supra n. 3, at 53–57.</i> Maharashdam finds a fruitful source of comparison in Hazeh ha-Tenufah’s ruling regarding divorce. On the basis of Hazeh ha-Tenufah’s opinion, invoking a tradition dealing with <i>halakhot</i> of divorce attributed to Rosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Lavi, supra n. 5, at 648, 655–656.</i> Maharashdam’s reply is that, just as setting conditions prior to giving a <i>get</i> is permissible regarding a divorcing couple, similarly the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>yibbum</i> (levirate marriage) allow for the imposition of conditions.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 41.</i> Therefore, one cannot obligate the brother-in-law to undergo <i>halitzah</i>. Moreover, adds Maharashdam, the condition must be “easy to fulfill.” Clearly, he argues, it is easy for the uncle to refrain from marrying his niece. On the other hand, in divorce situations, a condition which is “almost impossible to fulfill,” such as mandating that a divorcing wife should refrain from returning to her father’s home or to move away from her family, Maharashdam and numerous <i>Poskim</i> would argue that a husband cannot mandate as a condition to receiving a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh le-Melekh, supra</i> n. 16; <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, Tur, EH</i> 154, <i>Hagahot ha-Tur</i> 1; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:40 (17).</i> Therefore, in cases where we are dealing with a condition that can be easily executed, should a wife refuse to comply, she is responsible for impeding the execution of her own divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 24.</i>

In accordance with Maharashdam’s position, the justification in allowing a husband to set a precondition(s) that is easy to fulfill prior to executing a <i>get</i> stems from the fact that <i>Halakhah</i> did not mandate coercion because she is not an <i>agunah</i>, rather than due to a husband’s entitlement to delay the <i>get</i> process.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Landesman, <i>supra</i> n. 5, at 146; <i>PDR</i> supra n. 49.</i>
There have been varying interpretations of the scope of Maharashdam’s view in general and the type of condition that would be permissible in particular. One approach is that a <i>beit din</i> will recognize any condition that is legitimate in the eyes of <i>Halakhah</i> provided that the condition is easy to fulfill, such as recovering property that his wife had stolen from him or recovering outstanding debts from his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 10, understanding of Maharashdam’s position; File no. 1-64-5082, supra n. 14 (R.

Alternatively, Maharashdam’s view is understood to encompass all conditions that a husband may fancy, even those that are at variance with <i>Halakhah</i>. It has been contended that <i>dayanim</i> extrapolated such an interpretation from reviewing an excerpt of his opinion found in Ba’eir Heitev, a digest found in current editions of Shulhan Arukh on Even ha-Ezer, which was authored by R.

Subsequently, numerous <i>dayanim</i> followed in their footsteps and conclude that the type of condition that a husband may demand prior to granting a divorce must be “easy to fulfill.” Obviously, it will be left to the <i>beit din’s</i> discretion to determine which conditions are easy for the wife to comply with and which are impossible to fulfill.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For criteria, see File no. 0027-21-1, <i>supra</i> n. 6; File no. 1-64-5082 (R.

Elyashiv was of the opinion that a husband’s “excessive demands”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kefiyah be-Get</i>, supra n. 5, introduction (= <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:181).</i> in a particular case were to be viewed as “easy to fulfill” and therefore a legitimate precondition prior to a husband’s giving a divorce. On the other hand, Dayan Lavi rejects a husband’s demand to reduce a father’s child support as a precondition to granting a divorce that would be impossible to fulfill.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 043387083-21-1, supra n. 19.</i> Yet, in another case, Rabbis Abergil and Hershrik recognize such a condition as legitimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 040135832-21-1, supra n. 19.</i> In short, addressing the gray area, a condition that may fall in between a condition that is easily fulfilled and a demand that would be impossible to fulfill, is up to the <i>beit din</i>’s discretion whether to allow a husband to stipulate this precondition prior to giving a <i>get.</i>
Furthermore, a review of some of these decisions indicates that <i>dayanim</i> implicitly feels that a husband’s demand to revisit parenting arrangements (custody or visitation) or child support orders set down in civil court were “easy to fulfill” conditions.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 0027-21-1, supra n. 6; File no. 4273-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, December 18, 2000 cited by Bass, supra n. 5, at 155 and Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 117, n. 38; File no. 029612306-68-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, February 13, 2007, <i>ha-Din ve-haDayan, gilyon</i> 19, 4–5.</i> Two panels took the unusual position that an abusive husband could impose a condition that his children receive a Torah education prior to a <i>beit din</i> compelling a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">File 7178-25-2, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, August 31, 2004, <i>ha-Din ve-haDayan, gilyon</i> 8, 6–7; File no. 015692353-21-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, July 6, 2006, <i>ha-Din ve-haDayan, gilyon</i> 19, 5–6.</i> On the other hand, Rabbis Landesman and Daichovsky, as well as some other <i>dayanim</i>, take the position that Maharashdam’s ruling was limited to conditions relating directly to the divorcing couples. However, preconditions relating to child support and parenting arrangements that entail a third party’s best interests may not serve as a reason to delay a <i>seder ha-get</i>. In fact, a parent advancing a claim on behalf of his/her child in <i>beit din</i> is actually representing his child and hence must submit claims that promote the child’s best interests. Even with the absence of <i>beit din</i> involvement, any agreement finalized between the divorcing parents regarding their children must promote the child’s best interests. Should an agreement undermine these interests, the agreement is null and void.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha- Mabit</i> 2:62; <i>PDR</i> 2:300, 3:353,358, 7:3, 9.</i> As such, any conditions dealing with child support or parenting mandated by the husband prior to the granting of the <i>get</i> are invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Landesman, supra n. 5, at 151–152; Daichovsky, 2006, supra n.5, at 157; File no. 029612306-68-1, <i>Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol</i>, July 17, 2007, <i>ha-Din veha-Dayan, gilyon</i> 19, 4–5; File 024612665-21-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, unpublished decision, December 20, 1999 (R.

Given that Maharashdam’s distinction between a condition which is “easy to fulfill”, such as “she will not marry a particular person”, and a condition that is “impossible to fulfill”, such as “that she will not go to her father’s home”, are all non-financial conditions, Dayan Lavi concludes that all financial conditions are invalid, regardless of their reasonability in terms of compliance.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ateret Devorah</i>, supra n. 5, at 649.</i>
Finally and significantly, one must take cognizance of the factual context of Maharashdam’s ruling,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 112.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There is doubt that even those Sages in the Mishnah who said they compel . . . did not say that they compel him to grant a divorce unless he does not want to grant a divorce at all. But, if he wants to grant a divorce, but wants to impose some condition for granting the divorce, as to this, they certainly did not say that they compel him to grant a divorce unconditionally.</span>
To state it differently, his ruling is limited to an instance of demanding a precondition prior to giving a <i>get</i> where a husband sincerely intends to become divorced and demands a precondition prior to undertaking the <i>get</i> process. However, in a situation where the husband has no interest in giving a <i>get</i> and imposes a demand in order to simply stonewall the <i>get</i> process and leave his wife an <i>agunah</i> or negotiate a more favorable settlement, clearly Maharashdam’s position does not contemplate validating imposing any precondition, even one which is “easy to fulfill”, under such circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">R. D. Bigman, “Interpretation that is Open to Controversy,” (Hebrew), <i>Makor Rishon, gilyon</i> 720, 23 Iyar 5771.</i> And, in fact, R. Menasheh Klein understands Maharashdam’s ruling to be limited to a husband who sincerely intends to grant a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 17:82.</i> As R. Yehuda Fris, who serves as <i>av beit din</i> on the Ma’aleh Adumim <i>Beit Din le-Mamonot</i>, writes in trenchant terms,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Fris, supra n. 5, at 235.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When a <i>beit din</i> hands down a divorce judgment which directs that the <i>get</i> ought to be coerced, and the husband appears and announces that he is prepared to give a <i>get</i> after his wife transfers monies to him, nullifies claims in civil court and the like. In such a case he is not requesting to impose “a condition regarding the <i>get</i>” (<i>tenai ba-get</i>); rather he is petitioning to impose a condition “to the <i>get</i>” (<i>tenai la-get</i>). In other words, there is no consent to divorce accompanied by a condition to granting a <i>get</i>, but rather the imposition of a condition to the actual execution of the divorce and implementation of the <i>beit din</i> decision. In practice, in this context there is no imposition of a condition, but a husband’s opposition to implement a <i>beit din</i> judgment which obligates him to divorce . . . this request was never mentioned in Maharashdam’s words . . .</span>
Our scholars . . . established grounds for <i>get</i> coercion (see Shulhan Arukh, <i>EH</i> 154) and if a husband is permitted to establish conditioned and delay the <i>get</i> process in these instances, “what have our scholars gained by setting their guidelines” (See Radvaz 1:157)?
Or addressing those who interpret <i>Maharashdam</i>’s position as encompassing even conditions that are at variance with <i>Halakhah</i>, R. Landesman exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Landesman, supra n. 5, at 147. A similar reservation has been expressed by Prober, Goldberg, and Bibi, <i>supra</i> n. 5, at 157.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Is it logical to say that a husband controls such a matter to the extent that he can prevent the execution of a <i>beit din</i> decision by imposing any condition? Remember, concerning other claims between man and his neighbor that one can coerce a <i>beit din</i> judgment of “obligated to pay” and he refuses to implement the decision, should we say that one who is obligated to pay is empowered always to delay the implementation of a judgment by imposing any condition upon the opposing party? I wonder.</span>
More recently, the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol of Yerushalayim notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 880581/9, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 23, 2014.</i> “In a situation where the husband’s claims are unjustified and he attempts to extort from his wife concessions that are unjustified, we need to reject his claim and obligate him in a <i>get</i>.”
Furthermore, in R. Fris’s estimation, stipulating a condition that is “easy to fulfill” only applies, according to Maharashdam, prior to a <i>beit din</i>’s ruling that one is obligated to give a <i>get</i>. However, once <i>beit din</i> renders such a judgment, there can be no delay in executing the <i>seder ha-get</i>. At best, for Maharashdam, the husband may insist on a condition for granting the <i>get</i>. However, given that today <i>gerushin al tenai</i> is not practiced, R. Fris concludes that his view is contemporaneously inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Fris, supra n. 5, at 236–237.</i>
In sum, there are four differing interpretations of Maharashdam’s position. Firstly, preconditions which are recognized by <i>Halakhah</i> and which are easy to comply with are grounds for delaying the <i>get</i> process. Some decisors contend that even claims that are against <i>Halakhah</i> will be permitted as preconditions as long as they are easy to fulfill. Furthermore, other authorities argue that the conditions must be non-financial in order to pass muster.
Finally, some <i>Poskim</i> claim that one may invoke his position only with regard to instances where the husband sincerely intends to grant a <i>get</i>. However, in situations where the advancing of demands either seeks to stonewall the <i>get</i> process and leave the wife an <i>agunah</i> or to serve as a negotiating tactic to gain a more favorable divorce settlement, such conditions will not be recognized.
Despite the fact that the factual context of Maharashdam’s ruling dealt with a man who sincerely was willing to perform a <i>halitzah</i> (and by inference was applied by him to a husband who was willing to give a <i>get</i>), nonetheless, in recent years <i>dayanim</i> have expanded his ruling to encompass situations where the husband attempted to forestall the <i>get</i> process by demanding certain conditions be addressed. For example, partially relying upon Maharashdam’s view, Rabbis Rabinowitz, Algrabli, and Eliezrov issue a judgment coercing the husband to give a <i>get</i> since “he neither wanted <i>shalom bayit</i> (matrimonial reconciliation) nor wanted to divorce his wife, only the imposition of conditions.”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 3222-25-1, supra n. 19.</i> In another instance, eight months after being obligated by a <i>beit din</i> to give his wife a <i>get</i>, a husband appears in <i>beit din</i> and states that he is ready to grant a divorce on the condition that she agrees that the authority to resolve matters of property and maintenance be transferred from civil court to the <i>beit din</i>. Here again, his approach is examined, this time by Rabbis Prover, Y. Goldberg, and Bibi, who are dealing with a husband who has been delaying giving a <i>get</i> due to apprehension regarding whether the court will rule in favor of his claims and therefore now wants his issues adjudicated in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i>, supra n. 24.</i>
In another instance, an Israeli husband fled to Holland, remarried a non-Jewish woman, sired a child from the relationship, and abandoned his wife in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> who has been an <i>agunah</i> for eight years. After a series of negotiations between the couple, the husband agreed to grant a divorce, assuming that that custody of his child will be transferred to him and that he would receive the tens of thousands of dollars of maintenance that the wife collected from Israel’s national insurance. Subsequently, determining that there were grounds to give a <i>get</i>, two Israeli Jews meted out physical coercion and a <i>get</i> was procured from the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See S. Messas, “A Doubt Regarding <i>Get</i> Coercion,” (Hebrew) 23 <i>Tehumin</i>, 120–124, at 122 (2002).</i> However, given that the husband had certain preconditions prior to the issuance of the divorce and a <i>beit din</i> did not address if he could be coerced (much less physically coerced) without first complying with his demands, there existed a doubt regarding the validity of the divorce. Clearly, the circumstances of this case belie a husband who is a non-observant Jew and for eight years recalcitrant regarding the <i>get</i>, who ostensibly changes his mind and is ready to give a <i>get</i> but attempts simultaneously to extort monies from his wife. At the end of the day, third parties realize that a <i>get</i> will only be forthcoming if he is physically coerced. Yet, both Rabbis Bar-Shalom and Nadav, and later Rabbis Mordechai Eliyahu and Shalom Messas, who subsequently became involved in this case, factor into consideration Maharashdam’s view which addresses a Torah-observant husband who genuinely wants to perform <i>halitzah</i> and a husband who is willing to give a <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1-059024273-21 cited by Bass, supra n. 5, at 155.</i> In short, these cases are being resolved by invoking Maharashdam’s position, despite the fact that the context of his decision is markedly different than the three aforementioned cases, which deal with non-observant husbands who are manipulative and recalcitrant, regarding the giving of a <i>get</i>.
Except for one decision,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 860977-1, supra n. 19.</i> in the majority of cases that have been published, whether a panel chooses to subscribe to the majority opinion represented by Rashba and others and to reject Maharashdam’s position or to accept his view, there is no inquiry into the husband’s motivation at the time he decides to advance his demands.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Prover, Goldberg, and Bibi, supra n. 5; File no. 1-64-5082, supra n. 14.</i> Though many facts of the case are communicated in the decision, which potentially may facilitate distilling the husband’s motives in raising such preconditions, the <i>beit din</i> chooses to focus upon his position in general and whether the conditions are “easy to fulfill” or not in particular. Here again, these panels are implicitly positing that Maharashdam’s approach applies both to a recalcitrant husband as well as a sincere husband who desires to participate in the divorce process. The aforementioned <i>battei din</i>’s need to invoke his ruling in cases of a manipulative husband stems from “the gravitational pull” to avoid the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i> with its accompanying consequences of contributing to the proliferation of <i>mamzerim</i>. In other words, it is incumbent upon a <i>dayan</i> to exhaust every possibility to avoid the strictures of a coerced <i>get</i>. As such, if there is a possibility that the husband will divorce voluntarily, such as by demanding a certain precondition prior to the <i>seder ha-get</i>, we are proscribed from coercing him. As Maharashdam notes regarding the situation of the levirate marriage, “This is the straight and clear path, in my opinion, so as not to engage in compulsion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 126.</i>
Similarly, he states concerning the matter of divorce, “There is no doubt that compelling him to grant an unconditional divorce contributes to the proliferation of <i>mamzerim</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 113. For an identical understanding of his position, see <i>PDR</i> 5:66 supra n. 49, at 80 (R. Elyashiv’s opinion).</i>
Undoubtedly, the factor of <i>hezkat eishet ish</i> plays an important role, which may lead to a <i>psak</i> that is stringent in order to avoid potential <i>mamzerut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Shakh, <i>SA, HM</i> 242:4; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov, EH</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 39. Cf. others who contend that in situations where the accepted <i>minhag</i> is to follow the teachings of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and Rema, though there may exist dissenting positions; one ought to comply with the former rulings. See Hazon Ish, <i>EH</i> 99:5.</i> However, this presumption that concerns Maharashdam ought to play no role in our scenario, as it deals with a crafty and manipulative husband who engages in <i>get</i> recalcitrance!
Nevertheless, despite the inapplicability of his ruling to our case, <i>hezkat eishet ish</i> has propelled some <i>dayanim</i> to arrive at such a conclusion and issue a decision that permits a husband to impose preconditions prior to the <i>seder ha-get</i>. Nonetheless, as we have shown, there is no basis for a <i>beit din</i> to invoke such a presumption in our situation. It lacks a basis because the emergence of the centrality of <i>hezkat eishet ish</i> by Maharashdam was propounded within the context of particular fact pattern, facts that are readily distinguishable from the set of our facts of our scenario.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Final Afterthoughts: A <i>Halakhic</i> Desideratum</b></span>
Rabbi Lavi, <i>av beit din</i> of Netanya Regional Beit Din, writes the following,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">See letter cited by Shochetman, supra n. 5.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Here in our <i>beit din</i> we have authored in some of our decisions that according to <i>halakhah</i> we do not follow Maharashdam, given that many disagree with his view. Even according to this position, any condition that one cannot implement immediately, which is usually the case, which means delay in the divorce process in circumstances of separation and an obliging divorce judgment, is a condition that is not easily fulfilled.</span>
In other words, implicitly following in Shakh’s footsteps,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, SA, Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 242 (end), <i>Hanhagat Hora’at Issur ve-Heter</i>.</i> Dayan Lavi contends we should follow the majority opinion, which proscribes a <i>beit din</i> from sanctioning a husband’s right to advance a demand for insisting on the fulfillment of certain conditions prior to giving a <i>get.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 9–22.</i>
Seemingly such a conclusion is open to challenge. Invoking <i>hilkheta ke-vatrai</i> (lit. the <i>Halakhah</i> is in accordance with the view of the later authority) Rema states,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Rema, <i>SA, HM</i> 25:2. Translation culled from Menachem Elon, <i>Jewish Law: History, Sources, Principles</i>, vol. 1, (The Jewish Publication Society: Philadelphia, Jerusalem, 1994), 271.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In all cases where the views of earlier authorities are recorded and well known and the later authorities disagree with them . . . we follow the view of the later . . .

Seemingly, one can infer from Rema’s ruling that the “<i>batrai</i>” (lit. the later authority) in our scenario is Maharashdam, who lived in the sixteenth century, well after the “<i>kadmai</i>” (lit. the earlier ones), and may challenge and overrule the earlier authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">R. Hayyim Yosef David Azulai, <i>Ya’ir Ozen, ma’arekhet</i> 5, <i>kelal</i> 51 in the name of R.

Nonetheless, this interpretation of <i>hilkheta ke-vatrai</i> has been rejected by all <i>rishonim</i> (early authorities).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Hilkheta ke-Vatrai</i>”, <i>Encyclopedia Talmudit</i>, Volume 9, 343.</i>
The decision-making rule of <i>hilkheta ke-vatrai</i> is not to be viewed as a rule that empowers a later authority to overrule the opinion of an earlier authority, but rather as one that allows a <i>posek</i> to examine the various views regarding an issue and identify the ‘<i>batrai’</i> and follow his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">I.

Wosner, “<i>Hilkheta Ke-Vatrai</i>- A New Perspective,” (Hebrew) 20 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i>, 151–168, at 152, n. 5 (1995–1997).</i> However, as noted by Rema, ascribing to the view of the ‘<i>batrai</i>’ is contingent upon the fact that the later authority knew of the early authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 88.</i> In our case, as R. Yanai points out, it seems that Maharashdam did not have access to R. Yosef Karo’s <i>Bedek ha-Bayit</i>, which was published in 1605, fifteen years after Maharashdam’s demise, as well as volume four of Rashba’s <i>teshuvot</i>, which appeared over a hundred years after his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 9707-21-1, supra n. 14.</i> In fact, there is equally no mention in the entire <i>teshuvah</i> of earlier authorities such as Rashba, Rashbash, and Tashbetz, who differed with Maharashdam. Therefore, it is unsurprising to find the following admission. After a detailed discourse on the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>yibbum</i>, Maharashdam concludes his responsum by stating,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Radzyner, supra n. 5, at 112.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But, until now I have not found a source for this [i.e. <i>haskamah le-gerushin al tenai</i> –AYW], and in searching the laws of [stipulating] conditions, I found in . . . Hazeh Hatenufah . . .</span>
Consequently, in the absence of any examination, much less awareness, of these opposing views, the rule of <i>hilkheta ke-vatrai</i> is inapplicable and therefore Maharashdam’s position cannot be determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ateret Devorah</i>, supra n. 5, at 651–652.</i>
Based upon our foregoing presentation, we have analyzed the relative strength, effectiveness, and plausibility of the three approaches to allowing a husband’s precondition prior to giving a <i>get</i>. In pursuance to the rule of <i>rov</i>, majority rule, and the inapplicability of <i>hilkheta ke-vatrai</i>, it is our opinion that once it is clear that there are grounds for obligating a <i>get</i>, a <i>beit din</i> ought to be unwilling to accept a husband’s demands as a precondition to granting a divorce. The underlying rationale for this conclusion is that once there are grounds to obligate a <i>get</i>, there is no need to be concerned about <i>halakhically</i> illegitimate conditions advanced by the husband, in particular where the husband’s motivation for raising these demands is to manipulate and obfuscate the process. Echoing the Rashbash’s view and R. Yanai’s,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 208; 383; Yanai, supra n. 5, at 366.</i> R.

<span class="poetry indentAll">Is it logical to say that a husband controls such a matter to the extent that he can prevent the execution of a <i>beit din</i> decision by imposing any condition!!</span>
Furthermore, all of these conditions, such as modifying parenting arrangements, reducing child support, changes in a child’s schooling, addressing marital assets, extortion of monies, discontinuing a civil proceeding, and revisiting the claim(s)in <i>beit din</i>, etc., are unrelated to the actual delivery of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Yanai, supra n. 5, at 370; File no. 860977-1, supra n. 19.</i> Addressing a wife’s breach of a divorce agreement that provided that the husband would only grant a <i>get</i> if certain items would be returned to him, Mahariz Enzel is posed with the question whether we must declare that “the giving of a <i>get</i> is in error,” a <i>get muteh</i> which results in the need for arranging for a second <i>get</i>, due to the fact that the husband will argue “had I known she would renege on her commitment to return items, I never would have agreed to give her a <i>get</i>,” and he states<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahariz Enzel</i> 81. For a summary of the differing reviews of the consequences of <i>“a get muteh”</i>, see U. Lavi, “<i>Is there a Concern for the Validity of the Get When the Husband was Deluded in the Divorce Agreement</i>,” (Hebrew) 2 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (1994), 146; A.

<span class="poetry indentAll">God forbid that we should cast aspersions on this proper <i>get</i>, since he did not divorce her in order to recover some items but rather due to strife and hatred between them.

According to Mahariz Enzel as well as others,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hessed le-Avraham</i> (Teomim), <i>Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 43; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> 1:84, 2:85; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av</i> <i>EH</i> 25; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 154; <i>Yeshuot Ya’akov, EH</i> 25; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:37; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yosef</i> (Cohen) 2: Section 119, 17–18</i> one must distinguish between reasons that are related to the grounds for the divorce and reasons that, though advanced at the time of divorce, are unrelated to the grounds for the couple becoming divorced. As such, a wife’s plea that her husband rapes and abuses her or a husband’s claim that his wife is refraining from engaging in conjugal relations are claims directly related to the granting of the <i>get</i>. In Mahariz Enzel’s case, the husband divorced his wife due to feelings of hatred rather than because she refused to return some objects belonging to him. Therefore, it becomes a <i>beit din’s</i> responsibility to address this type of claim dealing with animosity in order to assess whether there are grounds for obligating a divorce. Once such determination is completed, the <i>beit din</i> will issue its directive for the couple to divorce. Upon the issuance of the divorce judgment, the only outstanding matter is simply whether the parties – and, in our cases, the husband – comply with the <i>beit din’s</i> judgment.
On the other hand, all reasons that are independent and unrelated to the grounds for divorce, such as the husband’s demand that his wife return certain objects, are subsumed under the category of <i>gerushin al tenai</i> and are invalid. And if the husband grants a <i>get</i> on the assumption that he will receive these items and the wife deceives him by failing to comply with his request, then, in accordance with Mahariz Enzel and others, there are no grounds for a divorce annulment.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, n. 100.</i> In other words, there is no basis for demanding conditions that are unrelated to the grounds for the divorce.
In conclusion, many <i>Rishonim</i>, Shulhan Arukh, and <i>Aharonim</i> insist that the <i>get</i> process be commenced once a <i>beit din</i> judgment has been handed down without deferring to a husband’s series of demands. And should a husband have <i>halakhically</i> legitimate claims that are unrelated to the giving of the <i>get</i>, such as recovering property that his wife had stolen from him or recovering outstanding debts from his wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">For another example, see supra text accompanying notes 33–35.</i> then prior to the <i>seder ha-get</i> the parties ought to sign off on an arbitration agreement empowering the <i>beit din</i> to resolve these matters after the <i>get</i> has been delivered to the wife. In effect, in the wake of a <i>beit din’s</i> decision to obligate a husband to grant a <i>get</i>, we suggest following in the footsteps of the majority opinion by invalidating any precondition(s),<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 9–22.</i> while invoking Maharsham and others who recognize the husband’s entitlement to deal with certain issues of <i>halakhic</i> import,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 23–37.</i> albeit as matters which ought to be addressed <b>after</b> the <i>seder ha-get</i> has been completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 3:41 (in the name of <i>Yeshuot Ya’akov</i> <i>EH</i> 119, <i>Peirush ha-Katzar</i> 6).</i>
Seemingly, adopting majority position that upon obligating the giving of a <i>get</i> without allowing the husband to state preconditions will create a situation of “a <i>get mut’eh</i>”. In other words, in such a situation should the <i>get</i> be executed, the husband could argue that “had I known that my conditions wouldn’t have been complied I never would have given the <i>get</i>”. In fact for some <i>Poskim,</i> a <i>get mut’eh</i> situation would have been created and a second <i>get</i> would be required.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Lublin</i> 122; <i>Mishkenot Ya’akov EH</i> 34</i>However, the majority of authorities reject the notion of “a <i>get mut’eh</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">See Lavi, supra n. 99.</i>Consequently, the majority of decisors who endorse the position that a <i>beit din</i> may obligate a <i>get</i> without permitting a husband to set conditions prior to its execution implicitly are following in the footsteps of the majority of <i>Poskim</i> who reject the concept of a <i>get mut’eh</i>.
Said conclusion that a husband’s precondition will not be permitted in the wake of a <i>beit din</i>’s decision either coercing or obligating a Jewish writ of divorce may be explained in <i>jurisprudential</i> terms. For instance, according to the conventional example of the gunman, if gunman A tells B, “Your money or your life,” B has a choice. Should B decide to give A his money, we do not consider B’s decision voluntary. We consider this a robbery rather than a consensual transfer of property. On the other hand, if B has a life-threatening disease and doctor A offers to treat him for fair remuneration which upon payment will dissipate B’s life’s savings, if B opts for the treatment, he may say that A’s offer was “an offer he could not refuse,” or that he had no rational choice but to accept the doctor’s proposal. Should B accept the offer, we would not consider B’s acceptance involuntary.
Both offers by the gunman and physician convey the same message in which A tells B:
1. If you do x, then z.
2. If you do not do x, then not z.
To state it differently, gunman A informs B that if he gives A money, A will spare B’s life; but if he fails to give him his money, A will die. The doctor A tell B that if he consents to pay a fee, A will treat his disease; but if he does not accept A’s offer, A will not treat him.
Given that both the gunman and doctor are giving the identical message, what distinguishes one offer from the other? Why would we conclude that in the gunman scenario B’s decision is given under duress, while in the case of the doctor, we think that B’s decision is voluntary? One possible solution is that the gunman’s offer is coercive while the doctor’s offer is not coercive.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Implicit in our understanding is that coercion is associated with the phenomenon of experiencing pressure to act in a particular fashion even though we do not want to do it. See Robert Nozick, “<i>Coercion</i>,” in, <i>Philosophy, Science, and Method: Essays in Honor of E. Nagel,</i> ed<i>.</i> S. Morgenbesser, et. al (St. Martin’s Press: New York, 1969), 440–472; James McCloskey, “Coercion: Its Nature and Significance, “ 18 <i>Southern Journal of Philosophy</i> 335 (1980); Daniel Zimmerman, “Coercive Wage Offers,” 10 <i>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</i> 121 (1981); Joel Feinberg, Harm to Self, (Oxford University Press: New York, 1986), 189–262; Joseph Raz, <i>The Morality of Freedom</i>, (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1986), 148–154. For a contrasting approach, see S. Anderson, “The Enforcement Approach to Coercion, “ 5 <i>Journal of Ethics &amp; Philosophy</i> 1 (2010).</i>
The question, then, is what makes one offer coercive and the other not coercive? Various moral philosophers argue that the benchmark, or what they call “the baseline”, entails whether morality dictates if a proposal is coercive or not. In the gunman scenario, B has a moral right not to be placed in the position of choosing between his money and his life. Since the gunman’s offer is worse than what B is morally obligated entitled to—the moral benchmark of retaining his life and his money—the offer is coercive and therefore B’s decision is involuntary. On the other hand, in the case of the physician, B is not morally entitled to be cured by A gratis. Given that the offer is better than what B is entitled to (avoiding B’s death), the proposal is not coercive, and therefore we view B’s decision as voluntary.
Based upon the foregoing, is our conclusion that prohibiting the imposition a husband’s precondition prior to executing a <i>get</i> that a <i>beit din</i> has mandated identical to the dilemma of the scenario of the physician or the gunman? Clearly, in our divorce situation, by dint of the fact that a <i>beit din</i> is either coercing or obligating the husband to grant a <i>get</i>, the moral baseline is that the husband is obligated to deliver a <i>get</i> without the setting down of any precondition. The <i>beit din</i>’s judgment that there are grounds for giving a <i>get</i> informs us that a husband’s proposal is coercive due to the fact that it worsens what the wife is <i>halakhically</i> entitled to receive, namely her <i>get</i>. Therefore, such conduct cannot be countenanced. In short, allowing a husband to impose a precondition is no different than a gunman A who tells B, “Your money or your life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, the two cases are on different <i>halakhic</i> planes in terms of sanctions that may be applied for such threats but both situations involve offers that are <i>halakhically</i> reprehensible.</i>
May it be the will of <i>Ha-Shem</i> that we return to learn this topic in response to an inquiry, a study without practical application, in the format of “<i>derosh ve-kabbel sakhar</i>.”

Chapter 3; A divorcee's relief from the consequences of an exploitative divorce agreement

For many years, our Torah-observant community has encountered both here in the United States and abroad, situations where a recalcitrant spouse chooses to condition the giving or the acceptance of a <i>get</i> upon receiving certain benefits such as receiving monetary remuneration from the opposing spouse, receiving custody of a child, or having certain issues related and/or unrelated to the end-of-marriage resolved in a <i>beit din</i>. Such conduct raises <i>halakhic</i> issues, which we will address here. At the conclusion of our presentation, we will raise the practical significance of this <i>limmud</i> (study) for our community.
Let me share a few cases that I have encountered in recent years:
1. For over five years, a Hassidic wife shared a bedroom with her husband and refused to engage in conjugal relations with him and was unwilling to accept a <i>get</i> from her husband. Knowing very well that the majority of <i>battei din</i> in New York City, barring the existence of a wife’s legal title to the marital home, will not give a wife a fifty percent share of the market value of the marital home upon divorce, one day the wife informed her husband “I will accept the <i>get</i> on condition that you transfer fifty percent of the ownership of our home to me.” He transferred fifty percent of the ownership of the home to his wife but she remained recalcitrant.
2. In another scenario, a wife refused to receive a <i>get</i> unless her husband would transfer a certain sum of money to her.
3. A non-Orthodox wife, in another case, was recalcitrant regarding the <i>get,</i> which her Orthodox husband requested her to accept, due to an outstanding monetary claim that was still unresolved after a few years of marital separation.
4. A husband from the Yeshiva community whose wife earned significantly more income than him demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars from his wife in exchange for giving the <i>get</i>.
5. A Conservative Jewish husband, in another situation, attempted to extort his wife for a significant sum of money as a precondition to giving a <i>get.</i>
6. In another scenario, due to the lack of the husband’s creditworthiness, the wife possessed title to their multimillion-dollar home in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. Gradually, the husband borrowed three million dollars against the equity of the home in order to purchase real estate. The couple decided to divorce and the husband refused to give a <i>get</i> unless he received fifty percent of the market value of the couple’s home.
Each of these stories are examples of one spouse extorting another for monies in exchange for giving or receiving a <i>get</i>. Aware that an offer on the table entails an exploitative agreement, prior to agreeing to the offer, the initial question is whether a <i>mesirat moda’ah</i>” (a notification of duress in the presence of two witnesses who will testify to the exploitative nature of the agreement and indicating that at the first opportunity he intends to undertake steps to undo the agreement) by the distressed party will be effective? Addressing a matter of <i>kiddushin</i> (<i>halakhic</i> betrothal), a Talmudic passage relates to us the following incident,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 40b</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A certain man wanted to betroth a woman, and she told him, ‘If you transfer the title of all your property to me, I will become betrothed to you; otherwise not.’ Therefore, he assigned all his property to her. In the interim, his oldest son had come to him and said, what about me? He took witnesses and he informed them, ‘Proceed and hide yourself in Eber Yamima and write out a transfer of my property to him.’ The case came before Raba and he decided that neither party had acquired title to the property. Those who witnessed this proceeding thought that Raba’s reasoning was because the one deed was a <i>moda’ah</i> with respect to the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since a <i>mesirat moda’ah</i> transpired with the son, it invalidated the transfer to the woman.</i> This is not entirely correct. [The secret gift] in that case did nullify the transfer because it demonstrated that the assignment was made under coercion. Here, however it is clear that the donor’s desire is that the one (the son) should receive title rather than the other one should possess it.</span>
This incident is cited in Shulhan Arukh, who invalidates a gift made under duress.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>)<i>, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 242:10</i>
Seemingly, as noted by Rabbi Sha’anan, the same conclusion ought to apply to divorce. Just as we encountered that when a woman refused to betroth herself to a man without property and the man was thus pressured to obligate himself in the giving of the piece of property, the acquisition was voided; similarly, if a wife obligated herself to give something to a husband who refuses to divorce his wife without receiving property and the wife thus obligated herself to give something, the acquisition may be voided based upon a <i>mesirat moda’ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iyunim be-Mishpat, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 41, page 423. The <i>mesirat moda’ah</i> must be stated in the presence of two Torah-observant adult male witnesses. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1, 2:213; <i>SA, HM</i> 205:1. Whether one has to state “you are my witnesses” or “know” and whether there is set formula for communicating this <i>moda’ah</i> is subject to debate. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127, 232<i>; Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 134 in the name of Tashbetz; <i>Beit Meir, EH</i> 134:1; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim, HM</i> 5:1; <i>Rashbam</i> on <i>Bava Batra</i> 40a; <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (hereafter: <i>MT</i>)<i>, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 6:19; <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, ad locum; <i>MT, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 10:3; <i>Tur, EH</i> 134; <i>SA, EH</i> 134:1; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 134: 2.</i>
Nonetheless, given that the argument to void the divorce agreement in each case is based upon a <i>mesirat moda’ah</i> executed a few years ago, the cases are complicated further. It is a matter of debate whether a claim for duress must be advanced prior to the execution of a <i>get</i> or even may be raised after the <i>get</i> has been given.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, there is no time limit in advancing a claim of duress. See <i>SA, HM</i> 205:1. However, there are exceptions to this rule. See <i>SA, HM</i> 98:2l; <i>Teshuvot Ma’arkhei Lev</i> 1, <i>Derush</i> 8; File no. 803424/2, <i>Beit Din ha-Gadol</i>, December 12, 2010.<br>Even if the agreement would be voided, its nullification would not impact upon the propriety of the<i> get</i> that was executed. Though Maharam of Lublin (<i>Teshuvot Maharam Lublin</i> 122) and Mishkenot Ya’akov (<i>Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya’akov, EH</i> 34) would raise under such circumstances the specter of a “<i>get muteh</i>” (a <i>get</i> given in error) due to the fact that had the husband known that the agreement would be breached by his ex-wife, he would not have given the <i>get</i>, nonetheless most authorities would argue that the <i>get</i> remains valid. See <i>Taz, SA, EH</i> 145:16; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 145:16; <i>Beit Meir</i> 37(26); Uriel Lavi, “Is there a Fear of the Propriety of the <i>Get</i> when the Husband was Misled in the Divorce Agreement? (Hebrew) ” 2 <i>Shurat Ha-din</i> 146 (5754).</i>
Assuming there was no <i>mesirat moda’ah</i>, is there any relief that the coerced party can seek in <i>beit din</i>?
The purpose of our presentation is to delve into the issue regarding the propriety of such a divorce agreement, where a wife waives her entitlement to her husband’s marital duties—such as support—or monies are paid in exchange for giving or receiving a <i>get</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For earlier treatments of this issue, see Binyamin Be’eri, “The Validity of a Divorce Agreement that has Exploitative Demands,” (Hebrew), <i>Yeshivat Kerem be-Yavneh Jubilee Volume</i>, 302–316 (5764); Shahar Lifshitz, “Distress Exploitation in Jewish Law,” <i>in As a Perennial Spring, A Festschrift Honoring Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm</i>, (Downhill: New York, 2013), 313–340. Some of the sources for our presentation have been culled from these studies.</i> When is such an agreement <i>halakhically</i> proper and when is it viewed as exploitative? Is the agreement exploitative where the weaker party has no choice but to acquiesce to unfair terms of the agreement? Are there “objective“ criteria that determine that an agreement is unconscionable, namely that signing off on such an agreement was coercive and/or the terms of the agreement are reasonably unfavorable to one party? May the agreement be voided once compliance with the agreement’s terms has commenced?
Let us address these questions in the context of the following scenario. Hypothetically speaking, a couple mutually agrees that “their marriage is dead” and reconciliation is not an option. The couple has been separated for over a year and all end-of-marriage issues have been resolved, yet the husband refuses to give a <i>get.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Without focusing upon whether there is an <i>ilat gerushin</i> (a ground for divorce) such as nonsupport, infidelity, abuse, or, in accordance with certain decisors, due to the lapse of time since separation from “a dead marriage”, the assumption is that he is <i>halakhically</i> obligated to give a <i>get</i>.</i> Extorting his wife, one of the terms of the divorce agreement mandates that the wife pay three hundred thousand dollars in exchange for the husband giving the <i>get</i>.
In terms of the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ones</i> (duress), it is clear that regarding a sales transaction “<i>agav onasa ve-zuzei gamar u-makneh</i>” (loosely translated, in a situation of coercion he resolved to execute the sale by paying for the item).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Bava Batra</i> 47b</i> Whether the coerced party must simply obligate himself to pay or must actually remit payment is subject to debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 205:1; <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 205:5; <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 205:2.</i> However, the consensus is that the obligation to pay or the actual repayment will bring finality to a sales agreement executed under duress. This same conclusion ought to apply to an agreement, such as a divorce agreement, executed under duress and would not run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>, a coerced <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The dissolution of the <i>halakhic</i> matrimonial bond requires the voluntary agreement of both spouses. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> produces a divorce that is arguably invalid, namely a <i>get me’useh.</i> However<i>,</i> appeasing a recalcitrant spouse by offering tangibles such as monies in exchange for either giving or receiving a <i>get</i> is not deemed to be unlawfully coerced. See <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 134 in name of Rashba, <i>Teshuvot Maharah Ohr Zarua</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:76; <i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 167:6; <i>Piskei din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 3:13, 5:71, 7:111, 8:36, 9:65, 16: 275–276; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 10(11); <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:137, 3:44, 4:106.<br>This transaction is similar to every mutual undertaking of obligations that entails a <i>quid pro</i> exchange, which is valid despite the presence of pressures such as economic ones. See <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 118 (10); <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 145. Since he received something in exchange for undertaking the obligation, the agreement is valid. See <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 205:8. In effect, the monetary benefit engenders <i>gemirat da’at</i> (the firm resolve to undertake the obligation) and therefore nullifies the element of coercion. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 48a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, ad locum; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban</i>, ad locum; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, ad locum; <i>Rashbam Bava Batra</i> 47b. Similarly, the exchange of monies for the giving a <i>get</i> creates <i>gemirat da’at</i> that the husband desires to give a <i>get</i>. Consequently, such a transaction doesn’t run afoul of the strictures of a <i>get me’useh</i>.<br>Secondly, absent the ability of an individual to follow through with his threat and the high degree of probability that damage or injury will ensue, the agreement is valid. See <i>SA, HM</i> 205:7; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 205:12.</i> Consequently, a divorcee would be unable to recoup the excessive fee.
Given the finality of an agreement executed under duress, the question is whether the term of the divorce agreement regarding payment of $300,000 in exchange for the <i>get</i> is exploitative and oppressive. A Talmudic passage conveys to us the following,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 116a</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a person fleeing from prison (unjustly imprisoned –AYW) came to a ferry and said to the ferryman: “Take a <i>dinar</i> to ferry me across the river,” he would still have to pay him the customary fee. This shows that he may say “ I was merely jesting with you” . . . But if he says “take this <i>dinar</i> for your compensation” and he ferried him across the river, he must pay him his fee. Why is there a difference? . . . (In the latter case –AYW) we are dealing with a boatman who is also a fisherman . . .</span>
Whereas in the first case of the ferryman we are dealing with a situation where an exorbitant fee is being charged for his services and consequently the Talmud concludes that the ferryman is only entitled to the market fee for his services, in the second case we are dealing with a boatman who equally works as a fisherman. Given that he lost the opportunity to trap fish by offering his services to the fugitive, therefore he is entitled to receive a fee for his loss of compensation for his fishing.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the event that his loss was minimal, the rescued party must pay the entire benefit that he derived from the rescue. See <i>SA, HM</i> 363:7.</i> In effect, the basic rule that emerges from this passage is that a person is able to charge the market fee for his services. A fee that exceeds this amount allows a person (in this case a prisoner) to claim “<i>hashatah</i>”, I was joking with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 106a; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Yevamot</i> 12:16</i> In other words, the fugitive was not earnest when he agreed to pay an outlandish fee for being ferried across the river to safety and therefore he may remit only the market fee. In short, should the boatman incur a loss and/or charge a fee that exceeds the market fee, the jesting rule is applicable. He is entitled to recoup from the boatman the differential involved.
Our case of the ferryman who saves the fleeing prisoner entails the performance of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>hashavat aveidah</i>, the restoration of a lost object. It is noteworthy that the Talmud extends this positive obligation to encompass the saving of human life.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 81b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 73a</i> Seemingly, given that the boatman’s act involves the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i>, he should be proscribed from being compensated.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 336:7; <i>Urim ve-Tumim, HM</i> 34:39; <i>SA, HM</i> 265:1. Cf. others who argue that the fugitive is exempt from paying the exorbitant fee due to the fact that this is a distress situation and he is under duress. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 106a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, ad locum; Rabbi Shimon b. Zemah Duran, <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash</i> 3:20.</i> In particular, since there was nobody else present to save his life, he ought to have performed his duty without compensation!<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, YD</i> 336 and <i>Rema, YD</i> 336:3 in name of Ramban.</i> Nonetheless, there are certain exceptions to this rule, one of which is finding a lost object and restoring it to its owner while working.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 265:1; <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 264:19</i> Consequently, a ferryman who saves an individual during his working hours is entitled to receive compensation for his time investment and any loss incurred by being unable to attend to his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai, Bava Kama</i> 174 in the name of Rabbi Hezekiah; <i>Beit ha-Behirah, Yevamot</i> 106a; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim, Sehirut</i> 15; <i>SA</i>, supra n. 17.</i> As such, assuming the fugitive proves that the fee charged exceeded the ferryman’s fee for ferrying as well as compensation for his inability to work as a fisherman, the prisoner ought to be able to recoup the price differential.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramban</i>, supra n. 15; <i>Rashba</i>, supra n. 15.</i>
At first glance, our explanation seems to stand at variance with the Talmudic reason that offers the rationale of <i>hashatah</i> (the jesting rule), that in fact the prisoner never firmly resolved in his own mind to give an exorbitant figure and therefore he is exempt from payment. In accordance with our understanding, the Talmud should have advanced the argument that requesting an outlandish fee is proscribed because the ferryman, while working, was engaged in a <i>mitzvah</i> while working and was therefore entitled to charge only for the loss of time investment and any attendant loss. The Talmud informs us that since he is in a distress situation, the prisoner may exclaim, “I am joking with you”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, we presume that an individual in distress, namely that there is a threat to his life, would raise the defense that he was joking when he agreed to pay the exorbitant price. See <i>Teshuvot Maimoniyot, Sefer Shoftim</i> 64. On the other hand, in the absence of a distress situation we cannot assume that he was joking and therefore he is obligated to pay the outlandish fee. See <i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, HM</i> 335:3 in the name of Mordekhai; <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 185:29. Even if the prisoner does not advance the jesting rule in a given case, the <i>beit din</i> does. See <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 81:1.</i> due to his distress situation, we are being taught he is exempt from paying the agreed-upon amount. On the other hand, the Talmud insinuates that if such an argument cannot be raised, he remains duty-bound to pay the agreed amount by dint of the fact that he must comply with the undertaking of any obligation—despite the fact the boatman was engaged in a <i>mitzvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, supra n. 18.</i> To state it differently, whether the prisoner is obligated to pay the agreed amount is dependent whether there was <i>gemirat da’at</i> (loosely translated as “a meeting of the minds” or firm resolve) between the parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 106a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Yevamot</i> 106a.</i> The presence of distress precludes the existence of <i>gemirat da’at</i>.
The outstanding issue is whether the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking an obligation) such as <i>kinyan sudar</i> (transferring a handkerchief from one party to the other) or memorializing the agreement into writing in the form of a contract, which would be recognized as a <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a commercial vehicle such as a contract for undertaking obligations), <sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the validity of a contract as a <i>kinyan situmta</i>, see <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, HM</i> 66; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:45; <i>PDR</i> 3:363, 5:310, 14:43, and others.</i> may trump the argument of <i>hashatah</i>? Given that we are concerned with <i>gemirat da’at</i> of the parties, then if a <i>kinyan</i> or contract is executed, clearly the fugitive’s intent was to pay the mutually agreed-upon amount.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 64:3; <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 129:22; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 81:4; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 81:2.</i> Others disagree and argue that the overarching fact is that we are dealing with a distress situation and, given the circumstances, he implemented a <i>kinyan</i>. Under these conditions, his readiness to finalize the transaction with a <i>kinyan</i> should be understood as the mindset of a distressed person who desires to honor his undertaking in order to extricate himself from his distressed state. However, since the commitment was made under duress, <i>halakhah</i> does not recognize it as a free-will commitment even in the wake of the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> or contract. Hence, the jesting rule is applicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1240; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 169:53 in the name of Rashba; Rabbi Akiva Eiger, <i>Gilyon la-Shulhan Arukh, EH</i> 169 in the name of Rashba; <i>Urim ve-Tumim, EH</i> 129(end) in the name of Rashba.</i> Others contend that the aforementioned debate centers around a matter of <i>reshut</i> (a voluntary act). However, if we are dealing with a <i>mitzvah</i>, such as in the incident of the prisoner, then there is a consensus that since the boatman is engaging in a <i>mitzvah</i> and we are dealing with a situation of <i>ones</i> (duress), he can only charge the market fee.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Yevamot</i> 106a; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 264:8; <i>Rabbi Akiva Eiger</i>, supra n. 25; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i>, supra n. 25; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 81:4 agrees with these decisors. However, his position is difficult to accept because the premise of his position is that the ferry situation is not an example of <i>ones</i>.</i> Consequently, even if a classical <i>kinyan</i> or contract would be executed, the jesting rule would be applicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 81:5.</i>
Now let us apply these principles to the case at hand, namely an exploitative divorce agreement. Assuming there are grounds for divorce, we are dealing with a <i>mitzvah</i> to divorce one’s spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Mitzvat Aseh</i> 222; <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh, Mitzvah</i> 455</i> As such, the principles which underlie an exploitative divorce agreement deal with a husband who is performing a <i>mitzvah</i> and therefore our scenario should be no different than the ferryman who is involved in a <i>mitzvah</i> of rescuing of a Jew who negotiates a fee for his services.
Should a couple agree to accept a <i>beit din’s</i> jurisdiction regarding the propriety of an exploitative divorce agreement, the threshold question is a factual one. What is the conventional practice in their community regarding how much a wife may be asked from her husband for executing a divorce agreement? Does the community limit his fee to <i>sekhar tirha</i> (lit. compensation for the burden<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sekhar tirha</i> is <i>sekhar batalah,</i> (lit. remuneration for idleness, loosely translated- “remuneration for toil and effort”). See Piskei Din Rabbanayim (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>)3:369, 375.</i>) or may his fee exceed this amount?
Historically speaking, there were some communities in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries where the customary fee was exorbitant.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 25; <i>Teshuvot Magen Dovid, EH</i> 1.</i> If we assume that that we are dealing with a scenario where the husband is obligated to give a <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The grounds for the duty is either based upon one of the <i>ilot gerushin</i>, (grounds for divorce such as spousal nonsupport or physically abusing his wife) or, according to certain decisors, the length of time that the couple has been separated.</i> and refuses to release a <i>get</i> unless he receives the customary fee which is an exorbitant amount that well exceeds what is usually paid in terms of <i>sekhar tirha</i>—is the agreement valid should his wife accede to it? Does the <i>hashatah</i> rule apply here? Given that we are focusing upon a situation where the husband is duty-bound to divorce his wife, there exists no loss in a husband divorcing his wife and therefore depending upon the terms of negotiation, the <i>hashatah</i> rule may be raised.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 13.</i> Notwithstanding some opinions that focus upon the fact that we are dealing with a <i>mitzvah</i> and therefore the husband is entitled only to his <i>sekhar tirha</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai, Bava Kama</i> 172 in the name of Maharam of Rothenburg; <i>Magen Dovid</i>, supra n. 30 in the name of various <i>Rishonim</i>.</i> most <i>Poskim</i> center their attention upon the importance of <i>gemirat da’at</i> and therefore claim that if these fees reflect the customary fee, albeit exorbitant, the jesting rule is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot</i>, supra n. 13; <i>Rosh</i>, supra n. 13; <i>Mordekhai</i>, supra n. 33 in the name of Rabbi Simhah and Rabbi Baruch; <i>Rema, SA HM</i> 264:7; <i>Maharshal</i>, supra n. 30; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, HM</i> 135.</i> In other words, even absent the execution of a classical <i>kinyan</i> or a written divorce agreement, orally accepting an exploitative divorce agreement would mandate payment of an exorbitant fee. Since there existed a custom in certain communities to pay such an amount, we impute that wife’s intent was to pay his fee. Based upon the foregoing, a husband’s offer to give a <i>get</i> (which entails the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i>) in exchange for $300,000 is unconscionable. Nonetheless, in terms of <i>hilkhot hiyyuvim</i>, the halakhot dealing with obligations would recognize such an arrangement as valid.
We must now ask ourselves: Today, in New York City, is it customary for a husband to financially extort his wife in exchange for giving the <i>get</i>? If a <i>beit din</i> concludes that the prevailing fee structure is one of remuneration for toil and effort, then charging an outlandish fee would mean that the jesting rule is applicable. And even if this arrangement of charging excessive fees would be practiced amongst the minority in our community, the <i>hashatah</i> rule would be invoked.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 264:15.</i> On the other hand, should the <i>minhag</i> today be to give a <i>get</i> contingent upon receiving an exorbitant fee, then the jesting rule may not be invoked and the wife would have to remit the outlandish fee. Though intuitively one would expect that such behavior is relegated to a minority of husbands who are irresponsible and have no pangs of conscience, absent sociological studies that would corroborate our feeling, it is possible that a <i>beit din</i> may recognize from the perspective of <i>hilkhot hiyyuvim</i> an exploitative divorce agreement as reflecting the <i>minhag</i> in our community. As such, the charging of an excessive fee may be valid.
Given that this possibility exists that an exploitative agreement may be recognized, as remote and as reprehensible as it might seem, can a wife find another <i>halakhic</i> avenue for <i>beit din</i> relief if she consented to an exploitative divorce agreement? Dealing with a price discrepancy between the market price (in our case <i>sekhar tirha</i>) and the charged price of more than one-sixth of the market price entails a form of theft<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, HM</i> 227:1; <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 227:1</i>, which in rabbinic nomenclature is labeled a claim of <i>ona’ah</i> (lit. overreaching, price fraud).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 227:1</i> Under such circumstances, the agreement can generally be voided.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 227:4</i>
Assuming experts determine that the disparity between the market price and agreed-upon price of the divorce agreement is more than one-sixth, <sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">For the requirement of experts to assess whether a claim for <i>ona’ah</i> exists, see <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Bava Batra</i> 4:20; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, HM</i> 227:21.</i> are there grounds to void the agreement and thus allow a wife to recoup her monies? Why didn’t the Talmud raise the claim of <i>ona’ah</i> as a defense for the distressed party rather than the plea of “<i>hashatah</i>”? We are dealing with payment for providing a service (<i>sekhar pe’ulah</i>) akin to the ferryman who provided the fugitive with a service, conveying him across a river. Depending on how you construe the ferryman’s service as the work of a <i>po’eil</i> (an employee) or as a <i>kablan</i> (an independent contractor) will impact whether an <i>ona’ah</i> claim may be advanced. Regardless how one identifies this service, there is controversy whether the service of a <i>po’eil</i> or a <i>kablan</i> is subject to <i>hilkhot ona’ah</i>. In other words, whether there is a claim for <i>ona’ah</i> concerning a <i>sekhar pe’ulah</i> is subject to that debate, which explains why the <i>ona’ah</i> claim wasn’t advanced in the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding a worker, see <i>Rabbi Yonatan of Lunel, Bava Kama</i> 115a; <i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, ad locum; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 2:157; <i>SA, HM</i> 227:33. Regarding a <i>kablan</i> (an independent contractor) which may be viewed as the service provided by a husband, see debate between Rambam, Ramban and Rashba found in <i>MT, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 13:15, 18; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Bava Metzia</i> 56b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba Bava Metzia</i> 56b; <i>SA, HM</i> 227:36</i> Consequently, if a husband’s entitlement to money in exchange for a <i>get</i> is construed as an example of <i>sekhar pe’ulah,</i> whether <i>hilkhot ona’ah</i> would apply is subject to debate. Secondly, in our scenario, it is clear that the wife knew that the fee was exorbitant and nonetheless agreed to remit the fee. The question arises that once one knows that one is being oppressed and accepts the price differential, can one subsequently advance the claim of <i>ona’ah</i> (price fraud)? This issue is equally subject to controversy.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA HM</i> 220:8<i>; Rema, SA HM</i> 227:7<i>.</i></i> In other words, his acceptance of the offer was not due to his acquiescence to the fee (there was no <i>mehilah</i>) but rather because he intended to advance a claim for <i>ona’ah</i> in <i>beit din</i>. He realized that he was unable to broker a fair deal with the seller and decided to subsequently pursue the matter in <i>beit din</i>. Similarly, in our case, the wife was well aware that she would have to agree to pay the exorbitant fee in order to receive her <i>get</i> and expected to pursue the matter of the exploitative agreement in <i>beit din</i>. Finally, it is an open question whether <i>hilkhot ona’ah</i> regarding price differentials in sales transactions apply today.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Zalman N. Goldberg, “The Law of Price-Fraud Today,” (Hebrew) <i>3 Mishpetei Eretz</i> 337 (5772); Osher Weiss, “The Law of Price-Fraud Today, ” (Hebrew) 3 <i>Mishpetei Eretz</i> 342 (5772).</i> As such, it is question whether an <i>ona’ah</i> claim has bearing today concerning instances of providing a service such as receiving a <i>get</i> for an exorbitant fee.
Assuming that <i>hilkhot ona’ah</i> are applicable and one may void the agreement under the circumstances, void the agreement, the wife is well aware that the fee is exorbitant and therefore her willingness to agree to the divorce agreement due to the distress of being still married to her husband demonstrates that she waived her right to void the agreement, i.e. <i>mehilah.</i> Consequently, that is why the Talmud in the fugitive case raises the <i>hashatah</i> rule as a basis for exempting the fugitive from remitting this unconventional fee.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, supra n. 26. In accordance with <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>’s view, this argument would apply only to the case of independent contractor such as a husband executing a divorce agreement where a claim for <i>ona’ah</i> is applicable. See supra n. 40.</i> Similarly, in our scenario, the jesting rule is invoked and consequently the wife has grounds to advance a claim to void the agreement. Contending that common sense dictates that if one undertakes an obligation to remit monies in a distress situation, monies that both sides knowingly realize are outlandish, how can one claim that there is a violation of the prohibition against <i>ona’ah</i>?!<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Hoshen</i> 264:8, <i>Bi’urei Hoshen</i>, page 74.</i>
In the event that remitting an excessive fee in exchange for giving a <i>get</i> would fail to run afoul of the jesting rule and <i>hilkhot ona’ah</i>, there is at least one outstanding avenue that may serve as grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to nullify a distress-exploitative divorce agreement. The Talmud teaches us,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 20a-21a.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Rabbi Hisda said to Rami bar Hama: Yesterday, you were not with us in the <i>Beit Midrash</i> where we discussed some especially interesting issues . . . The discussion was whether one who occupied his fellow’s premises unbeknownst to him, does he have to pay rent or not? . . .</span>
What was the situation? One cannot assume that the premises were not for rent and the occupier was similarly a man who was unaccustomed to rent, for what liability could there be in a case where the defendant derived no benefit and the plaintiff didn’t suffer any loss? If, on the other hand, the premises were available for rent and he was a man who customarily rented premise, why should no liability be incurred since the defendant derived a benefit and the plaintiff suffered a loss?
However, the problem emerges in a case where the premises were not for rent, but he [the occupier] wanted to rent [a place to live] . . . Is the occupier permitted to argue against the owner: What loss have I caused you since your premises were not for rent?” Or might the other party respond: “Since you have benefited, since you would have had to rent other premises, you must pay rent . . .
It was stated: Rabbi Kahana citing Rabbi Yohanan said: In the case of the aforementioned issue there would be no <i>halahkic</i> duty to pay rent; but Rabbi Avahu quoting Rabbi Yohanan said: There would be a <i>halakhic</i> obligation to pay rent . . . Rabbah bar Rabbi Huna . . . responded as follows: “Thus said my father . . . in the name of Rav: He is not legally bound to pay him rent . . . Rabbi Sehora said that Rabbi Huna quoting Rav had said: He who occupies his neighbor’s premises without having any agreement with him is under no <i>halakhic</i> duty to pay him rent . . .
As we have read, whether in the scenario of “this one derived a benefit, but the other sustained no loss” the occupier is duty-bound to remit rent is subject to Talmudic debate. Subsequently, Rambam and Rabbi Yosef Karo rule that should the premises be utilized without the owner’s consent, the occupier is exempt from paying rent.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Gezeilah ve-Aveidah</i> 3:9; <i>SA, HM</i> 363:6</i> Since the owner suffers no loss from the use of his premises, we cannot view the occupier as either a <i>gazlan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, HM</i> 371:10; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra,</i> <i>SA HM</i> 363:14</i> (a thief) or a <i>mazik</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimukei Yosef, Bava Kama</i> 20a in the name of Ramah</i> (a wrongdoer who damages somebody’s property), but rather as an individual who derives <i>hana’ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 363:4; <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Shimon Shkop, Bava Kama</i> 19. Additionally, since he sustains no loss, one can argue that the owner waives his entitlement to rent. See <i>Mahaneh Ephraim, Gezeilah</i> 10.</i> (benefit) from the property without the owner’s permission. As such, the occupier is exempt from payment.
Seemingly, invoking the rule of “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo haser</i>” (“this one benefits, and this one sustains no loss”) inexorably leads to the conclusion that the fugitive is exempt from paying the excessive price for the ferrying across the river. However, one of the exceptions to the rule of “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo haser</i>” is if the occupier expresses a readiness to pay the rent. Then, despite the fact that the owner failed to suffer a loss by the occupancy of his premises, he remains obligated to remit the rent.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 20b, s.v. <i>ta’ama</i>; <i>SA, HM</i> 363:8 ; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Tinyana, HM</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:157; <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Shimon Shkop, Bava Kama</i> 19, <i>Bava Batra</i> 4.</i> Consequently, given the fact that the prisoner agreed to pay the outlandish fee, in accordance with this well-trodden <i>mesorah</i>, a <i>beit din</i> would be unable to invoke the doctrine “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo haser</i>” and he would be duty-bound to pay the excessive fee.
However, even if the fugitive expresses a readiness to pay and remits these monies, there is the Talmudic rule of “<i>kofin al midat Sedom</i>” (we compel one who acts in the manner of the townspeople of <i>Sedom</i>) not to do so. <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Eruvin</i> 49a; <i>Ketuvot</i> 103a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 12b, 59a, 168a. In all these instances, the Talmud refrains from identifying this rule as a grounds for the exemption of payment in a case of “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo haser</i>”. And the Talmudic discussions of “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh lo haser</i>” equally do not mention the doctrine of “<i>kofin al midat Sedom</i>”. Yet numerous authorities seek to reformulate the Talmudic discussions of “<i>zeh neheneh</i> rule” in light of “the <i>kofin</i> rule”. See <i>Rashi, Ketuvot</i> 103a, s.v. <i>midat Sedom</i>; <i>MT, Hilkhot Shekheinim</i> 7:8; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Ketuvot</i> 103a; <i>Yad Ramah, Bava Batra</i> 168a; <i>Ohr Zarua</i> 3:24.</i> Given that the <i>zeh neheneh</i> rule is to be understood within the context of <i>midat Sedom</i>, that means that the owner’s conduct reflects the negative trait of <i>Sedom</i>, namely “mine is mine”.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Avot</i> 5:10</i> In other words, <i>halakhah</i> looks askance at one person refusing to confer benefit upon another individual even when the owner would not incur a loss.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See further, Aharon Lichtenstein, “<i>Kofin al Middat Sedom</i>,” (Hebrew) 16 <i>Alei Etzion</i> 31, Iyar 5769.</i> Hence, in the absence of sustaining a loss, the owner of the premises should not charge any rental fee. Similarly, despite the fact that the fugitive paid the exorbitant fee, <i>halakhic</i>-ethical considerations demand that the ferryman ought to refrain from exploiting a distress situation and therefore the monies ought to be returned to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Maharshal, supra n. 30<i>; Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 264:2; <i>Penei Yehoshua, Bava Kama</i> 20b; <i>Levush Mordekhai, Bava Kama</i> 15; <i>PDR</i> supra n. 29, at 375.</i> Failure to act in such a fashion reflects a personality trait of the townspeople of Sedom. In accordance with this approach, even if an exploitative divorce agreement has been executed, a divorcee has right to recover the exorbitant fee charged in exchange for receiving her <i>get</i>. In the interaction with individuals, surely in the performance of the <i>mitzvah</i> of divorce, a husband ought to refrain from using the <i>get</i> as a bargaining chip and engaging in extortion, which imitates the conduct of Sedom.
In conclusion, in the wake of an exploitative divorce agreement that has yet to be executed, a divorcee has the option to execute a <i>mesirat moda’ah</i> and thus allow her to recoup her payment. In the event that this procedure was not implemented or for some reason the <i>mesirat moda’ah</i> was ineffective<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the absence of witnesses, the presence of witnesses who are ineligible to submit testimony, or testimony that fails to state that the particular transaction was executed under duress will invalidate the <i>mesirat moda’ah.</i></i> and the agreement was finalized, a divorcee’s relief may be found either by advancing a plea that she never firmly resolved (<i>gemirat da’at</i>) to pay the nonconventional fee, a claim for <i>ona’ah</i>, and/or a declaration that her spouse is acting in a Sedomite fashion.
Deciding between the competing arguments regarding the readiness to recognize the merits of one of the three claims is the province of the <i>Posek</i> or <i>dayan</i>. The relative strength of each argument applicable in each situation, its effectiveness, and plausibility will hopefully be tested within the framework and constraints of future decisions of our <i>Poskim</i> and <i>dayyanim</i>.
Since the phenomenon of “<i>get</i> extortion” has become “a fact of life” in all segments of our community, it behooves rabbis and laypeople to become aware of the <i>halakhic</i> arsenal that exists to address this problem. If, at the end of the day, a wife and/or her family/friends are ready to succumb to this extortion in order for the woman “to move along with her life”, then there should be an awareness of the institution of <i>mesirat moda’ah</i>, which may be implemented prior to signing off on a divorce agreement.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 1–5.</i> Additionally, a divorce agreement which embraces “a payoff” for receiving a <i>get</i> ought to provide that any disputes and differences be resolved in a mutually agreed-upon <i>beit din</i>. Therefore, if the agreement is finalized then the wife has the option to advance one or all of the three claims outlined here in our presentation in a <i>beit din</i>. Alternatively, even in the absence of such a mutually agreed-upon provision in the agreement, if the couple had earlier executed a <i>shtar borerut</i> (an arbitration agreement) which clearly empowers a <i>beit din</i> to resolve “all end of marriage issues including but not limited to the division of marital assets and parenting arrangements”, then advancing claims against an exploitative divorce agreement is within the purview of <i>beit din</i> adjudication. In the event that the husband refuses to have differences resolved in a <i>beit din</i>, the wife ought to seek a <i>heter arkaot</i> (permission to litigate in secular court) in order to address the legal propriety of a distress exploitation contract. Counsel regarding this matter should be sought from a rabbinic authority that has expertise in <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> and <i>Even ha-Ezer</i>, preferably with experience in <i>dayyanut</i>.

Chapter 4; Division of marital assets upon divorce; From Metz Rabbinical Court of the Eighteenth Century to the Israeli Rabbinical Courts in Contemporary Times

The purpose of this chapter is to show whether Israeli <i>battei din</i> in contemporary times address the matter of division of matrimonial assets upon divorce any differently than how the Metz <i>beit din</i> of eighteenth century treated this issue. We have chosen to present such a comparison because until one arrives at the twentieth century there are very few extant records of the decisions of rabbinical courts, whether in Europe, Israel or the United States. Now with the existence of records of decisions handed down by an eighteenth century <i>beit din</i>, as well as published reasoned judgments rendered by the Israeli rabbinical courts—which are a network of <i>battei din</i> under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate—we can explore this matter.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>I. The <i>Pinkas</i> of the Metz Rabbinical Court, 1771–1789</b></span>
Our study of this eighteenth-century <i>beit din</i> has benefited from research conducted by Prof. Jay Berkovitz of the University of Massachusetts. Recently, he has published the <i>Pinkas</i> of the Metz Rabbinical Court, 1771–1789, accompanied by a critical commentary and notes regarding the matters addressed by this eighteenth-century rabbinic court.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jay Berkovits, <i>The Pinkas of the Metz Rabbinical Court 1771–1789</i>; (Brill: Leiden, 2014).</i> It is his unstinting efforts in a decade of examination of this historical record that has provided us with the opportunity to understand and distill how this rabbinic court dealt with this issue of dividing assets upon divorce, a topic that today is hotly debated in the Israeli world of rabbis and <i>dayanim</i>.
Describing the three-fold classification of a wife’s property, Prof. Ben Tzion Schereschewsky, the late Israeli Supreme Court Justice, expounds,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B.Z. Scherechewsky, “Dowry,” in M. Elon (ed.), <i>The Principles of Jewish Law</i>, (Jerusalem, 1975), 390–392.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Dowry or “<i>nedunya</i>” means all property of whatever kind brought by the wife to the husband upon their marriage . . . those assets of the wife which she of her own free will entrusts to her husband’s responsibility . . .”<i>Nikhsei tzon barzel</i>” (lit.” the property of iron sheep”) is a term derived from a name of a transaction in which one party entrusts property on certain terms, the latter undertaking responsibility . . . for the return of the capital value of the property at the time of his receipt thereof . . . Upon dissolution of the marriage, this obligation of the husband is governed by the rule that any appreciation or depreciation in the property is his . . . <i>Melog</i> property is property of which the principal remains in the wife’s ownership but the fruits thereof are taken by the husband, so that he has no responsibility . . . in respect of the principal, both its loss and gain being only hers, and upon dissolution of the marriage such property returns to the wife. . . . This category embraces all the property of the wife falling under outside the category of <i>nikhsei tzon barzel</i> (except for a third category described below –AYW) whether brought by her at the time of entering the marriage or acquired thereafter, e.g. by way of inheritance . . . A third category is property of the wife concerning which the husband has no rights at all, neither to the principal nor the fruits thereof. This includes property acquired by her after the marriage by way of gift, the donor having expressly stipulated that it be used for a specific purpose . . . or that it be used for any purpose of her choice without her husband having any authority . . . or property given to her by her husband.</span>
As Prof. Schereschewsky elucidates, the property <i>halakhically</i> identified as “<i>nikhsei melog</i>” is comprised of property that the wife owns the principal and the fruits or income accrue to the husband. For example, a wife brings into the marriage an apartment building. She remains the owner, but any income gained through rentals belongs to the husband and any losses due to the building’s deterioration are her losses. Should the couple divorce, upon the severing of ties, this <i>melog</i> property—regardless of its condition—reverts back as is to the now-divorced wife. Upon review of the <i>pinkas</i> (the records), one encounters the historical fact that this <i>beit din</i> addressed the issue of dividing up marital assets upon divorce by invoking the institution known as “<i>nikhsei melog</i>”, which identifies in part the property held by the wife during her marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ya’akov Berkovitz, <i>Pinkas Beit Din of Kehillat Metz (5531–5549)</i> (hereafter: <i>PMBD</i>), vol. 1, pt. 2, 49a, nos. 4, 14,15,16, 18,31; vol. 2, 57a, no. 19.</i>
And in fact, in the records of Metz we encounter a <i>beit din</i> following in the footsteps of the ruling of Shulhan Arukh,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 85:7.</i> directing a divorcing husband to return these <i>melog</i> assets to his wife.
On the other hand, let’s say a divorcing wife was living in Metz her entire married life and all of the family’s property is located in Metz was titled to her husband; or let’s say the wife holds property in her name that she amassed after the marriage. Would she receive a share in these properties? Given that the Metz <i>beit din</i> divided up property based upon the Talmudic division of matrimonial property system of <i>nikhsei melog</i>, <i>nikhsei tzon barzel,</i> and gifts, the answer is no. In fact, such a conclusion would not only be Talmudically grounded but equally would reflect the legal-social reality of Metz<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>minhag</i> (prevailing monetary custom) may under certain prescribed conditions be imputed to serve as the governing terms of a marital relationship even if the couple is unaware of the <i>minhag</i>. Clearly, since the <i>minhag</i> reflected a separate property system, therefore if <i>minhag</i> should be the determinant in deciding the couple’s financial relationship, it would be no different than how the Metz <i>beit din</i> rules. See this writer’s, “An Employer’s Vicarious Liability for an Employee’s Sexual Misconduct,” 46 <i>Tradition</i> (2014)= <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality, vol. 2</i>, chapter 4, (Urim: 2016).<br>Alternatively, the relevance of the legal-social reality may provide the grounds for invoking the couple’s expectations. See infra text accompanying notes 9–11.</i>. As Prof. Berkovitz notes in his critical commentary to the <i>Pinkas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Jay Berkovitz, <i>Protocols of Justice, The Pinkas of the Metz Rabbinic Court 1771–1789</i>, (hereafter: <i>Protocols</i>) (Brill: Leiden, 2014), 156.</i> all of the communities in northeast France—except for Metz—accepted the community property system. Adopting this community property approach towards dividing up marital assets upon divorce would mean that even if assets are acquired during marriage by one spouse, the other spouse receives a fifty percent share in the assets. However, rejecting the notion that property should be equally divided between the spouses, in Metz the concept of a separate property system was endorsed. Consequently, whether the Torah-observant wife appeared in the Metz <i>beit din</i> or whether she would have appeared in a Metz civil court because the husband refused to proceed to the Metz <i>beit din</i>, the result would be identical. Regardless of in which forum she would claim an equal share in the family’s properties, the result would be that she would not be entitled to half the value of the properties.
The fact that the Metz <i>beit din</i> divided marital assets upon divorce based upon the tripartite division of <i>nikhsei melog</i>, <i>nikhsei tzon barzel</i>, and gifts exclusively given to the wife is underscored by the fact that in order to afford a wife to retain her own property during the marriage and recover it upon divorce, the <i>tenaim</i> (premarital conditions) signed by the couple’s parents addresses the division of marital property.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PMBD</i>, vol. 2, 57a, 40–41, <i>Protocols</i>, 138-156-157.</i> It is clear that since the Metz <i>beit din</i> recognized and implemented the Talmudic matrimonial property system, it was therefore in the interests of a woman to have a prenuptial agreement finalized that would allow her to benefit from a different financial-economic arrangement. Dispositive arrangements concerning property relations are permitted based upon the operative rule “an individual may stipulate contrary what is written in the Torah”.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 19b</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>II. The Israeli Rabbinical Courts and its Interaction with <i>Minhag ha-Medinah</i></b></span>
<b>A. Ownership of the Marital Home upon Divorce</b>
One of the first issues that was addressed by the Israeli rabbinical courts at the time of their establishment in the 1950s was how to determine which spouse owns the matrimonial home. Adopting Turkish law, Israeli law mandates that all real estate that had been bought must be registered with the Land Registry Office. Upon registering the property, the buyer receives legal title to the real estate.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Land Law-5729 (1969), Section 8.</i>
Given that upon divorce marital assets were to be divided between the spouses, the question arose whether a title of ownership of the marital home by one spouse effectively preempted the possibility that the other divorcing spouse would be entitled to receive monies from the sale of the property.
The threshold question which arises is whether an Israeli Jewish citizen can <i>halakhically</i> purchase real estate without registration; or does <i>Halakhah</i> mandate that, absent compliance with the legal requirement of registration, the buyer fails to become the owner? As we know, land is acquired by different types of <i>kinyanim</i> (undertakings that demonstrate transfer of an asset), namely the transfer of money, the executing of a <i>shtar</i> (document), <i>hazakah</i> (possession), or a <i>sudar</i> (lit. the handing of a handkerchief or another article from one party to the other).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 190:1</i> Consequently, in contemporary times, Hazon Ish, R. Shlomo Zalman Urbach, and R. Levi Wosner conclude that any land transfer effected by a prescribed <i>kinyan</i> is <i>halakhically</i> valid without registration.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish, HM, Likkutim</i> 16:5; <i>Ma’adanei Aretz</i> 18; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 9:306</i> A few Israeli rabbinical courts endorse this view.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 12:239, 244, 15:353, 355–358.</i>

Hason et al. <i>Piskei Din Beit Mishpat Elyon</i> 35(3), 571, 611.</i> Precedent for such a position had already been marshaled by many authorities of earlier centuries. Some <i>Poskim</i> recognized real estate agreements executed in accordance with the governing civil law<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:514; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 2:77.</i> and others validated ownership based upon registration.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 225; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Emet</i> 12; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:143; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:31; <i>Teshuvot Maharit, HM</i> 2:66. For additional <i>Poskim</i>, see Kleinman, infra n. 18, at 216, n. 104.</i> Their rulings were either based upon invoking <i>dina demalkhuta dina, minhag, kinyan situmta</i> (commercially recognized form of transfer), and/or the fact that the intent of the buyer (<i>semikhut da’at</i>) is to be in compliance with the prevailing law.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For the basis of these rationales amongst <i>aharonim</i>, see R.

With this background we can now proceed to address how contemporary Israeli <i>battei din</i> deals with the issue of dividing up the marital home upon divorce. Will the spouse(s) who is registered on the property in the Land Registry be viewed <i>halakhically</i> as the bona fide owner(s) or the spouse (or a third party related to the spouse) who invested the money in the purchase be considered the owner of the home? Notwithstanding the many <i>battei din</i> today who invoke the civil legislation of Monetary Relations between Spouses and divide up the marital home equally, a review of many of decisions handed down within the network of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate between the years of 1957–2013 shows that—regardless of the spousal investment—if the purchase is registered under the names of both spouses, then upon divorce the property is divided up equally and if it is registered under the name of one spouse, ownership resides with the registered spouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 1:108, 3:78, 299, 6:257, 264, 11:116, 253, 12:179, 16:235, 321; A.

<span class="poetry indentAll">Regarding the question of the intent of the registration, we can establish that this is the custom and the practice throughout the world in every period. It is known that now there is a custom to register real estate, in particular residential property, under the name of the two spouses and ownership of the property will be theirs. The registration shows that he is the one who paid or he paid more and gave the balance of his share [in the real estate] to the second one as a gift.</span>
Other <i>dayanim</i> subscribe to the aforementioned view of R. Goldschmidt and argue that a husband who purchases the property and then registers the property in his and his wife’s name in effect is intending that his wife’s share is a gift. Or if the wife or the wife’s parents purchase the apartment and the property is registered under the name of both spouses, clearly a gift is being made with the husband or the son-in-law respectively.
The question then arises is whether the gift can be revoked or not. Seemingly, R. Elyashiv raises the possibility that when property is registered in the name of two individuals, from the seller’s perspective it is clear that he is selling the asset to two individuals and therefore it is difficult for the purchasing spouse to claim that the noncontributing spouse’s share is to be viewed as a gift and therefore revocable.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 4:257, 266.</i> Nonetheless, some <i>battei din</i> contend that the gift is revocable upon divorce should the grounds for divorce stem from a wife’s improper behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:31, 10:331, 14:21. See also, Nahum Gertler, “A Couple who Acquired an Apartment and the Husband Contributed More in the Purchase,” (Hebrew) 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 317, 341 (5763).</i> And as such, at the time of divorce, she would have to pay her husband for her share in the marital home. On the other hand, implicitly relying upon the opinions of Beit Yitzhak and the Lomzer Rebbe,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, HM</i> 72; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 5:232.</i> other rabbinical panels contend that when the husband gifted a share of the marital home to his wife, the gifting was unconditional. Therefore, even if the wife is responsible for severing the marital ties, she retains her share in the home.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:78; 10:331 (minority opinion), 11: 253, 12:179, 13:148. However, for example, if at the onset of the marriage the property was acquired by the wife and she subsequently had half of the property registered in her husband’s name, <i>battei din</i> argue that this property transfer is to be understood as a gift that is revocable should the couple sever marital ties. See <i>PDR</i> 10:331; File 5199/48- Unpublished, (R. Atlas’s opinion); File no. 2128904, Petah Tikva Regional Beit Din, Ploni v. Plonit, March 22, 2012.</i>
Absent valid grounds for divorcing a wife, in situations where an apartment was purchased by the husband and registered in his wife’s name, some <i>dayanim</i> such as R. Elyashiv invoke the well-known view of Rashba as well as others such as Ramban and Sefer ha-Terumot who claim that the registration was executed in order to fraudulently convey the property to a third party to avoid creditors rather than a proof that she actually is the property owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:263, 264–265. For antecedents to this approach, see <i>Shakh, SA HM</i> 60:39, 62:7; <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yose</i>f 75; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak,</i> supra n. 24; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:38; <i>PDR</i> 3:75. However, relying upon <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 96:4, <i>SA, HM</i> 60:12 and <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 62:1 rule that the individual who possesses title paid for the purchase of the real estate.</i> As such, the husband would be viewed as the owner of the home.
Given that the circumstances may vary from situation to situation whether the registration indicates the giving of a gift to a noncontributing spouse, one must examine each case individually and, absent any evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that the registered name is the <i>muhzak</i> (the possessor) and therefore the owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, HM</i> 62:6; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 4:32; File no. 9199-24-1, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, December 18, 2007; Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, July 22, 2012.<br>For the presumptive ownership by the <i>muhzak</i>, see <i>PDR</i> 1:117, 2:251, 275, 5:277, 6:257, 11:253.</i> In short, registration gives legal validity to a real estate sale. However, though registration is <i>halakhically</i> recognized as a form of transfer,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, text accompanying notes 16–18.</i> nonetheless whether the <i>halakhot</i> of gifting might impact at the time of divorce upon the ownership rights of a non-contributing spouse is subject to debate.
Nonetheless, there are <i>battei din</i> that validate the registration and fail to address concerns emerging from <i>hilkhot matanah</i> (gift). Lest one extrapolate from their silence that ownership of a marital home by a couple via a registration of couple’s title of the apartment conveys the notion that <i>Halakhah</i> is recognizing that matrimony is based upon a partnership between spouses which in part is grounded upon joint ownership of the marital home, a 1978 judgment authored by R. Shlomo Daichovsky argues otherwise. In a divorce case,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 11:116</i> the apartment was registered in the name of the married couple and the question arose as to who owns the home. Though the husband readily admits that his wife’s parents gave the majority of the monies for the purchase of the property, he is nonetheless claiming fifty percent ownership in the home. And the wife argues that he should not receive any share of the home.
<i>Halakhah</i> recognizes various different methods of establishing a partnership. One is known as “<i>kis</i>” (lit. a bag) or, in modern Hebrew parlance “<i>kupah meshutefet</i>” (the common purse). A prospective partner would place his share of money into the bag and mix it up with the contributions of others. The bag, with all its contents, was acquired by each of the potential partners and so each individual was given a right to the entire investment and the accrued profits.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah</i> <i>Ketuvot</i> 10:4; <i>Tosefta</i> <i>Ketuvot</i> 10:4</i>The question arises whether the monies each spouse contributed towards the purchase of the apartment created a common purse. In the absence of the establishment of a <i>kis</i>, are there additional methods of forming a partnership?
For Rambam, when individuals want to form a partnership, each individual will place his monies in the bag and both would lift the bag.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i> (hereafter:<i>MT), Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafim</i> 4:1.</i> On the other hand, Ba’al ha-Turim argues that even if each individual pull the monies of the other towards himself or if they commenced in engaging in the commercial partnership, such actions would suffice to establish a partnership arrangement.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, HM</i> 176:1</i> However, Sma disagrees and requires at least the intermingling of the monies in a bag prior to engaging in partnership activity in order to validate that in actuality a partnership arrangement exists.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 176:7</i> However, Taz agrees with Tur that engaging in the business partnership give validity to a partnership.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taz, SA, HM</i> 176:7</i>
In accordance with the <i>beit din</i> judgment, in the absence of a common purpose and pulling monies, the spouses failed to create a partnership. On the contrary, each spouse appeared with “their own bag” rather than placing their money in a common purse!
The outstanding question is whether the willingness of the couple to purchase a marital home serves as the commencement of a partnership relationship. Moreover, Rambam’s formulation that “the partners want to become partners” or Tur’s wording that “the partners are coming to be partners” assumes that the individuals have already mutually agreed to be partners and are seeking to ascertain how such a relationship is formed. In the matrimonial context, prior to the apartment purchase, there is no indication that the couple seeks to enter into a partnership arrangement. And it is very possible, argues <i>beit din</i>, that the wife who contributes the majority of the monies towards acquiring the property would not agree to creating a common purse. Consequently, R. Daichovsky concludes that, given the absence of preliminary actions prior to the purchase attesting to the desire to form a partnership, even in pursuance to Taz’s view, one would not recognize the creation of such a relationship.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Let us note that there are authorities who claim that a partnership is to be viewed either as each partner being an agent of all the others or as a hired employee of the others. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran, Bava Metzia</i>, Sofer ed., page 49; <i>Ra’avad, MT, Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafim</i> 4:2. Yet here again the facts of the matrimonial situation do not indicate that <i>hilkhot shelihut</i> (agency law) or <i>hilkhot sekhirut po’alim</i> (labor law) are applicable here.</i> In short, in the wake of the lack of evidence that the parties consciously desire to develop a partnership relationship, the <i>beit din</i> was unwilling to recognize such ties. Similarly, one should not infer from the silence of other <i>battei din</i> regarding the grounds for validating registration that these panels are invoking the conception that matrimony is a partnership relationship.
Yet there is at least one panel that recently argues that a couple that purchased an apartment together and registered it with each spouse receiving an equal share clearly intended to establish a partnership and divide up the asset equally even if the contribution of each spouse was unequal.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 2128904, Petah Tikva Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, March 22, 2012.</i>
Other panels have invokes notions of marital partnership but are quick to note that this partnership relationship is to be distinguished from a commercial partnership. A business partnership is created to accumulate monetary profit. In the event of intractable partnership disagreement that causes financial losses, there is an expectation that the partners will dissolve the ties. On the other hand, though there may be differences between the spouses regarding their marital property, the actual disputes do not necessarily mean that divorce is imminent. Marriage has its ups and downs and, at the end of the day, there may be other reasons that the relationship will sustain itself despite certain differences regarding their financial assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 3599221, Tiberias Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, November 24, 2004.</i> As R. Daichovsky points out, the moment of marital partnership dissolution will be tied to whether there exists prospects for <i>shalom bayit</i> (marital reconciliation), which may or may not be linked to the couple’s financial differences.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">S. Daichovsky, “Prenuptial Monetary Agreements,” (Hebrew) 21 <i>Tehumin</i> 280, 284 (5761). Whether the partnership lapses when the couple is separated and there no prospects for reconciliation or when a <i>get</i> is formally given to the wife is a subject of debate between R. Daichovsky and R. Sherman. See S. Daichovsky and A. Sherman, “ Liquidating the Partnership and Dividing the Assets of the Spouses,” (Hebrew) 16–17 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> 501(5750–5751)</i>
That being said, one must understand the <i>halakhic</i> basis for viewing marriage as a partnership? As Rambam rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 12:1–3</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When a man marries a woman . . . whether of majority age or a minor, whether a Jewess or a convert . . . he is obligated to her in ten matters and is entitled to receive four matters . . . and they are support, clothing . . . living with her . . . And the four that he is privileged to receive . . . her handiwork, her finds, consuming the fruits of <i>nikhsei melog</i> during her lifetime, and if she dies while he is alive, he is the first in line to inherit . . .</span>
This network of monetary obligations is predicated upon the fact that the husband is the breadwinner and therefore, in exchange for his efforts, he is entitled to her handiwork and the income accrued from her assets. This arrangement stands in bold contrast to the matrimonial property system based upon <i>hezkat ha-shituf</i> (lit. the presumption of partnership), which emerged from a series of Israeli Supreme Court decisions handed down in the 1960s and later ratified by the Knesset in 1973 in the form of legislation.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A. Rosen-Tzvi, <i>The Law of Matrimonial Property</i>, (Hebrew) (Jerusalem, 5742), 212–298.</i> Translating <i>hezkat ha-shituf</i> into legal terms, Israel adopts the community property system, which means that all assets—including property, real estate, and others—and rights that have accrued due to a spouse’s work during marriage are divided up equally between the couple upon divorce. In bold contrast to Israeli law, barring particular assets that are under her name and/or are jointly owned by the couple, it is clear that in accordance with <i>Halakhah</i>, all assets remain with the husband.
However, in 1992, Israel’s High Court of Justice directs the <i>battei din</i> to resolve these matters in accordance with governing Israeli law. In 1987, Mr. and Mrs. Bavli, who were two Israeli Jewish citizens, received a divorce judgment from a regional <i>beit din</i>. Additionally, despite the fact that according to Israel’s Spouses (Property Relations) Law of 1973 the wife should have been granted half of her husband’s assets, the <i>beit din</i> invokes the rule that the husband is entitled to retain his assets that are under his name rather than grant his wife a fifty percent share of those assets. Unhappy with the <i>beit din’s</i> ruling, Mrs. Bavli filed suit to the Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, requesting that they direct the <i>beit din</i> to award her half of her husband’s assets based upon the governing civil law. (In Israel, the Supreme Court may sit on certain claims as the Supreme Court and on certain claims as High Court of Justice.) Upon review of the <i>beit din</i> decision, the High Court of Justice rules that the <i>beit din</i> must comply with the dictates of Israeli civil law and render such an award.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">HCJ 1000/92, <i>Bavli v. Bavli</i>, 48(2) Israel Supreme Court 221.</i> From that time onwards, <i>battei din</i> under the Israeli chief rabbinate began handing down decisions in accordance with the governing civil law rather than the Talmudic matrimonial property of <i>nikhsei melog</i> and <i>nikhsei tzon barzel</i> and registration of the home. As a Tel Aviv <i>beit din</i> states,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 4488663, Tel Aviv- Yaffo Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit,</i> July 11,2013. See also, File no. 58661013, infra n. 43. Alternatively, the mutual agreement is achieved due to the fact that the <i>minhag</i> presumes that the assets are divided up equally. See File no. 8737051, infra n. 43.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The status and <i>halakhic</i> validity of the rabbinical court to judge the division of assets between a couple in pursuance of the Law of Couple’s Monetary Relations has been dealt with extensively. Two differing positions . . . have been stated concerning this matter. Does one view it as national custom or not? Even though the law (in accordance with <i>Bavli</i>) obligates the <i>battei din</i> to adjudicate the division of assets according to the law rather than <i>halakha</i>h, nonetheless it is clear that this decision does not empower a <i>beit din</i> to <i>halakhically</i> authorize itself to judge this matter when it believes that it is at variance with <i>halakhah</i>. Accordingly, today, the majority of <i>battei din,</i> if not all of them, demand from the parties explicit permission to resolve their matters dealing with assets according to the civil law . . . there are some <i>battei din</i> that do not only require verbal agreement but demand also the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>.</span>
Given that <i>Halakhah</i> differs from Israeli law regarding how one divides up assets upon divorce, on what grounds would a <i>beit din</i> address such a matter by recognizing <i>hezkat ha-shituf</i>? Clearly, if this question would be examined through the lens of registration, one would consider whether both spouses were registered on the real estate. Whether registration indicates ownership or a means to fraudulently convey the property would be addressed by the <i>beit din</i>. If the property was purchased by the husband and the real estate was gifted to the wife and registered under her name, is the gift revocable if she engages in inappropriate conduct? The notion of <i>hezkat ha-shituf</i> does not arise. However, under Israeli law, such questions are not raised. Regardless whose name is registered on the real estate and the conditions that lead to a name being registered, upon divorce the property is divided up equally between the spouses due to the fact that marriage is viewed as a partnership.
One approach, as suggested by the Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, is if the couple agrees to have their differences regarding the division of marital assets resolved in accordance to civil law, then the <i>beit din</i> will require the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking an agreement).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See also File no. 124053917464, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v.

However, following in Taz’s and Gra’s footsteps, Dayanim Elyashiv, Sherman, and others invalidate such an agreement due to the fact that it is a violation of litigating in secular court.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taz, SA, HM</i> 26:3; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, HM</i> 61:23; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 529; A.

Hence, a spousal agreement to have matters resolved in a <i>beit din</i> in accordance to secular law is invalid.
Alternatively, other <i>dayanim</i> contend that a <i>beit din</i> is empowered to address such issues because <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> (the national practice) is that divorcing spouses resolve such matters in accordance with Israeli law, namely the rules of community property system.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 3359063, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, May 26, 2010; File no. 7644111, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v.

<span class="poetry indentAll">The practice is also in the <i>haredei</i> (ultra-orthodox) families—including the families of renowned Torah scholars—that the wife is on equal standing to her husband regarding family property. This expresses itself in property registration of the marital apartment, with the purchase and sale of property with mutual agreement and the inheritance of the communal property to the wife after the length of days (i.e. demise –AYW) of the husband. I have sat (dealt –AYW) with thousands of estate files, and some from the most <i>haredi</i> families, and never encountered even one case where the wife had to waive her right to her husband’s estate for the sake of the Torah heirs.</span>
By invoking the effectiveness of <i>minhag</i>, there is an implicit assumption that the practice must be clear, it must be the custom throughout the country or a particular locale, and it must be practiced at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For additional discussion, see <i>Rabbinic Authority, vol. 2</i>, chapter 4, text accompanying notes 83–88.</i> Clearly, Israeli law concerning how to deal with the division of marital assets is clear, widespread, and has been applied more than three times.

Finally, according to many <i>Poskim</i>, the parties do not have to possess knowledge of the actual existence of the <i>minhag</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:125, 6:254; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 380; <i>Teshuvot Maharashakh</i> 2:229; <i>Sma, HM</i> 338:2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 314;<i> Teshuvot Teshuot Hein</i> 55 cited in <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 53:12.

See <i>Erech Shai, EH</i> 50:7.

Rosner, <i>Mishpat ha-Po’alim</i>, 92</i> the assumption is that the <i>minhag</i> applies. Consequently, the <i>minhag</i>—namely, governing Israeli law—will determine how property ought to be divided up for a Torah-observant couple. In other words, the intent of the parties is to enter into any monetary agreement on the basis of the <i>minhag</i>. The <i>minhag</i> now becomes an obligation of <i>halakhic</i> compliance rather than reflecting only a historical fact of a particular locale.
Some <i>dayanim</i>, such as Rabbis Izirer and Malka, contend that Torah-observant Jews desire to follow <i>Halakhah</i>. So if a <i>minhag</i> reflects <i>Halakhah</i>, there is an abiding willingness to comply with it. However, even if they are cognizant of the practice, some will reject it if it is in variance with <i>Halakhah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 8356651, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, Ploni v.

Shlomo Amar, former chief rabbi of Israel and Dayan Eliyahu Rosenthal claim that this <i>minhag</i> of dividing marital assets based upon the provisions of a community property system has failed to receive the imprimatur of a Torah scholar and therefore lacks validity.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">S.

Admittedly, there is a long-standing <i>halakhic</i> controversy whether a monetary custom practiced by the community is effective without rabbinic or communal endorsement. However, the classical restatements of <i>Halakhah</i> have either explicitly or implicitly ruled that a monetary custom has an independent status.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>SA, HM</i> 176:10, 218:19, 229:2, 230:10, 232:6, 330:5, 331:12; <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 72:5.</i> In fact, various contemporary <i>Poskim</i>, such as R.

In short, some <i>battei din</i> will impart recognition to the Israeli community property system based upon either <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> or by virtue of the fact that the a divorcing couple, when appearing in <i>beit din</i>, will execute a <i>kinyan</i> affirming that their matters be resolved in pursuance to civil law.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>B. Collecting the Value of the <i>Ketubah</i> Upon Divorce</b></span>
Assuming one adopts the position that <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes the civil law dealing with the division of marital assets upon divorce, the question emerges whether a wife may collect the value of her <i>ketuba</i>h upon divorce. Clearly, this is a debt that the husband owes to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 82b.</i> Legally, in pursuance to Section 17 of the Law of Monetary Relations between Spouses, a <i>beit din</i> may award the value of the <i>ketubah</i> to the divorcing wife. In other words, in addition to a wife’s entitlement to fifty percent of various monetary assets that may be in her husband’s name, she has a right to the value of her <i>ketubah.</i> Depending upon the income and property of each party during the marriage, there is a distinct possibility that in accordance with the governing law, a wife may be receiving assets that substantially exceed the value of her <i>ketubah,</i> which today approximates $30,000 to $40,000.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The value is 200 <i>zekukim</i> of silver, which is equivalent to a certain number of grams of silver. There are differing approaches for valuation of the 200 <i>zekukim</i>. Depending upon which approach one accepts, one then arrives at the current value based upon the value of silver in the silver spot market. So, for example, in November 2013, the value of the <i>ketubah</i> varied in the Ashkenazic world between $30,000 to $40,000, depending upon the valuation yardstick one adopted and whether one adopts the view of R. Moshe Feinstein or the Hazon Ish.</i> Given that the rationale for legislating that a husband must give his divorcing wife the value of the <i>ikar ketubah</i> of 100 <i>zuzim</i> is for deterrence, in order that “it will not be easy for him to divorce her”,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 11a, 82b; <i>Yevamot</i> 89a; <i>Rashi, Ketuvot</i> 101a; <i>Hiddushei Ri me-Gash, Ketuvot</i> 82b.<br>Even though in accordance to the position of R. Meir recorded in <i>Talmud Yerushalmi Ketuvot</i> 5:2 that a husband is obligated as a <i>tenai beit din</i> (<i>obligato ex lege</i>) to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, nevertheless, our Sages have mandated that the monetary value be memorialized in a document titled <i>ketubah</i> in order that a wife would be aware of her rights. See <i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 89a; <i>Ritva and Ra’ah, Shitah Mekubezet, Ketuvot</i> 56b. Consequently, if the <i>ketubah</i> is lost, the husband is obligated to prepare another one and give it to his wife. See <i>Ketuvot</i> 57a; <i>Bava Kama</i> 89a.</i> there would seemingly be no grounds to collect its value. This <i>ikar ketubah</i> has now been replaced by the potential windfall of real estate and/or monies that may accrue to the divorcing wife based upon civil law. In fact, for this reason, in a decision handed down by the Tzfat Regional Beit Din, Dayan Uriel Lavi rejects in his words “double rights”, entitlement to the <i>ketubah</i> and monetary rights under Israeli law.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ateret Devorah</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 47; See also, File no. 8549013, Tzfat Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, March 7, 2013.</i> At the time of marriage, the husband never contemplated that he would give his wife a right to half of his assets—the expectation based on Israel’s community property system guidelines—as well as obligate himself to the value of the <i>ketubah</i>. In other words, there is an <i>umdana,</i> (i.e. an assessed expectation) of the husband and therefore the obligation to pay the <i>ketubah</i> was on the condition that in the wake of a divorce he would not be required to give additional monies from his assets to his wife. Consequently, Dayan Lavi denies her right to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">And in fact, in numerous divorce cases handled at the various <i>battei din</i> in the New York metropolitan area, in cases where a wife will be receiving significant sums of money from her husband’s assets, a panel will generally not an award the value of the<i> ketubah</i> to her.</i>
Subsequently, the wife appealed the Tzfat Regional Beit Din’s decision to the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol in Yerushalayim and the panel rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1214978, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol,, <i>Plonit v. Ploni,</i> February 8, 2005.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In terms of <i>Halakhah</i> and the law there is a need to distinguish between the <i>ketubah</i> which is a debt . . . which is not dependent upon the intent of the obligor (the prospective husband –AYW) and the obligation of <i>tosefet ketubah</i>, for which one has to factor into consideration the obligor’s intent during the time of drafting the <i>ketubah</i>. As such, he could say that he intended that she would collect upon her divorce whatever she is entitled to receive according to the law monetary relations and therefore he does not need to give her <i>tosefet</i> and never intended to give her <i>tosefet</i>.</span>
The standard amount of money in the Ashkenazic <i>ketubah</i> is 200 <i>zuz</i>. Usually, one hundred <i>zuzim</i> are earmarked for the actual debt, known as the <i>ikar ketubah</i>, and another 100 <i>zuzim</i> are earmarked for the <i>tosefet ketubah</i>.

Whereas <i>ikar ketubah</i> is based upon rabbinic legislation and a wife cannot waive her right to these monies except in a certain prescribed fashion, <i>tosefet ketubah</i> is grounded in a husband’s undertaking of a commitment and therefore a wife may waive her right to these monies. See <i>SA, EH</i> 66:3; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 66:17</i> In the aforementioned Tel Aviv-Jaffa Regional Beit Din <i>psak din</i>, without focusing upon the distinction between <i>ikar ketubah</i> and <i>tosefet ketubah</i>, the panel argues that in order to invoke the <i>umdana</i> that the prospective Torah-observant husband in the event of divorce expected to pay only what his wife is entitled to according to civil law, the <i>umdana</i> must be <i>gedolah</i> (significant) to the level of absolute certainty in “his heart and the heart of every individual” in order to be exempt from paying the value of the <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 8388358, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v.

Daichovsky observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 8018232, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, September 2, 2007.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The <i>ketubah</i> was not designed in order to enrich the divorcing wife . . . the purpose of the <i>ketuba</i>h is to facilitate the wife to maintain herself with dignity for a period of a minimum of one year, until she finds another husband . . . one should take into account that today there is an additional reason to limit the <i>ketubot</i> (collecting its value –AYW). Everyone knows that the assets of the parties are divided equally according the law of monetary relations between spouses . . . the division of assets includes future rights, such as social benefits and retirement benefits and professional goodwill that the husband acquired during the marriage. It is difficult to assume that a groom with any common sense will agree “to be hit twice or three times”—to have his assets divided up in accordance with civil law . . . and to pay the <i>ketubah</i> . . .</span>
Implicit in Dayan Daichovsky’s understanding of the nature of the <i>ketubah</i> is that it is an obligation undertaken by one side, namely the <i>hatan</i> (the groom). The <i>kallah</i> (the bride) is outside the picture and, absent any negotiations between the prospective spouses regarding whether its value will exceed two hundred <i>zuzim</i>, the <i>kallah</i> is presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and is informed regarding its value under the <i>huppah</i> (wedding canopy). As R. Eliezer Fleckles, a nineteenth-century Austrian <i>Posek</i>, notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Elazar</i> 2:39</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And the <i>ketubah</i> . . . does not entail buying and selling, which requires the intent of the purchaser and the seller. A <i>ketubah</i> (marital agreement –AYW) is more comparable to someone who earmarks his assets in writing to his son or his wife . . . because these are a gift on the part of the donor and are not dependent upon the intent of the receiver (the beneficiary –AYW).</span>
In short, the <i>ketubah</i> is representative of a gift rather than an item sold to the wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">It is my understanding that in actuality R. Fleckles is referring to the <i>tosefet ketubah</i>, since the <i>ikar ketubah</i> is a <i>halakhic</i> mandate rather than a gift that is dependent upon the volition of the donor.</i>
As we explained, the common denominator of both of these schools of thought as to whether a husband remains obligated to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i> in situations where his wife has accrued significant assets in light of governing a Israeli law hinges upon how we assess the husband’s <i>umdana</i> at the time of their wedding. Is there an <i>umdana</i> that a Torah-observant Jew will undertake to remit both payments upon divorce or do we assume that a wife’s entitlement to fifty percent of his assets presumes that payment of the value of <i>ketubah</i> would not be forthcoming? Obviously, adopting one approach or another leaves much leeway for a <i>dayan’s shikul ha-da’at</i> in resolving this issue.
Invoking a <i>halakhic</i> directive rather than <i>sevara</i> (<i>halakhic</i> logic), we may resolve this issue by focusing upon a Talmudic <i>sugya</i> that deals with the words of a <i>shekhiv mei-ra</i> (a bequest spoken by a person on his deathbed). The testator who is critically ill must employ words that show that he is making a gift on his death. Sometimes his words are ambiguous and therefore it remains uncertain whether the intent was to give an inheritance or intending to give a gift beyond the normal share of the inheritance. For example, what happens if he states that he is giving X amount of money to his sons, who are Torah heirs, or to his wife, who will be paid her <i>ketubah</i> upon his demise? Do we construe the gift in addition to his inheritance to his sons or to the value of the <i>ketubah</i>? Or do we view it as a partial estate distribution to his sons or as a portion of the payment of the <i>ketubah</i>? This question is subject to debate and the Shulhan Arukh,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 109:3, <i>HM</i> 253:8</i> as understood by various <i>aharonim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zera Avraham,</i> <i>HM</i> 10; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Rahamim, HM</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Rosh Mashbir</i>, vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 39</i> as well as Rema<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 253:8</i> concur that the donor’s intent is to pay off now a portion of the share of their inheritance and remit partial payment of the value of the <i>ketubah</i>. In effect, the implication of this position is that in cases of ambiguity regarding the intent of the donor, we assume that the sons are only obtaining the value of the inheritance and the wife is only receiving the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. Relying upon this position, Dayan Lavi concludes that in lieu of the fact that a divorcing wife is receiving significant assets based upon civil law, we construe that the husband’s intent was not to obligate himself to “double payments” and therefore his wife is not entitled to the value of the <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 5931632, supra n. 71.</i>
In sum, in accordance with many Israeli <i>battei din</i> one may adopt the <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> dividing up assets upon divorce equally. But whereas the view of others, as exemplified by the aforementioned Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol <i>psak din</i>, argues that the emergence of this <i>minhag</i> does not impact a divorcing wife’s entitlement to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n. 72. See also, File no. 8388358, supra n.43.</i> the majority of <i>battei din</i> contend otherwise. Whereas the minority opinion contends that the duty to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i> remains intact regardless of the amount of assets that accrue to a divorcing wife, one who invokes <i>hilkhot shekhiv mei-ra</i> would discern that an individual’s intent is to refrain from making “double payments” and that this <i>Halakhah</i> of <i>yerushah</i> may serve as grounds that the husband is exempt from paying the value of the <i>ketubah</i> to his divorcing wife—who is receiving assets based upon <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>. Both opinions accept the <i>minhag</i>, yet each one assesses differently how <i>Halakhah</i> ought to deal with the husband’s obligation, memorialized at the inception of marriage, to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i> upon divorce.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>C. Collecting the Value of Professional and Personal Goodwill Upon Divorce</b></span>
With the emerging recognition of <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> by some Israeli <i>battei din</i> as the yardstick for assessing how to divide up marital assets upon divorce, we encountered that <i>battei din</i> began to address the propriety of paying a wife the value of her <i>ketubah</i> in light of the wife’s accumulation of liquid assets and/or real estate upon divorce. The interaction of <i>Halakhah</i> and <i>minhag</i> is not limited to this issue but equally encompasses other claims advanced by a divorcing spouse. For example, one <i>beit din</i> held that a wife’s law degree and teacher’s license are deemed as marital assets and therefore the panel awarded the husband a certain percentage of the value of the degree and the license.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 3980641, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol,, <i>Ploni v. Plonit,</i> June 3, 2009.</i> In another situation, arguing that her husband’s professional goodwill—namely, his established business and his earning capacity—should be considered as marital assets, a panel concluded that she was entitled to a certain percentage of its value.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 4654241, Haifa Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, March 18, 2010.</i> Two months after this ruling, a different panel agreed that professional goodwill is marketable property and therefore a wife would be entitled to a certain percentage of its value. However, given the particular circumstances of the case, the panel refrained from rendering such an award.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 3359063, Tel Aviv- Yaffo Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, May 26, 2010</i> The common denominator of the three rulings is that the parties mutually agreed to resolve their financial differences in accordance to civil law and the panels chose to accept the legal approach that recognizes that a professional degree and professional goodwill are both marketable properties and are therefore subject to being a marital asset, which may be valued for a divorce award and result in a spouse receiving a share in the value of the opposing spouse’s degree or goodwill.
On the other hand, in light of differing Israeli legal opinions regarding some of these matters, some <i>battei din</i> have chosen to resolve the case based on <i>halakhic</i> guidelines rather than aligning themselves with a particular legal position. For example, a wife advanced a claim to receive a share of the enhanced earning capacity of her husband, who is an engineer who specializes in refrigeration—namely, professional goodwill. Additionally, she claimed that her husband had an excellent reputation in the field and therefore is entitled to a share of the value of his personal goodwill, which encompasses the reputation, skills, experience, ability, and persona of the professional spouse.
The question arises whether one can have a property right in professional or personal goodwill. Does a property right have to be something tangible? Can one sell or inherit goodwill? Is there a difference between professional goodwill and personal goodwill?
Addressing these questions, R. Ariel Yanai of the Netanya Regional Beit Din distinguishes between personal goodwill and professional goodwill.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 8247802, supra n. 50.</i> Dealing with professional goodwill raises the issue whether a property right requires tangibility. <i>Halakhically</i>, a property right can be acquired only in something which has substance, or a <i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Mehira</i> 22:13–14; <i>Tur, HM</i> 212:1, <i>SA, HM</i> 212:1</i> Tangibility in this context is defined as something that has height, width, and depth.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Despite the lack of tangibility, already in sixteenth-century Poland, Maharshal recognizes the validity of a <i>shtar hakirah</i>, i.e. a leasing agreement known in Polish as an “<i>arenda</i>”, which was provided by the non-Jewish government to a Jew in order to sell certain wines for a period of three years.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 36.</i> For Maharshal, the validity of such a leasing agreement, which serves as an example of <i>davar she-yesh bo mamash</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Such an agreement is equally an illustration of acquiring a <i>davar she-lo ba le-olam</i>, something which is not yet in existence,</i> is based upon either <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i> (the law of the kingdom is the law) and/or <i>kinyan situmta</i> (a commercial practice of acquisition). In other words, despite the fact that the leasing agreement is bereft of <i>halakhic</i> tangibility, this <i>arenda</i> is recognized either due to the fact that the governing civil law confers validity and/or because the communal practice was to accept it.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Whether Maharshal requires that the leasing agreement pass <i>halakhic</i> muster based upon its validity by law and/or commercial practice is an open question. See Kleinman, <i>supra n. 18, at</i> 300–301.</i> Maharshal opines that a leasing agreement, despite its lack of tangibility, will be <i>halakhically</i> recognized as an avenue of acquisition. Maharshal’s position does not stand as a singular opinion regarding the validity of acquiring matters of no tangibility. Numerous <i>Poskim</i> have either validated such matters based upon <i>situmta</i> or the governing law.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:225; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah,</i> <i>Mahadura Tinyana, HM</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Maharshdam, HM</i> 386; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim, HM</i> 2:26; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, Bi’urim</i> 201:1; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:46; <i>Torat Hayyim</i> 1:25; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA HM</i> 212:1–2.</i> Consequently, the <i>beit din</i> rules that professional goodwill is a property interest which can therefore be valued as an asset to be addressed in a divorce situation.
Though <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i> and <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> serve as avenues for validating professional goodwill as a property interest, personal goodwill is treated differently. As R. Yanai states briefly,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 8247802, supra n. 50.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">. . . It is clear that the partnership ceases at the moment that the <i>get</i> is delivered by the husband to the wife . . . even if we would want to recognize the couple as partners in regard to everything (obviously based on the law . . . or <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, rather than by dint of Jewish law . . .) for the purpose of personal goodwill—i.e. the mutual lien of the couple regarding their respective incomes. Clearly, the partnership ceased with the giving of the <i>get</i>. The <i>get</i> dissolved the marital ties and therefore also dissolved the sharing (<i>shibud</i>) of the couple regarding their respective incomes.</span>
In contradistinction to civil courts, who may be ready and willing to value personal goodwill that entails future entitlements—namely, earning potential relating to post-divorce years, <i>Halakhah</i> refuses to validate such entitlements given that the partnership of marriage ceases at the time of divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Except for a few instances of paying off the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, paying child support, or volunteering to support his ex-wife through a third party after consummating the divorce, there is “a clean break” once a <i>get</i> is in place. See File 1887241, Netanya Regional Beit Din, <i>Ploni v</i>. <i>Plonit</i>, February 1, 2010.</i>
Moreover, the Netanya Regional Beit Din opines that <i>hilkhot hithayivut</i> (undertaking obligations) serve as the grounds for denying entitlement to this expected income. In the frequently-cited ruling, Rambam rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Mehira</i>, 22:13–14.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A person cannot transfer ownership neither through a sale nor through a gift concerning an object unless it has substance. If it has no substance, ownership of it cannot be transferred.</span>
How? A person cannot transfer ownership of the fragrance of an apple, the taste of honey, the color of crystal or the like. Therefore, when a person [desires to] transfer ownership of [the right] to consume the fruits of the date palm or dwelling in a house, he has not acquired it until he transfers the actual house to reside in it or the tree to partake of its fruits.
To state it differently, one cannot transfer sensory pleasure, such as visual enjoyment, to another individual. Consequently, dealing with the laws of sales, Rambam rules that the transferring of monetary privileges, such as the right to dwell in a place or to consume fruit, will be ineffective where the transfer of ownership is not executed with the actual object (i.e. the home or the tree), due to the fact that one is attempting to accomplish transference on a <i>davar she-ein bo mamash</i>, i.e. something lacking tangibility. As we mentioned, a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of transfer), such as an exchange of an object for money, requires an object—something that has substance. The right to dwell in a place or a right to partake of fruit is intangible.
Dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of entitlement, Rambam rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 10:15.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a person who is critically ill says “let this individual reside in the house,” or “let this person consume the fruits of this palm tree,” his words are ineffective since he did not transfer an object of substance. For living and eating are similar to speech and sleep, which cannot be acquired. However, if he said, ‘give this house to this individual in order for him to live there for a certain amount of time’ or ‘give the palm tree to this individual in order that he may partake of its fruits’, his words are effective because he transferred the entity itself with the fruits and the entity is tangible . . .</span>
Seemingly, Rambam has simply reiterated the point that he states earlier in the laws of sales, namely the requirement of tangibility prior to transferring an object from one person to another. But, in fact, the fact patterns are readily distinguishable and therefore communicate two different conclusions. Whereas in the laws of sales, we are dealing with transference of the taste of honey and an apple as an illustration of a <i>davar she-ein bo mamash</i> which cannot be acquired, in the laws of entitlement we are addressing the ineffectiveness of the transference of words and sleep. Whereas in the laws of entitlement we focus upon a person that “will eat fruits” in the future, in the laws of sales we address the consumption of fruits. In other words, whereas the laws of sales addresses the prerequisite of tangibility prior to transferring an object and therefore transference of the <i>benefit</i> of eating is ineffective, the laws of entitlement teach us that one cannot transfer the performance of an <i>action</i>, such as offering to allow a person to eat fruits for a period of time, similar to hearing and sleep—which is nontransferable due to the absence of tangibility. As Rambam decides elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Mehira</i> 5:14.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Matters that lack substance, a <i>kinyan</i> is ineffective. How? If one writes in a document . . . that he will engage in business with another person or they will divide up a field between themselves or they will establish a trade partnership . . . this is a <i>kinyan devarim</i> (an undertaking of words) and is ineffective because he did not transfer to him a specified thing.</span>
To create a partnership, an intangible action, such as an exchange of words, will not suffice. As Rambam reiterates in the <i>halakhot</i> of partnership,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Sheluhin ve-Shutafin</i> 4:2.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When craftsmen join together in a trade partnership, even though they perform a <i>kinyan</i> with each other, they do not become partners. How? If two tailors or two weavers stipulate between themselves that whatever either of them earns will be divided between them equally, there is no partnership. For a person cannot transfer ownership of something which is not yet in existence.</span>
However, if they took their own clothing, sewed it . . . and weaved it and became partners through their respective assets they are partners . . .
Here again, the performance of an action, such as creating a partnership, without an accompanying <i>kinyan</i> that imparts “substance” to the transaction is <i>halakhically</i> ineffective.
On the basis of the foregoing, we can now readily understand why Maharshal invokes <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i> and <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> in order to validate a leasing agreement. Clearly, a leasing agreement, in accordance with Rambam’s perspective, is no different than individuals who verbally agree to a partnership or the transference of honey and an apple. In all instances, the absence of tangibility precludes any transference. As such, the only solution is Maharshal’s, namely the <i>halakhic</i> recognition of a norm from <i>outside</i> the system via the avenue of <i>dina demalkhuta dina</i> and <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>.
On the other hand, regarding professional goodwill, one can clearly state that transference of it is effective because one is transferring the actual business enterprise accompanied by its reputation, which is akin to transferring a tree with its fruits.
However, personal goodwill, which entails an individual’s potential earning capacity, lacks tangibility and therefore cannot be transferred at the time of divorce.
Seemingly, R. Yanai’s conclusion based upon Rambam’s rulings is open to challenge by various contemporary <i>Poskim</i> who recognize the notion that an individual Jew may own his ideas, sound recordings, etc. despite the absence of tangibility. Prior to modern times, R. Shaul Nathanson, a nineteenth-century decisor residing in the Lvov—a center for Hebrew book publishing—who was aware that the governing civil law recognizes the idea of copyright, exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i> 1:44</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let not our perfect Torah be thought of as not being at least equal to their idle conversation, which is something that reason rejects . . .</span>
<i>Sevara</i> (<i>halakhic</i> logic), rather than accepting the law of the land, inexorably led R. Nathanson to his ruling that copyright protection is valid in the eyes of <i>Halakhah</i>. Explicitly or implicitly, contemporary Rabbis Elyashiv, Feinstein, Y. Weiss, and L. Wosner agree with his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">N. Weisfish, <i>Mishnat Zekhuyot ha-Yotzer</i> 115; <i>Iggerot Moshe, Orah Hayyim</i> (hereafter: <i>OH</i>) 4:40 (19), <i>YD</i> 3:91; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 9:153, <i>Likkutim</i> 169; <i>Emek ha-Mishpat</i> (in the name of R. Wosner), vol. 4, 341.</i> Accordingly, if one recognizes a person’s creations, which in many instances are intangible, one would equally classify personal goodwill as marital property and therefore subject to division.
However, upon a review of <i>teshuvot</i> and <i>haskamot</i> (approbations in books) that address this issue, one finds that the majority of <i>Poskim</i> advanced other perspectives while implicitly rejecting the aforementioned view of some of the leading contemporary <i>Poskim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">N. Rakover, <i>Zekhut ha-Yotzrim be-Mekorot ha-Yehudim</i>, (Jerusalem, 1991).</i> One approach is based upon the laws of <i>hasagat gevul</i> (economic competition).<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema</i> 10; <i>Teshuvot Shem Arye</i>h, vol. 1, <i>HM</i> 20</i> Generally speaking, <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes the right of an individual to open up a business that may be in competition with an existing commercial establishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 5:3; <i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> 79; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenburg</i>, Prague ed., 4:677; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 2, <i>HM</i> 39–40; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, HM</i> 27</i> Whereas during Talmudic and medieval times, these laws were applied within the context of a particular geographical locale, today, with a free market economy, no restrictions are to be applied to new commercial enterprises. Whereas during Talmudic times we address “the alleyway”,<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Batra</i> 21b; see infra n. 104 and supra notes 99–100.</i> and in modern times we have addressed “the neighborhood”,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:3</i> today we focus upon cyberspace.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 407.</i>That being said, according to many <i>Poskim</i>, if the entry by the competitor will cause customers to discontinue their patronage of the entrenched firm, such conduct will be prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ri me-Gash, Bava Batra</i> 21b; <i>Mordekhai</i> (in the name of Aviasaf) <i>Bava Batra</i> 516; <i>Rema</i>, supra n. 99; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, HM</i> 79; <i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim, HM</i> 3:20; <i>Iggerot Moshe, HM</i> 38.</i> Consequently, there is a prohibition against the publication of a work while copies of an earlier printing by another publisher were still available for purchase. Allowing the competitor to enter the marketplace will effectively deprive the original firm of his investment and livelihood.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 99.</i> In effect, just as an individual’s toil and effort is protected in establishing a business venture, an author’s discovery or invention is similarly recognized due to his investment of time and energy.
Others invoke the Talmudic rule that if B derives a benefit from A, and A suffers a loss, B must compensate A for the value of the benefit from his property, otherwise known as “<i>zeh neheneh ve-zeh haseir—hayyav</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 20a</i> This rule was extended to encompass a situation where B derives benefit from A’s expenditure.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadurah Tinyana HM</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:157</i> Accordingly, some contemporary decisors contend that this <i>zeh neheneh</i> rule proscribes an individual from copying A’s original published work.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">N. Bar Ilan, “Copying Books and Cassette Tapes,” (Hebrew) 7 <i>Tehumin</i> 360 (5756)</i> R. Zalman N. Goldberg, another contemporary <i>Posek</i>, endorses the implementation of a reserve clause (<i>shiyur</i>), whereby A sells his work, tape, or software to B but specifically excludes from the sale the right to copy the work. Should B proceed to copy it, it is deemed misappropriation (<i>gezel</i>) and therefore B is responsible to compensate A.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Z. N. Goldberg, “Copying from a Cassette without the Owner’s Permission,“ (Hebrew) 6 <i>Tehumin</i> 185 (5755).</i> Finally, some contend that a person’s right to his works is based upon the governing civil law.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, YD</i> 2:75, <i>HM</i> 80; <i>Teshuvot Hitorerut Teshuvah</i> 1:232</i>
In short, the common denominator of these varying positions is that copyright under <i>halakhah</i> entails protection against unfair competition, unjust enrichment, the enforcement of a reserve clause in a sale, and applicable secular law, rather that the right of ownership. In other words, a person’s creations are protected based upon indigenous <i>halakhic</i> doctrines rather the right of ownership. Implicit, and sometimes explicit, in this approach is the inability to recognize incorporeal things. Consequently, such as a posture is in <i>halakhic</i> alignment with R. Yana’s conclusion that personal goodwill is intangible and therefore isn’t a marital property interest that may be divided upon divorce.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>D. Civil marriage and the duty to pay spousal support</b></span>
Assume an Israeli Jewish man and Israeli Jewish woman were civilly married in Cyprus and subsequently the couple desires a divorce to be executed by an Israeli rabbinical court. Additionally, the wife petitions the <i>beit din</i> to address her spouse’s nonpayment of maintenance. How would a <i>beit din</i> decide this issue? <i>Halakhic</i> marriage consists of two separate acts, <i>kiddushin</i> (betrothal) and <i>nissuin</i> (the marriage ceremony). These components have been described in contemporary times in the following fashion,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">N. Frimer and D. Frimer, “Reform Marriages in Contemporary <i>Halakhic Responsa</i>,” 21 <i>Tradition</i> 9 (1984)</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In practical terms, <i>kiddushin</i> as the primary state of Jewish marriage can be . . . normatively constituted through the presence of five <i>halakhic</i> elements . . . at the helm stands <i>kavanah</i> (intention). But intention for what? Two divergent interpretations emerge . . . according to one authority, the intent of the couple must be for at least the most minimal and natural characteristics of the marital experience . . . that decision, however, must also include the stipulation that the wife shall be exclusively related to her husband and prohibited to all others. From this intent of <i>le-sheim ishut</i> (exclusivity for the husband –AYW) will then flow all other authority, which will bestow legitimacy upon the formal ceremony and simultaneously form the foundation of the <i>kiddushin</i>. The other view finds the natural standard utterly inadequate . . . what then, shall be the normative canon for <i>kavanah</i>? It must be <i>le-kiddushei Torah</i> or <i>le-sheim kiddushin</i> . . .</span>
The <i>kiddushin</i> relationship is a mutually agreed-upon tie that establishes a personal status, namely that of a <i>mekudeshet</i> (a woman designated for a particular man and prohibited to all others).<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 2b</i> Simultaneously, the act of betrothal also creates financial obligations that will be transformed into spousal duties upon the completion of the marriage ceremony, which constitutes <i>nissuin</i>. As R. Moshe Sofer exclaims,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 131.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If spousal maintenance is absent, there is no marital relationship (<i>ishut</i>)!</span>
Spousal maintenance is a unique monetary obligation that arises from the status of being in a marital relationship.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">See further, this writer’s “Contractual Consequences of Cohabitation in American Law and Jewish Law, “ (hereafter: Cohabitation) 20 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 278, 306–308 (2013).</i>
The emerging question is whether <i>Halakhah</i> will recognize a civil marriage. Despite the absence of a formal ceremony of <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>nissuin</i>, a few <i>Poskim</i>, such as R. Yosef Rozanne, R. Yehuda Zirelson, R. Yosef Henkin, and R. Menashe Klein argue that the engagement in conjugal relations creates a <i>halakhic</i> marriage and therefore a civil marriage is to be recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzofnat Pa’aneiah</i>, Dvinsk ed., 1:1–4; <i>Teshuvot Ma’arkhei Lev</i> 87; <i>Teshuvot Ibra</i> 3; <i>Lev Ibra</i> 12–20; <i>Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly of America</i>, vol. 5, 474–486 (1939).</i> Adopting such an approach led R. Ben-Zion Uziel to the conclusion that a husband ought to be obligated to support his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in R. Avraham Rodner, <i>Mishpetei Ishut</i> (Jerusalem, 1949), p. 140 reprinted in <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel, EH</i> 77.</i>
Although civil marriage does not entail the execution of <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>nissuin</i>, which conventionally creates monetary obligations—including a husband’s duty to support his wife, R. Zalman N. Goldberg nonetheless contends that spousal maintenance is an implied condition of living together, whether civilly married or as cohabitating partners. In the context of civil marriage or cohabitation, the husband promises to care and provide for his wife. On the strength of these promises, she performs certain services for her husband, including housekeeping, cooking, offering emotional support, and raising their children. As R. Goldberg notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Z. Goldberg, “The Guidelines for the Support Obligation, Clothing, and an Apartment,” (Hebrew), 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 294, 314 (5763). See also, idem, “The Maintenance Obligation in Civil Marriage,” (Hebrew) 24 <i>Tehumin</i> 188 (5764). For a critique, see File no. 764411/1, Netanya Regional Beit Din, October 3, 2010.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When one marries a woman civilly, one must follow how marriage is practiced with regard to spousal maintenance and other property matters. It is akin to how when one hires workers one follows the custom of supporting them, even though it is not explicitly mentioned . . .</span>
Just as there is an implied condition to employ an individual based upon conventional custom, similarly the monetary duties relating to a civil marriage are grounded in custom. And the Tiberias Regional Beit Din endorses his approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 80581211, Tiberias Regional Beit Din, June 24, 2009.</i>
However, most <i>battei din</i> fail to adopt R. Goldberg’s posture. Moreover, the majority of <i>Poskim</i>, including R. Moshe Schick, R. Yitzhak Schmelkes, R. Mordekhai Winkler, as well as most contemporary <i>Poskim</i>, contend that betrothal is predicated upon the intent to establish a relationship of <i>ishut</i>, which entails compliance with the laws of family purity and avoidance of licentious behavior. Therefore civil marriage that is executed by non-<i>halakhah</i>-observant people lacks validity.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 26; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, EH</i> 29; <i>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai, EH</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov,</i> <i>EH</i> 69 (=1:1 in old edition); <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i> 2:31; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 1:27, 2:19; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 54; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 3:127; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 73–75; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 1, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 10; File no. 5832361, Haifa Regional Beit Din, June 2, 2010; File no. 8663811, Netanya Regional Beit Din, November 11, 2012; File no. 8915491, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, March 5, 2013; File no. 4488663, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, July 11, 2013. See further, Cohabitation, supra n. 114, at 313–315.</i> Clearly, the existence of this controversy whether civil marriage is <i>halakhically</i> recognized is at best a <i>safek</i> (a doubt) and when we have a <i>safek</i> one does not extract money from one of the parties. Hence, it is unsurprising that the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol in 1960 exempted the husband who had undertaken a civil marriage from spousal support.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:370, 378–379.Alternatively,rules Rabbi Elyashiv that given the marital tie between the parties was not created <i>le’shem ishut</i> (loosely translated- <i>halakhic</i> marriage) therefore there does not exist a support obligation. See <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 4:168.</i> And in 2013, another <i>beit din</i> agreed with their conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 4488663, supra n. 119.</i>
However, another more acceptable approach has emerged from a decision handed down decades ago. In 1962, addressing the situation of two Jews who were married civilly in Russia in 1942 and were seeking a divorce in the Rehovot Regional Beit Din, the panel obligated the husband to make spousal support payments.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 5:124.</i> Despite the fact that the panel subscribed to the majority opinion that a civil marriage is not to be viewed as a <i>halakhic</i> marriage, nonetheless the <i>beit din</i> offered the following rationale for mandating the husband to pay maintenance. Addressing verbal monetary agreements executed between the prospective in-laws during the time of the <i>shiddukhin</i> (engagement), the Talmud teaches us,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 102a-b.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">R. Giddal said in the name of Rav: “How much are you giving to your son?” [and the other replies –AYW] “Such and such a sum”, and [when the other asks –AYW], “How much are you giving to your daughter?” [the first replies –AYW] ”Such and such a sum”, [and on the basis of this conversation –AYW] a betrothal was finalized. These are the matters in which <i>kinyan</i> is finalized by verbal agreement . . . owing to the pleasure of the establishment of a family tie they decide to allow each other the full effectiveness of a <i>kinyan</i>.</span>
In short, according to R. Giddal one can have a meeting of the minds (<i>gemirat da’at</i>) between prospective in-laws without the execution of a <i>kinyan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">For further discussion of this position, see this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality,</i> vol.<i> 2</i>, chapter 2.</i> In accordance with certain <i>Poskim</i>, this ruling is a piece of rabbinic legislation that in effect is limited to verbal agreements consummated during engagement; for other authorities it also encompasses other matters. Invoking the latter perspective, the Rehovot <i>beit din</i> suggests that the scope of R. Giddal’s teaching serves to explain a well-known sixteenth-century controversy focusing upon the claim of Hannah Graces Mendes who was one of the Marrano Jews from Portugal. She moved to Turkey and claimed half of her husband’s estate in accordance with the custom in Portugal, the place of her marriage. The dispute centered on the validity of a premarital agreement that was finalized between two Jews prior to a marriage that was conducted and solemnized in pursuance to civil law. So the issue that emerges is whether the Marrano husband had obligated himself to support his civilly married wife in accordance to the local custom based on R. Giddal’s teaching that validates verbal agreements. If the grounds of his ruling are based upon rabbinic legislation, then this enactment is limited to Jews who undertake a <i>halakhic</i> marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avkat Rokhel</i> 80–81.</i> Therefore, there would lack a foundational basis for validating the Portuguese custom regarding estate distribution to Ms. Mendes. On the other hand, other <i>Poskim</i> claim that “the pleasure of the establishment of a family tie”, which serves as grounds for <i>gemirat da’at</i>, should be no worse than the effectiveness of undertaking an obligation based upon the governing civil law, namely a <i>kinyan situmta</i>. Consequently, since Portuguese law recognizes that a widow is entitled to half of her husband’s estate, <i>Halakhah</i> validates the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mabit</i>, supra n. 89; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 327; Teshuvot <i>Maharbil</i> 2:23.</i> Relying upon the latter position, the Rehovot <i>beit din</i> affirms the divorcing wife’s right to receive spousal support payments from her husband due to the fact that <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes Russian law concerning this matter. Decades later, addressing the same question, a Netanya <i>beit din</i> composed of the same panel of <i>dayanim</i> agreed with this position on two separate occasions.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 7644111, Netanya Regional Beit Din, October 3, 2010; File no. 8891001, Netanya Regional Beit Din, April 2, 2014.</i> Whereas the Rehovot <i>beit din</i> invokes its ruling based upon a Russian practice, the two Netanya <i>beit din</i> rulings implicitly accept that an Israeli Supreme Court decision of 2003 serves as the genesis of an emerging <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> that imparted recognition of civil marriages.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">For the Israeli ruling, see Bagatz 2232/03, <i>Ploni v.

Whereas the Rehovot <i>beit din</i> arrives at its conclusion without examining whether affirming the <i>minhag ha-medinah</i> regarding awarding spousal support of a civilly married wife may be impacted by the element of <i>issur</i>, the Netanya <i>beit din</i> painstakingly demonstrates the cogency of the Rehovot <i>beit din’s</i> reliance upon the Mendes matter in order to reach its ruling.
In order for a <i>minhag</i> to pass <i>halakhic</i> muster, the customary behavior cannot abrogate <i>issur ve-hetter</i> (ritual matters). As we know, <i>minhag mevatel Halakhah</i> (custom supersedes the law) only with regard to monetary issues.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi <i>Bava Metzia</i> 7:1</i> Seemingly, Rashba’s decision, which is adopted by Rema,<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 6:254; <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 369:11</i> that rejects the acceptance of the <i>minhag</i> that a grandfather is the heir to his grandchild’s estate instead of his father, flies in the face of those <i>Poskim</i> who recognize a wife’s entitlement to support from her husband based upon a Portuguese custom.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying n. 123.</i> Astutely, the Netanya <i>beit din</i> distinguishes between the two situations. Regarding Rashba’s scenario, the <i>beit din</i> argues that we are addressing a <i>minhag</i> that changes <i>hilkhot yerushah</i>, namely that a grandfather should inherit his grandchild’s estate rather than his father. Such customary behavior cannot be recognized because it engages in the commission of an <i>issur</i>, namely changing the <i>Halakhah</i> of inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality, vol.</i> 2, chapter two.</i> On the other hand, the <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to legitimating a custom whereby a husband undertakes personal obligations, including spousal support of his civilly married wife, does not entail the violation of an <i>issur</i>. As such, even though generally a spousal support duty emerging from the establishment of a <i>halakhic</i> marriage is the prescribed avenue of imparting recognition for this monetary duty, nonetheless the <i>beit din</i> concluded that we recognize a <i>minhag</i> whereby monetary obligations emerge from marital ties, even though a civil marriage, according to the majority view, is an invalid form of creating such ties. Therefore, whereas in this case <i>minhag</i> is <i>mevatel Halakhah,</i> in the former situation, the presence of the violation of an <i>issur</i> preempts the possibility that <i>minhag</i> will be determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 7644111, supra n. 127.</i>
Alternatively, the Netanya <i>beit din</i> contends that the rule of <i>minhag mevatel Halakhah</i> is inapplicable in our situation. Generally, the rule in <i>yerushah</i> matters is operative in cases where the customary behavior redistributes the entire inheritance of the Torah heir to a non-Torah heir. However, if the <i>minhag</i> only divests a portion of the Torah heir, then the <i>minhag</i> is not tainted by an <i>issur</i><sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 52:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 8. See further, <i>Rabbinic Authority, vol. 2</i>, chapter 2.</i>. Consequently, relying upon the Portuguese practice, the widow in the Mendes estate matter was entitled to receive half of her husband’s estate. Had she received the entire estate, the transfer would have been <i>halakhically</i> invalid. On the other hand, addressing a practice of an entire divesture of an estate from a Torah heir leads Rashba to the conclusion that such a <i>minhag</i> lacked validity and therefore such a transfer ought not to be recognized.
Based upon the foregoing, despite the rejection of the institution of a civil marriage as a form of <i>halakhic</i> marriage, nevertheless, as we have seen, some <i>battei din</i> will validate monetary rights created by this relationship based upon invoking <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>.
In conclusion, our presentation shows how many contemporary Israeli rabbinical courts treat various issues regarding divorce radically differently from how the eighteenth-century <i>beit din</i> of Metz dealt with these matters. As we have seen, the Metz rabbinical court resolves the issues of the division of marital assets through the Talmudic prism of <i>nikhsei melog</i> and <i>nikhsei tzon barzel</i>. Over a century later, some Israeli <i>battei din</i>s implicitly follow in their footsteps. Unwilling to give <i>halakhic</i> receptivity to the governing Israeli law, these rabbinic panels impart <i>halakhic</i> credence to parties willing to have their matters resolved in accordance with Israeli law. By mandating that a couple execute a <i>kinyan</i> demonstrating their willingness to be governed by Israeli law,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 42–43.</i> a <i>beit din</i> has accomplished two things. Firstly, the parties’ expectations to have their issues resolved according to civil law have been satisfied. Secondly, the <i>beit din</i> is able to deal with the matters without halakhically recognizing the prevailing civil law as a reflection of <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>. As we mentioned, some <i>dayanim</i> rejected this <i>minhag</i> as invalid due to the fact rabbinic authorities have failed to endorse it.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 57.</i> Others implicitly accept the notion articulated by Dayan Uriel Lavi, <i>av beit din</i> of Tzfat Regional Beit Din,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">U. Lavi, “The Division of Marital Assets in accordance with the law of monetary relations between spouse,” (Hebrew), <i>Kenas ha-Dayyanim</i>, 57, 71, 74 (5770).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The source of the authority (the validation –AYW) is the <i>kinyan</i> (the symbolic act for undertaking the obligation) rather than the law.</span>
Furthermore, lurking behind their steadfast opposition to validating the <i>minhag</i> is that the <i>minhag</i> is ideologically aligned and socially associated with feminism and egalitarianism, which are values antithetical to <i>Halakhah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s, “Varying Approaches Towards the Division of Matrimonial Property Upon Divorce” (Hebrew) 70–71 <i>ha-Darom</i>, 129, 140–141 (5761).</i>As Dayan Avraham Sherman notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">A. Sherman, “The Law of Partnership is not Grounded in Jewish Law,” (Hebrew) 19 <i>Tehumin</i> 205,214 (5759).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The law of partnership has been transformed into a legal mechanism in order to achieve a social purpose. It is intended to attain social justice based upon equality between the sexes.</span>
However, upon our review, we found that there were many <i>battei din</i> that are prepared to validate this secular law as <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>. The threshold concern is to initially determine whether the practice is clear, widespread, and has transpired at least three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 33; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:226; <i>MT, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 23:12; <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, HM</i> 42:2; <i>Teshuvot Maharik ha-Hadashot</i> 65; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 342; <i>Rema, SA, HM</i> 331:1</i> Once “the <i>minhag</i> is established”, then <i>battei din</i> have proceeded to assess whether this practice ought to be grounds to resolve pending divorce issues. For example, numerous <i>battei din</i> have been willing to divide up assets upon divorce in accordance with Israeli community property principles, which is <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>. Moreover, in cases where the wife is awarded significant sums of money and/or real estate, numerous panels have concluded that the husband is exempt from remitting the value of the <i>ketubah</i> to his wife. Said conclusion is not simply based upon the <i>sevara</i> that such an award is a deterrent to becoming divorced and therefore there would be no basis for awarding the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, which equally was instituted in order to preempt the possibility of a rash divorce. On the contrary, as we demonstrated, the <i>hilkhot shekhiv mei-ra</i> direct a <i>beit din</i> to render such a judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">See supra notes 75–77.</i> However, in 2013 alone, despite the <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>, there were over half a dozen <i>battei din</i> that mandate that the husband pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i> with figures ranging from 180,000 <i>shekalim</i> to two million <i>shekalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">See D. Nisani, <i>Parshat ha-Shavua</i> no. 431, Israel’s Ministry of Justice, 5774, n. 13.</i>
On the other hand, though a <i>beit din</i> could have invoked personal good will as a marital interest that ought to be subject to community property distribution based upon <i>minhag,</i> nonetheless the <i>beit din</i>—in a painstakingly detailed discussion—rejected such a conclusion based upon the <i>halakhot</i> of undertaking obligations. Finally, though according to the majority of <i>Poskim,</i> a civil marriage does not conform to the tenets of <i>halakhic</i> marriage—which would create a duty, among others, to support one’s spouse—nonetheless, based upon <i>minhag</i>, the panel arrived at the conclusion that a civilly married husband is obligated to support his civilly married wife. Attuned to the fact that the effectiveness of a <i>minhag</i> is contingent upon the fact that it does not impinge on any i<i>ssurim</i>, the panel clarified why this practice is to be validated.
In sum, despite the fact that <i>hezkat shituf</i>—which emerges from various 1960 Israeli Supreme Court decisions and was subsequently ratified by the Knesset in 1973 in the form of legislation serve as the backdrop for <i>minhag ha-medinah</i>—is based upon the values of egalitarianism and feminism. Whereas, the rulings of the Metz Beit Din imbibe the norms of the classical matrimonial property system found in the Talmud, in many instances contemporary Israeli <i>battei din</i> choose to employ <i>minhag</i> as the vehicle for resolving issues emerging from a divorce situation.

Chapter 5; Two types of Bittul Kiddushin; Kiddushei Ta'ut and Umdana

<i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i> and <i>Umdana</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>1. <i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i> (Mistaken Betrothal)</b></span>
One of the solutions increasingly offered by many authorities to address the situation known as the plight of “the modern-day <i>agunah</i>”, whereby a husband refuses to grant a <i>get</i> to his wife, is for a <i>beit din</i> or a <i>posek</i> (an arbiter) to engage <i>in</i> “<i>bittul kiddushin</i>” (voiding the marriage).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For purposes of clarity, <i>bittul kiddushin</i> is to be distinguished from <i>hafka’at kiddushin</i> (annulling a marriage). For the most comprehensive treatment of the proscription of <i>dayan’s</i> inability to nullify a marriage that is <i>halakhically</i> valid without the husband giving and the wife receiving a <i>get</i>, see E. Shochetman, “Annulment of Marriage—A Possible Way of Solving the Problem of Refusal to Provide a <i>Get</i>?” (Hebrew) 20 <i>Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri</i> 349–398 (1997).<br>Moreover, invoking the term “<i>hafka’at kiddushin”</i> should not be confused with <i>bittul kiddushin</i>, in which a <i>Posek</i> is empowered to void a marriage by deploying the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut, umdana</i> or by invalidating the establishment of <i>kiddushin</i>— e.g. in a case where there were not two witnesses or where the <i>kiddushin</i> occurred in the presence of invalid witnesses. “<i>Hafka’at kiddushin</i>”, on the other hand as used in contemporary parlance, entails retroactively annulling the marriage of a recalcitrant husband who refuses to give a <i>get</i> by virtue of his authority.<br>What defines a wife as an <i>agunah</i> is beyond the scope of our presentation.<br>Whether one requires a <i>beit din</i> of three or one rabbi to void a marriage, see supra. the preface.</i> <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes two avenues of voiding a marriage retroactively. The first way is to invoke an <i>umdana</i> (an assessed expectation) that “<i>ada’ata de-hakhi lo kidshah nafshah</i>” (“on this assumption she did not betroth herself”). For example, a wife didn’t expect to live with an apostate or a mentally dysfunctional individual. The alternative method is based upon an error in the initial creation of the marriage known as “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>” (mistaken betrothal),<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For our presentation I knowingly refer to mistaken betrothal and mistaken marriage as synonymous, even though the concepts are <i>halakhically</i> different.</i> by means of which one may void the marriage. In both situations, assuming certain conditions are obtained, the wife is free to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i> according to various <i>Poskim</i>. In our presentation, we will be examining <i>umdana</i> and <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
Let us begin by examining the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, as it relates to grave preexisting marital flaws in the husband’s personality. Prior to a wife invoking the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage retroactively and claim there was an error in the creation of the marriage, three preconditions must have been obtained:
(1) The husband’s defect must be a major one (a <i>mum gadol</i>), such as sexual impotency, refusing to have children, insanity, homosexuality, apostasy, a marital expectation communicated by the prospective husband prior to the marriage which turns out to be a misrepresentation, engaging in criminal behavior—such as business fraud and pandering prostitutes or exposing one’s mate to a contagious disease such as syphilis or HIV, but only if such a flaw was present prior to the onset of the marriage. All of the aforementioned examples of a husband’s flaws have been characterized by one or more authorities as a <i>mum gadol</i>. Whether a particular defect serves as a major defect and therefore grounds for voiding a marriage is subject to the discretion of an arbiter or <i>beit din</i>. Consequently, there will be a difference of opinion concerning the severity and the magnitude of the defect that is required to void the marriage. Clearly, as R. Hayyim Berlin of the nineteenth century and Rabbi Shalom Messas of the twentieth century duly note, one must be concerned with “the slippery slope”, lest a decisor allow an insignificant flaw such as a husband’s periodic outbursts of anger, being a spendthrift, or stinginess as grounds to void the marriage. In effect, <i>bittul kiddushin</i> under such conditions would result in undermining the institution of <i>halakhic</i> marriage and therefore they refuse to employ such a tool!<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Nishmat Hayyim</i> 87 (126); <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 27. Despite Rabbis Berlin’s and Messas’s concern for the slippery slope argument, nonetheless in their subsequent rulings, they implement the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> under certain conditions. See infra n. 10.<br>As we mentioned, there are cases where a certain flaw may be subject to a difference of opinion whether it is to be considered a “<i>mum gadol</i>” or not. For example, whereas Beit ha-Levi, infra n. 4 views epilepsy as a grave defect, R. Spektor argues that this disease is curable and therefore it is to be classified as a minor flaw. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> vol. 1 <i>EH</i> 23. Others have adopted his approach. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Yad Dovid</i>, infra n. 31; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 8:239.<br>However, there are<i> Poskim</i> who would contend that a disease or a psychological condition may be classified as a major defect even if it is curable. See e.g. File no. 870175/4, infra n. 10, at 46, which deals with a schizophrenic husband. See also, infra n. 10.<br>Generally speaking, what constitutes “a<i> mum gadol</i>” is within the <i>beit din</i>’s discretionary judgment. See <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av, EH</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Ohel Moshe</i> (Zweig) vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 123(8).Whether a particular physiological defect or behavioral flaw constitutes a <i>mum</i> is based upon logic and/or a societal determination. See File no. 1-22-1510, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, September 7, 2004.<br>For additional reasons to reject voiding the marriage based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, see infra Chapter 8(f).</i>
(2) The wife must be unaware of the defect prior to the inception of the marriage and must only discover it after the marriage. On the other hand, if, for example, a husband commits adultery or contracts Alzheimer’s during the marriage, though both may be characterized as a <i>mum gadol</i> significantly impairing the matrimonial relationship, there would nevertheless be no grounds for a wife’s claim that the marriage was consummated in error because the conduct or disease respectively occurred after the onset of the marriage.
(3) Finally, upon a wife’s awareness of the major latent defect that her husband may have intentionally or unintentionally failed to disclose to her, she must decide to leave the marriage. Regarding this condition, whether she must immediately leave the marriage or not is subject to debate. According to Mishnah Torah, Tur, Beit Yosef, Rema, R. Akiva Eiger, R. Yehezkel Abramski, R. Hayyim Zimbalist, R. Shalom Messas, and some Israeli <i>battei din</i>, the wife must discontinue engaging in conjugal relations and receiving support from him and she must immediately leave the marriage. On the other hand, in pursuance to Arukh Hashulhan and Rabbis Kook and Messas, she may continue to live with him provided it isn’t for an extended period of time. For R. Yosef Baer Soloveitchik, R. Naftali Berlin, R. Klatzkin, R. Yehiel Weinberg, R. Binyamin Weiss, and Dayan Boaron—who deal with a fact pattern that she continues to live with him an extended period of time after the disclosure and do not raise such a mandate of opting immediately out of the marriage—assume that she may live with him for an extended period of time without articulating the reasons for their position. Others, such as Rabbis Sholom Schwadron and Moshe Feinstein, Dayanim E. Goldschmidt, S. Karelitz, and Y. Bavliki, argue that she may continue to live with him provided she offers a reasonable explanation. For example, according to R. Shimon b. Zemah Duran, R. Elhanan Spector, R. Yehezkel Abramsky, R. Yehoshua Ehrenberg, and Dayanim Batzri, Rabinowitz, Algarbali, and Eliezrov, the need to provide material support for herself and her children or an attempt to cure her husband’s flaw may serve as reasonable explanations for remaining in the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i> (hereafter: <i>MT</i>), <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 25:11; <i>Tur and Beit Yosef, EH</i> 154; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:1; <i>Teshuvot R.

See also <i>Teshuvot Maharik ha-Hadashot</i> 24, where a wife may claim that she thought that she could live with her epileptic husband. However, after a lapse of time, she realized that she could not tolerate living with him and therefore had to leave the marriage. In such a situation, concludes R. Kolon, the wife’s claim is justified and therefore her husband’s disease is grounds for divorce. See infra Chapter 8(g) (end).<br>In fact, that the lapse of time from the wife’s discovery of the latent defect until the wife’s decision to leave the marriage isn’t to be construed as <i>mehilah</i> (accepting the defect) was equally learned from scenarios where the husband desires to be divorced a few years after discovering during his marriage a latent defect in his wife that existed prior to the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 4 in the name of <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16 and <i>Teshuvot Ohr Gadol</i> 1:5(12). For additional extrapolations from the <i>halakhot</i> of a wife’s flaws to the <i>halakhot</i> of a husband’s flaws, see infra notes 34–36.<br>See also <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, op. cit. and <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 38 regarding a husband’s flaw that entails impotency or castration, where the requirement of immediately leaving the marriage may not be a requirement for voiding the marriage.<br>The precedent for those who contend that upon discovering the latent flaw the wife must leave the marriage immediately can be found in the <i>halakhot</i> of<i> tenaim</i> (conditions). If prior to <i>kiddushin</i>, the wife conditions the marriage upon the fact that she will not discover defects and upon marriage she becomes aware of defects, then should she remain in the marriage she is considered <i>halakhically</i> married. See <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 117:19. <i>A fortiori</i>, when a wife discovers these latent flaws during the marriage, she cannot be freed without a <i>get</i>. Cf. others who argue that the marriage is a mistaken marriage and it is void under certain conditions even if she remains in the marriage for a period of time upon discovery of the defect. See R. Boaron, <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 5, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 11 in the name of Rashba and Ritva.<br>For those who contend that upon discovery of the <i>mum gadol</i>, one must refrain from engaging in conjugal relations and receiving support, see <i>Ketuvot</i> 75b; <i>Maggid Mishneh, MT, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 15:3, <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 232(3); <i>Bah, Tur, HM</i> 232(4); <i>Teshuvot Ohr Gadol</i> 1:5(14).<br>The fact that one can extrapolate from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>tenaim</i> to <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> does not necessarily mean that the definition of what constitutes a “<i>ta’ut</i>” by <i>kiddushin</i> is derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of<i> tenaim</i>. See the differing views of <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 51, 106 and <i>Hiddushei Beit ha-Levi</i> 3:3; File no. 1011498/1, Be’eir Sheva Regional Beit Din, May 10, 2015; File <i>Yuhasin</i> 178–73, Beit Din Yerushalayim.<br>Some of the above-cited <i>Poskim</i> who require that upon discovery of a major flaw one must leave the marriage are addressing the situation where the husband discovers the defect in his wife. But clearly, one can extrapolate from such a scenario to a case where a wife discovers a major defect in her husband. See supra n. 3 (end) and infra text accompanying notes 34–36.<br>Finally, the common denominator of those decisors who endorse <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as a tool to void a marriage agree that a prerequisite to its implementation is that the error preexisted the marriage. In fact, it would seem that both R. Feinstein and R. Eitan ben Levi extend Ramban’s understanding in their rulings. Addressing the case of a husband who only exhibited signs of homosexuality after the inception of the marriage, it was assumed without verification that he was gay even prior to the marriage and they freed the wife based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>! See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:113. Addressing the case of a husband who reneged on a premarital condition to refrain from assaulting his spouse, R. Eitan Y. ha-Levi invokes <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in a marital situation of a husband who exhibits physically abusive behavior that is life-threatening without even verifying that such a <i>mum</i> existed prior to the marriage! See <i>Shirat ben ha-Levi</i>, infra n. 8 and n. 45. One solution may be suggested based upon Ramban’s understanding that if a <i>mum</i> suddenly appears after the marriage and it is clear that this defect predated the marriage, then we can construe this situation as <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> without further verification. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 2b. We leave this matter for further deliberation. See infra n. 45.</i> Subsequently, should the particular reason(s) become inapplicable, the wife must immediately bolt the marriage. For example, if a wife discovers during the marriage that her husband is mentally dysfunctional, under certain conditions this behavior would be labeled as “a major defect” and therefore under certain circumstances the marriage may be voided. However, if the husband attempts to address the situation by attending therapy sessions and/or take medication and the situation improves; should he subsequently fail to give her a <i>get</i>, there would be no basis for her to advance a claim for <i>kiddushei ta’ut.</i> On the other hand, should the therapy and/or medication fail to address the situation, she must bolt the marriage immediately, and should her husband be recalcitrant regarding the <i>get</i> a rabbinic authority (or authorities) will determine if there are grounds to void the marriage based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.In short, assuming all three conditions have been met, such a marriage, which was consummated by the wife when she was unaware of her husband’s major defect, may be voided. As such, she is freed from the marriage without the receiving of a <i>get</i> from her husband.
Seemingly, this solution has no <i>halakhic</i> precedent. Firstly, should we allow voiding a marriage, people might err and think that “a wife may leave her husband without receiving a <i>get</i>”. Moreover, the Mishnah in Kiddushin clearly states that the dissolution of matrimonial ties is effected either through the delivery of a <i>get</i> by the husband to the wife or by the husband’s demise and our <i>Amoraim</i>, (Talmudic sages) as well as the authors of our classical restatements of <i>halakhah</i> such as Alfasi, Mishneh Torah, Tur, and Shulhan Arukh never authorize voiding a marriage retroactively based upon the existence of major latent defects found in a spouse without the delivery of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 14:146; <i>Rabbi Yosef Henkin, Perushei Ibra</i> 43, 46. For precedent for the inability to address an <i>igun</i> matter if the issue has not been addressed in the Talmud and <i>gaonic</i> rulings, see <i>Teshuvot Bah</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 21.</i> Lest one argue that silence regarding <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> does not imply opposition to this solution, this is contradicted by the fact that the Shulhan Arukh and others address the case of latent defects found in a wife and conclude, though the marriage is doubtful, there is a rabbinic requirement of <i>get le-humra</i> (as a precautionary measure).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 39:5; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 35:9; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 50; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 27; <i>Beit ha-Levi,</i> supra n.4; <i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79; File no. 861252/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, January 23, 2012. However, In contrast to a case where a discovery of a wife’s defects after the marriage mandates a <i>get le-humra</i>, contends Rabbi Tzvi Pesah Frank, in a situation of a husband’s failure to disclose prior to the marriage that he was mentally dysfunctional, one can employ the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and she is free to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi EH</i> 1:180.</i> The same conclusion ought to apply concerning discovery of hidden flaws found in the husband. Moreover, absent a prior <i>tenai</i> (stipulation) by the husband regarding his wife’s hidden defect, in pursuance to Shulhan Arukh’s ruling, the discovery of the flaw after the onset of marriage may not serve as a basis for <i>bittul kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 39: 3–4, 117: 4–5.</i> Consequently, it is understandable for some <i>Poskim</i> to conclude that if the wife advanced a <i>tenai</i> concerning the hidden defect prior to the marriage, upon discovery of the defect after the marriage a <i>get le-humra</i> would be required rabbinically; this would be no different than the situation of a husband who stipulates prior to the marriage regarding a wife’s latent flaw and upon marriage discovers the defect.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For those authorities who object to voiding a marriage based upon the failure of a husband to disclose a major defect prior to the marriage, see R.

See <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 20 (20–25). Cf. <i>Rav Pe’alim,</i> op.cit.<br>Arguably, some of the above-cited decisors concur with R.

See <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 67.<br>Even if the husband was unaware of the <i>mum gadol</i> and assuming other conditions are present, one may invoke “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”. See <i>Nishmat</i> <i>Hayyim</i>, op. cit.;<i>Teshuvot Ohel Moshe, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 123; <i>Teshuvot Even Shoham</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 20(22). <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, op. cit.<br>Moreover, if a husband fails to disclose prior to the marriage that he is an apostate, may we employ “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>” and void the marriage? This issue is subject to controversy. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah,</i> <i>Mahadura Kama EH 88,Mahadura Tinyana EH 80</i>; Y. Raizin, <i>Teshuvot She’erit</i> <i>Yisrael</i> 47;<i>Beit Meir, EH</i> 129:5; <i>Terumat ha-Deshen, Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> 138; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim shel Shalom</i> 2:81; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av, EH</i> 85,114; <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 4:83(2); <i>Teshuvot Ohel Moshe</i> 2:123;G.Felder, <i>Teshuvot Nahalat Tzvi</i>, vol. 2,227-229; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 1:168; <i>PDR</i> 15:1, 11. Others will invoke <i>“kiddushei ta’ut”</i> in this case, provided there is rabbinic approval for their ruling. See<i> Hayyim shel Shalom</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 1:90. Whether if a husband fails to disclose prior to the marriage that he is apostate, one may invoke <i>“kiddushei ta’ut”</i> should the wife be nonobservant but finds his conduct offending to her sense of morality is subject to debate amongst the aforementioned decisors.<br>Finally, as we mentioned, there are cases where a certain flaw may be subject to a difference of opinion whether it is to be considered a “<i>mum gadol</i>” or not. For example, whereas <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4 views epilepsy as a grave defect, Rabbi Spektor argues that this disease is curable and therefore it is to be classified as a minor flaw. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> vol. 1 <i>EH</i> 23. Others have adopted his approach. See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Yad Dovid</i>, infra n. 31; <i>Teshuvot Zemah Tzedek</i> 2:312(3); <i>Hayyim shel Shalom</i>, supra n. 8;<i> Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 8:239;<i>Teshuvot Da’at Kohen</i> 44. See also <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>EH</i> 1:80, <i>EH</i> 4:82; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 3:20.<br>However, there are<i> Poskim</i> who would contend that a disease or a psychological condition may be classified as a major defect even if it generally stabilizes the situation. See e.g. File no. 870175/4, op. cit. at 46, which deals with a schizophrenic husband. See also, <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat, EH</i> 14(2) at 123.</i> In our contemporary context, what drives a <i>Posek</i> to seek such a solution? Regretfully, on many occasions the issuance of compulsion orders and obligatory orders of a <i>beit din</i> will be unable to motivate a husband to give a <i>get</i>. Obviously the personal predicament of the <i>agunah</i> who is dealing with a recalcitrant husband may serve as a motivating factor to be responsive. As R. Avraham ben Mordekhai ha-Levi of eighteenth-century Egypt observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ginat Veradim, EH</i> 3:20. Though this description relates to a case where a husband disappeared, it also applies to the present-day <i>agunah</i> whose husband refuses to grant her a divorce. See File no. 996047/2, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, December 25, 2014.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The daughters of Avraham remain grass widows with living husbands . . . they are left starving, thirsty, and destitute. And we should be apprehensive lest they become involved in objectionable conduct . . . Moreover, these women are young and nubile [and will not be able to wait indefinitely].</span>
The situation of such a woman has been likened to that of a moribund individual in imminent danger of death (a <i>goses</i>) and the withholding of a <i>get</i> entails a stricture ancillary to the prohibition of murder (<i>avizraihu de-retzihah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Yevamot</i> 122a; <i>Kitvei ha-Gaon R. Yosef Henkin</i>, vol. 1,115.</i>
However, beyond this vital concern for the <i>agunah’s</i> plight, given the contemporary inability of implementing the <i>halakhic</i> mechanism of <i>get</i> coercion, common sense dictates that a solution be found. <i>Halakhah</i> has been characterized by many as <i>“torat hayyim</i>” and therefore, dating back to the times of the Mishnah and Talmud, <i>Halakhah</i> has provided the <i>ilot gerushin</i> (grounds for a <i>beit din</i> to obligate or coerce a husband to grant a <i>get</i> to his wife).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Ketuvot</i> 7:9–10, <i>Yevamot</i> 13:12; <i>Ketuvot</i> 60a, 61b, 70a,75–76a,77a, 109a; <i>Tur, EH</i> 154; <i>SA, EH</i> 154:1.</i> With the issuance of these divorce judgments, a <i>beit din’s</i> authority in Torah-observant communities throughout the ages seems to have been quite effective in ensuring <i>get</i> compliance. (Absent any historical studies regarding this matter, we are positing this conclusion.) And, therefore, we encounter few discussions from earlier centuries regarding <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> relating to a husband’s flaws.
If we fast-forward to modern times, we confront a somewhat different picture. On one hand, in twentieth-century <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the <i>battei din</i> under the aegis of the Chief Rabbinate are legislatively empowered by the Israeli Knesset to issue <i>compulsion</i> orders, which will result in the incarceration of husbands who refuse to give a <i>get</i> to their wives. They can also render <i>obligating</i> judgments, which, if the husband does not comply, will restrict his right to leave the country, open or maintain a bank account, etc., and benefit from other privileges.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Y. Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment: Principles of Jewish Law,” 15 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 57 (2004). Consequently, it should be no surprise that Israeli <i>dayanim</i>, such as R. Ezra Batzri, who utilize the method of <i>umdana</i> to void a marriage (see infra n. 49) will initially advocate<i> get</i> coercion as a means to persuade the husband to grant a <i>get</i>. See File no. 011514213-25-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, February 16, 2000 cited by <i>ha-Din ve-Hadayan</i> no. 4, case 11.</i> Assuming that the Israeli <i>battei din</i> authorize such orders,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See supra chapter 1.</i> noncompliance by recalcitrant husbands might result in imprisonment or denial of certain social and economic benefits, which may serve as an effective deterrent for continued refusal of a husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. As such, in many situations the implementation of <i>bittul kiddushin</i> may not be required.
However, today in the United States and other places around the world, <i>battei din</i> are not empowered to issue such types of divorce judgments that would mean a husband’s incarceration or denial of benefits if he refuses to comply. Absent the existence of such legal and economic sanctions, the <i>halakhic</i> legal system has its hands tied in the face of a husband’s <i>get</i> recalcitrance. Consequently, common sense dictates that there is an acute need to address the <i>agunah’s</i> predicament by searching for other instruments to address <i>igun</i> matters—ways that will not run afoul of legal strictures of non-enforceability of <i>get</i> compliance.
Consequently, it should be of no surprise to find that the nexus between the legal inability to issue compulsion orders and the acute need to employ the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to address the <i>agunah</i> problem is uppermost in the minds of some contemporary <i>Poskim</i>. For example, in the early twentieth century, dealing with an impotent husband, implicitly adopting R. Elhanan Spektor’s nineteenth-century Lithuanian position, R. Eliyahu Klatzkin of Lithuania and <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Dvar Eliyahu</i>, supra n. 4. Consequently, if, for example, R. Yitzhak bar Sheshet Parfet, who resided in Algiers, North Africa during the fourteenth century, rules that sexual impotency is grounds for coercing a <i>get</i>, one should not draw a conclusion that he rejects the solution of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. Given that <i>get</i> coercion was allowed and presumably effective in fourteenth-century Algiers, there was no compelling need to address the merits of <i>kiddushei</i> <i>ta’ut</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127.<br>As we noted earlier, since we are dealing with a <i>safek kiddushin</i> (a doubtful marriage) in a mistaken marriage, Rabbis Klatzkin, Feinstein (infra text accompanying n. 19), Frank, and O. Yosef (infra text accompanying n. 23) claim that one may implement the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> given the fact that today outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> we cannot coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i> under any circumstances. See also <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 1. As such, these <i>Poskim</i> are implicitly following in the footsteps of <i>Maharah Ohr Zarua</i> 126 in the name of Ramah, <i>Beit ha-Behirah</i> on <i>Kiddushin</i> 65a, and <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1236, <i>PDR</i> 1:38, 3:74, and <i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i> 2:20, who argue that an instance of <i>safek kiddushin</i> serves as grounds for <i>get</i> coercion. See also <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:159.<br>Cf. other authorities who argue that there exist no grounds for <i>get</i> coercion in a situation of <i>safek kiddushin</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 25; <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 574; <i>Teshuvot R. Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 6 in the name of Radvaz; <i>Teshuvot Lehem Rav</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 378; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 154:2.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In particular in our times, we should contend . . . that there is a mistaken transaction (marriage –AYW) in our situation because during the period when <i>battei din</i> had authority, it was proper to compel him to divorce her . . . but this is not the case in our time when the power of <i>battei din</i> is not so effective, and in the secular courts she will be given the right to remarry.”</span>
A few decades later, addressing the case of a mentally deranged husband, R. Feinstein argues that we invoke the Talmudic principle that “one cannot live with a snake in the same basket”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 112b; <i>Ketuvot</i> 72a, 77a, 86b.</i>, which may serve as grounds for coercion of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>EH</i> 1:80.

In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> where there exists the possibility that a husband can be coerced to give a <i>get</i>, a wife may marry knowing that even if after the marriage a <i>mum gadol</i> emerges that she was unaware of prior to the marriage, she could proceed to <i>beit din</i> that could coerce him to give a <i>get</i>. Consequently, there would be no basis to invoke “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”. See <i>PDR</i> 15:1, 8. Obviously, outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and Morocco, where coercion is not an option, such a ruling would be inapplicable.<br>Whereas, if a wife who fails to disclose to her husband prior to their marriage a major flaw he may divorce her against her will, such a relief does not exist if a husband fails to disclose prior to the marriage to his prospective spouse a major defect. Conserquently, some <i>Poskim</i> propel themselves to void a marriage in such situations due to <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> provided that the conditions for <i>bittul kiddushin</i> are obtained. See <i>Hohmat</i> <i>Shlomo, Ketuvot</i> 75a; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 80 (<i>le’halakhah velo le’ma’aseh</i>); <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> <i>EH</i> 27(4); <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 1:79; <i>Minhat Avraham</i>, supra n. 10. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 3:20.<br>The question is what is the basis for the contention that in the absence of the implemention of coercion, we may invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. Possibly it is based upon Gra’s understanding of Rosh’s ruling (See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:3) which rejects <i>get</i> coercion in the case of a physically abusive husband. Given that the wife knew prior to her marriage that her husband was an angry person and prone to violence, consequently should he become physically abusive during the marriage one is proscribed from coercing him to give a <i>get</i>. In others, coercion is a response to the husband’s personality flaw rather than to the act of battery. See <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA EH</i> 154:17. That being said, the same line of argumentation ought to apply in the case of a husband who fails to disclose prior to his marriage to his wife his aggressive personality. And therefore if upon marriage he is physical abusive, there are grounds to void the marriage based upon the failure to disclose this <i>mum gadol.</i> On the other hand, if prior to the marriage she was cognizant of his flaw and still decided to marry him, she can’t advance a claim of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. In short, just as <i>get</i> coercion cannot be deployed when a wife knew about her husband’s flaws prior to the marriage, similarly, she can’t invoke <i>“ta’ut”</i> when she knew prior to the marriage about his <i>mum gadol</i>.<br>Consequently, given the analogy between <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and <i>get</i> coercion, one can well undertand the reason Rabbis Klatzkin, Feinstein and others argue that in the absence of the capacity to coerce a <i>get</i> one should employ <i>kiddushei ta’ut.</i> In both instances, the wife was unaware of her husband’s flaws prior to the onset of marriage. Similarly, in the absence of <i>get</i> coercion, one can invoke <i>umdana</i>. See <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i>, 198.<br>Even if one claims that Gra’s interpretation of Rosh is problematic (see <i>PDR</i> 8:216,218), one may accept his line of argumentation regarding the criteria for invoking <i>get</i> coercion.</i> R. Feinstein argues that insanity is to be viewed as “<i>a mum gadol</i>” and therefore the marriage may be invalidated based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. The inability to employ coercion equally propels R. Feinstein to invoke “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>” in the situation of a husband who is sexually impotent and fled.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79.</i> Focusing upon another situation of a mentally dysfunctional husband, a <i>Yerushalayim</i> Regional <i>Beit Din</i> notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 15:1, 8, 20:239, 281.

<span class="poetry indentAll">“If one cannot coerce the granting of a <i>get</i> the marriage was definitely a mistaken marriage.”</span>
Subsequently, relying upon R. Feinstein’s insistence that the absence of the implementation of coercion requires one to examine the merits of utilizing the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, another <i>Yerushalayim</i> Regional <i>Beit Din</i> contends that given that the husband intentionally failed to disclose his mental state prior to his marriage, the marriage is therefore void.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 20: 239, 254.</i> Acutely aware of the inability to implement coercive measures today, others such as Rabbis Yehezkel Landau, Shaul Nathanson, Tzvi Pesah Frank, and Ovadia Yosef argue for utilizing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as an avenue for addressing the <i>agunah</i> problem.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 80 (end); <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Tlita’a</i> 61; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:181 (end); <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer,</i> vol. 9 <i>EH</i> 38(2). Cf. <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 3:20.<br>Though the authorities cited in the text accompanying supra notes 16–22 as well as others (such <i>as Even Yekarah</i>, supra n. 10, <i>Birkat Retzeh</i> 107 and File no. 1-14-1393, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, March 5, 2003) seem to claim that a prerequisite before employing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> is that the latent defect must be grounds for coercing a <i>get</i>, a review of the decisors who utilize this technique clearly indicate that the tool was employed even concerning a <i>mum gadol</i> that was not necessarily a ground for <i>get</i> coercion. For example, a preexisting flaw that involves a husband’s misrepresentation and deception, albeit a basis for invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, was not a ground to coerce a <i>get</i>. See <i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 10, at 28. Cf. File no. 371447/3, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din cited in <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> no. 36, which argues that deception is grounds to coerce a <i>get</i>.</i>
All of the aforementioned <i>Poskim</i> are implicitly following the <i>mesorah</i> (<i>halakhic</i> tradition) enunciated by nineteenth-century <i>Poskim</i>. As R. Dovid Babad, a famed nineteenth-century <i>Posek</i> of Galicia, communicates to us such a <i>mesorah</i> (tradition):<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havatzelet ha-Sharon</i> 2:28.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“I heard from <i>ha-Gaon R. Barish Rapaport</i> . . . that he had a <i>mesorah</i> from his <i>Rav</i>, <i>ha-Gaon Noda be-She’arim</i>, <i>Av Beit Din</i> of Lublin, that upon receiving a question to address, he would first weigh in his mind the truthfulness of the matter according to what human reason dictates and if in his estimation of human reason the matter is true, then he would delve into <i>halakhah</i> to arrive at a decision.”</span>
To place this <i>mesorah</i> in our context, human reason dictates that a solution must be found to address the matter of <i>get</i> recalcitrance. Whether in fact, a solution will be found will depend upon whether the norms of the <i>halakhic</i> system offer a solution. In contemporary times, this <i>mesorah</i> has been explicitly adopted by <i>Poskim</i> to address the classical case of the <i>agunah</i> whose husband has disappeared<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov, EH</i> 56; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 9:150.</i>; it ought to be equally invoked for an <i>agunah</i> whose husband refuses to give a <i>get</i>. Given, as we mentioned, that our <i>amoraim</i>—as well as the authors of our classical restatements of <i>Halakhah</i> such as Mishnah Torah, Tur, and Shulhan Arukh—never authorized voiding a marriage based upon the existence of major latent flaws found in a spouse without the delivery of a <i>get</i>, what is the justification for invoking the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, which would free a wife without the delivery of a <i>get</i>? In Bava Kama,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 110b-111a.</i> the Talmud addresses the situation of a <i>“mekah ta’ut”</i> (a mistaken transaction) where the buyer has to rescind the sale due to a defect found in the item that was bought. Upon discovery of the flaw, the buyer has a right to return the object to the seller. One of the conditions for the rescission is that the buyer was unaware of the defect when he purchased the item. If, at the time of the sale, the buyer was aware of the defect, the sale is final. Among the <i>mekah ta’ut</i> matters that the Talmud addresses is the case of <i>yibum</i> (levirate marriage). A <i>yevamah</i> is the widow of a man who died childless and was survived by his brother. Under <i>Halakhah</i>, they are obligated to marry one another. Should the brother-in-law refuse to marry her, he must release her by means of a ceremony called <i>halitzah</i> (removal of one of his shoes). Should the surviving brother known as the <i>yavam</i> (levir) neither marry the <i>yevamah</i> nor perform the <i>halitzah</i>, she becomes an <i>agunah</i>. Dealing with a childless widow, the Talmud states,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 26. The <i>hazakah</i> is dealt with in other passages of the Talmud. See <i>Yevamot</i> 118b; <i>Ketuvot</i> 75a; <i>Kiddushin</i> 7a, 41a. In other places the<i> hazakah</i> is formulated as “a woman is pleased (even) with very little”. See <i>Kiddushin</i>, op. cit.; <i>Bava Kama</i>, supra n. 26.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A childless widow whose lot falls for <i>yibum</i> consideration before a brother-in-law who is afflicted with a severe skin disease (boils) (and as a result is physically repulsive to her –AYW) should be released without <i>halitzah</i> because she did not betroth herself in marriage to her brother-in-law with this in mind.</span>
However, rejecting the wife’s reasoning, the Talmud cites Reish Lakish’s ruling approvingly,
<span class="poetry indentAll">In that case we can attest that a woman is ready to accept any conditions (provided she is married to her first husband) . . . for Reish Lakish said: it is better to live as two than to remain in widowhood.</span>
Consequently, given that marrying a brother-in-law who is afflicted with boils is preferable than to remaining a widow, her first marriage cannot be considered a <i>mekah ta’ut</i>. Consequently, Tosafot extrapolates that in all situations where a husband exhibits major defects, a wife cannot argue that there is a <i>mekah ta’ut</i> because she prefers living with any man even if there is exists a danger in the future that she will be forced to live with her brother-in-law who is afflicted with a skin disease rather than live a life of spinsterhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, “<i>tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu</i>” deals with a wife’s willingness to live with her husband despite the future possibility of being forced to live with her brother-in-law who has a skin disease. See <i>Rashi, Kiddushin</i> 41a<i>, Bava Kama</i> 111a<i>; Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 24, Anaf 5; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79, 4:83;<i>Teshuvot Even Yekarah, Mahadura Tlita’a</i> 53. Compare others who contend that the <i>hazakah</i> refers to the <i>yavam,</i> the brother-in-law. In other words, a woman prefers to live with a brother-in-law who is afflicted with boils rather than live alone. See <i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 100b, s.v. <i>ada’ta</i>;<i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash</i> 3:5. Others contend that the presumption refers to both the husband and the brother-in-law. See <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4.</i> In effect, Reish Lakish’s <i>hazakah</i> (presumption), which in Aramaic is termed “<i>tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu</i>” has been understood as an ontological and existential fact rather than linked to cultural, sociological, and psychological factors—the latter of which would result in the inapplicability of this <i>hazakah</i> in certain contexts.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R. Joseph Soloveitchik, “Surrendering to the Almighty” <i>Light</i>, 17 Kislev 5736 (1976), 11–15, 18. Cf. R. A. Lichtenstein who asserts that even in accordance with Rabbi Soloveitchik, <i>tav le-meitav</i> is rooted in the wife’s expectations and thus if a <i>Posek</i> is convinced that in a particular case the wife regretted marrying her spouse, <i>tav le-meitav</i> would be inapplicable. See <i>Shiurei R. Aharon Lichtenstein on Tractate Gittin</i>, 338.<br>A review of the <i>Rishonim</i>, early authorities in <i>Kiddushin</i> 41a demonstrates that in fact a woman will have certain expectations in choosing a man for marriage and will not necessarily tolerate certain personality traits which manifest themselves during their marriage rather than than become divorced and leave a life of spinsterhood. See <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 41a, s.v. <i>assur</i>; <i>Rashba, Ritva</i> and <i>Nimukei Yosef</i> on <i>Kiddushin</i> 41a. See also, <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4. The applicability of <i>“tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu” hazakah</i> may vary from generation to generation as well as from culture to culture  in the same generation. See <i>Teshuvot Ta’alumot Lev</i>, vol. 3, <i>Kuntres ha-Shelihut</i> 1;<i>Teshuvot ha-Shavit</i> 7:20.</i> Therefore, it is unsurprising to find that many <i>Poskim</i> who prohibit implementing the method of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> rely upon this Talmudic passage as one of the grounds for their position while others will rebut the <i>hazakah</i> in cases where there are grounds to coerce a <i>get</i> and such relief is unavailable.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4, in the name of some <i>Rabboteinu Ha-aharonim</i> and <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 8. For other grounds, see supra text accompanying n. 5.<br>For those authorities who rebut the presumption in cases where there are grounds to coerce a <i>get</i>, see <i>She’eilat Moshe, EH</i> 2(59); <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 24(41); <i>Birkat Retzeh</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 10, at 28(3); <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 28. See supra n. 23.</i>
On the other hand, Rabbis Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, Hayyim Ozer Grodzensky, Moshe Feinstein and others argue that if the <i>tav le-meitav</i> presumption <i>is</i> operative under all circumstances, how were the authorities permitted to coerce a husband to divorce his wife in a situation where the wife cannot tolerate her husband’s behavior?<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak,</i> supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 27; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 28; R. Friedman of Karlin, <i>Piskei Halakhot, Yad Dovid, Ishut</i> 110.</i> Obviously, the presumption is not invoked under such circumstances! Moreover, according to Rashi’s interpretation of the passage, the two talmudic statements “she is satisfied with anything” and “it is better for her to live in this state” refer specifically to the case of a <i>yavam</i> who has a serious skin disease rather than to latent flaws in all marriages.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 111a</i> Espousing Rashi’s position, others conclude that in many other instances that entail a major defect, a wife may claim <i>mekah ta’ut</i> because she is unwilling to live with a husband who is repulsive to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 221; R.

Endorsing R. Spektor’s approach as well as others that the presumption may be rebutted in light of circumstances that include an undisclosed major flaw, decisors have operated with two different paradigms for defining a <i>mum gadol</i> of a husband. One model is to extrapolate from the situation of hidden defects found in a wife. If a certain flaw in the wife’s physiological makeup or psyche is viewed a <i>mum gadol</i>, similarly such a defect may be classified as a major defect in the husband’s makeup.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Rid, Ketuvot</i> 74a; <i>Shitah Mekubetzet, Ketuvot</i> 72a in the name of Rivash and Maharit; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42; <i>Teshuvot Maharhash</i> 33; <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, EH</i> 117<i>; Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Ohr Gadol</i> 1:11; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:33; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 3(16); <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yaakov</i> 3:114; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:180–181. For example, mental insanity ought to be considered a major flaw for a husband due to the fact that this latent defect serves as a <i>mum gadol</i> for a wife, which allows a husband to have his marriage voided. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 3 and <i>Teshuvot Malbushei Yom Tov</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 4. See also <i>Shitah Mekubezet, Ketuvot</i> 72 b in the name of Rivash and Maharit; <i>Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 176, who recognize that a major flaw in the wife may be grounds to void a marriage. Cf. <i>Beit Shmuel, SA EH</i> 154:9; <i>Minhat</i> <i>Avraham</i>, supra n. 10.<br>Adopting such an approach may well logically require that one accept the <i>Poskim</i> who require that upon discovering a preexisting grave defect in a wife, a husband must immediately leave the marriage (or may wait a few days in accordance with some authorities) rather than continue living with her, which in effect would ratify the marriage. See <i>Maggid Mishnah</i> and <i>Kessef Mishnah, MT, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 25:6; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 117:19; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i> 105; File no. 861252/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, <i>Ploni v. Plonit</i>, January 23, 2012. Consequently, the discovery after the onset of marriage of a preexisting major flaw in the husband may require the wife to leave the marriage immediately or within a short span of time. See supra text accompanying n. 4.<br>Cf. <i>Ra’avyah, Mordekhai Ketuvot</i> 201 who argues one cannot define a husband’s major defect based upon a wife’s major defect.</i> For example, many authorities argue that a husband would refrain marrying an <i>ailonit</i> (a woman who is incapable of procreation).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Some decisors conclude that there is no requirement of a <i>get</i> even on rabbinic grounds. See <i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 72b, s.v. <i>al menat</i>; <i>Tosafot Gittin</i> 46b, s.v. <i>ha-motzi</i>; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>,<i> Gittin</i> 46b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba Gittin</i> 46b.</i> Relying upon this position, there are some <i>Poskim</i> who contend that an undisclosed flaw of such magnitude, such as a wife’s feelings regarding her apostate husband stands, on par to a husband’s feeling regarding an <i>ailonit</i> that he married and therefore serves as grounds for freeing a wife without a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohel Moshe</i>, supra n 10; <i>Seridei Eish</i>, supra n. 10. In other words, just as the case of an <i>ailonit</i> may be classified as a wife who has a <i>mum gadol</i> and therefore, if undisclosed prior to the marriage, may serve as grounds for voiding a marriage (see <i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 2b and <i>Ketuvot</i> 72b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Ketuvot</i> 7:10; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16 in the name of <i>Emunat Shmuel, Bah</i>, and <i>Lehem Avurim</i>; <i>Imrei Yosher</i>, supra n. 16; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 1:168 in name of the majority of <i>Rishonim.</i> (Cf. decisors cited by <i>Sefer Beit-ha-Behirah, Yevamot</i> 2b who contend that this isn’t a situation of <i>mekah ta’ut</i>), similarly, a case where a Jewish woman who marries a Jewish man and it is unbeknownst to her prior to the onset of marriage that he is a <i>mumar</i> may serve as a basis for <i>bittul kiddushin</i>. See <i>Minhat Asher</i>, supra n. 10. (Interestingly enough, the converse is equally true. A major defect in the husband’s personality may be labeled a <i>mum gadol</i> in the wife’s makeup. See File no. 836721/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, January 16, 2012.)<br>Adopting such an extrapolation may logically lead to the conclusion that upon discovery of the grave flaw, the wife must immediately leave the marriage. See <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 39:9; R. Yehudah Batlan, <i>Teshuvot Zekhor Yehudah</i> 52(4). See text supra accompanying n. 4<br>Conversely, R. Spektor’s original position, memorialized in <i>Be’eir Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 10 is that <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> cannot be employed to void a marriage upon discovery of a husband’s major flaws; similarly, he contends that the same outcome would be applied regarding a husband’s discovery of his wife’s major defects. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 68, <i>Anaf</i> 3(23).</i> However, numerous authorities have rejected such an extrapolation.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz,</i> supra n. 3; <i>SA, EH</i> 38:35, 39:5; <i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 154; <i>Havot Ya’ir</i>, supra n. 33; <i>Beit ha-Levi,</i> supra n. 4; <i>Beit Meir, EH</i> 129:5, 154:1; <i>Teshuvot Yeriot Shlomo</i> 8; <i>Perushei Ibra,</i> supra n. 5. Though R. Tzvi Pesah Frank concurs with the inference, the discovery of such major defects may serve only as grounds for coercing the giving of a<i> get</i> but not for invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. In fact, according to his understanding, <i>Beit Shmuel</i> refrained from invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> upon discovery of a husband’s major flaws because there would be rabbinic requirement of a <i>get</i> as in the situation of discovery of a wife’s latent defects. See <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:181.</i> One of the reasons for rejecting the inference may be due to the questionable right to define the contours of what constitutes a grave defect in regards to creating <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, where a wife is freed without requiring a <i>get</i>, by invoking the scope of a wife’s major defects—where the <i>halakhic</i> consequence for a wife (even an <i>ailonit</i> according to certain decisors) who did not disclose the defect still includes according to some <i>Poskim</i> the need for a <i>get</i> on a rabbinic level or a <i>get le-humra</i> (the requirement of a <i>get</i> as a precautionary measure). To state it differently, one cannot define what constitutes a <i>mum gadol</i> of a husband, which may result in freeing the wife from her husband without a <i>get</i>, from the nature of a <i>mum gadol</i> of a wife, which may result—according to certain authorities—in requiring a <i>get</i>. Another explanation offered for rejecting this paradigm is the fact that there exist no grounds for <i>get</i> coercion when a husband fails to disclose his grave defects. If coercion is unavailable, there are no grounds for employing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in such a situation!<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See supra, text accompanying notes 16,20 and 21.<br>For <i>Poskim</i> who contend that discovery of major defects in a wife requires a <i>get</i> on a rabbinic level or a <i>get le-humra</i>, see <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i> 175; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 2b<i>; Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Yevamot</i> 2b.</i>
Given that <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> is predicated upon the notion of <i>ta’ut</i>, it is unsurprising to discover another paradigm; the model of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> for rescinding a sale is applied towards defining the contours of a <i>mum gadol</i> concerning <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. As we know, anything that the majority of the community considers a defect in an item and said defect is neither obvious nor disclosed to the buyer prior to the purchase generates the buyer’s right to void the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 232:6</i> Similarly, numerous contemporary <i>Poskim</i> and <i>Dayanim</i> contend that any defect viewed by society that relates to the essence of the marriage and/or its ongoing stability is to be understood as a <i>mum gadol</i> and therefore, under certain prescribed conditions, may free a wife from her marriage without the requisite need for a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4; Rabbi Reizin, <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yosef</i> 44; R.

See <i>PDR</i> 5:194, 196. We assume they would equally apply this definitional guidance of what constitutes a <i>mum gadol</i> regarding a wife’s defects to the context of a husband’s hidden flaws. However, see supra text accompanying n. 37, which may possibly serve to militate against such an analogy. This matter requires further deliberation. In fact, what constitutes a defect in a mistaken transaction has been extrapolated from what is understood as a flaw in cases of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See <i>Maggid Mishneh, MT, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 15:3; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, HM</i> 232:5–6.<br>It is important to note that a purchaser who had the possibility to inspect the item prior to purchase and he refrained from doing so and subsequently a defect was discovered, if he already paid for the item, the sale is final. See <i>Mishneh le-Melekh, MT, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 15:3; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, SA, HM</i> 232:1. On the other hand, despite the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> serve as the paradigm for defining the defects of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, nevertheless, there is no duty upon the wife to have performed due diligence in inquiring whether the husband had possessed certain flaws prior to the inception of the marriage.<br>As we mentioned supra text accompanying note 4, there are <i>Poskim</i> who will either not be concerned if there was a lapse of time (the length of time is subject to debate) after a wife’s discovery of her husband’s major <i>mum</i> or will accept a reasonable explanation for a delay in divorce. This position is implicitly relying upon the authorities who permit the rescission of a <i>mekah ta’ut</i> after much time has elapsed from the moment of discovery. See <i>Mahaneh Ephraim, Mehirah/Ona’ah</i> 5; <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, HM</i> 232, <i>ha-Gahot ha-Tur</i> 37.</i>
In effect, the recognition of a particular grave defect serves as an example of a mistaken transaction, which in effect undermines the presumption of “<i>tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu</i>”. A review of the <i>teshuvot</i> reveals that in multifarious situations authorities argue that we encounter a <i>mekah ta’ut</i> that rebuts the presumption and allows the wife to remarry without the giving of a <i>get</i>. For example, in accordance with Havot Ya’ir,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havot Ya’ir</i>, supra n. 33; R. Korfe, <i>Teshuvot Radakh, Bayit</i> 9.</i> the <i>tav le-meitav</i> presumption is based upon the wife’s desire to engage in sexual relations with her husband. Consequently, it is unsurprising that some <i>Poskim</i> invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in situations where prior to the marriage the husband is sexually impotent, refuses to have children, or is a homosexual.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 10; R. Goldberg, <i>Koah De-heteira</i>;<i> Mishnat Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>EH</i> 1:79, <i>EH</i> 4:13, 52, 113. Whereas <i>Shevut Ya’akov</i> supra n. 8, contends that a wife will remain in the marriage for sexual reasons, R. Elyashiv argues that <i>tav le-meitav</i> is inapplicable to secular Jews who are lax in their moral behavior. See <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 4:152. However, R. Feinstein claims that the presumption is equally inapplicable to Torah-observant Jewish women who are known to be lax in matters of modesty.</i> This understanding of the presumption is also in evidence with decisors who free a wife from <i>halitzah</i> in cases of latent defects discovered in the now-deceased husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Dvar Eliyahu,</i> supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> 5:57.</i> Lest one contend that given that rulings regarding a <i>halitzah</i> situation (which entails an <i>“issur lav</i>”) are not treated <i>halakhically</i> as stringent as a marriage case (which involves “<i>karet</i>”) due to the fact that the <i>halitzah</i> case neither involve a matter of <i>ervah</i> nor <i>eishit ish</i> and therefore may not serve as a precedent for matrimonial situations, numerous <i>Poskim</i> nonetheless clearly derive conclusions from <i>halitzah</i> situations and apply them to marriage cases in matters of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1:95, 99.<br>Whether one can utilize the <i>halitzah</i> ruling to conclude that one can equally void the marriage of a husband is impotent is open to much debate.  Even though a <i>shomeret yavam</i>(a widow waiting for her deceased husband’s brother to perform <i>halitzah</i>)is biblically prohibited to anyone else and her status is not as stringent as the status of a married woman who is biblically prohibited to anyone else, one may nonetheless apply <i>halitzah</i> rulings to marriage cases in matters of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See <i>Yevamot</i> 119a (Rava’s dictum); <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 250;<i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana EH</i> 66(end) and compare with <i>Mahadura Kama OH</i> 21; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1: 95, 99.Cf. <i>Teshuvot Torah Hessed OH</i> 29; R. Safran,<i>Teshuvot Rabaz</i> 88(3) and <i>Iggerot Moshe YD</i> 2:46 who would reject such an application of <i>halitzah</i> rulings to marriage situations in light of the stringency of the status of a married woman.</i> In other words, even though a <i>shomeret yavam</i> (a widow waiting for her deceased husband’s brother to perform <i>halitzah</i>) is biblically prohibited to anyone else and her personal status is not as stringent as the status of a married woman who is biblically prohibited to anyone else, one may nonetheless apply <i>halitzah</i> rulings to marriage cases.
A cursory glance of <i>teshuvot</i> memorialized in <i>Otzar ha-Poskim</i> and elsewhere shows that the <i>tav le-meitav</i> presumption is not limited to the sexual underpinning of the relationship but equally applies to instances where the matrimonial bond becomes severely compromised by a husband’s grave flaws such as mental dysfunction, criminal behavior, imprisonment, danger to his wife’s physical health, misrepresentation, nonobservance, and apostasy that existed prior to the marriage and only were discovered after the marriage was created.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otzar ha-Poskim, EH</i> 39:16–17; <i>Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Mahari ha-Kohen</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yosef</i> 19; <i>Even Yekarah,</i> supra n. 4; Rabbi Avraham Friedman, <i>Yagdil Torah</i>, Second Year, Pamphlet 27, sec. 85; <i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 10.<br>Implicit in this approach is that even if a husband’s physical or psychological disorder appears after the onset of marriage, nonetheless if it is clear that the disorder predated the marriage, we are dealing with a case of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 2b; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 3:45, 49, 4:113; <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 10, <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Sha’arei Tzion</i> vol. 3, <i>EH</i>:4, 15. (The same equally applies to a wife’s defects. To invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> one must prove that the defect preexisted the marriage. See <i>SA EH</i> 117:8; <i>Teshuvot Simhat Yom Tov EH</i> 22)<br>Interestingly, in Rabbis Schwadron’s, Feinstein’s and Boaron’s rulings there is an assumption that the disorder preexisted the marriage without corroborating its presence. For example, arguing that a husband’s failure to disclose prior to the marriage that he was gay, R. Feinstein concludes that this is a case of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. Even though in the actual <i>teshuvah</i> R. Feinstein does not produce evidence that he was gay, nonetheless, one may conclude that R. Feinstein believes that there are biological determinants that are linked to homosexuality and therefore we may assume that even prior to the marriage the husband was gay. In fact, though this matter is open to debate, the dominant thrust in secular professional literature would advance such a position. See e.g. D. Hamer et al, “A Linkage Between DNA Markers on the X Chromosome and Male Sexual Orientation,“ <i>Science</i>, vol. 261 (5119), 321–327, July 1993; Camperio-Ciani et al., “Evidence for Maternally Inherited Factors Favoring Male Homosexuality and Promoting Female Fecundity,” <i>Proceedings of Royal Society, London</i>. (2004) 271, 2217–2221; F. Lemmola and A.Camperio Ciani, “New Evidence of Genetic Factors Influencing Sexual Orientation in Men: Female Fecundity Increase in Maternal Line”, <i>Arch Sex Behavior</i> (2009), 38, 393–399.<br>Lest one challenge our conclusion given that the inquirer in the above cited <i>teshuvah</i> was R. Shmuel Tuvia Stern who informs us that this was a case where immediately after the couple’s honeymoon the wife suddenly becomes aware that her husband is gay (see <i>Teshuvot ha-Shavit</i> 7:20) and therefore one may readily assume that the latent defect preexisted the marriage, in fact, there are two additional instances where R. Feinstein invokes <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> while implicitly assuming that the <i>mum gadol</i> existed prior to the marriage. Addressing the case of sexual impotence, in one <i>teshuvah</i> [see <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79] he requires doctors to corroborate that the husband was impotent prior to the marriage before employing the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. However in another scenario, for R. Feinstein it was sufficient that the husband was proven to be impotent on his wedding night [see <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:52]. Therefore, despite the fact that the <i>ta’ut</i> could not be corroborated to exist prior to the marriage, he voids the <i>kiddushin</i> based upon an undisclosed <i>mum</i> <i>gadol</i> via a medical examination. In fact, other <i>Poskim</i> implicitly argue that it is sufficient to determine that the husband is impotent after the marriage. See <i>Beit Avi</i>, supra n. 8; <i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Dvar Eliyahu</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16.<br>Similarly, in another situation though R. Feinstein only voids a marriage of a husband who refused to have children due to the fact that the wife remarried without a <i>get,</i> a study of his <i>teshuvah</i> will show that he was willing to invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> despite the fact that there was no demonstrable proof indicating that prior to the marriage the husband expressed and/or shown any indication that he didn’t want to have children. See <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 4:13.<br>On the other hand, addressing the case of a husband who manifested schizophrenic attacks which manifest itself by the loss of self-control during his marriage and there was no proof <i>per se</i> that he exhibited such attacks prior to the marriage, a Haifa Regional Beit Din invokes <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> due to the fact that prior to the marriage he exhibited “negative and positive signs which are characteristic of an individual who is a schizophrenic” See Haifa Beit Din <i>psak</i>, supra n. 10, at 80.<br>Given that the husband did not display clear signs of schizophrenia prior to the marriage, one Israeli <i>dayan</i> told me that he rejected the propriety of employing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> under such conditions. Though I did not inquire with him regarding the merits of the aforementioned rulings of Rabbis Feinstein and Boaron, but I suspect he would discount them where the presence of these defects could neither be corroborated nor were there tell tale signs of these flaws as were present in the Haifa case.<br>Whether one can invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> without demonstrating that the <i>mum</i> predated the marriage requires further deliberation.</i> Obviously, a <i>dayan</i> must be astute and keenly aware of the slippery slope and therefore be very cautious in assessing what constitutes a grave latent defect, lest one undermine the institution of marriage. Consequently, though certain types of behavior or diseases such as temper tantrums, stinginess, and diabetes may impact upon marital stability, nonetheless such flaws would generally fail to be classified as a <i>mum gadol</i> that could potentially, under certain conditions, be grounds for a <i>mekah ta’ut</i>. Therefore the marriage would remain intact and its dissolution would mandate a <i>get</i>. Invoking such conduct or diseases as a <i>mum gadol</i> and freeing the wife without a <i>get</i> would only result in the travesty of the <i>halakhic</i> decision-making process in general and the institution of marriage in particular!
That being said, as we have described in great length, there are nevertheless some situations that have serious <i>halakhic</i> bases for utilizing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. As such, the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, under certain prescribed conditions, may serve as a basis for voiding a marriage retroactively. To buttress their rulings, some <i>Poskim</i> chose to rely upon both earlier rulings of predecessors as well as the judgments of R. Simhah of Speyers, R. Ya’ir Bachrach, R. Elhanan Spektor, and a recent Israeli rabbinical court ruling who espoused <i>le-halakhah</i> (in theory) this method but due to the <i>humra</i> of <i>eishit ish</i> (the stringency of a woman being endowed with the status of a wife) refrains from implementing this tool <i>le-ma’aseh</i> (in practice).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i> 761; <i>Havot Ya’ir</i>, supra n.33, R. Spektor, <i>Teshuvot Be’eir Yitzhak, EH</i> 3. Subsequently, R. Spektor voided a <i>halitzah</i> in practice based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See <i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4. On the other hand, <i>Dayan</i> Rabinowitz aligns R. Spektor’s position with those who prohibit the application of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as an avenue to void a marriage. See File no. 1-14-393, supra n. 10. For a case entailing a <i>kiddushin</i> that was voided in theory, see File no. 1-14-93, supra n. 10.<br>According to <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4 and <i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 4, though <i>mi-de-oraita</i> (on a biblical level) one can void a marriage based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, since nonetheless rabbinically a wife may not exit a marriage without a <i>get</i>, in practice he refrained from voiding a marriage under these conditions. Nonetheless, as Rabbi Feinstein notes, in situations where it is clear that she is <i>agunah</i>, one is not required to rabbinically remain an <i>agunah</i> one’s entire life and therefore voiding a marriage would be permissible. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 31, <i>EH</i> 1:80; <i>Rabbi Abramsky</i>, supra n. 10; File no. 870175/4, supra n. 10, at 60(end).</i> Invoking these types of theoretical rulings as practical judgments in other contexts is not unusual;<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed ha-Shalem, Kelalei ha-Poskim, Siman</i> 16 (47); <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 18.</i>therefore, the adoption of the position of the aforementioned authorities of validating <i>bittul kiddushin le-ma’aseh</i> should evoke no surprise at all!<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague ed., 1022, relying on his teacher; <i>Dvar Eliyahu</i>, supra n. 4 and <i>Teshuvot Emunat Shmuel</i> 34 endorse R.

In short, in the absence of being able to physically coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife, numerous authorities have voided a marriage based upon implementing the method of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in cases where the wife discovers during her marriage a latent flaw in her husband that was unbeknownst to her but existed prior to the marriage, Under certain prescribed conditions numerous <i>Poskim</i> have freed the wife from her husband without the issuance of a <i>get.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>2. A wife’s <i>umdana</i> (assessment of expectations) after the onset of marriage</b></span>
In contradistinction to <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, where one focuses upon <i>the past—</i>namely, when there was a mistake at the time of consummating the marriage in the form of an undisclosed grave preexisting personality and/or medical [or psychological] disorder and consequently, the marriage may be voided retroactively—when one invokes <i>umdana</i> as a grounds for voiding a marriage, we are focusing on a <i>future</i> occurrence—i.e. one that transpired after the creation of the marriage. For example, “had I known that my husband would have been physically abusive to me or would be become mentally dysfunctional during our years of marriage I never would have married him” may serve as illustrations of a wife invoking an <i>umdana demukhah</i> (a major assessment of expectations) which we hereafter label for the sake of the presentation as <i>umdana</i>. On the other hand, if a wife would allege that “I never knew that my husband’s violent behavior during the marriage is linked to certain biological factors that pathologically expressed themselves prior to the marriage”, which should serve as red flags for future abusive conduct, she is now making a claim that allows for employing the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, not <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Some authorities formulate an argument for <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> by employing the language of <i>umdana</i>, see e.g. <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i>, 1:197; <i>Birkat Retzeh</i>, supra n. 44; <i>Even Shoham</i>, supra n. 48, 60 in the name of R. Hayyim Berlin; <i>Seridei Eish,</i> supra n. 4, 3:25; <i>Ohel Moshe</i>, supra n. 10; <i>She’eilat Moshe, supra n. 10</i>;<i>Zikhron Yehonathan</i>, supra n. 19; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 6:159; <i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:25; <i>Minhat Asher</i>, supra n. 10. For example, focusing upon a latent defect of epilepsy in a husband, R. Soloveitchik contends that no reasonable woman would consent to marry such a man. See <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4. In other words, there is an <i>umdana</i> that it was only due to the absence of a person’s knowledge of a given reality that he acted as he did; in the law of sales had he access to all of the facts, he would not have sold something to someone else. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 146b; R. Guttesman, <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i> <i>on Tractate Kiddushin</i> (hereafter: <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i>) 21(5). The implicit assumption is that <i>umdana</i> is viewed as a <i>ta’ut</i>. See Ra’avyah, <i>Teshuvot u-Biurei Sugyot</i>, 1032.<br>Following in the footsteps of <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> infra n. 53, <i>Teshuvot Meshivat</i> <i>Nefesh EH</i> 73, <i>She’eilot Moshe</i>, op. cit., <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:121, <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i>, op. cit., <i>Sha’arei Ezra</i> supra n. 4 and others in our presentation we distinguish between <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>—which focuses upon a past event prior to the marriage and is examined through the lens of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> and <i>umdana</i>—which addresses a future event after the marriage. See <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Re’im</i> 68;<i> Teshuvot Ohr Sameah</i> 2:29; <i>Zikhron Yehonathan</i>, supra n. 19; <i>She’eilot Moshe</i>, op. cit.; <i>Seridei Eish</i>, supra n. 4 at subsection 21; <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i>. op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, HM</i> 42; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1:99; File <i>Yuhasin</i> 178–73, Beit Din Yerushalayim, August 13, 2015; Tzfat Beit Din, infra n. 77, at 16–20.<br>See infra note 74. Cf. R. Hayyim Berlin and R. Moshe Sofer, following in the footsteps of <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i>, infra n. 53 and <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 42:1 who reject utilizing a <i>post factum umdana</i> to void a marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Nishmat Hayyim</i> 126, 129; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:82.

In the context of these two distinct types of <i>bittul kiddushin</i>, how would <i>Halakhah</i> deal with claims of domestic violence? The professional secular literature is divided whether the conduct of perpetrators of domestic violence is linked to genes, the testosterone-serotonin link, or related to environmental stimulation—such as childhood exposure to violence, provocation, and current life conditions, or a combination of both biological and non-biological determinants. <sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For some of the voluminous literature regarding this subject, see G. Weisfeld, et al, “Biological Factors in Family Violence,” 2 <i>Michigan Family Review</i> 25 (1996); D.

See <i>SA, EH</i> 17:48; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 178:9.<br>Assuming the allegations can be verified, one must demonstrate that the pathological conduct predated the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:87; A. Shapiro<i>, Teshuvot Minhat Avraham</i> 2:10(11), 11(3).Cf. supra n. 45.</i> and the data indicates that the husband’s pathological behavior existed prior to the marriage, then the arbiter will have to determine whether there are sufficient <i>halakhic</i> grounds to invoke the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to address the matter of <i>igun</i>. Alternatively, assuming that the husband’s aggressive behavior cannot be corroborated to have transpired prior to the marriage; can one rely on the professional literature that supports the view that there are biological roots to all aggression and employ the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>? Does one require that the husband’s pathological behavior of abuse have manifested itself prior to the marriage? Is relying upon the notion of biological determinants of abuse existing prior to the marriage insufficient to invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>? Clearly, prior to the marriage, a person may have possessed this tendency, but if it was never realized then perhaps the tendency alone does not qualify as a <i>mum gadol</i> and therefore would be insufficient to create a <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
However, on the other hand, if the <i>halakhic</i> authority endorses the position that spousal violence is related to non-biological factors, assuming that the wife’s claims of abuse can be corroborated, the question is whether her exclamation “had I known that my husband would have been physically abusive to me or would be mentally dysfunctional during our years of marriage I never would have married him” may serve to free her from her husband without the requirement of a <i>get</i> via the employment of the technique of <i>umdana</i>.
These are all important questions. Yet, to date, to the best of my knowledge, <i>Poskim</i> have not addressed these issues and this matter requires further <i>limmud,</i> study.
Seemingly, the employment of an <i>umdana</i> here is open to challenge. As we know, for an <i>umdana</i> to be effective depends upon the consent of both parties. For example, a sales transaction involves the agreement of parties, the seller and the buyer—i.e. “<i>taluy be-da’at shneihem</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i> 1:145, 197; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama, YD</i> 69, <i>Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 130; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:82, 5:5.</i> The voiding of the sale with the appearance of a defect subsequent to purchase would be predicated upon two conditions:<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 47b, s.v. <i>she-lo</i>; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, HM</i> 230:1. Cf. <i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 45b, s.v. <i>me</i>.</i>
1. The buyer would have not consummated the deal if he had realized that the item sold would be defective within a reasonable time.
2. The seller would negotiate the sale contingent upon the utility of the item being sold. In other words, the voiding of the sales transaction is dependent upon the existence of both the seller’s and buyer’s implied conditions.
The requirement of “<i>taluy be-da’at shneihem</i>” as a precondition prior to the invoking of an <i>umdana</i> equally applies to marriage, which is based upon the consent of both a man and a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i>, ibid.; R. Avraham Teomim, <i>Teshuvot Hessed le-Avraham, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 55; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1:99</i> For example, if a husband is engaged in criminal activity while married, the fact that a wife would exclaim “had I known he would be a criminal, I never would have married him” would seem to offer no basis for voiding the marriage, since a similar statement must have either been articulated by the husband or be presumed on the husband’s behalf. In fact, the husband may not want to void the marriage in order to avoid his sexual intercourse being viewed as <i>be’ilat zenut</i> (an act of prohibited fornication). However, in contradistinction to R. Betzalel Stern’s view, adopting the views of Rabbis Mordekhai Hillel, Zvi Ashkenazi, Shmuel Landau, Beit Meir, Hayyim Halberstam, Zvi Shapiro, Moshe Zweig, Moshe Feinstein, Ezra Batzri and others, in cases of a major <i>umdana</i>—or what has been labeled as an <i>umdana demukhah</i> (a major inference expressed by one person), suffices in order to void a marriage. Let us examine a case where the wife was unwilling to undertake the marriage unconditionally. Regardless of whether the husband agreed to the condition or not, there would be no validity to the marriage unless the wife’s expectation would be met that the marriage would be established based upon certain circumstances. If the circumstances fail to materialize, there never existed a meeting of the minds of the parties.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’eilat Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 10 (R.

For the effectiveness of a major <i>umdana</i> in commercial issues where one party fails to agree to the other party’s condition, see <i>Mishnah le-Melekh, Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 6:1; <i>Noda be-Yehuda</i>, supra n. 52; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 1:62; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek HM</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shai</i> 37.</i> As such, if prior to the marriage the husband had represented that he was a man of financial means and it was discovered later that he wasn’t wealthy; or that he represented himself as a scholar and it was discovered that he wasn’t knowledgeable, such an <i>umdana</i> may be classified as minor and therefore would not serve as grounds to void the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Avnei Hefetz,</i> supra n. 40</i> On the other hand, if a husband becomes an apostate or mentally dysfunctional during the marriage, such conduct may be classified as undermining the institution of marriage and an example of <i>umdana demukhah</i> and, as such, may serve as grounds for the wife to remarry without receiving a <i>get.</i> Such a conclusion will be subject to a <i>beit din</i>’s discretion.
It is important to note that the <i>umdana</i> is not merely defined by the impropriety of the husband’s conduct, but equally by the wife’s inability to <i>halakhically</i> extricate herself from her marital relationship. As R. Meir Posner points out, prior to invoking the <i>umdana</i> one must be assured that there exists grounds to coerce the husband to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Meir, supra n. 55.</i><br>The inference from their position is that in order to employ the tool of <i>umdana</i>, one must ascertain whether in fact there are grounds for coercing the giving of a <i>get</i> in the particular circumstances. For example, if a wife exclaims, “Had I known that he was going to be a <i>mumar</i> (an apostate) I wouldn’t have married him!” Would such a claim, if provable, be grounds for coercing a <i>get</i>? In fact, there are <i>Poskim</i> who would coerce a<i> mumar</i> to give a <i>get</i>. See <i>Mordekhai, Gittin</i> 450; <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20(4); <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 228; <i>Beit Yosef, Tur EH</i> 154 in the name of <i>Orhot Hayyim</i>; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:1<i>; Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 73; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, EH</i> 154:15. Given that there are <i>Poskim</i> who mandate <i>get</i> coercion in such a case, in the absence of this means of enforcement, according to some authorities the marriage may be voided via the use of an <i>umdana</i>.</i> The <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidshah nafshah</i> (“upon this assumption she did not betroth herself”) tells us that the wife expects that she will be able to exit the marriage if her spouse acts improperly. If <i>get</i> coercion is a distinct possibility, she may have contemplated that her marriage could have been dissolved by <i>get</i> coercion due to her spouse’s inappropriate behavior. As such, there she would not invoke the <i>umdana</i> because she was empowered to direct the <i>beit din</i> to coerce her husband to give a <i>get</i>. Consequently, in accordance with this approach, in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> where there is an option of <i>get</i> coercion, her claim possibly may not be deemed as an <i>umdana demukhah.</i> On the other hand, in countries outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> where <i>get</i> coercion is legally unavailable, this in effect opens up the possibility of her becoming an <i>agunah</i> without any relief. Therefore, under such conditions, she never was prepared to marry such a man without the ability to extricate herself from the marriage. Under such circumstances, should a wife utilize the means of <i>umdana</i>, there may be grounds to void the marriage.
The <i>locus classicus</i> of the operation of this <i>umdana</i> may be found in an inference derived from the aforementioned Talmudic passage regarding a childless widow who is obligated to marry a brother-in-law who is afflicted with a skin disease.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 26. Numerous authorities have understood that this Talmudic <i>sugya</i> (topic for study) found in <i>Bava Kama</i> is dealing with an <i>umdana</i>. See <i>Maharam of Rothenberg,</i> infra n. 60; <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i>, infra. n. 66; <i>Teshuvot Re’eim</i> 68; <i>Radakh</i>, supra n. 41; <i>She’eilat Moshe</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 70.<br>However, some <i>Poskim</i> contend that this <i>sugya</i> is dealing with “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”. See <i>Teshuvot Ra’avyah</i> 1032; <i>Teshuvot Me’il Tzedaka</i> 2 and 4; <i>Teshuvot Zemah Tzedek</i> 322;<i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Tlita’a</i>, 61; <i>Mahari ha-Kohain</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Avnei Hefetz,</i> supra n. 10; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi</i> EH 2:180. In other words, the formulation of the <i>umdana</i> would be the following: “had I known that my husband possessed a <i>mum gadol</i> a mistaken transaction I never would have married him”. See <i>Zikhron Yehonathan</i>, supra n. 19, at subsection 17.<br>The difficulty in linking the <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata de-hakhi lo kidshah nafshah</i> to an error which preexisted the marriage is due the fact that the <i>umdana</i> relates to a husband’s behavior which emerges after the onset of marriage and is not linked to prior to the marriage. A more plausible explanation is that the <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata de-hakhi lo kidshah nafshah</i> is a<i> tenai,</i> a condition<i>,</i> albeit implied in establishing the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Me’il</i> <i>Tzedaka</i> 2; R. Shkop, <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i> 5:18. Compare R. Akiva Eiger who contends, albeit in this author’s mind problematic that the emergence of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as a vehicle to void a marriage is due to noncompliance with a<i> tenai</i>. See <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva</i> <i>Eiger, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 51, 106; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Tlita’a</i> 1:61.</i> Addressing the case of an apostate <i>yavam</i> who refuses to perform <i>halitzah</i> and <i>agunah</i> who engaged in illicit affairs with non-Jews, sired a child and married a <i>Jew</i>, Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg (known by the acronym Maharam), a thirteenth-century German arbiter, rules <i>le-halakhah</i> (in theory) that the <i>yevamah</i> is free to remarry without having to undergo <i>halitzah</i>. Though Maharam is well aware of some earlier Geonim who permitted the <i>yevamah</i> to remarry due to the fact that, by dint of becoming an apostate, he no longer is to be viewed as a Jew, he nonetheless aligned himself with Rashi’s position that an apostate Jew remains a Jew and offered another rationale for freeing the <i>yevamah</i> without <i>halitzah</i>. In his view, and possibly relying upon the twelfth-century opinion of the French decisor R”I,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i>, supra n. 53; <i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 110b, s.v. <i>de’adatei</i>.

In other words, her sexual urge to live with him would not propel her to live with a non­observant person!<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radakh</i>, supra n. 41; <i>Helkat Yo’av</i>, supra n. 10.</i> And Maharam did not distinguish between whether the apostasy occurred before the marriage or subsequent to his brother’s marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharam</i>, supra n. 60; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot,</i> supra n. 53; <i>Teshuvot Maharil</i> 205; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Mintz</i> 105; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hessed</i> (Lublin), <i>EH</i> 20; <i>Teshuvot Meshivat Nefesh</i> 73; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 118:5 in name of Maharam; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 1:90 in the name of Maharam. Cf. Bah’s understanding of Maharam’s position, see <i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 157 and <i>Teshuvot Maimoniyot, Nashim</i> 29.</i> In other words, regardless of the time of her brother-in-law’s apostasy, there is an <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata de-hakhi lo kidshah nafshah</i>—that she would never have married his brother had she been aware of her brother-in-law’s apostasy.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharil,</i> supra n. 62; <i>Maharam Mintz</i>, supra n. 62; <i>Hessed le-Avraham</i>, supra n. 54.</i> In effect, given the circumstances, the <i>tav le-meitav</i> statement is a presumption that is rebuttable. Since living with an apostate husband potentially exposes the wife to religious non-observance, including but not limited to infractions of <i>halakhot</i> of family purity, Maharam therefore explains that one may invoke an <i>umdana</i> that she is not interested in being married to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, supra n. 55.</i> In effect, the invoking of this <i>umdana</i> is understood as a vehicle to establish an implicit or implied condition that her husband would not have an apostate brother lest her husband die and her brother-in-law insist to marry her rather than perform <i>halitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 110b, s.v. <i>adatei</i>; <i>Tosafot Rosh, Shittah Mekubezet, Bava Kama</i> 110b; <i>Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>, supra n. 49; <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i> 5:18. See supra n. 58. Given that it is an <i>umdana demukhah</i> (a major inference), there is no requirement for <i>tenai kaful</i> (a double condition), namely that the condition expressly spells out the consequences of both compliance and noncompliance with the condition. See <i>Ohel Moshe</i>, supra n. 10, at subsection 8.</i>
Despite the fact that Maharam’s ruling was not <i>le-ma’aseh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai</i>, supra n. 55; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 223.</i> and was subsequently rejected by both Shulhan Arukh and Rema,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 157:4 and <i>Rema</i> ad. locum.</i> in practice, nevertheless, as we noted earlier in our presentation concerning <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, <i>Poskim</i> did not hesitate to invoke a theoretical opinion upon arriving at a practical decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 47–48. Cf<i>. Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 4:75<i>.</i></i> Similarly, in the case of an <i>umdana</i>, subsequent authorities would employ Maharam’s position even though it was only given in theory! In fact, in fifteenth-century Germany, a similar scenario arose where a <i>yevamah</i> was unwilling to marry her apostate brother-in-law. Despite offering him an exorbitant sum of money, he refused to perform <i>halitzah</i>. Eventually, she became promiscuous and married another Jewish man. Addressing this case, Maharil and R. Moshe of Mintz, leading authorities in fifteenth-century Germany, invokes Maharam’s ruling and, given that she was now married to a Jew it was after the fact (a <i>be-diavad</i> situation, similar to Maharam’s scenario).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Additionally, there were other grounds for freeing her from her status as a<i> yevamah</i>.</i> Therefore, they freed her to marry without the performance of <i>halitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharil</i>, supra n. 62, <i>Maharam Mintz</i>, supra n. 62.</i> Others adopt Maharam’s approach for <i>halitzah</i> cases even <i>le-khathilah</i> (<i>a priori</i>). For example, focusing upon a husband who committed suicide shortly after marriage and, in accordance with <i>halakhot</i> of <i>yibum</i>, the brother-in-law was to marry the childless widow but disappeared and his whereabouts were unknown, Rabbi Rozin contends that this scenario is to be equated to an apostate <i>yavam</i> who refuses to participate in a <i>halitzah</i> ceremony—namely, that the <i>yevamah</i> is free to remarry. As such, Rabbi Rozin rules in this case that the <i>yevamah</i> is free and is not required to undergo <i>halitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’eilat Moshe</i>, supra n. 10. Though R. Rozin invokes the tool of <i>umdana</i> and voids the marriage, he clearly states that the fact that prior to the marriage the husband clearly intended to commit suicide by poisoning himself, and this intention was corroborated and undisclosed to his wife prior to the marriage, places his ruling in the realm of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>!<br>See also, <i>Derekh Yesharah</i>, supra n. 55, where R. Frankel raises the possibility that we follow Maharam’s ruling regarding a <i>halitzah</i> case.</i> Similarly, addressing the case of a brother-in-law who became a communist after the marriage of his brother and subsequently, in the wake of the death of his brother refused to perform <i>halitzah</i> for his sister-in-law, a childless widow, Rabbi Feinstein offers a creative understanding of <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidhshah nafshah.</i> The wife was cognizant of the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>yibum</i> but thought that there was no duty to marry a nonobservant <i>yavam</i> such as an apostate or communist. Had she known that that an apostate <i>yavam</i> is <i>halakhically</i> a Jew, argues R. Feinstein, she never would have married her now-deceased husband, which would have exposed herself the prospects of an apostate <i>yavam</i> who would refuse to participate in a <i>halitzah</i>. On the basis of this <i>umdana</i>, which relates to a fact that transpired after the marriage (i.e. a brother-in-law who became a communist) as well as upon grounds of being <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, R. Feinstein concludes that she is free to marry without the performance of <i>halitzah</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:121. See also, <i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> supra n. 28, at subsection 1.</i>
Moreover, though Maharam’s judgment focuses upon a <i>halitzah</i> situation, it was applied by others who employed <i>umdana</i> in the context of marriage on a <i>le-khathilah</i> basis.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hessed le-Avraham</i>, supra n. 54; <i>Har Tzvi</i>, infra n. 76. We encountered the same readiness to utilize rulings concerning <i>halitzah</i> as grounds for voiding marriages based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See supra text accompanying n. 44.<br>Cf. others who reject applying <i>umdana</i> in cases of marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 88, <i>Mahadura Tinyana EH</i> 80; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:110.</i> Relying upon Maharam’s theoretical ruling, there are a string of subsequent judgments that employ <i>umdana</i> as a method to void marriages. On the one hand, applying Maharam’s ruling when dealing with an apostate <i>yavam</i>, Rabbis Yoel Sirkes, Avraham Teomim, and Zvi Pesah Frank rely upon the tool of <i>umdana</i> to void the marriage of an apostate husband. Failure to execute <i>bittul kiddushin</i> in these cases would have left the wife an <i>agunah</i> forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 157 (does not explicitly cite Maharam); <i>Hessed le-Avraham</i>, supra n. 54; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1:99, <i>EH</i> 2:201(<i>halitzah</i>).<br>Cf. R. Feinstein who rejects the <i>umdana</i> advanced by <i>Bah</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:162 who would void the marriage due to the fact that a woman doesn’t desire to marry her apostate brother-in-law because she would be forced to commit transgressions.<br>Interestingly, R. Glattstein argues that <i>Bah</i>’s view cannot be accepted because in his understanding of <i>Bah</i>, which addresses the emergence of apostasy after the marriage, he is invoking the paradigm of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and as such the apostasy must have predated the marriage. See <i>Nahalat Yoel Ze’ev</i>, supra n. 10 at 58(13), 59(4). In effect, in pursuance to R. Glattstein’s position, the tool of <i>umdana</i> may not serve as a method to void a marriage. However, our understanding is that <i>Bah</i> is arguing that <i>bittul kiddushin</i> is based upon an <i>umdana</i> that focuses upon a new event that transpires after the marriage, rather than <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, which deals with an event that predates the inception of the marriage. See also, Tzfat Regional Beit Din, infra n. 77. Consequently, <i>Bah</i>’s position may serve as a precedent for employing <i>umdana</i>.<br>Cf. R. Aharon Walkin who contends that prior to invoking the <i>umdana</i> regarding an apostate husband, one requires at least one additional argument to support voiding the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i>, vol. 1, 96.</i> On the other hand, dissenting from Maharam’s opinion and aligning himself with Rashi’s view that an apostate Jew’s <i>kiddushin</i> is valid, R. Dovid Korfu understands that their disagreement as to whether one can free a <i>yevamah</i> from <i>halitzah</i> or not dealt with an apostate <i>yavam</i> who was ready and willing to live with his <i>yevamah</i>. However, should the apostate <i>yavam</i> abandon her and move to another place and the <i>yevamah</i> cannot travel to him, under such conditions an <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidhshah nafshah</i> exists that under such circumstances she never would have married such an individual and consequently there is a basis for the <i>yevamah</i> to be free without undergoing <i>halitzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radakh</i>, supra n. 41.</i> Addressing the scenario of a mentally deranged husband who has no prospects for recovery, R. Zvi Pesah Frank contends that this situation should be no different than the case of a wife being unable to live together with her apostate husband. As such, invoking the <i>umdana</i> that a wife would be unwilling to be married to an insane spouse, R. Frank voids the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:133. For additional discussion of this ruling, see infra chapter 8(g), n. 21. Cf. <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 74.<br>Cf. others who will invoke an <i>umdana</i> regarding a dysfunctional husband on the condition that one receives a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>, permission of 100 rabbis from three different countries and three different communities. See <i>Divrei Hayyim</i>, supra n. 55; <i>Tiferet Tzvi</i>, supra n. 55.</i>
On the other hand, more recently, on May 20, 2014, a Tzfat Rabbinical Court presided upon by Dayan Uriel Lavi apply Maharam’s, Bah’s, Radakh’s, and R. Frank’s decisions—as well as others—by utilizing <i>umdana</i> in the situation of a husband in a vegetative state with no hopes for recovery.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 861974/2, Tzfat Regional Beit Din, <i>Plonit v. Ploni</i>, May 20, 2014. Though the authorities cited by Dayan Lavi invoke the <i>umdana</i> as a means to void a marriage, Dayan Lavi invokes these decisors in order to demonstrate that the wife is “<i>a safek eishit ish</i>” (a wife whose marriage is <i>halakhically</i> in doubt).</i> To state it differently, the wife would have not have married him, <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidhshah nafshah,</i> had she known that this medical event would have happened. Such a scenario, in the <i>beit din</i>’s mind, is to be equated to a case of an apostate <i>yavam</i> whose whereabouts are unknown and a husband who is insane. And despite the fact that some of these judgments deal with <i>halitzah</i> and the <i>psak</i> of R. Soloveitchik was handed down in theory, Rabbi Lavi was comfortable in grounding his case of marriage by citing these authorities. In fact, in his ruling Dayan Lavi explicitly notes the basis for deriving <i>halakhic</i> conclusions from <i>halitzah</i> cases for determining whether a marriage ought to be voided. Yet, despite Dayan Lavi’s readiness to invoke <i>umdana</i>, he explicitly states that in his case that we had a situation of a “<i>safek eishit ish</i>” (a doubt in her personal status as a married woman) and therefore she requires a <i>get le-humra</i> (a <i>get</i> as precautionary measure).
Explicitly adopting our conceptual distinction between <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, which focuses upon the past—namely a husband’s premarital grave flaws, and <i>umdana</i>, which relates to a future event(s) that transpires after the onset of the marriage, R. Moshe Rozin, a twentieth-century Lithuanian and New York authority, expands the scope of the <i>umdana</i> to encompass a different set of fact patterns while focusing upon a <i>halitzah</i> situation. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Rabbi Rozin notes that just as in the situation of an apostate a wife would not want to live with him, there similarly exists an <i>umdana</i> that a <i>yevamah</i> would not want to live with a potential <i>yavam</i> who would disappear. The employment of the <i>umdana</i> is grounded in an implied condition that nobody wants to marry such an individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’eilot Moshe</i>, supra n. 10, at 2(1). See also <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4. In other words, the marriage is construed as an agreement whereby noncompliance with an implied condition that should conduct after the onset of marriage be contrary to a spouse’s expectations, the marriage is void. See <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 51; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 255.<br>Given that we are dealing with an implied condition rather than an explicit condition, there therefore exists no requirement of expressly spelling out the consequences of both fulfillment and nonfulfillment of the condition, e.g. <i>tenai kaful</i>. See <i>Ohr Sameah, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 10:2. See also <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 6b, s.v. <i>lo</i>.</i>
In contradistinction to the above rulings, which were given <i>le-ma’aseh</i> (in practice), invoking the <i>umdana</i> that a wife would never have married her husband had she known that he would contract epilepsy during their marriage, Rabbi Yosef Baer Soloveitchik concludes <i>le-halakhah ve-lo le-ma’aseh</i> (in theory rather than in practice) that she is free from her chains of <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4.</i>
The common denominator underlying the aforementioned cases is that any conduct the husband engaged in during the marriage that will gravely impair and pose a danger to the ongoing matrimonial relationship may serve as a justification to invoke a wife’s <i>umdana</i> of <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidshah nafshah.</i> Therefore, in response to our threshold question, whether a wife’s exclamation “had I known that my husband would have been physically abusive to me or would be mentally dysfunctional during our years of marriage I never would have married him” may be recognized as an <i>umdana</i> that may void the marriage, the answer is that it is subject to controversy.
In short, the brief review of these <i>piskei din</i> demonstrate how <i>Poskim</i> utilize the technique of <i>koah ha-hiddush</i> (innovative <i>halakhic</i> thinking) in general and implementing <i>medameh milta le-milta</i> (analogical inferences) in particular.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For further discussion, see this writer’s, <i>Rabbinic Authority,</i> vol. 1, 53–57.</i> Commencing with Maharam’s distinction between the Talmudic case of a husband who is afflicted with a skin disease where there exists a <i>tav le-meitav</i> presumption and an apostate husband and/or <i>yavam</i> who a wife never would have married,notwithstanding some decisors who reject the deployment of <i>umdana</i> during the marriage upon discovery of a husband’s flaw,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avodat</i> <i>ha-Gershuni</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i> 1:106<i>; Teshuvot Hatam Sofer EH</i> 2:82<i>; Teshuvot Kol Mevaseir</i> 1:29<i>; Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak EH</i> 2:25<i>.</i><br>Whether the debate concerning the invoking <i>umdana</i> inorder to establish the act of <i>kiddushin</i> and marriage is relevant to the employment of <i>umdana</i> as a vehicle to void a marriage we leave as an open question.

In the absence of <i>igun</i>, one approach of decision-making in addressing matters of <i>davar she-be-ervah</i> (matters of sexuality) is that an arbiter must be concerned <i>le-khathilah</i>, (<i>a priori</i>) and rule in accordance with the stringent opinions that prohibit <i>bittul kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Kedushat Yom Tov</i> 9; <i>Erech ha-Shulhan, EH</i> 42:2, 43:1; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i> 1:10, 4:12; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Rahamim, EH</i> 19; <i>Teshuvot Pnei Yitzhak</i> 1:10, 13.</i> In effect that means that, given that there are numerous authorities who explicitly prohibit implementing <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 8.</i> or implicitly fail to even mention the employment of <i>umdana</i> as a technique for voiding a marriage, if a husband fails to disclose a latent defect which existed prior to his marriage and subsequent to the creation of the marriage the wife discovers a “<i>mum gadol</i>”, a <i>get mi-safek</i> or a <i>get le-humra</i> as a precautionary stringency is required—no different than the situation of a husband who discovers a premarital grave flaw in his wife and decides to leave the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 6.</i> In effect, in the absence of <i>igun</i>, the position that prohibits voiding a marriage will be controlling and for the wife to remarry she will be required to be given a <i>get</i> by her husband.
What are the ramifications of being a victim of <i>igun</i>? In the world of <i>she’eilot u-teshuvot</i>, the <i>igun</i> situation of a young woman who desires to remarry has been aptly described by numerous <i>Poskim</i> as a <i>“sha’at ha-dehak</i>” (an emergency situation) and has been construed as a <i>be-diavad</i> situation—as if she has already remarried someone else.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Masat Binyamin</i> 44; <i>Shevut Ya’akov</i>, supra n. 8; <i>Teshuvot Re’eim</i> 1:36; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:1; R.

Consequently, in cases of <i>igun</i>, which may be construed as a <i>be-diavad</i> situation, as noted by both Ashkenazic and Sephardic <i>Poskim</i>, a decisor must factor the opinions of leniency into consideration.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 51:2; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 56; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 47; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 11–12,75; <i>Get Pashut, Kelal</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev, Orah Hayyim</i> (hereafter: OH) 96 (end), <i>HM</i> 14; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom, EH</i>, vol. 2, page 2, no. 35; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 68 ; R.

Moshe Feinstein. In one of his earliest <i>teshuvot</i>, which was authored in 1934 while still residing in Russia, R. Feinstein outlines his method of <i>halakhic</i> decision-making regarding the resolution of <i>igun</i> matters. Setting out the mandate for an arbiter who possesses the required credentials of a <i>Posek</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">For an arbiter’s credentials, see this writer’s, <i>Rabbinic Authority,</i> vol. 1, 53–63.

Laying out his methodology in confronting <i>igun</i> issues, which entails engaging, and critically investigating the rulings of <i>rishonim</i> (early decisors) and <i>aharonim</i> and marshaling cogent arguments to arrive at a decision that will withstand critique to serve as the framework for understanding R. Feinstein’s decisions regarding voiding marriages. Acutely aware of the need to be subservient to the rulings of Shulhan Arukh in outlining his approach to arriving at a decision, his judgments regarding <i>bittul kiddushin</i> are reflective of this concern. Whereas we observed that the silence of Shulhan Arukh regarding voiding marriages based upon a husband’s latent defects has propelled others to forbid freeing a wife without a <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 8. .</i> <i>argument ex silentio</i> of this sort is inconclusive in the mind of R. Feinstein. On the contrary, implementing his methodology of decision-making, given that Shulhan Arukh remains silent concerning the legitimacy of <i>bittul kiddushin</i> based upon a discovery of a husband’s preexisting major flaw opens the gateway for permitting him to search for a solution(s) to deal with matters of <i>igun</i>! In reply to those <i>Poskim</i> who contend that the <i>tav le-meitav</i> presumption ought to be applicable and therefore a <i>get</i> ought to be given <i>mi-safek</i> or as a stringent precaution, R. Feinstein follows in Rabbi Elhanan Spektor’s footsteps and argues that the presumption is inapplicable in cases where one coerces a <i>get</i>. Furthermore, giving a <i>get mi-safek</i> is only required when a husband has been deceived since, if he desires, he may divorce her. However, a wife who has been misled by her spouse and cannot be divorced without her husband’s consent clearly will not consent to live with a husband who has a major flaw. For example, many a wife will refuse to live with a husband who is sexually impotent even though he is willing to support her.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:33</i> Moreover, giving a <i>get le-humra,</i> which is a rabbinic decree, is only brought to bear concerning a wife’s defects, which tend to be a more frequent occurrence than a husband’s flaw.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79. See also <i>Seridei Eish</i>, ibid.</i>
Employing his methodology, R. Feinstein concludes that if a husband fails to disclose to his wife prior to the marriage that he was impotent or gay, upon the wife’s discovery of the latent flaw, unless she has a rational explanation for remaining married to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:45</i> she must immediately leave the marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:46, 4:14, 83.</i>. Given that these cases are examples of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, she is free to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i> from her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79, 80, 4:113.</i>
Others, either prior to the issuance of R. Feinstein’s rulings or after their appearance, such as Rabbis Suliman Abudi, A. Shapiro, Y. Cohen, Shaul Nathanson, Avraham Yudlovich, Yehoshua Ehrenburg, Ya’akov Rosenthal, Tzvi Pesah Frank, Shalom Messas, Ben Tzion Boaron, and others, invoke the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 10.</i> Realizing that the strength of the <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> will vary upon the circumstances of the case and that there is concomitantly an overarching concern regarding the prohibition of <i>hezkat eishit ish</i> (the presumption of being a married woman), some of these same aforementioned <i>Poskim</i>—such as Rabbis Feinstein (in a case of <i>halitzah</i>), Tzvi Pesah Frank (in the case of <i>halitzah</i>), Shalom Messas, and Ben Tzion Boaron—will free a woman without a <i>get</i> when there are grounds for utilizing the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>—provided there is a <i>halakhic</i> impropriety in the conduct of the couple’s wedding ceremony or post-marital circumstances that demonstrate <i>ada’ata dehakhi lo kidshah nafshah,</i> i.e. the operation of an <i>umdana.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 72; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 1:204; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i> 4:9–10; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 11.<br>One should not extrapolate from the above position of R.

Regarding the latter, whether the deployment of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> or <i>umdana</i> ought to be the sole method or whether one requires an additional justification for <i>bittul kiddushin</i> will be subject to the determination of each <i>dayan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">For example, numerous authorities would only employ <i>umdana</i> as one of the justifications to free a wife from the chains of <i>igun</i>. <i>See Hessed le-Avraham</i>, supra n. 54; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 6: 159; <i>Avnei Hefetz</i>, supra n. 40; <i>She’eilot Moshe</i>, supra n. 10; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 72; <i>Sha’arei Ezra</i>, supra n. 4; Lavi, supra n. 77.

See supra n. 77.</i> In short, in contradistinction to some <i>Poskim</i> who may rely upon a minority view under certain prescribed conditions,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 110;<i> Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:35; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 236(10); <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:25</i> R. Feinstein and others engage in rigorous analysis of the matter, delve into the views of their predecessors, and utilize methods such as reasoning by analogy in order to void a particular marriage retroactively. This drive to inquire into every aspect of the matter and seek lenient rulings regarding <i>agunah</i> situations is earlier espoused by Rabbis Yosef Kolon, Moshe Alshakar, Betzalel Ashkenazi, Shmuel de Medina, Menahem Krochmal, Dovid ben Shmuel Halevi, and Moshe Sofer, with the proviso that a <i>beit din</i> receives approval for one’s <i>psak din</i> from other Torah scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">See infra chapter 8(b) (end).</i>
The need for contemporary rabbinic arbiters and <i>battei din</i> to seek the approval of others is not only due to the fact that this is a practice amongst some decisors but equally because much of the debate today about what approach ought to be adopted in order to address the matter of <i>igun</i> transcends the formal question of whether a particular method can pass muster in our rabbinic sources.<i>The debate revolves around the question who has the credentials to make such a determination and who gives them that authority</i>.
In short, despite the fact that a wife is exempt from the <i>mitzvah</i> of procreation, R. Moshe Trani and many others contend that one of the driving forces for finding a resolution for the <i>agunah</i> situation is to preempt the possibility of her engaging in promiscuity.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:187; <i>Shevut Ya’akov,</i> supra n. 8; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Gavison</i> 82; <i>Teshuvot Re’eim</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:35; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:43; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 36(10).</i> As such, an <i>igun</i> case, regardless of whether we are dealing with a victim of <i>igun</i> who wants to remarry and/or have children, entails “a state of emergency” and therefore requires a <i>Posek’s</i> immediate attention to address this issue. Deciding between the competing arguments regarding the scope of employing various methods to void a marriage will be the sole prerogative of the <i>Posek</i> or a <i>beit din</i> of three.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">It is a matter of dispute whether one requires one rabbi or a <i>beit din</i> of three in order to address matters of <i>igun</i>. For this debate, see supra, Preface, note 2.</i> The relative strength of each argument applicable in each situation, its effectiveness, and its plausibility will hopefully be tested within the framework and constraints of future <i>halakhic</i> decisions of our <i>Poskim</i> and <i>piskei din</i> of our <i>battei din</i>. Given the fact that a <i>Posek</i> or <i>beit din</i> who engages in freeing a wife without a <i>get</i> may be viewed as “permitting a matter which is surprising that seems to many as permitting a prohibition”,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>SA, YD</i> 242:10</i> and in our scenario appears to be freeing a wife without a <i>get</i>, nevertheless—as others note—if the authority provides a reasoned opinion, one can recognize such a ruling.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shakh, SA, YD</i> 242:17</i> Moreover, as R. Feinstein notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Diberot Moshe, Ketuvot</i>, vol. 1, 244–245.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Those who are of the opinion to prohibit are well aware the basis for permitting the matter and they should not be surprised when they hear that there are others who allow it. And if they fail to understand the grounds for permitting they are not <i>morei hora’ah</i> (loosely translated as authorized arbiters in matters of prohibitions –AYW) and one should not be apprehensive of them at all and they must inquire into the matter and they will see the side of permitting the concern and they will no longer be surprised.</span>
Clearly, the fact that a <i>Posek</i> is dealing with an <i>igun</i> situation does not allow him to initially try to resolve the situation by inquiring whether there are grounds to void the marriage based upon an error or an <i>umdana</i>. <i>Le-khathilah</i> (<i>a priori</i>), should the facts dictate, an Israeli <i>dayan</i> must endeavor to hand down a decision which either results in a judgment of coercing him to give a <i>get</i> or obligating him to give a <i>get</i> that, in the event of noncompliance, may result in the husband being incarcerated or subject to economic sanctions (such as freezing his bank accounts, confiscating his passport, etc.).<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See Kaplan, supra n. 14.</i> On the other hand, <i>battei din</i> in the Diaspora are bereft of the authority to coerce a <i>get</i>, so even in the absence of a judgment to obligate a <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i> 2:80; File no. 022553515-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, December 12, 1997 (Rabbis Z. Goldberg, Topeck, and Zimbalist)</i> some <i>battei din</i> will direct the imposition of communal-social sanctions—such as directing the community to refrain from interacting with a recalcitrant husband and/or denying him synagogue honors (such as an <i>aliyah</i> to the Torah or assuming a leadership position).
Given that a <i>get</i> has not been forthcoming from the husband, we are dealing with an individual who is acting improperly <i>halakhically</i>. In other words, we are dealing with an individual who knows that nobody can force him to give a <i>get</i> to his wife and therefore he commits a sinful act against his wife. Generally speaking, we know there is a prohibition to litigate one’s monetary matters in a civil court.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh, HM</i> 26:1</i> Nevertheless, Rema, Maharashdam, and more recently the late R. H. Shlomo Sha’anan, a former <i>dayan</i> serving on the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol in Yerushalayim and others rule that in cases where a Jew does not act properly towards another Jew, <i>Halakhah</i> sanctions the aggrieved party to proceed in civil court to file monetary claims, including end-of-marriage issues and claims for emotional stress due to a husband’s abandonment, a wife’s inability to remarry, and/or her subsequent inability to have children—all matters that are unrelated to <i>get</i> recalcitrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rema,</i>108 (end); <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 189; <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat,</i> <i>EH</i> 64; <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat, HM</i> 3.<br>For the propriety of advancing claims for emotional stress, see Dayan Eliyahu Abergil, “The Validity of a <i>Get</i> in Light of a Severe Monetary Penalty Issued by a Civil Court,” (Hebrew) 35 <i>Tehumin</i> 272 (5775); this writer’s, “May a <i>Beit Din</i> Render a Judgment of Tort Compensation for an <i>Agunah</i>?” (Hebrew) 34 <i>Tehumin</i> 430 (5775); <i>Rabbinic Authority,</i> supra n. 90<i>,</i> 163–175.</i> With an award in hand, the <i>agunah</i> may then have leverage and negotiate with her husband the receipt of her <i>get</i> in exchange for waiving her civil award, either entirely or partially.
In conclusion, there is a well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> that advocates the employment of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and <i>umdana</i> as avenues to deal with a husband’s <i>get</i> recalcitrance and thus rescue a wife from her state of <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Our <i>limmud</i> seems to show that the majority of arbiters will validate the use of the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as a means to void<i> kiddushin</i> retroactively<i>.</i> See supra notes 8 and 10. Even assuming that we have reviewed everything that was written on this issue and therefore conclude that this position is a fair representation of the <i>rov</i> (the majority opinion) (See <i>Kitzur Takfo Kohen</i> 13 and <i>Teshuvot She’eilat Ya’avetz</i> 157 who pose the question whether one can ever assume that one has identified the entire spectrum of views and determined that a particular opinion is representative of the majority), numerous questions arise. For example, does the principle of abiding by majority rule apply only within the confines of <i>beit din</i> deliberation or does it equally apply to resolving varying views emerging in different times and in various geographical locations? Is <i>rov</i> reflective of <i>rov minyan</i> (a numerical majority) such as it existed during the deliberation proceedings of the Great <i>Sandehrin</i> or does it refer only to the majority of arbiters of <i>rov hokhmah</i> (a majority of equal rabbinic stature)? Can a cogent minority opinion trump a majority view? This entire matter is beyond the scope of our presentation.</i> In the event that none of the aforesaid avenues result in a husband giving a <i>get</i>, then <i>be-diavad</i> (<i>post facto</i>) a <i>beit din</i> may scrutinize the facts and determine whether in fact there are grounds to void a marriage based upon <i>ta’ut</i> or <i>umdana</i>.
As such, this technique ought to be utilized by our contemporary <i>battei din</i> and <i>Poskim</i>. As R. Feinstein observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:117</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“And it is a major prohibition to “<i>le-agein</i>” (to leave a wife “in chains”) if one has the ability to address the situation and does not resolve it.”</span>

Yet on the other hand, conferring a <i>get</i> upon her without her consent and without her personally receiving it or authorizing a <i>shaliach le-kabalah</i> (an agent for delivery) is problematic.
A husband can neither appoint for his a wife a <i>shaliach le-kabalah</i> to receive a <i>get</i> on her behalf nor can a third party appoint an agent due to the fact that a divorce entails a <i>hov</i> (a disadvantage) to the wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, <i>Gittin</i> 1:5, 6:1; <i>Yevamot</i> 118b; <i>Bava Metzia</i> 12a; <i>SA, EH</i> 140:5</i> Upon divorce, a wife loses her spousal support and therefore it is deemed a <i>hov</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharshal</i> and <i>Penei Yehoshua</i>, infra n. 14; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:75; Rabbi Moshe Bula, <i>Zekhut Moshe</i> 7.</i> As the Talmud states, <i>ein havin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i>, one cannot act to someone’s detriment in his absence, i.e. without his consent.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 11b</i>

According to numerous <i>Poskim</i>, an arbiter or a <i>beit din</i> may not direct the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> because, by its very essence, divorce is a <i>hov</i> and there remains a fear that she may have changed her mind in the interim and wants to remain married.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi <i>Gittin</i>, supra n. 9; <i>Korban ha-Eidah</i>, ad locum<i>; Penei Moshe</i>, ad locum; <i>Tur, EH</i> 140:6; <i>Beit Yosef</i> and <i>Bah,Tur, EH</i> 140; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 1:33.

Whereas in earlier times, wives were wedded sexually to their spouses and were economically dependent upon their husbands and subject to changing their minds, today, given that most women are employed and are haughty and proud, once they decide to become divorced, they will not change their minds.

See <i>SA, EH</i> 140:5 in the name of <i>Ran</i> on <i>Gittin</i>.</i> Maharshal, Penei Yehoshua, and others offer the following rationale for a wife’s desire to remain married: <i>tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu</i>, it is better to live as two than to remain in widowhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam shel Shlomo, Gitti</i>n 4:7; <i>Penei Yehoshua, Gittin</i> 12b.

That being said, there are various instances within the context of marriage that are recognized by some <i>Poskim</i> where it would be a <i>zekhut gemurah</i> or <i>berurah</i> (hereafter: <i>a zekhut</i>)—an absolute benefit—for us to mandate a <i>get zikui</i> on behalf of a wife.

Some of the cited authorities emphasize that this was the <i>minhag</i>, while others issue a ruling without mentioning whether in fact this was the <i>minhag</i>. Whether the existence of a <i>minhag</i> is <i>halakhically</i> significant, see <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, infra n. 19.<br>Though the aforementioned <i>teshuvot</i> deal with an apostate wife, argues R.

Lipman concludes in his ruling by mandating that she should receive a second <i>get</i>.<br>The Sanzer Rov argues that divorcing an apostate wife may not constitute a <i>zekhut</i> because she may want to remain in the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 87. Yet, he admits that “those who permit outnumber” the others who prohibit the execution of a <i>get zikui</i>. Moreover, since according to some <i>Poskim</i> <i>zakhin</i> is a <i>gezeirat ha-katuv</i> (a scriptural decree), we are therefore unconcerned that she refuses to accept it. See <i>Avnei Miluim, SA, EH</i> 1:5; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 7:218.<br>Since it is a question whether the apostate wife may have been promiscuous and some contend that she may return to her husband, therefore R. Schmelkes claims that giving a <i>get</i> under such conditions possibly may be viewed as a <i>hov</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, EH</i> 31(end).<br>The Talmud states that we immerse a minor convert in the <i>mikveh</i> because <i>beit din</i> invokes <i>zakhin</i> and confers upon him the benefit, namely that he hasn’t engaged in any prohibition. See <i>Ketuvot</i> 11a. Based upon this passage, since we are dealing with <i>zehut ha-nefesh</i>, Gaon of Vilna extrapolates that in the case of an apostate wife we can execute a <i>get zikui</i>. See <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 1:33. Drawing an analogy from the instance of a minor convert to the case of an apostate wife is open to various challenges. Firstly, whereas in conversion he becomes a Jew via the circumcision and immersion performed by the minor, in the divorce situation, it is the <i>mezakeh</i> who facilitates the execution of the <i>get</i>. Secondly, whereas in conversion he may choose to opt out of the Jewish religion upon his reaching majority age, in the situation of divorce, the apostate wife remains divorced even if she lodges objections.</i> Under these circumstances the divorce is viewed as a benefit because there is a presumption that she will engage in illicit affairs and it is better for her if such conduct is committed by her as a single woman rather than as a married one.

Concern that a wife who refuses to accept a <i>get</i> may engage in illicit affairs drives R. Messas to view it as a <i>zekhut</i> to confer upon her a <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen, EH</i> 4:109.</i> in accordance with Rashi, Beit Yosef, Rema, and Arukh ha-Shulhan, R. Yitzhak Weiss, R.

As <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, supra n. 17 observes, Maharik is concerned for the Rif’s position that the <i>get</i> must delivered into the wife’s hand. Yet, as noted by Rabbis Reischer, Eisenstadt and others, numerous authorities (such as <i>Rashi, Yevamot</i> 118b, <i>Milhamot ha-Shem, Gittin</i> 11b; <i>Ran</i>, ad locum; <i>MT, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 9:21) reject Rif’s view and therefore one should not be concerned for Maharik’s minority view.

Akiva Eiger Hadashot</i> (Budapest, 5698) 3:79, <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:139), as <i>Poskim</i> note—when Rema identifies the second opinion as a stringency rather than prohibiting the execution of a <i>get zikui</i>, it is “<i>a kelal gadol</i>” (a major principle) in his rulings that Rema in actuality endorses the first opinion that it is permissible. See <i>Sefer Yad Malakhi</i>, page 199. In fact, others either cite Rema as permitting a <i>get zikui</i> in such a case or understand that this is his position. See e. g. <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 70(end); E. Shapiro, <i>Minhat Elazar</i>, supra n. 17.</i> The <i>halakhic</i>-moral calculus here is that it is preferable that she engage in her improper conduct as a single woman rather than as a married woman.

In addition to the aforementioned cases of an apostate wife and adulterous wife there are other situations of invoking <i>zakhin</i> in family matters. For example, a husband may confer a <i>get</i> for the benefit of his wife lest he die and be childless and she is obligated to marry her brother-in-law whom she does not desire. Clearly, under these conditions, <i>zikui get</i> to this wife, lest the brother-in-law refuse to release from the marriage via the performance of <i>halitzah</i>, is an absolute benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam Shel Shlomo, Yevamot</i> 15:21; <i>Taz, SA, EH</i> 145:7; <i>Beit Meir</i>, ad. locum.; <i>Mahaneh Ephraim</i>, infra n. 90.</i> In our contemporary context, let us examine a couple that is civilly divorced, physically separated from each other, and the wife engages in the commission of <i>issurim</i> (prohibitions) and refuses to receive a <i>get</i> from her husband. Given that they are civilly divorced, R. Feinstein and R. Tzvi Makovsky argue that the <i>tav le-meitav tan do mi-le-meitav armalu</i> is rebutted. Moreover, there is a concern that she may become promiscuous and she may desire to remarry; under such conditions we are dealing with a divorce that is a <i>zekhut</i>. Consequently, we may execute a <i>get zikui</i> and the husband and wife may remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, infra n. 31; <i>Teshuvot Yehaveh Da’at</i> 16. See also, <i>Tevuot Shemesh</i>, supra n. 19; Dayan Eliyahu Abergil, <i>Teshuvot Dibrot Eliyahu</i> 7:73. Though R. Yehezkel Landau contends that being promiscuous a few times does not serve as the basis for viewing the divorce as a <i>zekhut</i>, nonetheless the fact that in the particular community there are very few Torah-observant Jews increases the probability of a wife’s licentious behavior and therefore Rabbi Landau may agree that the divorce is a <i>zekhut</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, EH</i> 92; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, op.cit.</i> All of the aforementioned multifarious situations are viewed as examples of an absolute benefit to the wife and therefore the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> is in place. In all of these cases, once the <i>get</i> is in the husband’s possession she is divorced and the <i>mezakeh</i> (the one who conferred the benefit) is <i>the agent for delivery</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See infra text accompanying n. 43. Whether the grounds for a <i>mezakehh’s</i> role is <i>le-afrushei mei-issura</i> (to prevent a violation) or is due to <i>arevut</i> (responsibility for one’s fellow Jew) is beyond the scope of our presentation. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 1, <i>anaf</i> 2.<br>For the effectiveness of <i>get zikui</i> regarding a mentally dysfunctional wife, see <i>Noda be-Yehudah</i>, supra n. 17, as understood by <i>Teshuvot Minhat Shlomo</i> 1:79; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 1:29(4); <i>Teshuvot Pri Tevuah</i> 27. For additional <i>Poskim</i> who concur with this view, see Tzfat Beit Din, infra n. 55, at 27–29.</i> In other words, though in a conventional situation the wife is empowered to appoint the agent, here, within the context of operating with <i>zakhin</i>, the <i>mezakeh</i> in effect becomes the agent!
Seemingly all of these varied rulings undermine the Talmudic ruling that any third party who receives a <i>get</i> on behalf of the wife must have her prior authorization to be a delivery agent, which is an uncontested requirement in terms of normative <i>halakhah</i>. Absent such empowerment, any subsequent execution of the <i>get</i> ought to be null and void if she continues to refuse to be divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">If upon the execution of the <i>get</i>, she sanctions the action, it is subject to debate whether she is divorced or not.

Moshe Feinstein,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:6</i> implicit in this argumentation is that the concept of <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i> is grounded in the notion of agency. To state it differently, the individual who bestows the benefit functions as the agent even though he hasn’t been appointed by the beneficiary. Given that the establishment of agency by appointment is a rudimentary requirement,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 182:1</i> how can one waive this requirement? In the absence of a formal appointment, since this action will benefit another party, we recognize a <i>halakhic fiction</i>—we presume that had the beneficiary known about the benefit that would accrue from the action, he would have appointed the individual. In effect, numerous authorities contend that we are dealing here with a situation of constructive agency.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Bava Metzia</i> 12a; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 11a; <i>Ran, Nedarim</i> 36b; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Gittin</i> 1:13; <i>Birkat Shmuel, Kiddushin</i> 10(2) in the name of Rabbi Hayyim of Brisk in his understanding of <i>MT, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 3:14</i> Consequently, should the wife protest the divorce, she would still be married. Subscribing to this approach that <i>zakhin</i> is grounded in agency <i>halakhah</i>, it is readily understandable why one is proscribed from conferring the benefit of a <i>get</i> upon a wife who is a <i>shoteh</i> (mentally dysfunctional) in accordance to <i>halakhah</i> and hasn’t authorized an agent to receive her <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Panim Meirot</i> 1:4; <i>Teshuvot Nishal Dovid, EH</i> 33; <i>Teshuvot Tiferet Tzvi</i> 5 in the name of R.

On the other hand, R. Feinstein argues that those who are of the opinion that <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i> is operative in situations of an apostate or adulterous wife contend that the <i>zakhin</i> principle is not connected to agency.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Kiddushin</i> 42a; <i>Shakh, Nekudot ha-Kessef</i> <i>Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 305.</i> Others understand that the <i>halakhic</i> system (characterized as a <i>gezerat ha-katuv</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 105:1.</i>) imputes power to the individual (<i>yad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, supra n. 36; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rim, Gittin</i> 12b.</i>-loosely translated as an extended hand) conferring the benefit. Alternatively, if an individual is empowered to derive benefit for himself, he can equally accomplish the same action for another rather than be grounded in the institution of agency.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Kiddushin</i> 23b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Kiddushin</i> 42a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Kiddushin</i> 42a; Rabbi Shkop, <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Shimon ha-Kohen, Gittin, Siman</i> 4; Rabbi Urbach, <i>Imrei Binah, HM, Geviyat Hov</i>, 29(4);<i>Be-Ikvei ha-Tzon</i> 30(5) in the name of R. Yosef B. Soloveitchik.</i> Finally, some contend that <i>Halakhah</i> recognizes agency established by <i>harsha’ah</i> (authorization) as well as agency that can be created without prior permission. <i>Zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i> is to be subsumed under the rubric of agency without authorization.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Birkat Shmuel, Kiddushin</i> 10(3), 15.</i> Consequently, the net result of adopting this approach of <i>zakhin</i> that is not akin to agency is that a benefit may be conferred without the consent of the beneficiary. In effect, invoking <i>zakhin</i> would be effective in instances of an apostate or adulterous wife or upon issuance of a civil divorce involving a woman who is non-Torah observant, even should she lodge objections. Consequently, invoking <i>zakhin</i>, one can readily understand why one may view divorce as a benefit when resulting in the divorce of mentally dysfunctional wife whose husband had remarried despite her incapability of articulating her personal wishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pri Tevuah</i>, supra n. 29; <i>Teshuvot Nishal Dovid, EH</i> 33 in the name of R.

The ramifications of employing <i>zakhin</i> within the context of divorce cases does not merely center upon how one conceptually defines the institution of <i>zakhin</i>. How one views <i>zakhin</i> is inexorably linked with defining the nature of a wife’s consent to divorce. Does one require the wife’s actual consent or can one impute her consent? If we subscribe to the latter position, what are the criteria for imputing her consent? Regarding the scenario of the apostate wife who refuses to accept a <i>get</i>, those who contend that <i>zakhin</i> is inapplicable implicitly are advocating that her subjective wishes are determinative.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 21.</i> On the other hand, those who invoke, in R. Moshe Bula’s nomenclature, <i>zekhut ha-nefesh</i> (her spiritual benefit) argue that <i>zakhin</i> is operative to receive a <i>get</i> in order to avoid engaging in licentious behavior, even trumping the wife’s protestations.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 17 and 22.

Yet, there are decisors who would coerce an apostate husband to give a <i>get</i> on the assumption that his inner will is to be observant. See <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot, MT Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20(4); <i>Mordekhai, Gittin</i> 450, Rabinowitz ed.; <i>Orhot Hayyim</i>, Berlin, <i>Gittin</i> 156. Therefore, we may assume that an apostate wife who refuses to receive her <i>get</i> also seeks in her heart to be observant.</i> In fact, R. Bula seemingly notes that Rashba, who endorses <i>zakhin</i> even if the wife “stands and shouts”,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashba</i>, infra n. 90.</i> identifies with this understanding of <i>zekhut</i> entailing a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zekhut Moshe</i>, supra n. 10. We use the word “seemingly” because in different places of his presentation, Rabbi Bula finds that there are contradictions in Rashba’s position. See also, <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yisrael, EH</i> 5 <i>Kuntres Heter Agunah</i>.<br>In fact, if there is <i>minhag</i> to execute a <i>get zikui</i> for a wife, one can rely on Rashba’s ruling. See <i>Avnei Miluim, EH</i> 1:5</i> Similarly, those who invoke <i>zakhin</i> concerning an adulterous wife who objects to receiving a <i>get</i> explicitly espouse the notion that here again we are dealing with a <i>zekhut ha-nefesh</i> (a spiritual benefit) to receive a <i>get</i> rather than remain in a marriage marked by infidelity. On the other hand, those who contend that the wife’s objections remain paramount will reject the applicability of <i>zakhin</i> and understand the <i>zekhut</i> of receiving a <i>get</i> in subjective terms rather than in objective terms, which would be defined by <i>halakhic</i> criteria.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 21.</i>
In sum, whether one can confer the benefit of divorce upon a recalcitrant wife focuses upon the applicability of the institution of <i>zakhin</i>, the rational underlying its workings, and the nature of the <i>zekhut</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>2. Acting for the Absolute Benefit of a Husband (“<i>zakhin mei-adam</i>”)</b></span>
As we have shown, the notion of <i>zakhin le-adam sh-elo be-fanov</i> entails conferring a benefit upon one individual by another. For example, if a debtor has only one creditor, then a friend of the creditor may seize the property on behalf of the creditor.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 105</i> If someone wants to give money or chattel to another and the beneficiary is absent, he will acquire it on behalf of another via the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of accepting the gift).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 243:1</i> Or, if a husband desires to give his wife a <i>get</i> but she refuses, we explained that it may be a benefit to her to become divorced under certain conditions and the <i>get</i> is executed in her absence and without her prior authorization. The common denominator of these cases is that an individual—a wife, a creditor, or a gift recipient—has benefited unknowingly from the action of another. In these instances, we invoke the concept of <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i>.
The question that emerges is whether <i>zakhin</i> applies when we <i>take away something</i> from an individual. For example, if someone neglected to sell his <i>hametz</i> on the eve of <i>Pesah</i> and the <i>hametz</i> potentially would lose its value,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The loss of value would be due to the fact that one’s <i>hametz</i> which is not sold to a non-Jew prior to <i>Pesah</i>; one is prohibited to derive any benefit from it after <i>Pesah</i>.</i> can a friend sell it prior to <i>Pesah</i> on behalf of his friend? Or should a husband refuse to give a <i>get</i> to his wife, may we say it is a <i>zekhut</i> for him to give the <i>get</i> and therefore a third party ought to give it to his wife despite his protestations? Since the execution of the <i>get</i> entails the husband’s decision to voluntarily give it and personally write the <i>get</i> or delegate it to a scribe, how can a third party initiate the process without prior the husband’s prior consent and authorization? In both of these scenarios, the person who owns the <i>hametz</i> and the husband who refuses to give a <i>get</i> will be deprived of something or someone, respectively, due to the action of another. To state it differently, we know there is a rule of <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i>, can one equally engage in situations involving <i>zakhin mei-adam</i>?
Admittedly, throughout various passages of the Talmud, commentaries, <i>teshuvot</i>, and <i>sifrei psak</i> (restatements of <i>Halakhah</i>) such as Shulhan Arukh, one finds <i>zakhin</i> being applied in circumstances where a benefit is being conferred rather being taken away from an individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Encyclopedia Talmudit</i>, vol. XII, 135–198.</i> However, there are various instances which we find, both in the Talmud and <i>Poskim</i>, a recognition that <i>zakhin</i> is equally operative in situations where one takes something from an individual.
A passage in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> informs us,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesahim</i> 13a. See also <i>Gittin</i> 52a.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There was an incident with a man who deposited for safekeeping a bag full of <i>hametz</i> with . . . But when the eve of Pesah arrived, mice penetrated it and the <i>hametz</i> was leaking out. He approached a rabbi and asked what he should do. At the first hour, he told him “wait”, second hour he told him “wait” . . . at the fifth hour, he told him “proceed to the market and sell it . . . to a non-Jew”</span>
Since the fifth hour was the last hour that the owner of the <i>hametz</i> could benefit from his foodstuffs, the rabbi instructed the man to sell it to a non-Jew before <i>Pesah</i> because with the arrival of <i>Pesah</i> the <i>hametz</i> would be prohibited to the owner and thus the owner would lose the <i>hametz</i>.
A passage in Tractate <i>Ketuvot</i> teaches us,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 11a</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A prospective boy of minority age, one can immerse him in a <i>mikvah</i> with the consent of <i>beit din</i> . . . it is a benefit for him and <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i>.</span>
Here, the minor did not derive any benefit from any object.
Based upon the foregoing as well as additional sources, notwithstanding Ketzot ha-Hoshen,Mirkevet ha-Mishneh and a few other authorities, the <i>majority</i> of <i>Poskim</i> including, but not limited to, Tosafot, Rabbis Moshe ben Nahman, Nissim of Gerondi, Yisrael Isserelin, Yosef Karo, Moshe Issereles, Dovid ben Shmuel ha-Levi, Avraham Gumbiner, Moshe Sofer, Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, Avraham Tzvi Eisenstadt, Meir Eisenstadt, Hayyim Ozer Grodzensky, Avraham Karelitz, Shimon Shkop, Shalom Schwadron, Avraham Kook, Eliezer Shach, Shlomo Z.

Cf. <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 243:8; <i>Mirkevet ha-Mishneh, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 6:3.</i>
The threshold question is whether there is a basis for invoking <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> in the context of divorce cases. Seemingly, the question hinges directly upon the issue whether <i>zakhin</i> encompasses a divorce situation, which entails <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> (taking something from the husband), namely the benefits of being married? In effect, may one take a <i>get</i> from a husband without his consent and give it to the wife? However, there are various threshold questions that must be addressed prior to dwelling on this matter. <i>Zakhin,</i> on the one hand, entails the world of <i>kinyanim</i> such as the <i>halakhot</i> of gifts, loans, and bailment—which are matters of <i>mamon</i> (financial matters), whereas marriage and divorce entails a matter of <i>issura</i> (prohibition).
The betrothal (<i>kiddushin</i>) relationship is a consensual agreement,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 26, 37–39</i> albeit a special agreement that establishes a personal status—namely that of a <i>mekudeshet</i> (a woman designated for a particular man and prohibited to all others).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 2b</i> The establishment of this status known as <i>ishut</i> renders both spouses subject to various prohibitions—e.g. sexual relations with various relatives becomes prohibited.
From the perspective of the husband there is a <i>halakhic</i> duty to engage in conjugal relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de-R. Yishmael, Mishpatim</i> 3, ed. Horowiz-Rabin, 258–259.</i> In addition, spouses are mutually bound to each other (in the form of <i>she’ibud</i>—servitude) in conjugal relations as a consequence of marriage. As R. Shlomo ben Aderet (known by the acronym: Rashba) notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Nedarim</i> 15b. Additionally, see <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Gittin</i> 75a.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“They are mutually in servitude and this is the reason that they decided to marry.”</span>
Arguing that a husband’s <i>she’ibud</i> derives from the <i>kinyan</i> of sexual relations, R. Avraham Min Hahar points out that this is based upon the biblical verse “If any man takes a wife”.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i> 22:13</i> Obviously, as is noted, a husband’s servitude is not to be construed as enslavement.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Torah Temimah, Vayikra</i> 22:11.</i> Clearly, the scope of the <i>she’ibud</i> is limited to conjugal relations and even within the context of engaging in sexual relations, a husband is proscribed from engaging in spousal abuse and rape.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s “Harnessing the Authority of <i>Beit Din</i> to Deal with Cases of Domestic Violence,” 45 <i>Tradition</i> 37 (2012) reprinted with revisions as chapter 3 in this writer’s <i>Rabbinic Authority, vol. 2</i>.</i> Emerging from the establishment of marriage in general, and the husband’s <i>she’ibud</i> in particular, there are certain monetary duties that are incumbent upon him as a husband, such as spousal maintenance. In short, despite the fact that the institution of matrimony is multi-dimensional with elements consisting of <i>mamon</i> as well as <i>issur</i>, nonetheless a husband is clearly not acquiring a wife through matrimony. Consequently, even those <i>Poskim</i> who claim that <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> is ineffective in applying the mechanism of <i>zekhiya</i> in regard to financial matters ought to agree that by marriage it is effective, since we are creating marital ties based upon <i>ishut</i> rather than by acquisition. <sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif, Gittin</i> 9a; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 2:35; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 123:9; <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 4; <i>Avnei Miluim, Teshuvot</i> 17<i>; Ohr Sameah, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 9:20; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 55.

Employing R. Klatzkin’s terminology, the <i>zakhin</i> rule has the capacity to be <i>mafkia shei’budo</i> (annul a husband’s servitude)?<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dvar Halakhah, miluim</i> 93.</i> As Dayan Uriel Lavi demonstrates via a detailed and meticulous citation of excerpts of <i>teshuvot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Tzfat Regional Beit Din, supra n. 55 at 36–44.</i> under certain conditions, Noda be-Yehudah, Hatam Sofer, Sefer Petach ha-Bayit, Maharash Engel, Rabbi Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, Ahiezer, Erech Shai, Har Zvi, R. Elyashiv, Tzitz Eliezer, and others endorse the applicability of <i>zakhin</i> where there exists a <i>zekhut</i> (an absolute benefit) or a <i>zekhut be-atzmuto</i> (a benefit in its essence) for a husband to become divorced.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Noda be-Yehudah</i>, supra n. 17; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 55; <i>Sefer Petach ha-Bayit</i>, supra n. 55; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:186; <i>Mirkevet ha-Mishneh</i>, supra n. 55 in the name of Rabbi Krotosyn; <i>Be’eir Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 55; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 1:28(16); <i>Erech Shai, EH</i> 35; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:64; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:155; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 5:23. Some of the cited <i>Poskim</i> will require an appointment of an agent or at least a <i>gilui da’at</i> by the husband prior to employing <i>zakhin</i> and one giving the <i>get</i> in the place of the husband while others will neither require a designation of an agent nor a <i>gilui da’at</i>. For example, in accordance with Hatam Sofer, <i>gilui da’at</i> is effective provided we are dealing with a situation where we are saving the husband from the edict of Rabbeinu Gershom. See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 2:43. Or in accordance with <i>Ahiezer</i>, op. cit., <i>Beit Avi</i>, op. cit, <i>Ameirah Ne’imah</i>, Ma’amar 125, <i>Har Tzvi,</i> op. cit. and <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:177 who invoke <i>zakhin</i> provided that there was a directive of the husband to give a <i>get</i>. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 55.See infra text accompanying n. 83.<br>For the role of <i>gilui da’at</i> in R. Elyashiv’s rulings, see <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:177 at subsections 3,8,and 11.</i> Implicit in this position endorsed by many <i>Poskim</i>, despite the fact that marriage is multi-dimensional with elements consisting of <i>mamon</i> as well as <i>issur, zakhin</i> is operative since we are creating marital ties based upon <i>ishut</i> rather than by acquisition.
To contend that <i>zakhin</i> is effective without a husband’s mandate to give a <i>get</i> is innovative. Seemingly, employing a <i>get zikui</i> for the husband’s benefit will run afoul of the <i>halakhic</i> procedural stricture against the husband’s absence of involvement in the <i>seder ha-get</i> (the executing of the <i>get</i>). In pursuance to Shulhan Arukh’s ruling, a <i>get</i> must be written either by the husband <i>le-shemah</i> (specifically for his wife) or he must designate a scribe and two witnesses to write the <i>get</i> and confirm the divorce respectively—and if it is written without his prior authorization, the <i>get</i> is null and void. <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 120:1; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 123:1</i> Consequently, even if the wife wrote the <i>get le-shemah</i> without the husband’s directive to write it, or the scribe wrote it <i>le-shemah</i> without the husband’s instructions, the <i>get</i> is a nullity.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, EH</i> 123 in the name of Ramah, <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, infra n. 69; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Gittin</i> 23a; <i>Pri Hadash, EH</i> 123:1; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 123:1</i> Relying upon Ramban’s view, Shulhan Arukh rules that neither the scribe is empowered to write nor witnesses are authorized to sign until the husband personally informs then to write and sign. And when the husband authorizes them to execute the <i>get</i>, they are not permitted to delegate the writing and signing to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 120:4. See also, <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 141:27.</i>
It therefore is unsurprising to find that, in part due to the requirement of needing a husband’s consent as well the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i> by the husband, Mirkevet ha-Mishnah is propelled to negate the possibility of <i>zakhin mei-adam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mirkevet ha-Mishneh,</i> supra n. 55</i> Others such as Ohr Zarua, Ketzot ha-Hoshen, and Emek Yehoshua agree with his conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i>, vol. 2, <i>Pesahim</i> 224; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> supra n. 55; <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 36:2; <i>Teshuvot Emek Yehoshua</i> 21.</i>
Furthermore, it is unsurprising that one of the primary reasons that contemporary decisors such as R. Moshe Farbstein, R. Yitzhak Yosef and others find a <i>get zikui</i> unacceptable is due to noncompliance with the <i>le-shemah</i> requirement, namely the absence of a husband’s instructions to both the scribe and the witnesses to write and sign the <i>get</i>, respectively.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Letter of R.

Implicitly, the above <i>Poskim</i> are relying on <i>Tosafot</i>, Meiri, Ran, and R. Ya’akov of Lisa who contend that the absence of a husband’s instructions to write the <i>get</i> precludes the obtaining of the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i>. See <i>Tosafot, Gittin</i> 22b; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Gittin</i> 23a; <i>Beit ha-Behirah, Gittin</i> 22b; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif, Gittin</i> 11a; <i>Torat Gittin</i> 32b; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 4:43.</i> In the absence of a husband’s mandate to write a <i>get</i>, even if the scribe wrote the <i>get</i> specifically for the wife, the <i>get</i> would be invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Eruvin</i> 13b. If a wife writes the <i>get</i>, it is subject to debate whether the <i>get</i> is kosher. See <i>Beit Shmuel, SA EH</i> 123:1.</i>
In light of Ramban’s position, we do encounter grounds for validating a <i>get zikui</i> in a situation where husband did not provide instructions to write a <i>get</i>. Upon a review of the aforementioned Ramban’s position,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Gittin</i> 23a (<i>hashmatot</i>), 24b; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif, Gittin</i> 32b in the name of Ramban. Ramban’s position is cited approvingly in contemporary times by R. Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg. See Z. Nehemiah Goldberg, “Agency and Conferring Benefit in <i>Kiddushin, Get</i>, and Undertaking Obligations,” (Hebrew) 1 <i>Le-Ma’an Da’at</i> 61, Elul 5774. This <i>teshuvah</i> was published a few months after the decision handed down by the Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55, and in this <i>teshuvah</i> R. Goldberg confirmed via his presentation the propriety of <i>get zikui</i> in the Tzfat Beit Din decision.</i> we encounter a seemingly self-contradiction in his words. On one hand, should there be a husband’s letter directing the scribe to write a <i>get</i>, he would be in compliance with the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i>. On the other hand, Ramban contends that the scribe must have received explicit verbal instructions from the husband to prepare a <i>get</i>. Resolving this seeming contradiction, R. Feinstein argues that Ramban’s position is that it must be crystal clear that the husband wants to initiate the process of divorce, i.e. <i>le-shemah</i>. As we know, the presumption is that a wife is <i>lav le-gerushin omedet</i> (that she is not destined to be divorced) and therefore there is a requirement of <i>le-shemah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Following in the footsteps of <i>Tosafot, Zevahim</i> 2b, Ramban rules that the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i> is to insure that the wife is “<i>le-gerushin omedet</i>”, she is destined for divorce. See infra text accompanying n. 79. Should a wife have a <i>get</i> written without the instructions of her husband, there is a debate whether she is <i>le-gerushin omedet.</i> See <i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 123; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 13:1.<br>According to R. Y. Hapstein, the Maggid of Koznitz, upon a husband’s refusal to give her <i>get</i>, the wife assumes the status of “<i>le-gerushin omedet</i>”. See <i>Sefer ha-Yovel Karnot Tzadik</i> in the name of R. Hapstein, author of <i>Beit Yisrael</i>. See infra n. 105.</i> Consequently, if the husband communicates verbal instructions to the scribe or writes a letter that he wants the scribe to draft a <i>get</i>, his intentions are clear and the <i>le-shemah</i> condition is obtained.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:116,119.<br>For a differing interpretation of Ramban’s insistence that the husband write or appoint another to write the <i>get</i>, see <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Beit Ridvaz</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 3:25(2);<i> Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av EH</i> 30; <i>Marheshet</i> 2:10;<i> Yad Dovid, Piskei Halakhot</i>, vol. 1, 55b.<br>Relying upon a letter (authored by a husband who was living far away from his wife) that states that he desires to be divorced and remarry (namely a <i>gilui da’at</i>), <i>Maharsham</i> rules that despite the fact that there wasn’t an actual mandate from the husband, the wife is free due to the fact that she is <i>le-gerushin omedet,</i> i.e. because she has been an <i>agunah</i> for ten years. See <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:146.</i> To state it differently, Ramban is concerned with verifiability that in fact the husband desires to initiate a divorce process rather than the husband must initiate the process of mandating the writing of the <i>get</i>.
Based upon R. Feinstein’s understanding of Ramban, which subsequently receives Shulhan Arukh’s endorsement, in the context of <i>zakhin</i>, where the husband is absent, the scribe is receiving a directive from the <i>beit din</i> to draft the bill of divorce and he is well aware that this procedure is being implemented to benefit the husband. In other words, without a husband’s directive to initiate the process, the <i>get</i> is a <i>hov</i>. However, if there is an absolute unmitigated benefit, divorce is no longer a <i>hov</i>. As such, despite the absence of the husband’s instructions, based upon R. Feinstein’s elucidation of Ramban’s view the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i> is in effect being verified via the rule of <i>zakhin</i>. Following in the footsteps of R. Akiva Eiger and Hazon Ish, in the words of R. Herzog,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei R. Akiva Eiger, Bava Metzia</i> 22a<i>; Hazon Ish EH</i> 86:1-2<i>; Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:54. (For a similar formulation, see <i>Miluei Even</i> 29).<br>Though in other portions of this ruling and others (see <i>Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> 8:189) R. Herzog states that a <i>get</i> <i>zikui</i> will be effective provided that the husband gives explicit instructions to the scribe and authorizes an agent to deliver the <i>get</i>, it our understanding if there is a <i>zekhut</i> such a requirement wouldn’t be required.<br>In accordance with <i>Tosafot Gittin</i> 72a, s.v. <i>kolo</i>; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i> EH 156:9; and <i>Hiddushei R. Shimon Shkop, Gittin</i> 7(11-12) argue that if <i>zakhin</i> is invoked in a matter of  divorce then one can instruct the scribe and the witnesses in place of the husband. Cf. O. Weiss, <i>Minhat Asher Kiddushin</i> 47.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since it is a clear benefit for her, the <i>get</i> will not be a nullity due to the fact that the husband did not instruct . . . it is as if the husband is in front of us and commands . . .</span>
Following in the footsteps of R. Hayyim Ozer and Hazon Ish, in a subsequent <i>teshuvah</i> rules R.

Numerous <i>Poskim</i> arrive at the same conclusion contending that either <i>zakhin</i> preempts the need for a husband’s instructions to the scribe and the witnesses or the requirement of <i>le-shemah</i> is in effect being accomplished through her status of “<i>le-gerushin omedet</i>” (she is destined for divorce).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 77; <i>Teshuvot Havazelet ha-Sharon, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 72;<i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 108, hagahah; R.

As we discussed regarding a <i>get zikui</i> for a wife, according to certain authorities <i>zakhin</i> will be effective once the <i>get</i> is in the husband’s possession and the <i>mezakeh</i> (the one who confers the benefit) is the agent for delivery.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying n. 29.</i> The question is whether a <i>gilui da’at</i> must have been articulated by the husband prior to executing a <i>get zikui</i>.

For example, if a husband is insistent that he appoint a <i>shaliach le-holakhah</i> (an agent who will deliver his <i>get</i> to his wife) or actually appointed a <i>shaliach</i>, can a third party invoke <i>zakhin</i> and give a <i>get</i> to the wife? R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, R. Eliyahu Klatzkin, and R.

In a case where the husband’s appointment is invalid, his <i>gilui da’at</i> to become divorced will not have validity. Nonetheless, the <i>get</i> may be executed provided that it is a <i>zekhut</i> for the husband to be divorced. See <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i>, supra n. 66.</i> Moreover, when dealing with a husband who is a <i>shoteh</i> (mentally dysfunctional in accordance with <i>halakhic</i> criteria), a husband’s <i>gilui da’at</i> to give a <i>get</i> prior to becoming a <i>shoteh</i> is irrelevant in establishing the husband’s benefit.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Get Pashut</i> 121:10; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 86:3, 49:10. Cf. R. Farbstein’s contention that a <i>gilui da’at</i> prior to becoming dysfunctional will be determinative. See R. Moshe Farbstein’s letter dated Sivan 5774 to Dayan Lavi (on file with author). Clearly, a review of <i>Hazon Ish</i>’s words corroborates Dayan Lavi’s understanding.<br>Others claim that <i>zakhin</i> will be effective even in the absence of the husband’s writing the <i>get</i>.

Yisrael Minzberg sharply attacks those authorities who sanction a <i>get zikui</i> when it is in the husband’s benefit by showing a few places that a husband expressed an interest in giving a <i>get</i>, yet he fails to provide any proof that such an option would be ineffective in the presence of an absolute benefit. In fact, R. Minzberg readily admits,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’eirit Yisrael</i>, supra n. 47, at 5(3), page 252.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">ºIf it is a <i>zekhut gamurah</i> (an absolute benefit), a <i>beit din</i> may appoint an agent without his knowledge.</span>
In short, our understanding of <i>zakhin</i> regarding the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> from a husband is identical to our perception of <i>zakhin</i> concerning benefiting a <i>get</i> to a wife. As we explained, despite the fact that the wife doesn’t appoint an agent for delivery for the <i>get</i>, nonetheless due to <i>zakhin</i>, which imputes power to the <i>mezakeh</i>, the net result is that the husband serves as the agent for delivery.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying note 29.</i> On the other hand, generally the husband or his appointed agent gives the <i>get</i> to his wife. Here, though the <i>mezakeh</i> is not the husband’s agent to give the <i>get</i>, nevertheless a <i>beit din</i> is empowered to give the <i>get</i> to his wife without a husband’s knowledge.
Based upon the foregoing, we have various authorities that view <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> under the rubric of <i>zakhin le-adam</i>, that the <i>le-shemah</i> requirement and the requisite need of the husband or his agent to give a <i>get</i> may be actualized via the medium of <i>zakhin</i> and that a <i>gilui da’at</i> is not necessarily required by all <i>Poskim</i> prior to invoking <i>zakhin</i>.
The remaining question is whether <i>zakhin</i> is effective in divorce matters, similar to commercial matters, where the benefit is conferred despite the protestations of the beneficiary.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Kiddushin</i> 23a, s.v. <i>u’le-inyan psak halakhah</i>; <i>MT, Hilkhot Avadim</i> 6:1 compared to <i>MT, Hilkhot Zekhiya u-Matana</i> 4:2; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 1, <i>anaf</i> 1(1) in the name of Rashbam and Ran ; <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 1:10(5); <i>Hiddushei ha-Rim, HM</i> 195:16; M. Wygoda, <i>Agency</i> (Hebrew), 805, n. 183,185. Additionally, see <i>Mahaneh Ephraim, Zekhiya u-Matanah</i> 6. <i>Mikraei Kodesh</i> on <i>Pesah</i> 1:71.<br>Whether a <i>get zikui</i> may be issued in face of a husband’s protest is dependent upon how one understands the institution of <i>zakhin</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n. 31 and text supra accompanying notes 30–40.<br>Cf. <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif</i>,<i> Kiddushin</i> 18b<i>; Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Hullin</i> 39b; <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 37:12; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 110 who argue that <i>zakhin</i> is effective in the area of marriage provided that <i>ex post facto</i> the beneficiary agrees.<br>One of the proofs adduced to demonstrate that his consent is not required is from marriage, where his consent is not mandated. See <i>SA, EH</i> 34:4. Yet, <i>SA</i>’s case deals where there was a prior <i>gilui da’at</i>. See supra text accompanying ns. 81–88.</i> Does one require the husband’s actual consent prior to invoking <i>zakhin</i>? Will a husband’s refusal to give a <i>get</i> undercut invoking <i>zakhin</i>? Seemingly, in accordance with R. Yosef B. Soloveitchik and others, since there is a special <i>Halakhah</i> that one requires <i>ratzon</i> regarding matters of divorce,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be’ikvei ha-Tzon</i> in the name of Rabbi Soloveitchik, 197; <i>Even ha-Azail, Hilkhot Geneiva ve-Aveida</i> 1:9; <i>Teshuvot Zeikher Yitzhak</i> 1:23; <i>Avi Ezri, MT, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20; <i>Shiurei ha-Gaon Rabbi D.</i> <i>Povarsky, Bava Batra</i> 48b.</i> therefore no <i>get</i> can be forthcoming in the absence of a husband’s verbal consent. At first glance, this is the impression one receives from reading the oft-cited formulation of Rambam’s <i>psak</i>. In Mishnah Torah, he explains,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MT, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 2:20.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When a man whom <i>Halakhah</i> mandates to be compelled to divorce his wife does not desire to divorce her, the <i>beit din</i> ought to have beaten until he consents . . . With regard to this person who (outwardly) refuses to divorce his wife—he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he desires to perform all the <i>mitzvot</i> and avoid all the transgressions; it is only his evil inclination that presses him. Therefore when he is beaten until his evil inclination has been weakened and he says “<i>rotzeh ani</i>”; he consents (to the <i>get</i>) and he is considered to have performed the divorce willfully</span>
On the basis of his ruling, R. David ha-Kohen of Corfu argues that a husband’s wishes are controlling.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Radakh, bayit</i> 9, <i>heder</i> 12.</i>
However, as Rabbis Moshe Bula and Uriel Lavi aptly observe, the context of Rambam’s ruling is addressing an instance of <i>kefiyah</i> (coercion). Rambam is offering his explanation how one can reconcile coercing a husband to give a <i>get</i> with the notion that he must give it voluntarily and attain the result of <i>rotzeh ani</i>. A narrow reading of Rambam’s view of the requirement of <i>rotzeh ani</i> is limited to a case of physical coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Bnei Ahuvah, Ishut</i> 1:4</i> However, others view the requirement as implicitly encompassing verbal persuasion. Moreover, since Rambam introduces the requirement only in a case of coercion, one can extrapolate that should the husband volunteer to give a <i>get</i>, it is sufficient to execute a <i>get</i> based upon the husband’s directive without the need for the husband to articulate the words “<i>rotzeh ani</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zekhut Moshe</i>, supra n. 10, at 18(c-d); Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55, at 69–71</i> Furthermore, Tur, Shulhan Arukh and others either fail to mention such a requirement or do not require a verbal statement of consent. <sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tur</i> and <i>SA EH</i> 134 and 154.<br>Nonetheless, others fail to mention the requirement of verbal consent due to the fact that the husband’s physical act of giving the <i>get</i> is sufficient. See <i>Beit Yosef, Tur HM</i> 205; <i>Lehem Mishneh, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 4:1; <i>Bi’ur ha-Gra SA EH</i> 42:3; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer EH</i> 1:114. From their perspective, given the need for the husband’s active participation in executing the <i>get, zakhin</i> would be inapplicable.</i> In fact, some argue that there is no such requirement and some contend <i>be-diavad</i> (<i>ex post facto</i>), if during the execution of the <i>get</i>, the husband states “here is your <i>get</i>” without mentioning <i>rotzeh ani</i>, the <i>get</i> is kosher.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havot Yair</i> 55; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 205:1 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 154:13; <i>Sefat Emet, Arakhin</i> 21b; <i>Olat Shlomo, Arakhin</i> 21b. Some claim that <i>ex post facto</i>, the get is valid. See <i>Teshuvot Bigdei Yesha</i> 36:8–9.</i>
Finally, as we have shown, the authorities deal with the issues of whether <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> is to be viewed as equivalent to <i>zakhin le-adam</i> and whether a husband’s mandate to give a <i>get</i> is required or <i>gilui da’at</i> is sufficient prior to invoking <i>zakhin</i>—and as well as defining the nature of the <i>zekhut</i>? To the best of our knowledge, those authorities who validate a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband never entertained the possibility that the requirement of <i>rotzeh ani</i> would undermine the implementing of <i>zakhin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>teshuvot</i> cited supra notes 68, 78–79, 84–87.</i> There has been total silence amongst these <i>Poskim</i> regarding this issue because once one recognizes that <i>zakhin</i> will be operative in the divorce situation, one focuses upon a husband’s <i>imputed</i> consent rather than his actual consent. To state it differently, under certain conditions, <i>zakhin</i> trumps the subjective wishes of the husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot Re’eim</i> 68; <i>Zekhut Moshe</i>, supra n. 10; R. Y. Engel, <i>Gilyonei ha-Shas, Ketuvot</i> 11a; <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i>, supra n. 66 at subsection 11; R. Sha’anan, <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat, EH</i> 14(b). However, as the late R. Sha’anan of Bnei Brak told this author that he retracted his position in his subsequent writings. <i>See Iyunim be-Mishpat</i>, 5775, 66.</i> Even if he “stands and screams” and refuses to give a <i>get</i>, <i>zakhin</i> allows us to attribute consent to him in certain circumstances based on the notion that there exists an absolute benefit to him, a <i>zekhut</i> to give a <i>get</i>. Just as we found that by <i>get zikui</i> of a wife the <i>mezakeh</i> stands in the place of the wife to receive the <i>get</i>, here when dealing with <i>get zikui</i> of a husband, the <i>mezakeh</i> such as a <i>beit din</i> stands in the place of the husband to give the <i>get</i>. And as we explained, according to some <i>Poskim</i> there exists no requirement to state <i>rotzeh ani</i>.
How ought the <i>zehut</i> be defined? As we mentioned earlier, there is a debate whether one can invoke <i>zakhin</i> for a wife based upon <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> (spiritual benefit), which is defined by <i>halakhic</i> norms. R. Eliyahu Mizrachi of sixteenth-century Constantinople, Turkey addresses the case of a husband who was apprehensive that he would soon die and his wife would be obligated to engage in <i>yibum</i> (levirate marriage) with his apostate brother. To forestall this possibility, he wanted to divorce his wife prior to his demise. Since his wife was unavailable at that time, the husband appointed a third party to confer the benefit of a <i>get</i> upon her. Given that it is a <i>zekhut</i> that she would not marry her brother-in-law who is an apostate, R. Mizrachi opines that she is divorced via <i>zakhin</i>. And even if she desired to marry him via <i>yibum</i>, she would remain divorced despite her objections because it is in her benefit to be “saved from sin”.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Re’eim</i>, supra n. 99. In his discussion of R. Mizrachi’s <i>teshuvah</i>, which deals with divorce, R. Moshe Zula appends the Rashba’s ruling that <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> is effective in non-divorce despite a beneficiary’s protestations. See <i>Zekhut Moshe</i>, supra n. 10, at 19a.</i> A similar definition is offered in contemporary times by R. Z. Nehemiah Goldberg, who offers an example of the husband’s <i>zekhut</i> is if he is obligated to pay spousal support and engage in conjugal relations and unable to fulfill his <i>halakhic</i> marital duties due to the fact that he is in a vegetative state. .<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See Goldberg, supra n. 74, at 66.</i> To state it differently, benefit is to be defined by <i>halakhic</i> criteria. Given that <i>Halakhah</i> looks askance at an individual engaging in sin, it is therefore a benefit for her to be divorced. During the same century, R. Dovid ha-Kohen of Corfu contends that <i>zekhut</i> is defined by the wife’s subjective wishes. So if, in fact, the wife wants to remain married to her apostate brother-in-law, invoking <i>zakhin</i> would be ineffective.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radakh,</i> supra n. 93.</i> Subsequently some <i>aharonim</i> (later authorities) endorse R.

Moreover, he contends that R. Bula, supra n. 10 agrees with his position. See R. B. ha-Levi, <i>Mishnat Yosef,</i> supra n. 72, 343. However, a reading of R. Bula’s words fail to support his assertion.</i>
We encountered numerous <i>Poskim</i> who implicitly subscribe to Rabbi Mizrachi’s view by sanctioning the implementation of <i>zakhin</i> concerning an apostate and an adulterous wife due to the fact that <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> mandates that such individuals be “saved from sin” and they therefore ought to be divorced from their spouses.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying notes 17–19, 27–29.</i> Similarly, regarding executing a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband, there are <i>Poskim</i> who permit a <i>get zikui</i> in order to prevent the husband’s transgression of polygamy even in the absence of a <i>gilui da’at</i> that he intends to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo D.

Additionally, see supra n. 29.<br><i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i>, supra n. 66, agrees with these authorities provided there is a <i>gilui da’at</i>.</i> And more recently, in dealing with a husband in a permanent vegetative state, Dayan Lavi adopts this <i>mesorah</i> that addresses a mentally dysfunctional wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55 at 77.</i> For these <i>Poskim</i>, as in other realms of <i>Halakhah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">For example, there is a controversy whether it is <i>zekhut</i> for a minor who has been adopted by a non-observant couple to be converted without his consent. Given that the child will be raised in a nonreligious environment, the premise of the debate is that <i>zekhut</i> is defined in terms of the spiritual benefit of conversion. See <i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish</i> 2:96; <i>Teshuvot Da’at Kohen</i> 147, 148(end); <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i> vol. 1, 29:11, vol. 2, <i>YD</i> 100(11); <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:28; <i>Teshuvot Havazelet ha-Sharon</i> vol. 1, <i>YD</i> 75; <i>Iggerot Moshe, YD</i> 1:158, <i>EH</i> 4:26.</i> a spiritual benefit is sufficient to be a legitimate basis for <i>zakhin le-adam she-lo be-fanov</i> in a divorce situation.
The issue remains whether one can argue that a spiritual benefit is being conferred via <i>get zikui</i> upon a husband who is withholding a <i>get</i>? Clearly, as we have presented and as we will show in our section below entitled “final afterthoughts”, to date there is no <i>mesorah</i> that affords such relief to the modern day <i>agunah</i>. The outstanding question is whether one can suggest persuasive argumentation which will serve in the future for <i>Poskim</i> as a basis for addressing the plight of the modern day <i>agunah</i> via the invoking of get <i>zikui</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Final Afterthoughts</b></span>
Our foregoing presentation of the propriety of executing a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband rests upon the following foundations:
1. <i>Zakhin mei-adam</i> is operative in accordance with the rule of <i>zakhin</i>.
2
The <i>mezakeh</i>, namely a <i>beit din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nekudot ha-Kesef, YD</i> 305:10; <i>Penei Yehoshua, Kiddushin</i> 42b, <i>Ketuvot</i> 11a; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov, YD</i> 110; <i>Teshuvot Be’eir Yitzhak, OH</i> 1:6<i>; Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:155. However, R. Herzog argues that any individual may employ <i>zakhin</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:52.</i> will communicate to the scribe that the husband ought to be divorced from his wife and the <i>beit din</i> will inform the witnesses that they ought to sign the <i>get</i>. As such, the <i>le-shemah</i> requirement will be fulfilled.
3. The <i>mezakeh</i> is empowered to give the <i>get</i> to the wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon the notion that <i>zakhin</i> endows power to the <i>yad</i> of the <i>mezakeh</i> (see supra n. 37), the <i>get</i> can therefore be transferred by the<i> mezakeh</i> (instead of the husband) to the wife. See <i>Birkat Shmuel, Kiddushin</i> 10 and 15 in the name of R. Hayyim Soloveitchik; <i>Hiddushei ha-Granat, Ketuvot</i> 27; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 1:29(4). Alternatively, in the <i>Hazon Ish</i>’s words, “the <i>zekhut</i> is not that he she benefits from receiving a <i>get,</i> rather that she is divorced”. See <i>Hazon Ish,</i> supra n. 85. To state it differently, by dint of <i>zakhin</i> she is divorced rather than because of the “<i>yad of the mezakeh</i>” that is authorized to give the <i>get</i> to the wife.</i>
4
<i>Zakhin</i> will be effective even without the husband’s prior <i>gilui da’at</i> that he desires to be divorced and despite the husband’s objections.
5
One may employ <i>zakhin</i> provided that there is a <i>zekhut gamur</i> to the husband that he ought to be divorced.

The <i>zekhut</i> may be defined by <i>halakhic</i> criteria, namely an absolute spiritual benefit.
Despite the fact that every foundation presented above was and continues to this very day to be fraught with <i>halakhic</i> controversy, we have shown that that there are authorities that would execute a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband under various circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 66, 79, 83–88.<br>Clearly, we have equally demonstrated the basis for invoking a <i>get zikui</i> for a wife in multifarious cases.</i> A review of the above six foundations shows that <i>zakhin</i> is a <b><i>halakhic fiction</i></b> that, if certain conditions are obtained, in effect empowers the <i>mezakeh</i> to accomplish whatever <i>Halakhah</i> mandates as the husband’s responsibility vis-à-vis his involvement in the <i>get</i> process!
To state it differently, whether one sanctions the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband is predicated upon whether one is willing to recognize the <i>halakhic fiction</i> of <i>zakhin</i>. Whether <i>zakhin</i> is a subset of the <i>halakhot</i> of agency (and therefore such an execution is prohibited) or whether it is unconnected to agency (and consequently the execution is permitted) hinges upon whether <i>zakhin</i> will be viewed as a <i>halakhic fiction</i> or not. Similarly, whether or not <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> is to be validated based upon <i>zakhin</i> centers on the question of whether such a fiction will be an enabler to facilitate the application of <i>Halakhah</i> to <i>halakhic</i> questions and circumstances of <i>igun</i> such as divorce matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 30–40, 49–57.</i>
Once this <i>mesorah</i> endorses that <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> falls under <i>zakhin</i>, we have demonstrated how adopting such a position implicitly or explicitly fulfills the basic requirements concerning the execution of a <i>get,</i> namely<i>:</i> (1) A <i>get</i> must be given by the husband “<i>be-ratzon</i>” (with his prior consent). (2) In the text of the <i>get</i>, it must be clear that the husband is severing the marital relationship. (3) The <i>get</i> must be written for the wife, (“<i>le-shemah</i>”). (4) The husband or a <i>sofer</i> (a scribe) at the husband’s directive must write the <i>get</i>. And the witnesses who will attest to the execution of the <i>get</i> must have heard the husband’s directive to sign the <i>get</i>. (“<i>le-shemah</i>”) (5) The husband or his agent must deliver the <i>get</i> to his wife. In short, despite the absence of a husband’s designation of a scribe and witnesses as well as his depositing the <i>get</i> with his wife, <i>zakhin</i> intrinsically has the capacity by dint of it being a halakhic fiction to be effective as if the husband left instructions for giving a <i>get</i>, imparting his wishes to the scribe, designating witnesses and personally or by agent delivering the <i>get</i> to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">See Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55, 92–93.</i>
The outstanding question is whether one can execute a <i>get zikui</i> for a husband who refuses to give a <i>get</i> to his wife, similar to employing <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> in commercial matters in a case where the beneficiary “stands and screams”.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">For its effectiveness in commercial affairs, see supra text accompanying note 90.<br>The identical question may be asked regarding a <i>get zikui</i> for a recalcitrant wife. However, given that under certain conditions a wife who refuses to receive a <i>get</i> from her husband may result either in a <i>heter meah</i> <i>rabbanim</i> for him to remarry (based upon a permission given by 100 rabbis from different countries and three different communities provided that a <i>get</i> and the value of the <i>ketubah</i> is deposited in a <i>beit din</i>) or freeing the husband without a <i>heter meah</i> <i>rabbanim</i>—this entails an examination of other issues, we have chosen to refrain from addressing this question here. See infra, chapter 8(i).</i> Assuming that all end-of-marriage issues—including, but not limited to, the division of marital assets, parenting arrangements, and child support—have been resolved either by mutual agreement between the parties, via mediation, <i>beit din</i>, civil arbitration, or civil litigation and the husband refuses to give a <i>get</i> to his wife, may a <i>beit din</i> execute a <i>get zikui</i> on the basis of <i>zakhin</i>? Will the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> serve as a solution to the modern-day <i>agunah</i> problem? As we have shown, <i>zakhin mei-adam</i> is effective regarding divorce situations that entail a <i>zekhut.</i> In the wake of the husband’s <i>get</i> recalcitrance, the question is whether one can adopt the view that it is a <i>zekhut</i> for the husband to execute a <i>get</i>.
This issue must be viewed in two factual contexts: Both the husband and wife appeared in <i>beit din</i> and the panel ruled that the husband is obligated to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. Despite the judgment, the husband is adamant in refusing to give a <i>get</i>. Under such circumstances, can the <i>beit din</i> execute a <i>get zikui</i>?
As we discussed, in accordance with certain <i>Poskim,</i> a <i>zekhut</i> may be identified as <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> prior to sanctioning the use of a <i>get zikui</i>. Concerning executing a <i>get zikui</i> for a wife, we found that some authorities allowed this practice in situations where laxity in morals such as a promiscuous or apostate wife was recalcitrant in receiving her <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying notes 22 and 28.</i> Similarly, we encountered that there are <i>Poskim</i> who will employ a <i>get zikui</i> in a situation where a husband remarried without giving a <i>get</i> to his first wife and in effect was in violation of the <i>halakhot</i> against polygamy.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying n.105.</i> The common denominator of these cases is that the need to confer a benefit, either based upon <i>zakhin</i> or <i>zakhin mei-adam</i>, would be considered a <i>zekhut</i> lest certain prohibitions would be transgressed such as adultery or polygamy.
Yet, <i>zakhin</i> is not limited to avoiding the engagement in prohibitions. In fact, R. Eliyahu Mizrachi’s precedent-setting opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Re’eim</i>, supra n. 99</i> grounds the <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> in the above cited Rambam’s ruling,<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 92.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When a man whom <i>Halakhah</i> mandates to be compelled to divorce his wife does not desire to divorce her, the <i>beit din</i> ought to have beaten until he consents . . . With regard to this person who (outwardly) refuses to divorce his wife he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he desires to perform all of the <i>mitzvot</i> and avoid all of the transgressions; it is only his evil inclination that presses him. Therefore, when he is beaten until his evil inclination has been weakened and he says “<i>rotzeh ani</i>”, he consents (to the <i>get</i>) and he is considered to have performed the divorce willfully.</span>
The husband’s imputed consent to give his wife a <i>get</i> via the meting out of coercion is rooted in his readiness to adhere to his “real will”, namely a steadfast and unswerving readiness to comply with the norms of <i>Halakhah</i> its positive as well as negative commandments. As such, <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> is not limited to the ambit of avoiding negative transgressions but equally encompasses the realm of positive commandments.
In our hypothetical scenario, a <i>beit din</i> contends that the husband is obligated to give a <i>get</i>. By dint of the fact that both parties have accepted the jurisdiction of the <i>beit din</i> by signing on a <i>shtar borerut</i>, (an arbitration agreement) there emerges <i>the mitzva li-shmoah le-divrei hakhamim</i>; the parties are duty-bound to follow the teachings of the Torah scholars. In fact, some contemporary authorities emphasize the paramount importance of this duty within the context of a divorce proceeding.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mar’eh Yehezkel</i> 2:95; <i>Teshuvot Emek ha-Teshuvah</i> 3:110; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:1(5); <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96; File no. 819158/3, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, October 5, 2011. For an earlier authority who rules that a husband who fails to listen to a <i>beit din’s</i> divorce judgment is violating the words of Torah scholars, see <i>Teshuvot Maharlbah</i> 36.</i> Consequently, R. Ovadia Hadaya argues that should a husband be recalcitrant in regard to the giving of the <i>get</i>, he is violating the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>lo tasur</i> (you shall not deviate from the word they shall tell you).<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yaskil Avdi</i>, supra n.119.</i> Given that his “real will” is to abide by the <i>mitzvot</i> in general and the rulings of rabbinic authorities regarding giving a <i>get</i> in particular, we therefore view it as a <i>zekhut</i> (an unmitigated benefit) for the husband’s <i>nefesh</i> to execute a <i>get zikui</i>.
The outstanding question is whether the <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> of complying with a <i>beit din’s</i> ruling and a husband’s duty to refrain from being <i>me’agein</i> his wife by giving her a <i>get</i><sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See text infra notes 128–139.</i> will trump the subjective wishes of a husband who “stands and screams”, refusing to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. To the best of our knowledge, <i>aharonim</i> (later authorities) who recognize the institution of <i>zakhin</i> concerning divorce and the concept of <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> do not address our question
Alternatively, in the husband’s absence, should an arbiter or a <i>beit din</i> address the matter of a <i>get</i> at the behest of a wife’s plea and conclude that the husband is obligated to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife, here again such a judgment is a <i>zekhut</i> for the husband and therefore serves as grounds to execute a <i>get zikui</i>. For example, dealing with a husband who did not return from war and was presumed to be dead, R. Eliyahu Klatzkin contends that he has relinquished his right to direct his wife to fulfill her marital duties and therefore may be compelled to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dvar Halakhah</i>, supra n. 64.</i> By dint of R. Klatzkin’s ruling, a husband is compelled to follow the dictates of his judgment. Had the husband been alive, he would have been obligated to give a <i>get</i>. In the wake of the <i>beit din</i> judgment; there exists a <i>zekhut</i> to permit the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> that would afford relief to the plight of the <i>agunah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously, as we noted, there must be a <i>gilui da’at</i> according to R. Klatzkin prior to executing such a <i>get</i>. See supra text accompanying n. 83. According to R. Klatzkin, the requirement of a <i>gilui da’at</i>, namely the need to know that the husband is willing to give a <i>get</i>, is a precondition for invoking <i>zakhin</i> and is unrelated to the propriety of advancing the presence of a <i>zekhut</i>. The absolute benefit is defined by <i>halakhic</i> criteria, which in this scenario is the husband’s inner will to comply with the judgment of a rabbinic authority.</i>
Even in the absence of a <i>psak</i> of <i>beit din</i> that would obligate the husband to give a <i>get</i>, the <i>mitzvah</i> of freeing a woman from the chains of <i>igun</i> is sufficient enough to label the situation as a <i>zekhut</i>. As R. Hayyim Ozer Grodzensky states in the name of R. Shlomo ha-Kohen of Vilna,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ahiezer</i>, supra n. 81</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since he expresses an interest that he wants to divorce and release her from <i>yibum</i>, it is a benefit because it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to release her from the chains of <i>igun</i>.</span>
Subsequently, R. Yosef Tzvi ha-Levi, <i>av beit din</i> of Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ameirah Ne’imah, Ma’amar</i> 125, page 592</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is a major <i>mitzvah</i> that a woman is saved from her <i>igun</i>. And we find that due to the <i>zekhut mitzvot</i> (the benefit of <i>mitzvot</i>), we say <i>zakhin</i>.</span>
In a recent Israeli decision,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 764231/6, Haifa Regional Beit Din, May 25, 2014. One must duly note that the invoking of <i>zakhin</i> for R. Yosef Tzvi ha-Levi presumes that the party who is <i>mezakeh</i> the <i>get</i> is viewed as a <i>shaliach mishnah</i>, a sub-agent of the first agent who died.</i> relying upon Rambam’s and R. Akiva Eiger’s rulings and Dayan Avraham Horowitz’s <i>psak din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 13:264, 267–268 in the name of MT, <i>Hilkhot Ishut</i> 24:22 and <i>Drush ve-Hiddush</i>, page 91.</i> the <i>beit din</i> rules that when marital reconciliation is unattainable and even if a wife engaged in adultery, it is prohibited for a husband to be <i>me’agein</i> (delay the giving of a <i>get</i>) his wife. In other words, there is not only a <i>hiyyuv</i> (a duty) upon the husband to give a <i>get</i> but failure to give one involves the commission of an <i>issur</i>! Hence, <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> mandates that a husband give a <i>get</i> and therefore we may invoke <i>zakhin</i>.
Notwithstanding R. Shlomo ha-Kohen’s position, here again, the outstanding question is whether the <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> of complying with a <i>beit din’s</i> ruling and a husband’s duty to give a <i>get</i> and thereby refrain from being <i>me’agein</i> his wife will trump the subjective wishes of a husband who “stands and screams”, refusing to give a <i>get</i> to his wife.
As we will show, there exists a <i>mesorah</i> that recognizes, in very limited circumstances, the invoking of a <i>get zikui</i> despite the husband’s protestations.
A case where <i>zakhin</i> was applicable despite a husband’s protest may be found in a letter authored by R. Elyashiv in September 1954 and sent to Rabbi Yitzhak Herzog in 1959 and subsequently, around 1990, he incorporates the letter into his Kovetz Teshuvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:55; <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i>, supra n. 66.</i> Addressing the case of an <i>agunah</i> whose husband who was living behind the Iron Curtain and in all probability remarried due to the enforced separation from his wife, relying upon a decision of R. Yitzhak Elhanan Spektor, R. Elyashiv rules that the accrued benefit of “saving him from sin” may serve as grounds to employ <i>zakhin</i> even if the husband “stands and screams”, even if the husband would fail to recognize “the good” to be not in violation of the <i>herem</i> against polygamy.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:46; <i>Kovetz Teshuvot</i>, supra n.66, at subsection 11.<br>In other words, <i>zakhin</i>, an unmitigated benefit will be effective even without a husband’s appointment of an agent to deliver a <i>get</i> to his wife. See Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55, at 76.<br>However others such as R. Yitzhak Yosef and the late R. Sha’anan (in conversation with this author) disagree and contend that <i>zakhin</i> is operative in R. Elyashiv’s case because the husband appointed an agent though he subsequently passed away. See <i>Mishnat Yosef</i>, supra n. 72, 33. Had the husband failed to designate an agent, in their minds R. Elyashiv would have refrained from employing <i>zakhin</i>.<br>Firstly, there is no indication from the context of Rabbi Elyashiv’s ruling in subsection 11 that he was addressing the case of a husband who had appointed an agent. Moreover even if we would be dealing with this scenario numerous <i>Poskim</i> contend that under such conditions once the agent dies, there is no basis to invoke <i>zakhin</i>. Notwithstanding <i>Dvar Halakhah</i>, supra n. 64 and no. 122 in the name of R. Meir Arik and <i>Minhat Shlomo</i>, supra n. 83, the majority of <i>Poskim</i> contend that there is no basis to invoke <i>zakhin</i> under those conditions. See <i>She’eirit Yisrael,</i> supra n. 47; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:187;<i>Teshuvot Seridei Esh</i> 1:90; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i> <i>EH</i> 2:64; <i>Teshuvot Minhat</i> <i>Yitzhak</i> 1:48(4). See M. Wygoda with H. Zafri, <i>Agency</i>, 787-788. Finally, in subsection 13 of the <i>teshuvah</i>, R. Elyashiv stresses that a <i>get</i> can be given either by the avenue of agency or a <i>zekhut gamur</i>, an absolute unmitigated benefit.<br>Clearly, even if one would adopt the aforementioned minority interpretation of R. Elyashiv’s ruling, nonetheless, in a matter of <i>igun</i>, we would follow the majority opinion which would result in a leniency, namely the invoking of a <i>get zikui</i> in the circumstances where the recalcitrant husband is transgressing the <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom. See supra, preface, text accompanying n. 27.</i> In fact, R. Elyashiv’s proof that <i>get zikui</i> will be operative even in the wake of a husband’s objection is derived from the case of an <i>apostate wife</i> who refuses to receive a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">See text supra accompanying n. 22.</i> Despite the disparity between the biblical prohibition of adultery and the rabbinic ban against polygamy, R. Elyashiv nevertheless released the woman from her “<i>igun</i>”. Lest one challenge the soundness of this <i>psak</i>, notwithstanding that there are authorities who claim bigamy is a rabbinic violation,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Ran</i> 38; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, EH</i> 33, 77; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 117; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:21.</i> there are <i>Poskim</i> who contend that transgressing the <i>herem</i> entails a <i>de-oraita issur</i> (a Biblical violation).<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avodat ha-Gershuni</i> 53; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 305; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:2; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 14</i> Even if it is open to debate whether the <i>herem</i> is operative after the fifth millennium (1240 CE), it may be viewed as a <i>minhag</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur SA EH</i> 1:10.</i>and it must be seen through the lens of a <i>neder</i> (a vow), which is grounded biblically.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Otzar ha-Poskim, EH</i> 1(76).</i> Despite the fact that in accordance to R. Elyashiv one cannot coerce a husband who married a second wife without giving a <i>get</i> to his first wife to give the <i>get</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Kovetz Teshuvot</i> 1:132</i> if we would assume that violating the prohibition of bigamy entails a biblical transgression, it would therefore be permissible for a <i>beit din</i> to employ a <i>get zikui</i> in order to free the wife from the biblical <i>issur</i> of an <i>eishit ish</i> (the prohibition of a married woman), in spite of the husband’s protestations. A similar position is subscribed to by R. Feinstein. As R. Feinstein notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe,</i> supra n. 79<i>.</i></i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It isn’t considered an absolute benefit if he doesn’t have another wife.</span>
The inference is that if the husband has remarried and has been recalcitrant with giving a <i>get</i> to his first wife, <i>zakhin</i> is applicable.
In effect, explicitly R. Elyashiv and implicitly R. Feinstein are of the opinion that the contours of the <i>zekhut,</i> more specifically the <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> has been already established in the situation of conferring a benefit upon a wife. As Rema states,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema</i>, supra n. 17.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Some say if his wife has become an apostate, somebody confers upon her the benefit of a <i>get</i> and he marries another woman . . .</span>
Following in the footsteps of R. Yisrael Isserelein,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 237.</i> Helkat Mehokeik elucidates,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA EH</i> 1:19</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And the reason is to prevent the husband from transgressing the legislation of Rabbi Gershom.</span>
In other words, the deployment of <i>zakhin</i> concerning an apostate wife who refuses to receive a <i>get</i> is to save the husband from sin. Numerous decisors have subscribed to this rationale as a basis for invoking <i>zakhin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer,</i> supra n. 55; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:186; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 5:23.</i>
Analogously, contend Rabbis Elyashiv and Feinstein the employment of <i>zakhin</i> regarding a recalcitrant husband who is marrying a second wife without <i>halakhic</i> permission is to save him from sin. Despite the differences between the case of the apostate wife where <i>zakhin</i> is effective despite the fact that the <i>get</i> process is bereft of the wife’s consent to receive her <i>get</i> and the situation of the recalcitrant husband where <i>zakhin</i> is operative even in the absence of a husband’s directive to give a <i>get</i> and designate a scribe and appoint witnesses, the nature of the <i>zekhut</i> is identical, namely the <i>zekhut hanefesh</i> to save the husband from sin.
Assuming one accepts the aforementioned six foundations, the final issue is whether our <i>Poskim</i> will extrapolate (<i>“medameh milta le-milta</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">See this writer’s, <i>Rabbinic Authority, vol.</i> 1, 53–57.</i>) from the aforesaid views that invoke <i>zakhin</i> regarding “saving a husband from the sin” of transgressing the <i>herem</i> despite his objections to the situation of a husband who is “<i>me’agein</i>” his wife? To state it differently, whereas <i>zakhin</i> has been recognized as “saving a husband from sin” in the context of violating the <i>herem</i>, it ought to encompass “saving the husband from the sin “ of “failing to rescue him” or abstaining from the act of “loving your neighbor like yourself “ by refusing to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Seder Eliyahu Rabba</i> 13.</i> In fact, relying upon the above cited <i>teshuvah</i> of R. Eliyahu Mizrachi and Penei Yehoshua, R. Nehoriah Y. Ohanah raises this <i>sevarah</i>, line of reasoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnat Yosef</i>, supra n. 72, 429. Though he raises this line of reasoning, clearly for other reasons R. Ohanah would refrain from invoking<i> zakhin</i> and issue a <i>get zikkui</i>. See <i>Mishnat</i> <i>Yosef</i>, supra n. 72, 414–442.</i>
At this juncture, there exists no <i>mesorah</i> permitting the implementation of <i>get zikui</i> concerning a husband who is recalcitrant regarding the giving of a <i>get</i>. In fact, contemporary <i>Poskim</i> such as R. J. David Bleich and Dayan Uriel Lavi reject the employment of <i>get zikui</i> under such conditions.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">J. David Bleich, “Constructive Agency in Religious Divorce: An Examination of <i>Get Zikkuy</i>,” 35 <i>Tradition</i> 44 (2002), idem, “The <i>Get</i> of Tzefat,” 48 <i>Tradition</i> 33(2015); Tzfat Beit Din, supra n. 55, at 3.</i>
On the other hand, R. Rafael Stern of Beit Va’ad le-Torah of Givat Shmuel, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> contends that R. Klatzkin would allow a <i>get zikui</i> under such conditions, despite a husband’s objections. However, this allowance is provided given that it is a <i>zekhut gamur</i> to be divorced, namely there exists an obligation to give a <i>get</i> in the particular circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that there was no <i>gilui da’at</i> on the part of the husband in both <i>Miluei Even</i> supra n. 77 and <i>Devarim Ahadim</i> 43, as R. Stern argues, does not necessarily mean that the voicing of an objection to giving a<i> get</i> would alter R. Klatzkin’s sanction of employing a <i>get zikui.</i></i> But R. Stern leaves the matter as one that requires further deliberation.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">See Shiur no. 569 in the series of classes dealing with <i>hilkhot</i> <i>matanah</i> and <i>moda’ah</i>, which is accessible at https://sites.google.com/site/betmidrashsite/home/---</i> However, invoking R. Klatzkin’s <i>teshuvah</i> as a panacea for the modern-day <i>agunah</i> problem is highly problematic. Despite the fact that there was no <i>gilui da’at</i> that would indicate that the husband would give a <i>get</i>, in the scenario posed to R. Klatzkin, <i>get zikui</i> was recognized due to a constellation of facts that were unique to the case at hand and therefore cannot serve as a precedent for validating the implementing of a <i>get zikui</i> in the conventional scenario of a recalcitrant husband. As R. Klatzkin notes, the <i>kiddushin</i> may have been valid only on a rabbinic level in the case addressed by him. Also, the husband lost nothing due to the fact that he was prohibited to live with her because his wife entered into a second marriage and the husband had abandoned his wife for at least five years.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Since the abandonment was at least five years, in the mind of R. Klatzkin, she is deemed <i>le-gerushin</i> <i>omedet</i>, i.e. that the dissolution of the marital tie is a foregone and inevitable conclusion. As such, for R. Klatzkin, the scribe and witnesses may execute a <i>get</i> on behalf of the husband by dint of <i>zakhin</i> even though the husband did not designate the scribe and witnesses to act as his agents for the execution of the <i>get</i>.<br>Cf. <i>Maharsham,</i> who contends that there must be a husband’s abandonment of 10 years in order to be deemed <i>le-gerushin</i> <i>omedet.</i> See <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 76. However, in another ruling, R. Schwadron rules that “a few years” of a husband’s abandonment places her in the category of <i>le-gerushin omedet</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:352(6). In accordance to Rabbi Sjperber, <i>le-gerushin omedet</i> may apply where the couple resolved their differences in civil court, the husband loves another woman, and a <i>get</i> has yet to be given. See R. Sjberber, <i>Teshuvot Afarkesta Deanya</i> 3:273(4). Assuming a wife has the status of <i>le-gerushin omedet,</i> one does not require the directive from the husband to give a<i> get.</i> See <i>Maharsham</i>, supra n. 76.</i> In other words, a read of his <i>teshuvah</i> clearly indicates that a <i>get zikui</i> was employed due to the specific facts of the case and therefore his ruling cannot serve as grounds for executing a <i>get zikui</i> in every situation where a husband refuses to give a <i>get</i>. In other words, given the particular facts of the case, R. Klatzkin’s ruling will not apply in the overwhelming majority of modern-day <i>agunah</i> situations. Moreover,R.Yisrael Mintzberg claims that R. Klatzkin retracted his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yisrael</i> 1:5(3). Subsequently, the retraction is mentioned by <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 64. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i>, vol. 4, <i>EH</i> 100 (end).</i>
In sum, in pursuance to the foundations presented, acting for the absolute benefit of the husband (“<i>zakhin le-adam</i>”) empowers a <i>beit din</i> to issue <i>a get zikui</i> in two instances: Firstly, the Tzfat Regional Beit Din argues that a <i>get zikui</i> may be issued in the case of a husband who is in a permanent vegetative state and therefore incapable of instructing the giving of a <i>get</i> to his wife. Secondly, when dealing with a husband who received an improper <i>heter nissuin</i>, permission to remarry and subsequently married a second woman without giving a <i>get</i> to his first wife, contends R. Elyashiv serves as grounds to issue a <i>get zikui</i>. As such, there is now a <i>mesorah</i> to issue “a <i>get zikui</i>” in these two scenarios. Though there is no <i>mesorah</i> to execute a <i>get zikui</i> in the case of <i>the</i> modern day <i>agunah</i> where the husband refuses to give a <i>get,</i> yet we submitted <b>argumentation</b> to sanction the execution of a <i>get zikui</i> for the modern day <i>agunah</i> based upon the ruling of R. Elyashiv which deals with “saving a husband from sin”.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Though R. Feinstein agrees with R. Elyashiv that <i>zakhin</i> applies when a husband marries a second wife without giving a <i>get</i> to his first wife, nevertheless his disenchantment with R. Hapstein’s stance memoralized in Beit Yisrael that it is an unmitigated benefit (“<i>a zekhut gamur</i>”) to employ <i>get zikui</i> in a situation of <i>igun</i> teaches us that R. Feinstein’s view is that the subjective wishes of the husband trump the <i>mitzvah</i> to give a <i>get</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, supra n.79. Consequently, in the wake of a husband’s <i>get</i> recalcitrance, in R. Feinstein’s mind one cannot authorize the deployment of a <i>get zikui</i>.</i>
Deciding <b><i>le-halakhah</i></b> (on a theoretical plane) as well as <b><i>le-ma’aseh</i></b> “(as a practical judgment) between the competing arguments regarding the readiness to recognize the institution of <i>zakhin</i> concerning a recalcitrant husband and recognizing “the saving a wife from <i>igun</i>” as a <i>zekhut</i> is the province of the <i>Posek</i>. The relative strength of extrapolating from the case of “saving a husband from sin” regarding the <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom to a general instance of <i>get</i> refusal will hopefully be tested within the framework and constraints of future decisions of our <i>Poskim</i> and <i>battei din</i>.

Chapter 7; An Inquiry into some of the varying halakhic traditions regarding the appropriateness of a divorcee marrying a kohen

A <i>kohen</i> (a Jewish man from the priestly class) is proscribed by an explicit prohibition in the Torah from marrying a divorcee,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra</i> 21:7</i> with the ban memorialized in the various restatements of <i>Halakhah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 13; <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>) 6:1; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 13:10.</i> Despite the fact that it is uncertain that all known <i>kohanim</i> are in fact the descendants of Aharon, there is a <i>hazakah</i> (a presumption) that they are indeed <i>kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 3:6; <i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 5: 219, 221. She remains prohibited to marry a <i>kohen</i> if she had married a Jew and she became a widow. <i>Hokhmat Shlomo, EH</i> 6:1</i> As such, the prohibition remains in force to this very day. Though the marriage is prohibited, should the man and woman marry the marriage is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 15:1, 44:7</i> Nonetheless, given that such a marriage is proscribed, in a country such as Israel where coercion is an option, we compel the man to divorce his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 2.</i>
Let us imagine a scenario in which a Jewish man and a Jewish woman are married in accordance with <i>Halakhah</i>. Subsequently, the couple divorced in accordance with <i>Halakhah</i>. In this scenario, where there was an <i>ilat gerushin</i> (grounds for the divorce) and therefore the <i>get</i> was a <i>sine qua non halakhic</i> requirement, it is obvious that a <i>kohen</i> may not marry the divorcee. However, what happens if this <i>get</i> falls into the category of a <i>get le-humra</i> (a precautionary stringency), which is rabbinically mandated—such as in the situation of the presence of invalid <i>edei kiddushin</i>, which was never addressed at the time the <i>get</i> was executed? Years later, the divorcee meets a <i>kohen</i> and they desire to marry each other. Assuming there would be grounds to void the divorcee’s marriage (<i>bittul kiddushin</i>), such as the presence of invalid witnesses testifying to the act of <i>kiddushin</i> (loosely translated as marriage), is there a prohibition to consummate such a marriage between the divorcee and the <i>kohen</i>?
A <i>sine qua non</i> to create the <i>ma’aseh kiddushin</i> (the act of <i>halakhic</i> marriage) is the presence of two adult Jewish males who are Torah observant, not blood relatives to either the man or the woman, who witness the man reciting “<i>harei at mekudeshet li betaba’at zo, kedat Moshe ve-Yisrael</i>”, and who observe the man transferring a ring to the woman and her acceptance of the ring.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 42:2,5. Whether the witnesses who are present under the <i>huppah</i> must see the <i>netinah</i> only or equally hear his words of <i>kiddushin</i> is a matter of debate. See <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 42:4; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 42:12; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:101; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:82 and <i>Sha’arei Yosher, Sha’ar</i> 7, chapter 12.</i> Addressing a case of an <i>agunah</i> who attempted to have her marriage voided due to the fact that both witnesses during the <i>kiddushin</i> were invalid due to the fact that they violated the Shabbat and committed other sins, R. Aharon Walkin who resided in Pinsk, Ukraine and later died in a concentration camp in the 1930’s responds to such a request in the most trenchant terms,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 1:81. See also, <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 87. In contradistinction to this position, argues R. Yitzhak Liebes should the Torah observance of the witnesses be verified by a <i>beit din</i>, there would be grounds to void the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Avi</i> 5:133.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is improper in my eyes to adopt this path to criticize the act of <i>kiddushin</i> eight years after the wedding . . . You must understand that such advice can destroy the purity of Israel . . . to multiply <i>mamzerim</i> in the midst of a holy nation; the marital bond from now will be not sustained. Everyone will destroy it in accordance with his will . . . And the stringency of being married (<i>eishit ish</i>) will be nullified . . . Therefore eight years after the wedding . . . we should not inquire for guidance to void the marriage . . .</span>
And, in conclusion, R. Walkin notes,
<span class="poetry indentAll">I will not deny that if the husband and wife would have questioned me about the <i>kiddushin</i> immediately after the <i>kiddushin</i>, I would respond to them that he should be <i>mekadesh</i> (loosely translated, marry) her in the presence of two eligible witnesses since there are quite a few doubts and strong concerns with this <i>kiddushin</i>. However, when the question emerged to void the <i>kiddushin</i> and permit her to remarry, far be it for me to do that even for proper reasons.</span>
In sum, voiding a marriage ceremony many years after a couple have been living together as a married couple will only undermine the institution of <i>halakhic</i> marriage and therefore the thrust of R. Walkin’s position is that regardless of whether we are dealing with an <i>agunah</i> or a <i>non-igun</i> situation, such as our scenario of a divorcee who wants to marry a <i>kohen</i>, voiding a marriage ought to be unwarranted.
Aligning himself with R. Walkin’s position, Dayan Uriel Lavi, <i>av beit din</i> (presiding <i>dayan</i>) of the Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, advances the position that that there are various <i>halakhic</i> procedural requirements which in most instances ensure that in the event that there are ostensibly invalid witnesses for <i>kiddushin</i>, one can nevertheless almost guarantee that the marriage will be recognized and that we can ultimately (and this is my inference) protect the institution of <i>halakhic</i> marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 24. Whether R. Walkin would subscribe to all of these requirements we leave as an open question. For his alignment with some of these requirements, see <i>Zekan Aharon</i>, supra n. 7.</i>
Firstly, following in the footsteps of the Havot Ya’ir<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 19</i> who rules in accordance with Hatam Sofer and others,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:100 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA,</i> <i>EH</i> 42:11; <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 44; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:77–78,3:32</i> in the event that there were invalid witnesses at the <i>huppah</i> (wedding ceremony), one can rely upon the Torah-observant attendees at the ceremony who observed the <i>kiddushin</i> yet did not observe the actual <i>mesirah</i> (the giving of the ring) by the <i>hatan</i> (the groom) to the <i>kallah</i> (and her acceptance of the ring) and/or did not hear the <i>hatan</i> be <i>mekadesh</i> (consecrate in words) his wife. These Torah-committed participants may serve as “<i>anan sahadi</i>” (firm knowledge of something is equal to witnessing it), as if they are saying, “we are the witnesses of the <i>kiddushin</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Implicit in this view is that there is no requirement to designate who the witnesses are for the<i> kiddushin</i> and that since <i>kiddushin</i> cannot be consummated without eligible witnesses, it is as if the <i>hatan</i> has designated kosher witnesses in order that they will not be invalidated by ineligible witnesses. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 479; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 42:4; <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 42:6; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 36:6.<br>Cf. Rabbi Tenna, who contends that even if the couple is not Torah-observant, if they want their wedding to be <i>halakhically</i> proper including having qualified witnesses, <i>anan sahadi</i> will be effective. See <i>Teshuvot Birkat Shlomo</i> 12.</i> The fact that some of the participants in the audience may be non-observant does not preclude the invoking of the <i>halakhic</i> axiom of “<i>anan sahadi</i>” by the Torah-observant attendees,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 10.</i> provided that the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> (the rabbi who officiates at the <i>kiddushin</i>) is Torah-observant and proficient in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Lev Aryeh</i> 1:31</i>
However, the majority of <i>Poskim</i> endorse the earlier view of R. Weil of fifteenth-century Germany that once the witnesses are designated and they are found to be ineligible, one cannot validate the wedding based upon others who are present at the wedding that are qualified to give testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Mahari Weil</i> 7; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Kiddushin</i> 43a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 2:707; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 109; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 228; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 172; <i>Teshuvot Ne’eman Shmuel</i> 59; <i>Teshuvot Ohr Lee</i> 70(73b); <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> 2:64(8); <i>Teshuvot Kerem Shlomo, EH</i> 25; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel, EH</i> 57; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 3(4–5); File no. 92507-1, Be’er Sheva Regional Beit Din, March 29, 2009 (Rabbi E. Abergil); Rabbi Boaron, <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i> 2: <i>EH</i> 9, 11.<br>Whether this position is contingent upon the fact that the <i>hatan</i> designated the witnesses or a third party, such the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> or the <i>hazan</i> designated them, we leave as an open question. However, today where generally speaking the <i>hatan</i> designates the witnesses, “<i>anan sahadi</i>” would be ineffective if the witnesses are found to be invalid. See <i>Teshuvot Perah Mateh Aharon</i> 2:113; <i>Teshuvot Ne’eman Shmuel</i> 79<i>; Teshuvot Kerem Shlomo</i> 81; <i>Teshuvot Emek Yehoshua</i> 3:42; <i>Teshuvot Ohr Lee</i>, 70(20). Clearly, if the rabbi or <i>hazan</i> designates the witnesses with the prior authorization of the <i>hatan</i> and they are found to be invalid, “<i>anan sahadi</i>” will be ineffective. See <i>Teshuvot Minhat Asher</i> 2:98.<br>Rabbis Yosef Ibn Lev and Shlomo ha-Kohen would require a second <i>kiddushin</i> but would not void the marriage. See <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:101; <i>Teshuvot Maharshah</i> 1:25.</i> In effect, contrary to Rabbi Lavi, protecting the institution of marriage cannot be accomplished once the designated witnesses have been found to be invalidated by invoking “<i>anan sahadi</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One could claim that the rule that should one of the witnesses be found to be ineligible then both qualified witnesses are invalid may be inapplicable to matters of marriage and divorce. See <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 2:66; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 8: 37. However, Dayan Lavi clearly subscribes to the position that the rule applies to matters of marriage and divorce as well as <i>beit din</i> proceedings. See also <i>Otzar ha-Poskim, EH</i> 42:25.</i>
Realizing that there are some eminent authorities who refute Hatam Sofer’s view, Dayan Lavi invokes two additional procedural requirements that in effect challenge the acceptability of deeming a witness as an ineligible witness without critical inquiry. Firstly, adopting Tumim’s view, witness invalidation is accomplished by definitive ruling of a <i>beit din</i> corroborated by two witnesses who testify to his disqualification.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Urim ve-Tumim, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 87:27, 28:3.</i> Dayan Lavi concludes that the majority of witnesses cannot be disqualified by their own admission or based upon the assessment of others. In other words, people who want to disqualify a witness to the act of <i>kiddushin</i> must submit their testimony in the presence of <i>beit din</i>. Hence, given the absence of a <i>beit din</i> determination, there would be no grounds to void the marriage. As aptly noted by Dayan Lavi, there are some <i>Poskim</i> who concur with the Urim ve-Tumim’s position;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 28, <i>Hiddushin</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, Yoreh Deah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 11; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 38:17. See also, <i>Teshuvot Beit Avi, EH</i> 5:133(2) and <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 6 (2–3). R. Schwadron speaks of the need to verify if in fact the witnesses are ineligible. See <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:106.</i>nevertheless, there are others who object to his view.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yeshuot Yisrael, HM</i> 28:3; <i>Imrei Binah, Eidut</i> 40.</i> Others point out that if the public is aware of the witnesses’ noncompliance with <i>Halakhah,</i> such as violating the <i>Shabbat</i>, or they have admitted to having transgressed <i>Shabbat</i>, one does not require formal testimony in <i>beit din</i> by two witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 100(end); <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 3:25; <i>Teshuvot Ne’eman Shmuel</i> 75; <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 12(10) in the name of Ra’avan and Mordekhai; Goldschmidt, <i>Ezer Mishpat</i> 2; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:82(11).</i>
Secondly, buttressing his position, Dayan Lavi subscribes to Sma’s ruling that if the witness is unaware that he committed a sin, one cannot identify such an individual as an invalid witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 34:57. See <i>Teshuvot Rabbi Akiva Eiger Mahadura Kama</i> 96.</i> Though there are numerous <i>Poskim</i>, including R. Walkin, who align themselves with this position,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See authorities cited by <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 8 <i>EH</i> 5 and <i>Ateret Devorah</i>, supra n. 8.</i> there are others who object to Sma’s view.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, HM</i> 34:16; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 10, 110; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef</i> 5 (end); <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:24; See decisors noted by <i>Yabia Omer</i>, supra 21 and <i>Ateret Devorah</i>, supra n. 8.</i> For example, relying on various <i>Poskim</i>, R. Shlomo Amar opines,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i>, vol. 4, <i>EH</i> 1(4)</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Today . . . the ignorant masses, their sins have been sanctioned (“<i>heter gamur</i>”). And they converse with themselves about transgressing <i>Shabbat</i> and Yom Tov just like they speak about other matters, and they tell each other what they did on <i>Shabbat</i>, and where they traveled. Nobody would cast a doubt regarding their words that in fact that they transgressed <i>Shabbat</i> and committed other sins, therefore a man is trustworthy to disqualify himself from submitting evidence.</span>
Here again, Dayan Lavi and R. Walkin advance a procedural requirement that in effect will result in affirming the marriage because many, if not most, Jews today are unaware that their conduct is in violation of <i>Halakhah</i>. And consequently, by dint of their lack of cognizance, they would not be disqualified in serving as witnesses for affirming that a Jewish man and Jewish woman have consummated their <i>kiddushin</i>.
Finally, following in the footsteps of the scholars of Toledo, Spain, prior to invalidating a witness of <i>kiddushin</i> who committed a transgression, one must ascertain that he has not been repentant.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zikhron Yehuda</i> 82 cited by <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 42.</i> However, if subsequent to the wedding he has been penitent, then the <i>kiddushin</i> is valid and therefore the execution of a <i>get</i> is required. Here again, as noted by Dayan Lavi, there are <i>Poskim</i> who refrain from factoring into consideration a witness’s repentance and validate the marriage.
In short, adopting any or all of these procedural requirements prior to invalidating an <i>eid kiddushin</i> almost guarantees that once a Jewish couple has been married by an Orthodox rabbi, the opportunity to void the marriage will be significantly diminished or nonexistent despite the potential issues with the acceptability of the <i>eidei kiddushin</i>.
On the other hand, a <i>posek</i> must be aware of the ramifications of either rejecting the technique of “<i>anan sahadi</i>” and/or the procedural requirements that the individual’s disqualification must have passed <i>beit din</i> muster.
Assuming one adopts the latter approach that upon discovery that there were ineligible witnesses for the <i>huppah</i> and therefore there are grounds to void a marriage, then the execution of a <i>get</i> isn’t mandated since the union failed to be consummated under the <i>huppah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Implicitly we are assuming that even if the couple lived for an extended period of time in a Torah-observant community and are known at large as a married couple and Torah observant (including practicing the <i>halakhot</i> of family purity), nonetheless we will not construe their cohabitation as a form of <i>kiddushei biah</i> (marriage via intercourse) since we do not practice today such an avenue to consummate a marriage. See <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i>, Addendum to the <i>Sefe</i>r, 1 (end) cited by <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, EH</i> 62; H. Schachter, “<i>Birurei Halakha</i>”, <i>Beit Yitzhak</i> (5748), 237; <i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 7:195, 200 (a <i>safek kiddushin</i>), 13:286. Said conclusion is in consonance with R. Feinstein’s view that contends that public knowledge that the man and woman have lived together in a Torah lifestyle for at least five years is sufficient to deem them <i>halakhically</i> married, provided that there are members of the community who know that they actually married in pursuance to <i>halakhah</i>. See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:75.</i> Nevertheless, since the marriage was performed publicly and the couple lived together for years and had children, there was a <i>kol kiddushin</i> (loosely translated—a rumor of marriage). However, there is also a <i>kol gerushin</i> (a rumor of divorce) that was confirmed by the act of <i>beit din</i> in which the <i>get</i> states explicitly that she is permissible to marry everyone except a <i>kohen</i>! Should we be concerned about <i>reiah ha-get</i> (lit. the fragrance of the <i>get</i>) that prohibits the divorcee to marry a <i>kohen</i> since there was a <i>kol kiddushin</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 52a, 94a; <i>Gittin</i> 84a; <i>SA, EH</i> 6:10, 46:1–7</i> In a scenario where a <i>get le-humra</i> was executed, are we to be concerned about a <i>reiah ha-get</i> and therefore the divorcee would be unable to marry a <i>kohen</i>? Or do we stake out the position that the notion of <i>reiah ha-get</i> is applicable only when the <i>get</i> was given <i>min ha-din</i>, namely due to a certain <i>ilat gerushin</i> (a ground for divorce)? To state it differently, if the witnesses under the <i>hupah</i> were ineligible and therefore there are grounds to void a marriage, may a <i>kohen</i> marry the divorcee given that a <i>get</i>, albeit was executed as a rabbinical stringency?
In one case, it became evident after a divorce that one of the <i>eidim</i> for the <i>kiddushin</i> was invalid due to being a relative and the second witness transgressed the <i>Shabbat</i> in public, the Haifa Regional Beit Din under Dayanim S. Y. Cohen and M. Uriyah allow the divorcee to marry a <i>kohen</i> whom she knew well (in their words, “<i>adukah</i>”). Since there was a dissenting opinion on the panel, the <i>beit din</i> requested R. Shlomo Amar, the Chief Rabbi, to resolve the matter. And Dayan Tzion Boaron replies to the question.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 9.</i> Implicit in the question is that given that the marriage was never established due to the presence of ineligible <i>eidin</i>, but given that a <i>get</i> nonetheless was executed, are we to be concerned about “<i>reiah ha-get</i>”? Shulhan Arukh rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 6:1</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">if a <i>kohen</i> marries a divorcee even if she is <i>safek gerushah</i> (there is a <i>halakhic</i> doubt whether she is a divorcee), he must leave her . . . and even <i>reiah ha-get</i> invalidates her to a <i>kohen</i> and we coerce him to divorce her.</span>
In his <i>mapah</i> concerning this ruling<i>, Rema</i> adds,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 6:1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even if she became divorced only because of <i>kol kiddushin</i> even though it is clear that there was no <i>mamash</i> (no substance) in the <i>kiddushin</i> and the <i>get</i> was given only because of a <i>humra be-alma</i> (a stringency) nonetheless she is invalidated to marry a <i>kohen</i>.</span>
As we know, a <i>get</i> can be executed <i>min ha-din</i> (pursuant to the law) which means that a <i>beit din</i> will determine the grounds for a divorce such as a husband’s impotency, unwillingness to support his wife, or engaging in spousal abuse—physical or emotional. Alternatively, if a couple has been separated for either a minimum of a year or 18 months and it clear that we are dealing with “a dead marriage” and there are no hopes for marital reconciliation, according to certain <i>dayanim</i> today, such a situation would be grounds to either obligate or coerce a <i>get</i>. In addition, to mandating a <i>get min ha-din</i>, on rabbinic grounds one can direct the issuance of a <i>get le-humra</i> (a precautionary stringency). For example, according to most decisors today, in the case of a couple who only underwent a civil marriage, should they dissolve their relationship, a <i>get le-humra</i> is required.
In short, for Rema, regardless whether the execution of the <i>get</i> is <i>mei-ikar hadin</i> or <i>le-humra</i>, the divorcee is prohibited from marrying a <i>kohen</i> due to the Talmudic label of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>”. And in fact, there are numerous <i>Poskim</i> who would endorse Rema’s opinion and argue that one cannot nullify a <i>kol kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash,Tur Bet</i>, 12 in the name of Rif and Ran<i>; Bah, Tur EH</i> 6; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 47:11, <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum 14; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Rivot</i> 5; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 2:130. <i>Teshuvot Menahem Meishiv</i> 34.</i>
However, we need to examine the basis for Rema’s <i>shita</i> (position) prior to arriving at that conclusion.
Given the fact that a printer of Shulhan Arukh adds in parentheses after Rema’s ruling that the basis for his conclusion is a <i>teshuvah</i> of Rashba and, to the best of my knowledge, all <i>Poskim</i>—contemporaneous as well as subsequent to Rema—assume that Rashba’s <i>psak</i> is the basis of Rema’s position,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The source references in Rema’s <i>mapah</i> were not authored by Rema. Rema’s <i>mapah</i>, which was published in 1583 and 1594 as well as the Venice edition of 1594, do not cite sources. Subsequently, the Cracow printers in 1607 took the sources for Rema from his <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> memorialized in <i>Tur</i> and incorporated them in his <i>mapah</i>. And interestingly enough, <i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 6 cites the differing views regarding this matter as found in <i>Mordekhai, Kiddushin</i> 531, but there is no mention of Rashba’s <i>teshuvah</i>! In fact, as noted by <i>Shakh</i> and <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah</i>, many of the source references found in the <i>mapah</i> are inaccurate and misleading. See <i>Teshuvot Hayyim Sha’al</i> 2: 38(51); <i>Sdei Hemed, Kelalei ha-Rema</i>, vol. 6, page 99. Whether this source citation found in <i>SA, EH</i> 6:1 is inaccurate we leave as an open question.<br>That being said, since we are addressing normative <i>Halakhah</i> and examining this <i>shitah</i> of Rema in light of all <i>aharonim</i> who assume that Rema’s view is based upon Rashba’s ruling, we will refrain from understanding Rema’s view independently without reference to Rashba.</i> we will briefly scrutinize Rema’s <i>shitah</i> within this context—through the lens of the aforementioned <i>teshuvah</i> of Dayan Boaron, whose argumentation and conclusion is accepted by Rabbis S. Amar, O. Yosef, Masash, Waldenberg, Zevichi, and others.
Many <i>Poskim</i> point out that though a read of the Rashba’s <i>teshuvah</i> that serves as the basis for Rema’s view would lead one to the conclusion of the recognition of the notion of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>”,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The following question was posed to Rashba. Reuven arranged for a <i>shidduch</i> for his daughter and subsequently the <i>shidduch</i> failed to materialize. Upon the voiding of the <i>shidduch</i>, they said to the father of the prospective <i>kallah</i> that the prospective <i>hatan</i> ought to give a <i>get</i> to the woman, lest the public assume that she was betrothed to him. The groom was <i>halakhically</i> ignorant and heeded their advice and gave a <i>get</i> to the woman. Nonetheless, there was no rumor that in fact she was betrothed to him. Subsequently, Reuven wanted to marry off his daughter to a <i>kohen</i> and the question arose whether such an action is permissible. In such a situation, Rashba rules that the rule of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” was applicable and therefore prohibited the <i>shidduch</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:550.</i> nonetheless Rema’s contemporary the Beit Yosef (who is the author of Shulhan Arukh) presents another of the Rashba’s rulings, memorialized in his <i>teshuvot</i>, which contradicts the other <i>teshuvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 13</i> On the one hand, Helkat Mehokeik raises this contradiction and concludes that one must distinguish between the fact patterns of the two cases, but he fails to articulate the differences between the two rulings.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 6:2</i> Beit Shmuel, on the other hand, cites Bah’s view that Rema’s position is dealing with a divorcee who has yet to remarry the <i>kohen</i> and the situation of the <i>teshuvah</i> found in the Beit Yosef deals with the situation of a <i>kohen</i> who married the divorcee and, in such a “<i>be-diavad</i>” (<i>post facto</i>) situation, the notion of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” is inapplicable and the couple need not separate. However, Beit Shmuel presents Taz’s view who rejects this distinction and here again Beit Shmuel does not side either with Taz or Bach.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 6:4</i> Finally, there is another approach that, in accordance with Rashba’s ruling cited in Beit Yosef, if it is clear that a <i>get</i> was executed and the woman does not challenge the veracity of “<i>kol de-la pasik</i>” (the persistent rumor), then she is prohibited from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Reiah ha-Sadeh</i> 100.</i>
However, there is a fourth position: Given that there is a contradiction in Rashba’s <i>teshuvot</i>, we assume that the one cited by Rema reflects his earlier position and Beit Yosef is citing his later view.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 1(4); <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 1: <i>EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 4:19; <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 13.<br>Lest one understand Rosh’s ruling recorded in <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 35:14 as rejecting Rashba’s final position, see <i>Yabia Omer</i>, op. cit. in the name of <i>Hagahot Maharikash, EH</i> 6:4.</i> The proof given for this conclusion is based upon a read of the later <i>teshuvah</i>, where Rashba counters the proofs that he had brought to buttress his decision in the earlier <i>teshuvah</i>. In effect, Rashba, similar to other <i>rishonim</i> such as Rambam and Rosh changes his mind and both the original position and his final decision are memorialized in his collection of rulings.
Moreover, Dayan Boaron and the others argue that there are other <i>Poskim</i> who reject Rema’s view; in the forefront are Tosafot Ri ha-Lavan and Rabbi Eliezer of Metz, who nullify the <i>kol kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Mordekhai, supra n. 19.

Based upon the foregoing as well as additional lines of argumentation,Dayan Boaron affirms the Haifa beit din’s decision and, in light of the discovery of that the witnesses were disqualified, the <i>kohen</i> and the divorcee who knew each other quite well were permitted to marry each other, despite the earlier execution of the <i>get le-humra</i>. In fact, Dayan Boaron reiterates his conclusion in another <i>teshuvah</i>, which deals with a similar fact pattern.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 12</i>
By no stretch of the imagination are these two <i>psakim</i> of Dayan Boaron “a lone ranger”, which emerges from the particular fact patterns posed to him. He equally enbraces this view in other scenarios. One case involved a <i>kohen</i> who divorced his wife and afterwards returned to engage in conjugal relations and children were sired from that relationship after the divorce. Subsequently, they became <i>ba’alei teshuvah</i>, but it was discovered that one of the witnesses to the original <i>kiddushin</i> were transgressors of <i>Shabbat</i> in a public fashion. So the question posed to Dayan Boaron was whether they could remarry in accordance with <i>Halakhah</i>. Without even addressing the matter of the children, Dayan Boaron renders the same <i>psak</i> as we encountered in the other two <i>teshuvot</i>. Namely, the <i>get</i> was identified as a <i>get le-humra</i> due to the witness disqualification and therefore the rule of <i>“reiah ha-get’</i> is inapplicable, and consequently he is allowed to remarry his former wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sha’arei Tzion</i>, supra n. 37</i>
Moreover, addressing the case of a couple who were originally were married by a Reform rabbi and then separated, R. Amar rules that the divorcee would be permitted to marry a <i>kohen</i>. Notwithstanding R. Feinstein’s view that the act of <i>kiddushin</i> never transpired at a wedding ceremony which is officiated by a Reform rabbi, for those <i>Poskim</i> who rule that a <i>get le-humra</i> is required, he concludes that the divorcee may marry a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shema Shlomo</i>, supra n. 37</i> In another case, there was a <i>kol kiddushin</i> (but clearly there was no basis for claiming that the <i>kiddushin</i> ever happened), a <i>get</i> was executed, and subsequently a <i>kohen</i> married her and they had children. The question posed to R. Waldenberg was whether the <i>kohen</i> could remain married to his wife or must he divorce her? Here again, the <i>psak</i> was that he may remain married her and the same line of reasoning as advanced by Rabbis Amar and Boaron was argued by R. Waldenberg.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 4:19.Whereas R.

Waldenberg was equally posed to R. Pinhas Zevichi and he arrives at the identical conclusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Paz, EH</i> 3:3</i>
Finally, notwithstanding that the majority of <i>Poskim</i> contend that a civil marriage does not constitute a <i>halakhic</i> marriage and therefore a <i>get</i> is not required, the Rogotchover, Ma’arkhei Lev, R. Winkler, Melamed le-Ho’il, and R. Henkin mandate the execution of a <i>get le-humra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzofnat Pa’aneiah</i>, Warsaw, 1:26–27; <i>Teshuvot Ma’arkhei Lev</i> 87; <i>Levushei Mordekhai, EH</i> 40–41; <i>Teshuvot Melamed le-Ho’il, EH</i> 20; <i>Perushei Ibra</i> 1:4</i> The question emerges: If a couple who is only civilly married and a <i>kiddushin</i> was never consummated due to the couple separating and <i>get le-humra</i> was issued due to the fact that the civil law mandates a <i>get</i> prior to finalizing a civil divorce, can that divorcee marry a <i>kohen</i>? On the one hand, adopting Rema’s view, Menahem Meishiv Nefesh and R.

See also, <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 1 or 4.</i> Said position is endorsed in contemporary times by the Netanya Regional Beit Din as well as Rabbis O.

In pursuance to R. Aron Soloveitchik, the demand for a <i>get le-humra</i> has only implications for the prohibition of <i>eishit ish</i> (the status of being a married woman). It is only relevant in connection to the relations between the husband and the divorcee. However, in relation to other prohibitions such as <i>mamzerut</i> (<i>halakhic</i> bastardy), one can be lenient.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">A. Soloveitchik, “ <i>Kiddushin</i> that was Officiated by a Conservative Rabbi,” (Hebrew) 20 <i>Tehumin</i>, 297, 308 (5760)</i> The rationale is that because the violation of <i>eishet ish</i> entails a severe prohibition that results in the punishment of <i>karet</i>, a <i>beit din</i> will therefore be concerned to sustain the <i>kiddushin</i> and therefore will mandate a <i>get le-humra</i>. On the other hand, the prohibition of <i>mamzerut</i> is an <i>issur lav</i> (its normative level is lower) and therefore there is lesser concern. To state it differently, a <i>beit din</i> will act less stringently regarding lineage of a child [i.e.<i>mamzerut</i>] than in a case of a doubt where the woman is to be considered still married. A similar line of reasoning would apply to the marriage of a divorcee and a <i>kohen</i>. Given that a marriage of a divorcee and a <i>kohen</i> entails a transgression of an <i>isur lav</i>, the marriage is valid<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Though the marriage is valid, it must be dissolved due to the violation of an <i>issur lav</i>.</i> by dint of the fact that it doesn’t constitute <i>giluy arayot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avnei Miluim</i> 33:1; <i>PDR</i> 7:53–56, 200–201</i> As such, should a <i>get le-humra</i> be executed prior to their marriage, their marriage will be valid and need not be dissolved.
Assuming there are grounds to void a marriage subsequent to the issuance of a <i>get</i> based upon witness disqualification and allow a divorcee to marry a <i>kohen</i>, is there a basis to employ “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”(loosely translated- an erroneous marriage) and permit a divorcee (who was divorced with a <i>get</i>) to marry a <i>kohen</i>? To state it differently, after receiving a <i>get many years earlier,</i> can a divorcee subsequently advance a claim of “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>” and should her claim be found justified, can she marry a <i>kohen</i>? In the wake of a finding that the execution of a <i>get</i> was in actuality a <i>get le-humra</i> due to the fact that after the divorce it was discovered that the witnesses at the <i>kiddushin</i> were ineligible to testify, therefore the divorcee is permitted to marry a <i>kohen</i>. Would we arrive at the same conclusion if the voiding of the marriage is based upon “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”? To the best of my knowledge, such a question has not been addressed in the extant <i>teshuvot</i> and decisions of the Israeli <i>battei din</i>, but let’s try to flesh out the issues and the potential replies to our question.
As we discussed in chapter five, prior to a wife invoking the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage retroactively and claim there was an error in the creation of the marriage, three preconditions must have been obtained: The first is that the husband’s defect must be a major one (a <i>mum gadol</i>) such as sexual impotency, refusing to have children, insanity, homosexuality, or apostasy; secondly, the wife must be unaware of the defect prior to the inception of the marriage and only discovered it after the marriage. On the other hand, if for example, a husband commits adultery or contracts Alzheimer’s during the marriage, though both may be characterized as a <i>mum gadol</i> significantly impairing the matrimonial relationship, nevertheless since the conduct or disease occurred after the onset of the marriage, there would be no grounds for a wife’s claim that the marriage was consummated in error.
Finally, upon a wife’s awareness of the major latent defect that her husband may have intentionally or unintentionally failed to disclose to her, she must decide to leave the marriage. Regarding this condition, whether she must immediately leave the marriage or not, is subject to debat as we have shown.
Assuming all of these conditions would exist, there would be grounds to invoke “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”.
Seemingly, the implementation of “<i>ta’ut</i>” runs afoul of R. Mordekhai Eliyahu’s following <i>psak din</i>. A couple married and after the onset of the marriage she discovered that he was mentally dysfunctional and later divorced him. Subsequently, she married a <i>kohen</i> civilly and then married him in accordance with <i>Halakhah</i> based upon rabbinic advice that the first marriage was a case of “<i>ta’ut</i>”. Addressing this case, R. Eliyahu is unwilling to invoke “<i>ta’ut</i>” due to the fact that he is unsure whether the <i>get</i> was executed <i>min ha-din</i> or as a <i>get le-humra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> 2:1.</i> Clearly, our review of <i>teshuvot</i> did not reveal to us why the <i>get</i> was given and nevertheless the various decisors determined <i>post facto</i> that the execution of the <i>get</i> was rabbinically mandated as a <i>humra</i> and consequently there should be grounds to permit the divorcee to marry the <i>kohen</i>.
Should there be a determination that in fact there was a “<i>ta’ut</i>”, then there may be one of three options. One possibility is that the marriage ought to be voided and therefore she is free to remarry even a <i>kohen</i> due to the fact that she does not have the status of a <i>gerushah</i> (a divorcee). Alternatively, for those <i>Poskim</i> who claim that this case entails “a <i>safek kiddushin</i>” (a doubtful marriage), a <i>get</i> must therefore be executed <i>le-humra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In this situation of <i>safek kiddushin</i>, she has “a <i>hezkat penuyah</i>” (presumptively she is a single woman). See <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif, Kiddushin</i> 5b; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 1:138; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 4 (3–4). Nevertheless, as a precautionary stringency, a <i>get</i> is executed.</i> Since the <i>get</i> executed is rabbinically mandated as a <i>get le-humra</i>, in accordance to the above-cited <i>Poskim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 45–55.</i> the divorcee would be allowed to marry a <i>kohen</i>. Alternatively, espousing the view of those authorities who contend that the rule of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” is applicable even concerning a scenario where there is an issuance of a <i>get le-humra</i> would inexorably lead to the conclusion that the divorcee is proscribed from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.
Should one support the position that a divorcee may marry a <i>kohen</i> by invoking <i>“ta’ut”</i>, can one use as a “<i>senif</i>” (a supporting argument) that we are not 100% sure <i>kohanim</i> nowadays are <i>kohanim</i> and therefore permit the divorcee to marry a <i>kohen</i>? In accordance to Rivash, Yam shel Shlomo, Maharashdam, and others, such an argument may be advanced.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 94; <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 5:35; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 235; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, Orah Hayyim</i> (hereafter: <i>OH</i>) 6; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:93; <i>Teshuvot Mishnat Ya’avetz</i> 1:155; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Elazar</i> 3:56<i>; Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> 7, <i>EH</i> 9:4, 10(4); <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 73. Cf. <i>Poskim</i> cited by <i>Ateret Paz</i>, supra n. 48, at 349.</i>
In conclusion, we began our discussion by noting that there are authorities who will refrain from invalidating a marriage that took place in the past due to the fact that it was now discovered that the witnesses who attested to the act of <i>kiddushin</i> were ineligible. As such, the matrimonial bond never existed. Such a tradition emphasizes the importance of sustaining the <i>halakhic</i> institution of marriage even in the face of an <i>igun</i> situation. At the same time, we observed that there are numerous decisors who would invalidate the marriage under such conditions.
In the context of these two diametrically opposed <i>mesorot</i> (traditions), we have addressed the question whether of there would be any scenarios where a divorcee would be permitted to marry a <i>kohen</i>. In light of the fact that there is a biblical proscription to recognize such a marital tie, there would seemingly be no circumstances where such a marriage ought to be validated. Yet, we found that there is a debate in regards to the discovery of invalid witnesses to an Orthodox wedding or a couple who were either civilly married or were married by a Reform rabbi and <i>get le-humra</i> was issued, whether a <i>kohen</i> could marry any of these Jewish women. As we encountered in the matter of discovering years after the marriage that the <i>edei kiddushin</i> were ineligible at the time of the union, there is ongoing controversy whether we protect the <i>halakhic</i> marriage and continue to affirm the existence of the marriage or not. Similarly, the propriety of a divorcee marrying a <i>kohen</i> where a <i>get</i> was issued in the wake of a Reform wedding or a civil marriage is subject to varying positions. Here, the locus of attention centers upon whether “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” is applicable or not. To state it differently, invoking this rule in effect means that one of our concerns is to stress the significance of the marital tie and that even in circumstances such as a civil marriage or a Reform marriage ceremony where a <i>get</i> would be mandated, a divorcee is prohibited from marrying a <i>kohen</i>. On the other hand, those who claim that “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” is inapplicable in these cases have argued that there are other concerns which lead one to the conclusion that such a marriage ought to be sanctioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See R. Amar’s letter that enumerates these underlying considerations in sanctioning such a marriage. See Bass, infra n. 62, at note 26. In another context, see also, <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 16, who offers similar reasons towards understanding these rulings.</i> For example, one of the concerns mentioned in the <i>teshuvot</i> is that there is a need to minimize the possibility of the non-Torah observant divorcee continuing in engaging in the commission of prohibitions. Consequently, according to certain authorities, a divorcee from a civil marriage may be permitted to marry a <i>kohen halakhically</i>. Should we fail to sanction this <i>halakhic</i> marriage, the man and woman will continue to engage in sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ya’an Avraham</i>, infra n. 62; <i>Shemesh u-Magen</i>, supra n. 59.</i> Finally, in the instance of discovery of “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”, some <i>Poskim</i> will affirm the norm of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” and will proscribe the divorcee from marrying a <i>kohen</i>, while others will invoke the discovery of a preexisting latent flaw in the husband’s persona and permit such a union.
Addressing the need to invoke one <i>halakhic</i> norm among a constellation of <i>halakhic</i> norms in exclusion of another one regarding the propriety of a union between a <i>kohen</i> and a divorcee, we even encounter situations where a <i>get le-humra</i> has not been issued. For example, there is a controversy whether a <i>kohen</i> who civilly married a daughter of a non-Jew is permitted to marry <i>halakhically</i>. Notwithstanding Beit Dovid, R. Feinstein, and Dayan Eliyahu Abergil, who contend that even if a <i>kohen</i> married a daughter of a non-Jew married civilly and had a child <i>post factum</i>, they would be unable to undergo a <i>halakhic</i> marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Dovid</i> 6; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:5; <i>Teshuvot Dibrot Eliyahu</i> 4:31. Cf. Relying in part upon the view of Ramban (<i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 45a, <i>Sefer ha-Zekhut, Yevamot</i> 15a on <i>Rif</i>) which has been accepted subsequently by <i>Beit Shmuel, SA EH</i> 4:2 and <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA EH</i> 4:3, Rabbis Yehiel Weinberg, Avraham Revach, O.

Clearly, his sanction is limited to the fact pattern that he has addressed.

As such, our <i>limmud</i> (study) has demonstrated, we find countervailing <i>halakhic</i> norms emerging from the various situations addressed in our <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa) concerning the propriety of a divorcee marrying a <i>kohen</i>. Among those norms we find the importance of preserving the institution of marriage vs. addressing the <i>igun</i> situation and/or facilitating the religious observance of a member of the Jewish community vs. the norm of “<i>reiah ha-get</i>” in non-<i>igun</i> cases. Which norm(s) will be the determining factor in a particular ruling is subject to the <i>posek’s</i> discretion, which in itself is grounded in the canons of the decision-making process.

A <i>sina qua non</i> to create the <i>ma’aseh kiddushin</i> (the act of halakhic betrothal) is the presence of two adult Jewish males who are qualified (i.e. unrelated to the <i>hatan</i> and <i>kallah</i>), Torah observant,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>EH</i> 42:2, 5</i> and will testify that the <i>hatan</i> recited to his <i>kallah</i> “<i>harei at mekudeshet li betaba’at zo, kedat Moshe ve-Yisrael</i>”, gave a ring to the <i>kallah</i>, that and she accepted it. If needed, these two <i>eidim</i> (witnesses) may be called upon to serve as <i>eidei ra’ayah</i> to confirm in a <i>beit din</i> that in fact the execution of <i>kiddushin</i> was done in pursuance to the dictates of <i>halakhic</i> marriage law.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 65b; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:100.

See <i>Mordekhai Kiddushin</i> 531; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:780. For further discussion, see <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 19; <i>Pithei Teshuvah SA EH</i> 42:12.</i> Moreover, these two individuals serve as <i>eidei kiyyum</i>, who by dint of their presence and participation under the <i>huppah</i>, impart validity to the act of the <i>kiddushin</i>. Whereas the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> serves as the <i>mashgiah</i> (the supervisor), the two witnesses are an integral part in establishing the <i>kiddushin</i>.

For example, assuming the witnesses saw that the man held the ring, recited the “<i>harei at</i>”, and observed that the ring was on the index finger of her right hand but never saw the actual transfer of the ring from the man to the woman, it is a question whether their testimony is effective. See <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 42:4; <i>Beit Shmue</i>l, ad. locum. 12 in the name of Mordekhai; <i>Urim ve-Tumim, HM</i> 90:14; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 40:7.</i>
As Shulhan Arukh rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 42:3</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The <i>mekadesh</i> and the <i>mekudeshet</i> are obligated to see the witnesses.

Given that there are no witnesses at the <i>huppah</i> who were seen by the couple and who witnessed the giving of the ring by the <i>hatan</i> to the <i>kallah</i>, the <i>kiddushin</i> was therefore never consummated.
Subsequently, over a thousand years later, Rabbis Elyashiv, Zolty, and Goldschmidt explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 7:175.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“The witnesses to the <i>kiddushin</i> are witnesses who establish the act of <i>kiddushin</i> rather than witnesses who confirm its existence.

Even in the absence of two witnesses or in the presence of two disqualified witnesses, there is the Hatam Sofer’s view that Torah-committed Jews who observed the <i>kiddushin</i> ceremony yet did not see the actual <i>mesirah</i> (the giving) of the ring by the <i>hatan</i> to the <i>kallah</i> may serve as “<i>anan sahadi</i>” (we are the witnesses) for the <i>kiddushin</i>. And even the presence of non-Torah observant Jews as onlookers to the <i>kiddushin</i> ceremony will not invalidate the testimony of the other Torah-observant Jews who are onlookers there.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hatam Sofer,</i> supra n. 3 which is cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 42:11.

See <i>Teshuvot Beit Avi</i> 5:133; <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 5:12. Such a posture is borne out by a close reading of Hatam Sofer’s <i>teshuvah</i>. Cf. Dayan Shlomo Tenna, <i>Teshuvot Birkat Shlomo</i> 12.</i> Given that at this wedding, the guests at the ceremony included both Torah observant and non-observant Jews, we may seemingly rely upon Hatam Sofer’s position that the act of <i>kiddushin</i> has been established.
Had we have been dealing with a <i>kiddushin</i> that was invalid due to an ineligible witness, and our intent was to validate the marriage via the avenue of onlookers to the <i>huppah</i>, we would have considered invoking the position of the Hatam Sofer.

Moreover, invoking “<i>anan sahadei</i>” is predicated upon the fact that the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> is Torah-observant in general and proficient in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>seder kiddushin ve-nissuin</i> (the engagement and marriage ceremony) in particular.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 3:121 cited by <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA EH</i> 49:1; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:119; <i>Teshuvot Knesset</i> 72;<i> Yehezkel</i>; <i>Shem Aryeh</i>, supra n. 14; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:76–77; <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i>, supra n. 14. Even according to Taz, the <i>mesadeir</i> has to possess a basic knowledge of the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>seder</i> of <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>ni’ssuin</i>, the betrothal and marriage ceremony. See Taz, <i>SA EH</i> 49:1.</i> For example, take a case where the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> executed a double ring ceremony where the <i>hatan</i> gave a ring to the <i>kallah</i> and recited the prescribed halakhic text for <i>kiddushin</i>, “<i>harei at mekudeshet li</i> . . . <i>ve-Yisrael</i>” and the <i>kallah</i> gave a ring to the <i>hatan</i> and stated “<i>ani le-dodi ve-dodi li</i>”. Such an exchange of rings is against <i>halakhah</i> according to certain authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:13. A more problematic case would arise if the woman responded to the man “<i>harei atah mekudash li</i> . . .” Given that the woman must consent to the man’s intent to be <i>mekadesh</i> her l<i>e-sheim</i> <i>kiddushin</i>, her response to create another avenue to consummate <i>kiddushin</i> and seemingly reject the man’s <i>kiddushin</i> is a contravention of <i>Halakhah</i> and, at minimum, creates a <i>safek kiddushin</i> (a doubt whether the act of betrothal has been established). See <i>Shem Aryeh</i>, supra n. 13, at subsection 6; <i>Iyunim be-Mishpat, EH</i> 166.<br>Under certain conditions, Rabbi Feinstein would permit a double ring ceremony. See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:18, 4:32. These circumstances are inapplicable to our case.</i> Therefore, the absence of two witnesses and the execution of a double ring ceremony for <i>kiddushin</i> in our case preclude one from invoking “<i>anan sahadei</i>”.
Despite the <i>halakhic</i> shortcoming of the absence of two witnesses, may one nevertheless invoke the rule of “<i>ein adam oseh be’ilato be’ilat zenut</i>” (a Jew does not engage in sexual relations as an act of illicit fornication)? If this rule is applied, the act of <i>biah</i> (intercourse) would consummate the marriage. Applying this rule presumes that the couple were religiously committed to a Torah way of life, including compliance with the <i>halakhot</i> of family purity, at the time of the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Torah</i> (hereafter: <i>MT</i>), <i>Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:19; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 209; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1:351; <i>SA, EH</i> 26:1, 33:1.<br>Whether the <i>hazakah</i> applies both to the wife as well as the man is subject to dispute. See <i>Ra’avad, Mishnah</i> <i>Torah, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:19; <i>Ran, Kiddushin</i> 25b on Rif; <i>Perishah, Tur, EH</i> 38:52; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe 1:62</i>.</i> The mere living together as a husband and wife does not suffice; their cohabitation must <i>le-sheim ishut</i> of <i>kiddushin</i>—to be conscious that the both are living together to the exclusion of others based upon a <i>halakhic</i> imperative rather than cohabitating with each other devoid of <i>halakhic</i> intent is the desideratum.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:74–77</i> It is our understanding that at the inception of marriage, the spouses were Conservative Jews who were not Torah observant such as keeping <i>Shabbat</i> and therefore the rule of “<i>ein adam oseh be’ilato be’ilat zenut</i>” cannot be applied.
Could the relationship of the cohabitating couple possibly be viewed as an example of <i>pilgashut</i> (concubinage)? <i>Pilagshut</i> is where there is a long-term commitment that is on one hand marked by exclusivity in terms of conjugal relations between the man and the woman and on the other hand is distinguished by the absence of the execution of <i>kiddushin</i> and the giving of a <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Talmud Yerushalmi, Ketuvot</i> 5:2; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21a.</i> In our case, we are dealing with a situation of a man who in effect chose a woman to be his <i>pilegesh</i>. Though a <i>ketubah</i> was signed, in light of the absence of <i>eidei kiddushin</i>, the act of <i>kiddushin</i> never was established and therefore the signing of a <i>ketubah</i>, which is predicated upon the existence of <i>kiddushin</i>, had no halakhic significance.
In the absence of <i>kiddushin</i>, the question is whether one may recognize such a relationship. A review of authorities shows that that there is no “<i>hashash kiddushin</i>” (concern that betrothal has happened).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 284; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 32:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 217.</i> As R.

<span class="poetry indentAll">There is no <i>ishut</i> (marital relationship) here since a woman can be acquired . . . and even though he lived with her and engaged in intercourse a few times, she is not acquired in that fashion.

Consequently, she is not married to him.
Moreover, even if subsequent to the marriage this non-observant couple live within a Torah-observant neighborhood, in light of the fact that they were irreligious and ignorant of the dictates of <i>Halakhah</i>, there would be neither a basis to assume that they knew that two witnesses were required to create <i>kiddushin</i> nor that their cohabitation must be for the sake of <i>kiddushin</i>. Furthermore, their choice of a <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> to execute their marriage implicitly assumed that their marriage would be solemnized in accordance with his understanding of the dictates of <i>Halakhah</i>. In the final analysis, this rabbi was unaware of the basic requirements of creating matrimonial ties to effectuate <i>le-sheim kiddushei Torah</i> (intending to establish a <i>halakhic</i> marriage) through the presence of two eligible witnesses. Consequently, to presume that the couple was consummating the marriage with the intent that their conjugal relations would be <i>le-sheim kiddushei Torah</i> (“<i>hein hein eidei yihud, hein hein edei biah</i>” ) is surely unwarranted based upon their own lack of religious observance including, but not limited to, complying with the <i>halakhot</i> of family purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:76 (end). In fact, even if the couple would have been Torah observant, for those <i>poskim</i> such as Rema and Urim ve-Tumim (see supra n. 4) who require that <i>eidei kiddushin</i> see the entire <i>netinah</i> (giving) of the ring from the man to the woman and the <i>amirah</i> (the recitation) of the <i>kiddushin</i> formula by the man, there ought to be no grounds for invoking “<i>hein hein eidei yihud, hein hein</i> <i>eidei biah</i>”! For understanding how Rema and Urim ve-Tumim would validate this <i>hazakah</i>, see <i>Marheshe</i>t 2:39(8); <i>Iggerot Moshe, Yoreh De’ah</i> 1:48.<br>The implicit assumption is that not only was it the man’s intent to have conjugal relations <i>le-sheim kiddushin</i> but equally the woman’s intent. See <i>Mishneh le-Melekh, Hilkhot Gerushin</i> 10:18; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 2:58; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, EH</i> 41. Cf. <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:75.<br>Consequently, even Riaz would agree that in the absence of <i>edei kiddushin</i>, the mere living together in a community would be inconsequential in declaring the couple <i>halakhically</i> married. See <i>Shiltei Gibborim</i> in the name of <i>Riaz, Kiddushin</i> chapter 3.</i> Moreover, even a Torah-observant Jew today doesn’t intend to consummate his marriage via intercourse.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 209; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 23; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, EH</i> 42 in the name of <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i>; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Shlomo</i> vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 30.</i> In fact, we live in a society marked by promiscuity. Consequently, there is no basis to impute such intent to a non-observant Jews! On the contrary, as Rabbi Feinstein notes, given that the couple did not intend to have relations <i>le-sheim ishut</i> of <i>kiddushin</i> but on the basis of the first <i>kiddushin</i> under the <i>huppah</i>, she therefore does not require a <i>get</i> and is permitted to everyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1: 77–78.</i>
Finally, since the marriage was performed publicly and the couple lived together for years and had children, there is a “<i>kol kiddushin</i>” (loosely translated a rumor of marriage) and therefore the <i>kol</i> should trump the fact that there were no <i>eidim</i> at the wedding.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 52a, 94a; <i>Gittin</i> 84a; <i>SA, EH</i> 6:10, 46:1–7.</i> Whether the <i>kol</i> should be determinative in such a scenario is subject to debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Otzar ha-Poskim, EH</i> 46: 4(28).</i> Secondly, even according to those <i>poskim</i> who contend that the <i>kol</i> outweighs the formal impropriety of the <i>kiddushin</i>, in the case of an <i>agunah</i> the marriage may be voided.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Meir, EH</i> 46; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch) EH 1:91(9); <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama</i> 65; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 43: 2.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Decision</b></span>
Given the absence of two witnesses at the <i>kiddushin</i> who can testify to a valid <i>netinah</i> (the giving) of a ring by the <i>hatan</i> to the <i>kallah</i> while pronouncing aloud the <i>amirah</i> (“<i>harei at</i> . . .”), the act of <i>kiddushin</i> was never consummated. Therefore, Esther Katz is free to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i>.

b) Bittul Kiddushin; The invalidation of an eligible eid kiddushin

<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Facts of the Case</b></span>
The couple was married in March 2010. Until April 2012, she lived in the same bedroom with him and subsequently moved out of the house in June 2012. In a Deal Memorandum (“Agreement”) dated June 2, 2013, executed between the above referenced parties and signed equally by their respective legal counsel there was a provision that the husband would be give a <i>get</i> (a Jewish divorce) to his wife.
Ms. Aliza Friedman (hereafter: the <i>Tova’at</i>—the plaintiff) summoned Mr. Baruch Friedman (hereafter: the <i>Nitva</i>—the defendant), her husband, before our <i>Beit Din</i> for the purpose of receiving her <i>get</i>. The couple was civilly divorced in July 2013. To this very date, the <i>Tova’at</i> has not received her <i>get</i>. The <i>Tova’at</i> was informed by the Nitva’s attorney that the <i>get</i> would be granted on the condition that the <i>Tova’at</i> would sign a stipulation that she would waive her right to any share of the community property. Should she sign the waiver, the <i>Nitva</i> would give her a <i>get</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
In Section IV of the Agreement it states,
<span class="poetry indentAll">The exact language of what needs to be done to obtain a <i>Get</i> shall be included in the Judgment and Respondent shall participate in the ceremony as required by <i>Bet Din</i> of Aliza’s choice. Said ceremony shall be initiated as soon as possible but the final step shall take place upon the date the parties execute the Judgment of Dissolution and the related forms.</span>
According to <i>Halakhah</i>, the question is if a couple takes upon themselves the obligation to dissolve their marriage, is such an agreement valid? An Israeli rabbinical court gave the following reply:
<span class="poetry indentAll">it is clear that a divorce decree issued following a mutual agreement to be divorced, even though the parties undertook the obligation. . . . does not obligate them to become divorced . . . each party may withdraw from the agreement.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 8:175, 179</i></span>
That is, such an agreement is null and void. Numerous rabbinical courts in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> have taken this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 8:257,262; 2:289,290; 3:322, 323; 11:89, 91. See this writer’s, “Breach of a promise to marriage,” 17 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i> 267 (2007).</i>
The agreement has may be characterized as “a promise”, which is binding because <i>Halakhah</i> mandates one to keep one’s word. However, this mandate is unenforceable by a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>) and <i>Rema, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 204:7.</i> A promise to perform an action in the future, such as the promise to give a <i>get</i> in the future, cannot constitute a <i>hithayivut</i> (the undertaking of an obligation).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For differing rationales why a promise to carry out a future action is invalid, see <i>Rashi, Bava Batra</i> 3a s.v. <i>kinyan devarim hu</i>; <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Bava Batra</i> 1:3; <i>Teshuvot Torat Hessed</i> 228; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 1:203.<br>For <i>Poskim</i> who reject the possibility of obligating the giving of a<i> get</i> via the signing of a divorce agreement accompanied by the execution of a <i>kinyan</i> (a symbolic act of undertaking an obligation), see <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen, Psakim</i> 173; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 134:7; <i>Shakh, SA, Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 258:22. However, in our case, if all the terms of the divorce agreement would have been connected to the execution of a <i>get</i> and in effect the execution of the <i>get</i> is a <i>tenai</i> (a condition) to the implementation of the terms of the agreement, then the <i>Nitva</i> would have been obligated to give a <i>get</i> to the <i>Tova’at</i>. See <i>PDR</i> 5:208.</i>
Despite the fact that a <i>beit din</i> cannot mandate that the <i>Nitva</i> comply with his promise to execute a <i>get</i>, over three years have lapsed since they have been separated and this Agreement to address their end-of-marriage issues was executed over three years ago. Clearly, the circumstances indicate that we are dealing with “a dead marriage” with no hopes for marital reconciliation; therefore, the <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to give a <i>get</i> to the <i>Tova’at</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Whether one requires that marital separation be for one year or eighteen months prior to a <i>beit din</i> obligating the giving of a <i>get</i> is subject to debate. See <i>Sefer Meisharim Helek</i> 8, <i>Netiv</i> 23; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:112;<i> Iggerot Moshe, YD</i> 4:15. For a few of the contemporary <i>battei din</i> rulings, see <i>PDR</i> 13:264; File no. 854682/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, June 28, 2012; File no. 470386-20, Haifa Regional Beit Din, June 26, 2014; File no. 4827-21-2, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, July 3, 2005 (Rabbi Daichovsky’s opinion).<br>Given that in our case the separation has been over three years, the consensus of the above-cited authorities would be that the <i>Nitva</i> is obligated to give a <i>get</i>. Whether marital separation and the lack of prospects for reconciliation is an <i>ilat</i> <i>gerushin</i> (a ground for obligating a <i>get</i>) or reflects a <i>beit din’s</i> unwillingness to allow such a situation to persist is a matter of controversy.</i>
In an earlier <i>psak din</i>, we therefore ordered the husband, the <i>Nitva</i> to give a <i>get</i> to his wife unconditionally.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Once a <i>beit din</i> obligates the giving of a <i>get</i>, no preconditions can be advanced by the husband prior to executing the <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:256<i>; Bedek ha-Bayit</i> on <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, HM</i> 143; <i>SA, EH</i> 143:21; see supra chapter 2.</i> However, to this date, the <i>Nitva</i> refuses to give his wife a <i>get</i>.
The question that remains is whether there are grounds to authorize a <i>heter nissuin</i> (permission for the <i>Tova’at</i> to remarry) without the issuance of a <i>get</i>.
Let’s focus upon the wedding ceremony, the event that established the marriage between the couple. To understand the background and building blocks of this practice, we need to offer some <i>halakhic</i> background. Recognizing that marriage consists of two separate acts, called <i>kiddushin</i> (i.e. act of halakhic engagement without cohabitation) and <i>nissuin</i> (marriage with cohabitation) respectively, Rabbi Norman Frimer and Rabbi Dov Frimer note,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Norman Frimer and Dov Frimer, “Reform Marriages in Contemporary <i>Halakhic</i> Responsa,” 21 <i>Tradition</i> (1984) 7, 9–11.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In practical terms, <i>kiddushin</i> as the primary state of Jewish marriage can be . . . normatively constituted through the presence of five <i>halakhic</i> elements . . . At the helm stands <i>kavanah</i>: intention. But intention for what? Two divergent directions emerge . . . According to one authority, the intent of the couple must be for at least the most minimal and natural characteristics of the marital experience . . . That decision, however, must also include the stipulation that the wife shall be exclusively related to her husband and prohibited to all others. From this intent of <i>le-shem ishut</i> will then flow all other authority which will bestow legitimacy and direction upon the formal ceremony and simultaneously form the foundation of the <i>kiddushin</i>. The other view finds the natural standard utterly inadequate . . . What, then, shall be the normative canon for <i>kavanah</i>? It must be <i>lekiddushei Torah</i> or <i>leshem kiddushin</i> . . . a conscious awareness that the ceremony must be <i>kedin</i>, in faithful fulfillment of the hallowed imperatives of Jewish law . . .</span>
. . . the intention to marry must be visibly objectified, in order both to articulate as well as to inculcate the core ideas of that <i>kavanah</i>. Jewish tradition, therefore, devised two more patterns of action to achieve tangibility. One of them was the <i>amirah</i>, an official verbal declaration of marital <i>kavanah</i> to be made directly by the groom to his bride in a formal and public style . . . The other act . . . was the <i>netinah</i>, giving, initiated again by the groom and complemented by the parallel <i>kabbalah</i>, receipt, by the bride. These sequential acts of “give and take” involve an object . . . traditionally a ring . . .
But not only must these facets of <i>kavanah</i> be shared between bride and groom. Normally, the <i>halakha</i> also demands . . . <i>ratson</i>-a fourth element, involving the couple’s voluntary assent to all parts of the <i>erusin</i> (i.e. <i>kiddushin</i> –AYW) . . .
Finally, a Jewish marriage must be witnessed by at least two qualified <i>edim</i>, whose responsibility is two-fold. When necessary, they . . . can help establish the facts and certify the . . . degree of compliance with the prerequisites of Jewish marriage law. Yet, even more critical is their role . . . who by their very presence and participation at the ceremony constitute the validity of the <i>ma’aseh kiddushin.</i> (i.e. an act of engagement –AYW.)
In short, the subjective marital intentions of the Jewish man and Jewish woman are translated into reality via verbal articulation; concretization of this intent must occur under the scrutiny of two witnesses and in the presence of an officiating rabbi and public assemblage (minimally ten adult male Orthodox Jews) for the expressed purpose of establishing a consensual marital union.
Given the procedural requirements to establish whether in fact a marriage was created, we need to inquire whether there were two adult Jewish Torah-observant males who were present under the <i>huppah</i> who would corroborate that the <i>hatan</i> was <i>mekadesh</i> (<i>halakhically</i> engaged) his <i>kallah</i>. Generally speaking, notwithstanding the positions of some authorities,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Penei Yehoshua, Gittin</i> 17a; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Yoel</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot va-Ya’an Dovid, EH</i> 175, Ettinger, <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi</i> 1:44; <i>Da’at Torah, YD</i> 1(18); <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 48; <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, YD</i> 281:9.</i> nowadays every adult Jewish male has a “<i>hezkat kashrut</i>” (a presumption of being Torah observant) and therefore qualified to be a witness to the act of <i>kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot Beit ha-Levi</i> 2:4; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, HM</i> 310; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 5 (2–4).</i> That being said, we are not absolved from inquiring into the Torah observance of each witness.
Reviewing pictures of the <i>huppah</i> ceremony, based upon the <i>Tova’at’s</i> information,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For the grounds of relying upon her information, see <i>Nahalat Tzvi</i> 2, 241–242. Lest one argue that her information may be biased in terms of misrepresenting the facts in order for the <i>beit din</i> to invalidate the <i>kiddushin</i>, R. Feinstein rules that if it is clear that the wife does not know the <i>halakhot</i> regarding the requirements of having witnesses and kosher ones, then her information is deemed credible. See <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>EH</i> 4:83(3).<br>Seemingly, the viewing of pictures or a video does not constitute <i>halakhic</i> testimony. As we know, in Talmudic times, the marking the New Moon was fixed by the actual observation by at least two witnesses. The <i>Mishnah Rosh Hashanah</i> 24a teaches us that observing the moon via its reflection in water or via the flame of the candle is considered invalid testimony. Therefore, the viewing of pictures or a video would equally be invalid testimony. However, authorities note that direct observation rather than knowledge of the event is a<i> Halakhah</i> regarding the sanctification of the moon; however, in other areas of <i>Halakhah</i>, knowledge suffices. See <i>SA HM</i> 30:14, 90:6; <i>Teshuvot Ein</i> <i>Yitzhak EH</i> 31; <i>Teshuvot Shevut</i> <i>Ya’akov</i> 1:126. In fact, in contemporary times, one authority argues that viewing of pictures or a video is equivalent to the testimony of two eligible witnesses. See <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 23.</i> we found that under the <i>huppah</i> were the parents of the <i>hatan</i> and <i>kallah</i>, two relatives from the <i>kallah’s</i> family, one relative from the <i>Nitva’s</i> family, one woman who was a non-relative, one adult male Jew who was unrelated to anybody under the <i>huppah</i> and an rabbi who <i>was mesadeir kiddushin</i> he supervised the <i>halakhic</i> propriety of the <i>kiddushin</i> (<i>halakhic</i> engagement) as well as the <i>nissuin</i> (<i>halakhic</i> marriage) that were performed under the <i>huppah</i>. We contacted the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> and we were informed that the <i>kiddushin</i> was performed without designating (<i>meyaheid)</i> the witnesses. Moreover, we inquired and discovered that the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> violated the <i>Shabbat</i> (in the actual <i>psak din</i> the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> was Torah-observant).
All the relatives present under the <i>huppah</i> were <i>be-dargat kirvah</i> (in the class of relatives who would be invalidated to serve as witnesses for the act of <i>kiddushin</i>). Amongst the individuals present under the <i>huppah</i> during the performance of the <i>kiddushin</i> were relatives from the mother’s family. Notwithstanding most <i>Poskim</i> who rule that such individuals are invalid <i>mi-de-oraita</i> (on a biblical level),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 14 in the name of Rav Hai, Rif, Ramban, and Rashba; Hayyim Medini, <i>Ohr Lee</i>, 70(4) cites <i>Divrei Rivot</i> that “<i>geonai olam</i>” disagreed with Rambam.</i> in accordance with certain interpretations of Rambam’s view<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishneh Torah</i> (hereafter:MT)<i> Hilkhot Eidut</i> 13:1.</i> such testimony is to be invalidated only on a rabbinic level.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef, Tur,</i> <i>EH</i> 42 (end) in the name of Tashbetz; <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 33</i> Consequently, even if one rules that the individuals are invalidated as witnesses on a rabbinic level, Rambam as well as Shulhan Arukh and Rema conclude that a <i>get</i> is required <i>mi-safek</i>, because of the existence of doubt that the act of <i>kiddushin</i> may have been valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema, EH</i> 42:5.</i>
The individuals who were invalidated as witnesses on a rabbinic level were not the only ones present under the <i>huppah</i>. Individuals who were invalid <i>mi-de-oraita</i> were present under the <i>huppah</i>. Seemingly, their presence invalidates the testimony of those witnesses who were eligible <i>mi-de-oraita</i> based upon the rule in matters of <i>kiddushin</i> “if any witness is a relative or invalid, the testimony of the others is null”.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Makkot</i> 6a. The assumption in invoking this rule is that it is applicable not only to criminal and monetary matters, but it is equally applicable to matters of <i>kiddushin</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 76; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Kama</i> 94.<br>Though women are ineligible as witnesses, nonetheless the rule “if any witness is a relative or invalid, the testimony of the others is null” may be applicable to women. See <i>Turei Even, Rosh Hashanah</i> 22a; <i>Teshuvot Brit Ya’akov, EH</i> 43; <i>Teshuvot Nahal Yitzhak</i>, 35(6–7); <i>PDR</i> 10:229. Consequently, the presence of the woman who is a non-relative (as well as the other relatives) under the <i>huppah</i> will invalidate the eligible witness.<br>Implicit in our conclusion is that a woman in principle could be a witness (“<i>shem eid aleha</i>”), but for various reasons her testimony is invalid. See R. Y.B. Soloveitchik, <i>Reshimot Shiurim, Shavuot</i> and <i>Nedarim</i> 1–2; <i>Reshimot Shiurim, Sukkah</i> 108. See also <i>Turei Even</i>, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 6.<br>Many <i>Poskim</i>, such as <i>Hiddushei R. Akiva Eiger, YD</i> 228:3, <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger</i> 1:73 (<i>hashmatot</i>); <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, HM</i> 8; <i>Urim ve-Tumim</i> 36:11 <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 36:10, and <i>Teshuvot Shem Aryeh, HM</i> 13(end), argue that a woman is in principle not a witness, therefore the rule “if any witness is a relative or invalid, the testimony of the others is null” is inapplicable to women. Consequently, according to these authorities, the presence of a woman who is not a relative to the prospective couple under the <i>huppah</i> would not invalidate the eligible witnesses.</i> This rule is inapplicable if a party to the <i>kiddushin</i> designated only certain eligible individuals to serve as witnesses to the exclusion of others. The presence of ineligible persons under the <i>huppah</i> will not affect the eligibility of the designated witnesses due to the fact that the selection of two witnesses in effect <i>halakhically</i> separates them from the individuals surrounding them during the time of the <i>kiddushin</i>. In our case, as we were told by the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i>, he did not designate any individuals as witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, there is no requirement to designate individuals as <i>eidei kiddushin</i>. See <i>SA, EH</i> 42:4. Even if the witnesses observed the act of<i> kiddushin</i>, their testimony is valid. See <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 42:11 in the name of <i>Beit Meir</i> and <i>Hatam Sofer</i>; <i>Teshuvot Bikurei Asher</i> 1:12. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Panim Me’irot</i> 3:25.<br>Nevertheless, the practice in many communities is to designate them. See <i>Hagahot ha-Semag, mitzvah</i> 183(7); <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 36:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 2:707; <i>Beit Meir</i> 42:4; <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 37:8; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, HM</i> 57 in the name of <i>Hatam Sofer</i>. Among the reasons that the practice is to designate witnesses is our concern for Ritva’s view (see infra text accompanying note 18) that ineligible witnesses may invalidate an eligible witness. See <i>Radvaz</i>, op. cit.; <i>Shakh</i>, op. cit.; <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 42:6; <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, EH</i> 99:8. Secondly, it may occur that relatives are standing next to the <i>hatan</i> and <i>kallah</i> and other nonrelatives stand at a distance from the prospective couple. Therefore, we designate witnesses in order that the eligible witnesses move forward and stand near the prospective couple to be able to testify to the act of <i>kiddushin</i>. See <i>Ketzot ha-Hoshen</i>, op. cit.</i> Seemingly, the absence of designation invalidates any eligible witness present under the <i>huppah</i> during the performance of <i>kiddushin</i>.
The question is whether the actual presence of ineligible witnesses who are biblically invalid and who have no intention to testify to the act of <i>kiddushin</i> will invalidate an eligible witness as well as the relatives who are invalid according to certain <i>Poskim</i>? According to many <i>Poskim</i>, the rule of “if any witness is a relative or invalid, the testimony of the others is null” is in effect only if the ineligible witness intended to be a witness to the <i>kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently, if the eligible witnesses intended to testify and the invalid witnesses did not intend to testify, the testimony of two eligible witnesses is valid. See <i>SA, HM</i> 36:1;<i> Sma, SA HM</i> 36:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i>, Bi’urim 36:1. Cf. <i>Shakh, SA</i> <i>HM</i> 36:3.</i> In our case, it is clear that the presence of these family members under the <i>huppah</i> was only for the purpose of being onlookers rather than serving as witnesses.
However, there exists the minority position of Ritva in the name of his teacher Ra’ah, which is agreed upon by some <i>rishonim</i> (early authorities), R. Akiva Eiger, and authoritatively cited as a <i>senif</i> (lit. an appendage—a supporting argument) by some contemporary <i>dayanim</i> that in the absence of designating the witnesses, if both eligible and ineligible witnesses are present under the <i>huppah</i>, that the testimony is invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Gittin 18b,Kiddushin</i> 43a; <i>Shakh</i> 36:8 in the name of <i>ha-Gahot Semak</i> 183; <i>Tosafot Yeshanim</i> in the name of <i>Rashbam, Bava Batra</i> 113a; <i>Teshuvot R. Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 56 (28b); <i>Teshuvot Zikhron Yehuda</i> 81; <i>Rabbeinu Yeruham, Sefer Meisharim</i> 7; <i>Teshuvot Shemesh u-Magen</i> vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 10, 3 EH 53; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 8:37(9) in the name of Ritva, “and many uphold him”; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 25.<br>However, a review of the <i>Poskim</i> will show that in fact the posture that is attributed to Ritva is in actuality the posture of his teacher Ra’ah. A review of <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i> on Tractates <i>Gittin</i> and <i>Kiddushin</i>, op. cit as well as some authorities who cite Ritva (see e.g. <i>Erech Shulhan HM</i> 36:6; <i>Teshuvot Kerem Shlomo</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Avir Ya’akov</i> 24; <i>Teshuvot Givat Olam</i> 11; <i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> 10: 327,329) will show that in fact Ritva dissents from his teacher, Ra’ah and it is for this reason that in one of his other commentaries of the Talmud Ritva advances a question which attacks Ra’ah’s posture. See <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Makot 6a,</i> Mosad ha-Rav Kook ed., 79.<br>Nonetheless, in our presentation we have followed the lead of many <i>Poskim</i> who identify Ritva as the author of this view.</i> In contemporary times, various <i>Poskim</i> and Israeli <i>dayanim</i> rule upon the propriety of a particular act of <i>kiddushin</i> by factoring into consideration Ritva’s view, along with other factors, in voiding a marriage under various circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:111, 3:50; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:13; <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i>, supra n. 18, at section 9; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 3(5); <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion, vol. 2, EH</i> 10–11; <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i>, vol. 4, <i>EH</i> 1(5).<br>Implicit in their posture to rely upon a minority opinion as “a <i>senif”</i> rather than an independent and self-standing line of reasoning is predicated upon the notion that the argument of <i>kim li</i> will be ineffective against contrary rulings of Shulhan Arukh and Rema. See <i>Tumim SA HM</i> 25. Pursuant to <i>halakhic</i> court procedure, a party in dispute can argue as follows: “I want the <i>beit din</i> to rule in my favor, which is based upon the position of Rabbi X who affirms my claim”. Under certain conditions, we will accept his view even if Rabbi’s X‘s opinion reflects a minority view. The <i>kim li</i> argument is generally invoked in monetary claims but equally has been employed concerning<i> issurim</i>, prohibitions such as <i>ribbit, halakhically</i> prohibited interest, <i>shevuot</i>, oaths, <i>nedarim</i>, vows and <i>ishut</i>, matters of personal status. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridvaz</i> 4: 278(=1349), 6:225; <i>Teshuvot Maharibil</i> 1:13, 2:46.Given that Ritva’s posture, supra n. 18 may be construed as a minority view related to an <i>ishut</i> matter and in light of the fact that neither Shulhan Aruch nor Rema subscribe to his position, consequently the above cited authorities employ Ritva’s stance as a <i>senif</i> only.</i> Disqualification of the eligible witnesses is contingent upon the fact that all or at least one of the ineligible witnesses saw the eligible witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ritva</i>, supra n. 18; <i>Shakh, SA, HM</i> 36:6, 7; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 36:4. Others contend that if the eligible witnesses saw the invalid witnesses, their testimony is invalid. See <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat, Hiddushin</i> 36:6; <i>Sma, SA, HM</i> 36:5(end).<br>In a situation where the two witnesses to the <i>kiddushin</i> were invalid and in light of the fact that the individuals were not designated as witnesses, argues Dayan Eliyahu Abergil that one must be concerned with Ritva’s position and one cannot validate the <i>kiddushin</i> based upon two eligible witnesses who are sitting in the audience. See File no. 92507/1, Be’eir Sheva Regional Beit Din, March 29, 2009.</i>
Given that Ritva’s position is reflective of a minority view, why would we cite it as one of the bases of our judgment? Clearly there is an acute need to distinguish what transpires in the portals of the <i>beit midrash</i> (study hall) and the world of <i>psak</i>. As R. Aharon Lichtenstein astutely observes,
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Hora’ah</i> (<i>halakhic</i> decision-making) is comprised of two elements: <i>psak</i> and <i>pesikah</i>, respectively. The former refers to codification, the formulation of the law pertinent to a given area . . . of one position in preference to others. As such, it is, essentially the concluding phase of the learning process proper . . . and its locus is the <i>bet midrash</i>. <i>Pesikah</i>, by contrast, denominates implementation. It bespeaks the application of what has already been forged in the crucible of the learning to a particular situation . . . Its venue is, publicly, the <i>bet din</i>, or, privately, the meeting of the inquirer and respondent . . . Its challenge lies in the need to harness knowledge and responsibility at the interface of reality and <i>Halakhah</i> . . . (Leaves of Faith, vol. 1, 162–163)</span>
Our <i>psak’s</i> reliance in part on Ritva’s position belies R. Lichtenstein’s understanding of what the process of <i>psak</i> entails for a <i>dayan</i>. Addressing the situation of the classical <i>agunah</i> where the husband has disappeared and his whereabouts are unknown and noting the uniqueness of each <i>agunah</i> situation, R. Ya’akov Reischer rules the following,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i>, 3:110. Lest one challenge our readiness to employ R. Reischer’s view in light of the fact that his ruling is <i>le-halakhah ve-lo le-ma’aseh</i> (in theory rather than in practice) nothing could be farther from <i>halakhic</i> truth. Invoking these types of theoretical rulings as practical judgments in other contexts is not unusual. See <i>Sdei Hemed ha-Shalem, Kelalei ha-Poskim, Siman</i> 16(47); <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 18. Consequently, in voiding a marriage where prior to the marriage a husband failed to disclose a <i>mum gadol</i> (a latent major defect), an arbiter has in part relied upon a theoretical decision handed down by <i>Havot Ya’ir</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Dvar Eliyahu</i> 48; <i>Teshuvot Emunat Shmuel</i> 34; <i>Teshuvot Even Shoham</i> 56.<br>Seemingly, relying upon a minority opinion is in conflict with the basic principle of <i>halakhic</i> decision-making, “<i>aharei rabbim le-hatot</i>”, the rule to follow the majority. See <i>Tosefta Berakhot</i> 4:15; <i>Rambam, Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i> 175; <i>Rashi, Bava Kama</i> 116a. However, as other <i>Poskim</i> note, the application of this rule is limited to resolving issues within the confines of a <i>beit din</i> proceeding and cannot be extended to intergenerational <i>halakhic</i> disputes. See Z. N. Goldberg, <i>Darkhei ha-Psak</i>, Shevat 5765, 19-22,42 at n. 86 in the name of <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Sanhedrin</i> 32a;<i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:104 cited approvingly by <i>Beit Yosef, Tur HM</i> 13(end)[ Cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:153]; <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah HM</i> 16; <i>Tumim</i> 25, <i>Kitzur Takfo Kohen</i> 123; <i>Get Pashut</i>, Kelalim, kelal 1,5; <i>Teshuvot Maharlbah</i> 147; <i>Teshuvot Maharit HM 79 in the name of Mahari Beirav</i>; <i>Sdei Hemed</i>, Ma’arekhet 10, chapter 32 in the name of Rashba, Maharik, Maharshakh and Penei Moshe; <i>Teshuvot Mishpatim Yesharim</i> 1:238; <i>Teshuvot She’eilat Dovid,</i> Introduction, 12-18; <i>Hazon Ish, Orlah</i> 17, <i>Kelayim</i> 1; <i>Sheve’it</i> 23; R. Chayes, <i>Mishpat ha-Hora’ah</i>, 4-5 in the name of Ramban; <i>Teshuvot Kohav me-Ya’akov</i> 1:41. For additional authorities who espouse this view, see <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 2, <i>OH</i> 12(3).<br>In fact, in light of Beit Yosef’s unwillingness to endorse the rule of majority rule regarding intergenerational <i>halakhic</i> controversy it is no surprise that in his own <i>halakhic</i> works, following the majority of <i>Poskim</i> plays no rule in rendering a <i>psak</i>. Rabbi Yosef Caro’s methodology of <i>halakhic</i> decision making is based upon Alfasi, Rambam and Rosh. In the event that one of the three authorities did not address the matter and the other two are in disagreement, Rabbi Karo follows the majority opinion which includes Ramban, Rashba, Ran, Mordekhai and Semag. See <i>Beit Yosef, Tur OH</i>, Introduction. In effect, Rabbi Karo chooses a technical formula of decision making based upon a preselected group of authorities rather than following majority rule of all authorities who addressed a matter or an assessment of the argumentation of the merits of each issue.<br>As noted by <i>R. O. Yosef</i>, op. cit. the basis for invoking a minority position is grounded in the Talmudic decision making rule that in matters of <i>aveilut</i>, mourning and <i>eruvin</i>, one follows the minority view rather than the majority opinion. The implicit assumption being that there was no face to face <i>halakhic</i> debate regarding the issue. See <i>Mo’eid Katan</i> 20a and <i>Eruvin</i> 46a. R. Moshe ben Shlomo Ibn Haviv adduces additional Talmudic proofs which corroborate this position. See <i>Get Pashut,</i> op. cit.<br>Since the question of whether <i>Poskim</i> endorse the minority view of Ritva is a resolution which takes place among authorities who live in different places and in different times rather than within the confines of a <i>beit din</i>, in accordance with the aforementioned authorities, the directive to follow majority rule is inapplicable. In fact, contends <i>R. Chayes</i>, op. cit. that <i>Shakh,</i> infra n. 23 who stakes out the position that one is proscribed from reliance upon a minority view in a biblical matter forgot that the majority rule principle is inapplicable regarding intergenerational halakhic controversies. See <i>Mishpat ha-Hora’ah,</i> op. cit, 380.</i>

<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Final Thoughts</b></span>
<b>I.</b>
Given that our case deals with uprooting a Biblical prohibition of <i>eishit ish</i>, a married woman based upon the minority opinion of the Ritva, we need to inquire whether in fact <i>Halakhah</i> allows one to rely upon a singular view entailing a Biblical injunction? Given that voiding the marriage of a modern-day <i>agunah under certain conditions</i> may entail a Biblical matter of <i>eishit ish</i>, this question is of reliance upon a minority opinion assumes primary significance.
As we mentioned earlier, there are <i>Poskim</i> who will only rely upon a minority opinion in a <i>d’rabbanan</i>, a matter of Rabbinic law (e.g. the case of a classical <i>agunah</i> “in endless waters”).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 23.</i> In fact, as presented though R. Haviv of the latter half of the seventeenth century marshals numerous proofs from the Talmud and <i>Poskim</i> that one may rely upon a minority opinion in a biblical matter, nonetheless, he concludes that <i>Poskim ha-Achronim</i>, later decisors who live in recent generations who are “orphans of orphans” are reluctant to render any judgment, much less one that will uproot a biblical prohibition. Consequently, R. Haviv aligns himself with their approach and refuses to invoke a minority opinion in dealing with a biblical matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Get Pashut</i>, Kelal 6.</i>
Nonetheless, based upon various Talmudic precedents, as we presented earlier, there are authorities who will rely upon a minority view in a <i>d’oraita</i>, a biblical matter such as the prohibition of being a married woman (e.g. our situation of voiding the marriage of a modern-day <i>agunah</i> by invalidating witnesses attesting to the act of <i>kiddushin)</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 23.</i>
If in fact, the majority of <i>aharonim</i>, later authorities endorse the position that a minority opinion cannot be invoked in a biblical matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sdei Hemed</i>, Ma’arkehet kaf, siman 109, page 207.</i> then seemingly one must refrain from subscribing to the minority view of authorities who rely upon a minority view in a biblical matter? However, as we explained if following the majority view is inapplicable to Torah matters due to the fact that there is no face to face debate amongst the <i>Poskim</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 21.</i>so from a biblical standpoint there exists a <i>safek</i>, a doubt what the <i>Halakhah</i> ought to be and it is due to a <i>rabbinic enactment</i> that we endorse the majority view even in matters dealing with Biblical prohibitions such as the biblical <i>issur</i> of <i>eishit ish</i>, which looms in some of the fact situations dealing with the modern-day <i>agunah</i>. <i>Safek d’oraita le-humra me-derabbanan</i>, rabbinically we rule strictly in biblical matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Mishnah Torah, Hilkhot Tumat ha-Met</i> 9:15; Ra’avad, <i>MT, Hilkhot Kelayim</i> 10:27), <i>Pri Hadash, YD</i> 110, <i>Sefek Sefeka, Seridei Esh,</i> supra n. 23 and R. Kook, <i>Shabbat ha-Aretz</i>, chapter 10 contend that in a matter of doubt of a biblical matter we follow the strict view on a rabbinic level. For additional <i>teshuvot</i> of <i>Aharonim</i> (later authorities) see <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 1, <i>OH</i> 19:7, 21:1; vol. 4, <i>YD</i> 16:3 and <i>Teshuvot Dibrot Eliyahu</i>, vol. 3, <i>OH</i> 1. In fact, as noted by R. Yosef (<i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 1, <i>OH</i> 36(10)) there are many <i>Poskim</i> who subscribe to Rambam’s view in situations of dealing with <i>issurim</i>, prohibitions. See Maharit Algazi, <i>Hilkhot Yom</i> <i>Tov</i>; <i>Behorot</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Havot Da’at</i> 110, <i>kelalei sefek sefeka</i>; <i>Teshuvot Keren le-Dovid</i> 114; <i>Teshuvot Tarshish Shoham</i> 28; <i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 71.</i> As such, as we mentioned many <i>Poskim</i> argue that we may rely upon a minority opinion in a matter of rabbinic law.
Based upon the foregoing, subscribing to the view that one may rely upon Ritva as a <i>shitat yahid</i>, a minority view regarding a biblical matter may be more readily understandable and acceptable towards arriving at a <i>halakhic</i> decision involving a modern day <i>agun</i>ah for one of two reasons: Either we may rely upon upon a minority opinion in a biblical matter such as the situation of a modern-day <i>agunah</i>. Alternatively, in light of the inapplicability of following the majority in intergenerational <i>halakhic</i> controversies and in view of invoking the rule of <i>safek d’oraita le-humra me-derabbanan</i>, as we explained earlier, we are in actuality dealing with a rabbinic matter and consequently we may rely upon a minority opinion which would void a marriage of a modern- day <i>agunah</i>.
Finally, relying upon this minority view of Ritva is premised upon demonstrating that there does not exist a normative <i>halakhic</i> resolution that rejected Ritva’s posture. The entitlement of an authority to invoke a minority position is predicated upon the fact that the <i>Halakhah</i> has not been established in variance to that posture, in Talmudic parlance it is known as “<i>lo itmar hilkhita</i>”. <sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eruvin</i> 46a; <i>Niddah</i> 9b</i>. That being said, if the <i>Halakhah</i> has been formally resolved, “<i>itmar hilkhita</i>”, a decisor is precluded from relying upon the minority opinion.
<i>Itmar hilkhita</i> has been understood within the context of three different literary sources of the corpus of <i>Halakhah</i>. Firstly, should the Talmud have ruled explicitly in favor of a majority view, one cannot invoke a minority view.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i> 2:306; <i>Ravyah</i>, Lulav 697; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 4:80.</i> Since the Talmud has not endorsed the majority view, in our situation, therefore a <i>Posek</i> may rely upon the minority view of Ritva if there is “a <i>she’at ha-dehak</i>”. Similarly, if Shulhan Arukh, the classical restatement of <i>Halakhah</i> and many <i>Poskim</i> have staked out a position against the minority position, one may invoke a minority position in a <i>she’at ha-dehak</i> even in a matter entailing a Biblical injunction.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 11, 100; O. Yosef, <i>Kuntres be-Inyan Heter Mehirat Karkaot be</i>-<i>Shevi’it, Minhat Aharon</i>, Yerushalayim 5750.</i> In our case, though <i>SA HM</i> 36:1 as well as many authorities reject Ritva’s view, in accordance to the above cited authorities one may still rely upon the minority view.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Hazon Ish YD</i> 150:3-4; <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 4:83, Anaf 1.</i> The basic premise of the foregoing presentation is that we are dealing with a <i>shitat yahid</i>, a minority view <i>attributed</i> to Ritva.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 18</i>
The question is a <i>shitat yahid</i> a singular opinion of an authority or may it reflect the view of a few decisors who are in variance with the majority of <i>Poskim</i>? In other words, if the latter position is advanced, the result would be that if there exists a singular opinion one may not rely upon the minority view. A cursory glance of the Mishnaic and Talmudic sources would indicate that we are dealing with a view of “a lone ranger” rather than “<i>a me’ut ha-Poskim</i>”, a minority of authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Eduyo</i>t 1:5-6; <i>Tosefta Eduyot</i> 1:4; <i>Eruvin</i>, supra n. 45.; <i>Niddah</i> 6a, 9b</i> Consequently, R. Schneersohn<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> 218.</i> and R. Yosef<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kuntres be-Inyan Heter Mekhirah</i>, supra n. 47.</i> conclude that even those decisors who will not rely upon a minority opinion concerning a Biblical matter in a state of emergency will invoke the view if it is supported by a minority of decisors.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kuntres be-Inyan Heter Mekhirah</i>, supra n. 47.</i> Consequently, given that Ritva’s view has been subscribed to by a few others,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 18.</i> therefore we can rule in pursuance to their view in our case dealing with a Biblical injunction of <i>eishit ish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. others who contend that Ritva’s view may be only utilized as a <i>senif</i>, supporting argument in arriving at a decision. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> <i>EH</i> 2:64; <i>Teshuvot Malbushei Yom Tov</i> 2:5; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:111, 3:50(20); supra n. 19.</i>
Alternatively, given that there are some authorities who claim that the <i>halakhic</i> rule that when there exists a state of emergency one may rely upon a minority view which encompasses <i>me’ut ha-Poskim</i>, i.e. a minority of authorities rather than a singular opinion,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit YD</i> 33; <i>Get Pashut</i>, supra n. 40; <i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 1:75, 3:102,111; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 17:8, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 12(13).</i> therefore as we explained there are grounds to invoke Ritva’s view who was endorsed by other decisors in a situation of a Biblical proscription such as the modern day <i>agunah</i>. Finally, we may rely upon Ritva’s opinion in a biblical matter due to the fact that there are a minority of decisors who subscribe to his position.
In sum, we may rely upon Ritva’s posture for one of three reasons: Either we may rely upon upon a minority opinion concerning a biblical prohibition such as the freeing a modern-day <i>agunah</i> without a <i>get</i> without contravening the Biblical prohibition of <i>eishit ish</i>. Alternatively, in light of the inapplicability of following the majority in intergenerational <i>halakhic</i> controversies and in view of invoking the rule of <i>safek d’oraita le-humra me-derabbanan</i>, we are in actuality dealing with a rabbinic matter and consequently we may rely upon a minority opinion which would void a marriage of a modern- day <i>agunah</i>. Finally, we may rely upon Ritva’s position in a biblical matter due to the fact that there are a minority of <i>Poskim</i> who agree with his view.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>II.</b></span>
A review of many <i>teshuvot</i> and the few <i>piskei din</i> of the rabbinical courts under the Israeli Chief Rabbinate that mandate <i>bittul kiddushin</i> (voiding a marriage), one encounters that the issuance of the <i>piskei din</i> is contingent upon third party rabbinic approval. A plausible explanation for desiring rabbinic approval is the following: The <i>kiddushin</i> (betrothal) relationship establishes a personal status, namely, that of a <i>mekudeshet</i> (a woman designated for a particular man and prohibited to all others).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiddushin</i> 2b</i> The establishment of this personal status known as <i>ishut</i> renders both spouses subject to various prohibitions, e.g. sexual relations with various relatives become prohibited. On one hand, a refusal to invoke <i>bittul kiddushin</i> means that the <i>issur</i> continues to exist; on the other hand, the implementation of <i>bittul</i> means that the <i>issur</i> no longer exists and the wife, in the case of an <i>agunah</i>, is permitted to remarry without the issuance of a <i>get</i>. Prohibiting <i>bittul kiddushin</i> in part is due to the lurking fear that the woman is an <i>eishit ish</i> and therefore should we permit her to remarry she would be living in sin and should she bear children her offspring will be <i>mamzerim</i>. As such, given the concern that the wife has a <i>hezkat eishit ish</i> (is presumptively married), a <i>beit din</i> may seek the approval of other(s) prior to rendering a decision to void a marriage.
The emerging question is whether the seeking of outside rabbinic approval is a <i>nohag</i> (a practice) devoid of any <i>halakhic</i> significance or if it is to be viewed as a <i>halakhic</i> norm, which requires an arbiter to seek approval. If the answer to our question is that it is to be understood as a <i>halakhic</i> obligation devolving upon the arbiter that means every arbiter, regardless of his rabbinic stature, is mandated to find rabbinic endorsement. Moreover, given the paramount concern to avoid undermining the presumption that the wife is a married woman, one would expect that a <i>beit din</i> would look for “a second opinion” in other areas of <i>ishut</i> (family relations) that impact upon the <i>hazakah</i> of <i>eishit ish</i>.
But in fact this is not the case. For example, there exists certain grounds for a Jewish divorce known in modern Hebrew parlance as “<i>ilot gerushin</i>”, which may serve as a basis for <i>beit din</i> to coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. As we know, the <i>get</i> must be executed with the consent of both the husband and wife. Should a <i>beit din</i> fail to have an adequate basis for coercing a husband to give a <i>get</i>, the net result is a “<i>get meuseh</i>” (a coerced <i>get</i>), which is null and void according to the majority of <i>Poskim</i> and she remains a married woman until a proper <i>get</i> is executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Gittin</i> 88b, s.v. <i>mifsal</i>; <i>Rashbam Bava Batra</i> 48a, s.v. <i>ve-khain</i>; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 70a, s.v. <i>yotzi</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:6; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Ketuvot</i> 77a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran, Gittin</i> 49a, s.v <i>get</i> <i>me’useh</i>; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 104; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573,2:276; <i>Meiri, Beit ha-Behirah, Gittin</i> 88b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 339 in the name of Rashi; <i>Maggid Mishneh, MT, Hilkhot</i> <i>Ishut</i> 14:8; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 41; <i>Yam shel Shlomo Yevamot</i> 12:33; <i>Helkat Mehokeik SA, EH</i> 77:5; <i>Tur, EH</i> 134; <i>SA,</i> <i>EH</i> 134:7; <i>Rema, SA,</i> <i>HM</i> 205:7; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:138; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, shoresh 63; <i>Beit Shmuel</i> <i>SA</i> EH 134: 10, 13; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz</i> 1:40; <i>Teshuvot Mahari</i> <i>bei Rav</i> 41;<i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 38, 48; <i>Meshoveiv Netivot</i> 3; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Mikhtav mei-Eliyahu, Sha’ar 7, 19; Teshuvot R.

There is no such discussion because there is no such <i>halakhic</i> requirement! As recently as six years ago, <i>Dayanim</i> Sheinfeld, Abergil, and Toledano handed down a ruling to coerce a <i>get</i> due to the fact that the husband had been obligated to give a <i>get</i> and continued to be <i>me’agein</i> his wife.

Another example is the propriety of dissolving a civil marriage between two Jews without the issuance of a <i>get</i>.

Given that prior to rendering <i>get</i> compulsion orders and the dissolution of civil marriage ties without a <i>get</i> there is no requirement for seeking rabbinic endorsement, why do many authorities void a marriage based upon a <i>halakhic</i> impropriety in the <i>kiddushin</i> only provided there is rabbinic approval? It would seem the genesis of this practice of seeking rabbinic endorsement began with the <i>Poskim</i> who freed the classical <i>agunah</i> where the husband has disappeared and his whereabouts are unknown. For centuries, <i>Poskim</i> enlist the support of an outside rabbi(s) prior to assisting a classical <i>agunah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 377; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:186–189; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Lublin</i> 110; <i>Teshuvot Bah</i> 79; R.

Menahem Krochmal, <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> 103, 106.<br>Addressing the case of the classical <i>agunah</i>, we encounter a diametrically opposed position in the words of R. M. Tenenbaum. In concluding a lengthy <i>teshuvah</i>, he states, “Since it is a very strict matter I therefore will not establish a ruling to be followed, until I learn this matter an additional time.” See <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:100.</i> Given that this practice was implemented when dealing with the classical <i>agunah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">R. Michal Epstein labels it a “<i>nohag</i>” amongst Torah scholars. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan EH</i> 17:255.</i> the practice emerged upon addressing the plight of the modern-day <i>agunah</i>.
But here again concerning voiding a marriage of a modern-day <i>agunah</i>, it is a <i>nohag</i> (a practice) devoid of a <i>halakhic</i> basis rather than a <i>halakhic</i> norm that obligates the receipt of support under all circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Some contend that with the disappearance of the <i>Beit Din ha-Gadol</i>, namely the <i>Sanhedrin</i> sitting on the Temple Mount in Yerushalayim, the rulings of the <i>gedolei ha-dor</i> (the scholars of the generation) were to be heeded by all the Jewish communities in the <i>Gola</i>, (Diaspora) and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. See <i>Minhat Hinukh, Mitzva</i> 495(3) in the name of <i>Sefer ha-Hinukh</i>; <i>Derashot ha-Ran, Derashah</i> 12; R. E. Wasserman, <i>Kuntres Divrei Soferim</i>, vol. 2, 2–3 in name of Rambam. Compliance with their judgments equally required that <i>halakhic</i> arbiters were to consult them prior to rendering their own decisions and/or legislation in matters of personal status and conversion due to the fact that such decisions had implications for the entire Jewish community. See <i>Teshuvot Even Shoham EH</i> 56 in the name of R. Hayyim Berlin; <i>Teshuvot Devar Avraham</i> 3:29; <i>Maharsham</i> and <i>R. Hayyim Ozer</i> as cited respectively in <i>Ein Tenai be-Nissuin</i>, 22, 56; A.

Consequently, an arbiter’s failure to seek out the view of the <i>gedolei ha-dor</i> regarding a pending matter of personal status entails a <i>halakhic</i> infraction.<br>Finally, in a situation where there is a <i>halakhic</i> dispute whether the employment of a particular <i>umdana</i> will free a wife, who is a classical <i>agunah</i>, prior to rendering a decision all the Torah authorities must convene to deliberate regarding the matter and only once a consensus is reached or the majority agree to invoke the <i>umdana</i> may one free the <i>agunah</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef</i> 1.<br>However, in contradistinction to the above ruling of Rabbi Yosef Karo a review of the rulings which will free a modern day <i>agunah</i> based solely upon an <i>umdana</i> or in conjunction with other supporting arguments such as <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> either memorialize the practice to have only a second opinion (sometimes a third view) or do not require any rabbinical approval of a third arbiter prior to issuing a decision. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenburg</i>, Prague edition, 1022; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Hefetz</i> 30; <i>Teshuvot She’eilot Moshe, EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:95(deals with a mentally dysfunctional wife); <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi EH</i> 2:133; <i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 4:121.<br>Our brief review has shown that many arbiters either refrain from consulting <i>gedolei ha-dor</i> in matters of personal status prior to issuing a ruling or if there was consultation, the endorsement was given by rabbis who do not necessarily have the stature of a <i>gadol ha-dor</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef, EH</i> 1; <i>Rivash</i>, supra n. 70; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1:187.<i> Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16; . . . 79; <i>Teshuvot Seridei Esh</i> 1:90; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 2:76; <i>Teshuvot Radakh</i>, Bayit 9. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick</i> 79.<br>Nonetheless, there are some authorities who mandated the seeking of “a second opinion” of “<i>ba’alei horo’ah</i>”, credentialed authorities rather than scholars of the generation.

Epstein arrives at the conclusion that there is a <i>halakhic</i> duty upon a<i> rabbi</i> (rather than a <i>beit din</i> of three) to rely upon outside rabbinic approval. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan,</i> supra n. 71. See also, <i>Arukh ha</i>-<i>Shulhan EH</i> 17:118; <i>Rivash</i>, supra n. 70.<br>For those <i>Poskim</i> who refrain from seeking approval, implicit in their position is that under certain conditions a <i>halakhic</i> arbiter is empowered to issue a ruling that may be in variance with a ruling handed down by any of his predecessors and by inference even a <i>gadol ha-dor</i>. See <i>Piskei ha-Rosh, Sanhedrin</i> 4:6; <i>Teshuvot R. Yeshaiah ha-Rishon</i> 62; <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash</i> 9; <i>Hazon Ish, HM, Likkutim</i> 1; S. Daichovsky, <i>Teshuvot Lev Shomeiah le-Shlomo</i> 2:37; <i>Rabbinic Authority, vol. 1</i>, 44–53.</i> Therefore, it is of no surprise to encounter that there were some authorities who issued rulings regarding the propriety of a particular <i>kiddushin</i> without having outside rabbinic endorsement.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Felder, <i>Nahalat Tzvi</i>, 231–239 (sought approval of his colleagues serving on his <i>beit din</i> but R.

c) A non Orthodox mesadeir kiddushin and ineligible eidei kiddushin

<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>The Facts of the Case</b></span>
On May 26, 2013, David Reiss married Deborah Stone. At the wedding, the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> (the officiating rabbi) was a Conservative rabbi. At the <i>huppah</i> (wedding ceremony) there were two adult Jewish males who were designated to serve as <i>eidei kiddushin</i> (witnesses for the act of betrothal). Upon inquiry, we were able to determine that the married couples, as well as both men, were non-Orthodox. After being civilly divorced, on August 1, 2014 Deborah requested her <i>get</i>. To this very date, David has refused to give her a <i>get</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
The role of the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> is to supervise that the entire gamut of <i>halakhot</i> that directly relate to the marriage ceremony are fully complied with by the <i>hatan</i> (groom) and <i>kallah</i> (bride).

Even in the absence of two witnesses or in the presence of two disqualified witnesses, there is the Hatam Sofer’s view which is cited by Pithei Teshuvah, as well as Havot Yair’s and Avnei Mi’luim’s position that Torah-committed Jews who observed the <i>kiddushin</i> ceremony yet did not see the actual <i>mesirah</i> (the giving) of the ring by the <i>hatan</i> to the <i>kallah</i> and the <i>hatan’s</i> recitation of the <i>kiddushin</i> formula may serve as “<i>anan sahadi</i>” (we are the witnesses) for the <i>kiddushin</i>.

Despite the <i>halakhic</i> shortcoming of the two ineligible witnesses, nevertheless may one invoke the rule of “<i>ein adam oseh be’ilato be’ilat zenut</i>” (a Jew does not engage in sexual relations as an act of illicit fornication)?

Therefore, Deborah Stone is free to remarry without receiving a <i>get</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Final Afterthoughts</b></span>
We have voided the above marriage due to the <i>halakhic</i> impropriety of the two witnesses who are an integral to the establishment of a <i>halakhic</i> marriage.
The question is whether we could have invalidated the marriage by dint of the fact that the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> is a Conservative rabbi? In other words, ought we scrutinize on a case-by-case basis whether the marriage was executed properly or it sufficient to invoke a <i>hazakah</i> (a presumption) that a marriage performed by a Conservative rabbi is invalid unless there are facts that would indicate to the contrary? To focus upon this issue, let’s understand how <i>halakhic</i> authorities viewed the propriety of a Reform rabbi as a <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> and then we will be better able to address our scenario of a Conservative rabbi who officiated at a wedding ceremony.
Our brief summary of the role of the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i> is buttressed by numerous sources found in the restatements of <i>Halakhah</i>, commentaries, and responsa literature.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See text accompanying notes 1–10. .</i> Clearly, the officiating rabbi ought to be molded not only by the imperatives found in the Five Books of Moses, Prophets, and Later Writings, but equally what is stated in the Oral law. To state it differently, functioning properly at a wedding ceremony means that the rabbi accepts the traditional view that establishes an organic connection between the Written Law and Oral Law, where the latter is a concomitant elucidation of the former rather than a subsequent modification. A cursory glance of Reform theology would demonstrate that the Oral Law and its divine origins aren’t recognized. Consequently, it is unsurprising that in a series of <i>teshuvot</i> (responsa) authored between 1957 and 1969 by R. Moshe Feinstein, he labels adherents of the Reform movement as nonbelievers who neither believe in the divinity of Torah (<i>Torah min ha-Shamayim</i>) nor fulfill Biblical as well as rabbinic prohibitions that emerge from the rabbinic interpretation of Written Law and Oral Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1: 75–77; <i>EH</i> 3:23, 25; <i>EH</i> 4:59, 75.</i> Absent evidence to the contrary, a marriage conducted by a Reform rabbi who is theologically, ideologically, and—in terms of religious observance—out of sync with the norms of <i>Halakhah</i> is null and void. In other words, there is a <i>hazakah</i> (a presumption) that any wedding performed by a Reform rabbi is null and void.
However, as noted by others,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Norman Frimer and Dov Frimer, “Reform Marriages in Contemporary <i>Halakhic</i> Responsa,” 21 <i>Tradition</i> (1984),7, 20.</i> there is a second approach endorsed by Rabbis Schwadron, Grossnass, and Felder that investigate the propriety of the ceremony rather than focusing upon the identity of the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 2:110; <i>Lev Aryeh</i>, supra n. 17; <i>Nahalat Tzvi</i> 2, 231–239</i>
One of the differences between adopting one approach in lieu of the other is when there is a <i>safek</i> (a doubt) regarding one of the facts. For example, let’s say that it isn’t factually clear that the two witnesses are invalid. In such a situation, if one adopts the approach that there is a presumption that a Reform rabbi does not meet the requirements as a <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i>, if there then exists a doubt, we follow the presumption and invalidate the <i>kiddushin</i>. On the other hand, advocating the approach of evaluating the matter on a case-by-case basis propels us to the conclusion that when there is a <i>safek</i>, we act stringently and therefore we conclude that the marriage is valid and requires a <i>get mi-safek</i> (a <i>get</i> due to an existing doubt).
The question is whether one can extrapolate the two varying approaches employed concerning a Reform Jewish wedding to our scenario of a Conservative Jewish wedding. Seemingly, the fact that numerous adherents to the Conservative movement have aligned themselves ideologically with the tenets of “Historical Traditional” Judaism would place them in the camp of those Jews who reject the divinity of Torah. From their perspective, the Oral Law represents a stage in the evolutionary process of Judaism that finds itself in a state of flux and therefore we may choose whether we want to accept the authority of the Talmud and/or the rulings of post-Talmudic decisors. In fact, there are Conservative rabbis who do not observe the dietary laws of <i>kashrut</i> or will ride to synagogue on Shabbat. On the other hand, in 1980’s as R. Feinstein astutely notes, there were Conservative Jews who are <i>Shabbat</i> observant and eat kosher and therefore R. Feinstein concludes that should such Conservative rabbis officiate at weddings, there exists a doubt whether their <i>kiddushin</i> are invalid.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:135</i> As such, unlike Reform rabbis whose ideology and observance places them beyond the pale of <i>halakhic</i> Judaism, Conservative rabbis tend to fall into different camps.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chaim Jachter, “Conservative <i>Kiddushin</i>," (Hebrew) 18 <i>Tehumin</i> 84, 88–90 (5758)</i> Therefore, if a wedding is performed under the auspices of a Conservative rabbi, one cannot invoke a <i>hazakah</i> that the marriage is invalid absent any evidence to the contrary. Aware of this reality, this panel scrutinized if the wedding ceremony which was officiated by a Conservative rabbi procedurally complied with the dictates of <i>Halakhah</i> rather than focusing upon the religious affiliation of the <i>mesadeir kiddushin</i>.

<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Bayla Stein v. Levi Stein</i></span>
On June 1, 1992, Bayla (the <i>Tova’at</i>) and Levi (the <i>Nitva</i>) were married. In the wake of the issuance of an order of protection filed on January 9, 2011, which directed the <i>Nitva</i> to refrain from assaulting, stalking, harassing, etc. his five children, the <i>Nitva</i> was directed by a civil agency to leave the marital home. Despite the fact that the <i>Tova’at</i> requested a <i>get</i> from the <i>Nitva</i> and summoned him regarding this matter to appear at another <i>beit din</i>, the <i>Nitva</i> nonetheless failed to appear and remained recalcitrant regarding giving her a <i>get</i>. On September 8, 2014, the rabbinical court issued the following <i>psak din</i>:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Harhakot de-Rabbeinu Tam</b> (“isolating measures”)</span>
<i>“</i>Harhakot de-Rabbeinu Tam<i>” for a wife who pleads “ma’is ali” (he is repulsive to me) and the husband refuses to divorce her:</i>
<i>To all our brothers of the house of Israel in every place:</i>
<i>Appearing in front of us was Levi Stein with his wife Bayla with her argument of “ma’is ali”. However, the aforementioned man refuses to divorce her because he wants to be me’agein her (chain her to him</i> –AYW<i>) and pain her.</i>
<i>Therefore, this beit din decrees with a severe oath (be-alah hamurah) that every man and woman of the house of Israel is forbidden to speak with him, to do business with him, to circumcise his son, to provide him with food and drink, to interact with him, to visit him during his time of illness and to bury him in a Jewish cemetery.</i>
It is our understanding that the above <i>psak din</i> informs us that upon hearing the evidence of both parties, the <i>beit din</i> arrived at the conclusion that there is merit in <i>Tova’at’s</i> argument that she is repulsed by him. That being said, in light of such a plea, following in the footsteps of Rabbeinu Tam,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Yashar, Teshuvot</i> 24 and cited authoritatively by <i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 204; <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 88; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 29,102; <i>Beit Yosef, Tur, Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 134 in the name of Maharik; <i>Levush, EH</i> 134:10. In these sources, one finds different versions of these sanctions and therefore one may draw different parameters regarding the scope of these measures. A study of this matter is beyond our presentation.</i> the <i>beit din</i> listed specific measures of social isolation that may be meted out to the husband. To date, the <i>Nitva</i> has continued to refuse to give a <i>get</i> to the <i>Tova’at</i>.
Given <i>Nitva’s</i> continuing <i>get</i> recalcitrance, the <i>Tova’at</i> has submitted her case to our <i>beit din</i>. The threshold question is a procedural. Given the fact that the matter of the <i>get</i> has already been addressed by another <i>beit din</i>, is this panel entitled to revisit the matter? Absent any knowledge that the <i>beit din</i> erred,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>)<i>, EH</i> 142:9; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter:<i> HM</i>) 1.</i> clearly the earlier <i>beit din’s</i> decision is final. In the event that the review of the case entails an error, should another <i>beit din</i> seek to revisit the case, it is their duty to hear the entire presentation of the parties as well as the testimony of the witnesses prior to arriving at a decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Yoel</i> 149.</i>
That being said, we are dealing with an issue of a <i>get</i> that entails severing the marital ties of <i>eishit eish</i>, a matter of <i>issura</i> (a ritual prohibition) and we are seemingly mandated to refrain from revisiting such an issue once it has been resolved by a rabbinic authority. As the Talmud instructs us in two places,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 63b; <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7b</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“A scholar who is proscribed something- his colleague may not sanction it” or “If one inquires from a scholar and he states it is impure, he should ask a scholar and he will say it is pure . . .”</span>
Nonetheless, this Talmudic dictum was established in the context of disputes dealing with <i>sevara</i> (<i>halakhic</i> logic). But dating back to the thirteenth-century Ashkenazic tradition that decision-making has been expended and is ensconced in studying our books,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Orhot Hayyim, Hilkhot Talmud Torah</i>, ch. 21; this writer’s, <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality, vol. 1</i>, 34–35.</i> in R.

Yosef’s words, “the books are our masters”,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 4, <i>HM</i> 1:6</i> and therefore the rule is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 148. <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan Yoreh De’ah</i> (hereafter: <i>YD</i>) 262:63</i> By dint of the dissemination of <i>hiddushin</i>, <i>sifrei psak</i>, and <i>teshuvot</i>, one resolves issues without taking cognizance whether a previous authority had already addressed the same case. Even if there are numerous <i>Poskim</i> who would contend that the rule still remains applicable in contemporary times,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For a list, see <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, supra n. 5, 35, n. 65</i> there are authorities who claim that the rule is inapplicable in cases of <i>igun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’arei De’ah</i> 100; <i>Teshuvot Miluei Even</i> 29(end); <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:45.</i> Consequently, regardless of whether the rule is employed today, there is a sound basis for abstaining from invoking it in our case, which addresses the plight of an <i>agunah</i>.
That being said, we need to elucidate the basis for the earlier <i>beit din’s</i> recognition of the wife’s plea for “<i>mais ali</i>”. Secondly, if the claim is valid, will it serve as grounds for invoking the isolating measures as propounded by Rabbeinu Tam and invoked by the rabbinical court?

For Rambam, a husband cannot coerce a wife to have sexual relations with him. And in the event that she is repulsed by him, Rambam rules that a <i>beit din</i> ought to coerce (“<i>kofeh</i>”) the husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife.

However, in the wake of a wife’s “<i>mais ali</i>” plea, some authorities such as Rabbeinu Gershom, Rabbeinu Hananel, Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Ba’al ha-Maor, Ittur, Ramban, Rashba, Meiri, Rosh, Ritva, Maharil, Ran, Nimukei Yosef, and Shulhan Arukh opine that a husband cannot be forced by a <i>beit din</i> to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ragmah</i> 40; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 64a, s.v. <i>aval</i>; <i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 63b., s.v. <i>aval be-sofo, Sefer ha-Yashar, Teshuvot</i> 77 <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Ketuvot</i> 64a in the name of Rashi; <i>Ba’al Ha’maor</i> on <i>Rif, Ketuvot</i> 27a; Ramban, op. cit.; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 138; <i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i>, Sofer ed., 268; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:8; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Ketuvot</i> 63b; <i>Teshuvot Maharil ha-Hadashot</i> 189; <i>Ran</i> on <i>Rif,</i> <i>Ketuvot</i> 27b; <i>Nimukei Yosef</i> on <i>Rif, Ketuvot</i>, 27b; <i>SA, EH</i> 77:2.</i> Nonetheless, some of these authorities would claim that there is a <i>hiyyuv le-gareish</i> (an obligation upon the husband to divorce his wife).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i> 64 in the name of “<i>yesh omrim</i> (some say)”; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Ketuvot</i> 63; <i>Rema, SA, YD</i> 228:20. Even though the same conclusion may be found in <i>Shittah Mekubezet, Ketuvot</i> 64 in the name of Rabbeinu Yonah, some may argue that since Rabbeinu Yonah employs the term “<i>mitzvah le-garesh</i>”, he is arguably invoking a lower level of divorce enforcement. However, in the time of Rabbeinu Yonah, generally speaking there was recognition of two types of enforcement, namely coercing and obligating a <i>get</i>. (There was an exception to the rule where the wife was evil where “<i>mitzvah le-garesh”</i> was employed. See <i>Teshuvot Rashbash</i> 411). Consequently, utilizing the term of “<i>mitzvah le-garesh</i>” was synonymous with “<i>hiyyuv le-garesh</i>”. However, today where there are four different types of divorce judgments, namely coercing a <i>get</i>, obligating a <i>get, mitzvah</i> to divorce, and recommending a divorce, some would refrain from aligning Rabbeinu Yonah with the other opinions cited here. For a discussion of the significance of the different types of enforcement in terms of the various sanctions due to noncompliance, see Yehiel Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment: Principles of Jewsh Law,” 15 <i>The Jewish Law Annual</i>, 57, 76–80 (2004).</i>
The threshold question is whether or not in our scenario there were grounds to contend that the wife advanced a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”?
After undergoing a hysterectomy in 2000, the <i>Nitva</i> turned to the <i>Tova’at</i> and exclaimed, “You are not a woman anymore, you can’t have any children!”
Though the <i>Tova’at</i> had spoken to the panel about various alleged shortcomings in the <i>Nitva</i>’s persona, such as failing to financially support the family, emotionally abusing his wife, failing to be involved in raising their children, gambling, and engaging in illicit affairs, it was this comment which mortified her and clearly left an indelible ink on her psyche. Subsequent to this interaction and her subsequent realization that he was possibly engaging in illicit affairs, the <i>Tova’at</i> chose to refrain from engaging in conjugal relations with him.
At first glance, the <i>Nitva</i>’s comment and her decision to live at least sexually “separate lives” can be construed as “<i>ma’is ali</i>”. However, Rambam and others always speak in terms of a wife who articulates the words “<i>ma’is ali”</i> and that did not transpire here. The question is whether there is a requirement to express the plea in such fashion or does a wife’s words and/or behavior that reflect her revulsion towards her husband suffices for us to conclude that her words and conduct are equivalent to her stating “<i>ma’is ali</i>”? Authorities note that as long as her words and/or behavior convey the idea that she is repulsed by him, that would be sufficient. For example, if she pleads that she hates him, no longer wants to remain with him, or his actions (such as abuse) demean her, we can state that she is constructively raising the argument of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Knesset ha-Gedolah, EH</i> 77, <i>Hagahot Tur</i> 19 and <i>Ba’air Hetev, SA, EH</i> 77:12 in the name of <i>Teshuvot Mahara Sasson</i> 186; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 1:55; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 186; <i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 5:157, 8:126, 9:183–184; File no. 284462/9, Netanya Regional Beit Din, May 14, 2014. See infra chapter 8e.</i>
Upon reflection, the words of Rambam are clear. We may coerce a <i>get</i> in the case of a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” provided that due to his repulsive behavior, she cannot live sexually with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying note 12.</i> Though others point out that the plea may encompass hatred due to other improper behavior or simply an unwillingness to remain married to him such as age difference,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 77:3; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573<i>; Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 77 in the name of Rashba; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 102; <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Maharashdam, EH</i> 41; <i>Torat Emet</i>, supra n.16; <i>PDR</i> 9:183; File no. 992236/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, May 17, 2015. Cf. <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> (Algazi), page 213c; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:2</i> we need not address the parameters of this plea. Given that in our scenario, the <i>Tova’at</i>’s immediate response was to refrain from engaging in conjugal relations, she was in fact pleading the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea in a Maimonidean fashion. In other words, his alleged comment and alleged infidelity inexorably led to the <i>Tova’at</i>’s decision to refrain from having sexual relations with him. In effect, the constructive plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” is interconnected to her inability to continue living with her husband.
Given that the <i>Tova’at</i> has advanced an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>” (a clear pretext) why she abhors his conduct, we therefore do not need to inquire whether for the plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” to be accepted there must be an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>”. However, the issue is whether such reasons must be verified via the testimony of two eligible witnesses. Notwithstanding some authorities who require testimony to assess the veracity of her claim,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:145; <i>Beit Shmuel, Kitzur Dinei Moredet</i> 77 (end); <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 79:16; File no. 992236/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, May 17, 2015.</i> Tosafot Rid, Avnei Miluim, and Helkat Mehokeik do not mandate such verification.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Rid, Ketuvot</i> 64; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, Kitzur Dinei Moredet</i> 77(4); For <i>Avnei Miluim</i>, we trust her words.

Since we were unable to verify if in fact he was silent, her readiness to waive any and all monetary claims imparted credence to her plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”.
Subsequent to his conduct, had the <i>Tova’at</i> separated from him by either his departing the marital home or moving elsewhere, we would have had to address whether upon submitting a claim of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” a <i>beit din</i> can obligate the husband to give a <i>get</i> or not. However, to our surprise, the couple only separated a decade later and no explanation was communicated to us by the <i>Tova’at</i> why she remained in the marriage for another ten years. Moreover, the reason for the separation at that time was due to a directive of child services that he must leave the marital home due to neglect of his children. Consequently, in light of his wife’s claim and the fact that it has been three years since he left the marital home and there was no chance for <i>shalom bayit</i> (marital reconciliation), we rule that “<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>” (a duty to divorce) that the husband give a <i>get</i> to his wife.
Our utilization of “<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>” as a vehicle of <i>get</i> enforcement is to emphasize the Talmudic point that “one who transgresses the ruling of the rabbis is to be labeled a transgressor”.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 40a.</i> Or as <i>Poskim</i> state in the context of addressing divorce cases,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:1; <i>Teshuvot Mar’eh Yehezkel</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot Emek ha-Teshuvah</i> 3:110; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96</i> “it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to listen to Torah scholars”. Moreover, in cases where we cannot coerce a <i>get</i>, the community may show its displeasure and label him a sinner.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rabbeinu Yonah,</i> supra n. 15; <i>Teshuvot Hakhmei Provence</i> 73–74; SA EH 154:21; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 29.</i> Labeling a transgressor of <i>Halakhah</i> as “a sinner” in most cases will not propel a husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. The question is whether there are grounds to invoke economic and social sanctions against him. As we noted at the outset, in the case before us, the other <i>beit din</i> had ruled:
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>“</i>Harhakot de-Rabbeinu Tam<i>” for a wife who pleads “</i>ma’is ali<i>” (he is repulsive to me</i> –AYW<i>) and the husband refuses to divorce her:</i></span>
<i>To all our brothers of the house of Israel in every place:</i>

<i>Therefore, this</i> beit din <i>decrees with a severe oath (</i>be-alah hamurah<i>) that every man and woman of the house of Israel is forbidden to speak with him, to do business with him, to circumcise his son, to provide him with food and drink, to interact with him, to visit him during his time of illness and to bury him in a Jewish cemetery.</i>
Though in accordance with Rabbeinu Tam,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For different recordings of these measures, see supra n. 1.</i> in the wake of a wife’s <i>ma’is ali</i> plea, one cannot coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i>, numerous <i>Poskim</i> nonetheless understood that Rabbeinu Tam obligates a <i>get</i> under such circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 204; <i>Teshuvot Zikhron Yehudah</i>, Machon Yerushalayim edition, 110; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:21. Cf. File no. 917387/1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, November 17, 2013 in the name of numerous <i>Rishonim</i>.</i> In the absence of sanctioning coercion, there is a <i>hiyyuv le-garesh</i> (a duty to give a <i>get</i>), and therefore Rabbeinu Tam introduces these <i>harhakhot</i> in order to induce the husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. Nonetheless, in contemporary times, Israeli rabbinical courts sanction the use of these isolating measures even if a panel would rule <i>mitzvah le-garesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 12:338; File no. 1-64-8455, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, 17 Elul 5768. The implementation of these sanctions is legally recognized in legislation passed by the Knesset in 1995. In situations where the grounds for a divorce would not serve as a reason(s) to coerce a <i>get</i>, one cannot obligate a <i>get</i> lest the husband think that he is duty-bound to give a <i>get</i> and then the <i>get</i> would be deemed a <i>get muteh</i>. (i.e. the husband would claim, “Had I known that it was not a duty, I never would have given it.”). Therefore, in such circumstances, a <i>beit din</i> would rule <i>mitzvah le-garesh</i> or that the <i>beit din</i> recommends the husband to give a <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 10 in the name of <i>Radvaz</i> and <i>Mishpat Tzedek</i>.</i> The mandating of these <i>harhakot</i>, as R. Herzog observes, serves as an avenue to facilitate that a husband fulfills the <i>mitzvah</i> to divorce his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:3.</i>
And given that the other <i>beit din</i> refrains from articulating the grounds for invoking these <i>harhakhot</i>, we are assuming that it was not staking out a position regarding the level of <i>get</i> enforcement in our case, namely whether <i>hiyyuv le-garesh, mitzvah le-garesh</i> or even recommending divorce would apply in our situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of “recommending divorce” see Kaplan, supra n. 15</i> And we have followed in the footsteps of the Israeli <i>battei din</i> to mandate such sanctions in light of our ruling of <i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>.
The outstanding question is what is the basis of invoking such sanctions?. As we know, the dissolution of a marriage requires the voluntary agreement of both spouses; failure of one party to assent to the divorce precludes execution of the <i>get</i>. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to either give or receive a <i>get</i> produces a <i>get</i> that is arguably invalid, i.e. a <i>get me’useh</i>. As such, ought a <i>beit din</i> mandate the implementation of these <i>harhakhot</i> to effectuate <i>get</i> compliance lest these measures be viewed as coercive and resulting in a <i>get me’useh</i>? The isolating measures introduced by Rabbeinu Tam have been characterized by others as “<i>meniat tovah</i>” (withholding a benefit).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Yosef Goldberg, “Withholding a Benefit from a Man—is it Considered to Be a <i>Get Me’useh</i>?” (Hebrew) 8 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 409 (5763).</i> Is withholding a benefit from a recalcitrant husband tantamount to coercing the delivery of a <i>get</i>? Following in the footsteps of the Gaon of Vilna,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 154:67.</i> since the husband has a choice to move to another place and thus be accorded these benefits and the application of the <i>harhakhot</i> are not directed at the body of the recalcitrant husband, therefore their implementation does not entail coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze’ev</i> 88; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 137; <i>Teshuvot Maharitz ha-Hadashot</i> 2:172; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, YD</i> 132; <i>Teshuvot Kerem Shlomo, EH</i> 22; <i>Levush, EH</i> 134(end); <i>Teshuvot Tzeil ha-Kesef, EH</i> 6; <i>Teshuvot Seder Eliyahu Rabba</i> 13–14; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Gavison</i> 42; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 23, vol. 8, <i>EH</i> 25.<br>There are rulings that endorsed these <i>harhakot</i> but the context dealt with a brother-in-law who refused to engage in the <i>halitzah</i> process and the subsequent <i>halitzah</i> process was viewed as valid rather than coerced. See <i>Semak, mitzvah</i> 185; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Tzeil ha-Kesef</i> 13, <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 2:9; <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 28. However, these judgments may not serve as precedent for cases where we are addressing the scenario of a husband who refuses to give a <i>get</i>. Whereas the performance of a marriage without a recognized <i>halitzah</i> entails a prohibition of a negative commandment [“<i>an issur lav</i>”-see <i>MT, Hilkhot Yibum va-Halitzah</i> 4:25–26; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 165:13] without attendant<i> mamzerut</i> (<i>halakhic</i> bastardy), a coerced <i>get</i> entails the transgression of the prohibition of “an <i>eishit ish</i>” (a married woman) with attendant <i>mamzerut</i>. As such, one cannot extrapolate from the more lenient situation of <i>halitzah</i> where these measures are permissible to the case of a <i>get</i>. See supra page 152, n. 44.</i> Furthermore, Hazon Ish introduces a third reason for validating the propriety of these <i>harhakhot,</i> namely that all the sanctions entail “<i>shev ve-al ta’aseh</i>”. In other words, the measures involve refraining from certain types of conduct such as abstaining from burying the husband or interacting with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 108:12.</i> Abstention from behavior isn’t construed to be coercion. Moreover, even R. Yosef Ibn Lev, who claims that withholding a benefit constitutes a form of coercion,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i> 2:18. See also others who did not subscribe to such measures. See <i>Gevurat Anashim</i> 72; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Levi, kelal</i> 2, <i>siman</i> 11; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek, EH</i> 2:262(4,12); <i>PDR</i> 16:261–263.</i> would mandate these sanctions in certain extenuating circumstances when <i>get</i> compulsion was not an option.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharbil</i>, 2:79.</i>
Finally, if one contends that these measures that attempt to withhold benefits from the recalcitrant husband are coercive in nature, then prior to imposing any <i>harhakot</i>, a <i>beit din</i> must assess any and all pressures if they rise to the level of being intimidating and coercive. But in fact, our <i>halakhic</i> sources have been meticulous in defining what constitutes coercion or not. Whatever is labeled coercive will generate a situation of a <i>get me’useh</i> if applied. And those that have not been identified as coercive do not result in a <i>get me’useh</i>.
In fact, Dayan Uriel Lavi, formerly <i>av beit din</i> (presiding <i>dayan</i>) of Tzfat Regional Beit Din and presently <i>av beit din</i> of the Jerusalem Regional Beit Din astutely observes that Rabbeinu Tam views the measures through the prism of how the community ought to relate to <i>get</i> recalcitrance without even suggesting the need to ascertain if these sanctions are coercive.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah, vol. 2, EH</i> 81</i> As Rabbeinu Tam notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i>, supra n. 1</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">That they will be unable to speak with him, engage in business with him, to host him or feed him or to drink with him . . . to visit him when he is sick . . . if he will not divorce and allow this young woman (to be free –AYW), this does not constitute coercion. If he wants to fulfill it, he will not be flogged by this excommunication but we will separate from him.</span>
If in fact the focus was whether such measures were coercive or not, there would have been no need to accentuate the differences between excommunication that impacts upon the body<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Moeid Katan</i> 17a.</i> and economic and social sanctions that harm the individual indirectly. Furthermore, there is no advice being given by Rabbeinu Tam that there is a need to assess whether these isolating measures constitute coercion and therefore outlawed.
A similar understanding of these <i>harhakhot</i> is presented by R. Mordekhai Yaffe, who observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Levush, EH</i> 154 (end)</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If a <i>beit din</i> perceives . . . that there is a value for the woman in the matter such as if she pleas “<i>ma’is ali</i>” and the like . . . and even if this (is not one of the examples –AYW) that we force a husband to divorce, nonetheless, <i>beit din</i> may impose a <i>herem</i> (social shunning –AYW) . . . that they will not be permitted to speak and engage in business with him . . .</span>
Others such as Tashbetz, Beit Ephraim, and Seder Eliyahu argue that the determining factor is whether coercive measures such as corporal or financial duress that would invalidate the <i>get</i> have been implemented rather than assess whether the husband was pressured due to “<i>oneseh de-nafesheih</i>” (self-imposed duress), <i>harhakhot</i>, or a third party.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 70; <i>Teshuvot Seder Eliyahu Rabba</i> 13.</i> A similar line of argumentation has been advanced in contemporary times by Israeli <i>battei din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 1-21-9918, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, November 11, 2003; File 8455-64-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, September 17, 2008.</i> As one <i>beit din</i> states,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, supra n. 44.</i>

See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 127; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i>, 2:80.</i> and in the event the <i>get</i> fails to be forthcoming, we endorse the LA’s <i>beit din’s</i> directive to authorize the community to withhold social and economic benefits from the recalcitrant husband.
Even in the absence of her <i>ma’is ali</i> plea, there would be a <i>hiyyuv le-garesh</i> and therefore grounds to invoke these isolation measures. As we know, one of the primary duties that a husband has vis-a-vis his spouse is the requirement to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>onah</i> (engaging in conjugal relations).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot</i> 21:10; <i>Tur, EH</i> 69; <i>SA EH</i> 69:6, <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, ad locum, 10; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum, 5.</i> Assuming the wife agrees, he may abstain from engaging in <i>onah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, EH</i> 76; <i>SA, EH</i> 76:11</i> In our scenario, if the <i>Tova’at</i> would have consented to having relations with the <i>Nitv</i>a and was precluded from this possibility due to the civil authorities who removed him from the marital home, he would have the status of a <i>moreid</i> (a rebellious husband who refuses to engage in this <i>mitzvah</i>) and such abstention allows a wife to request that <i>beit din</i> coerce him to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 77:1, 154:1.

We are following <i>SA</i>’s ruling due to the fact that his view is reflective of the majority view. See <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 74, <i>anaf</i> 5.</i>
However, if his abstinence is due to circumstances beyond his control such as being sick, then there would be no grounds to coerce (or obligating) him to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, EH</i> 76; <i>SA, EH</i> 76:11; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i> and <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum, 17.</i> Seemingly, since in our scenario, the <i>Nitva</i> was precluded from engaging in <i>onah</i> due to the civil authorities’ decision to remove him from the home, he should equally be not labeled a <i>moreid</i>.
Nonetheless, it is our contention that whereas being sick or feeling weak are examples of being an <i>ones</i> (a person under duress) and therefore a husband is exempt from engaging in sexual relations, here we are dealing with the <i>Nitva</i>, who committed a <i>peshia</i> (an act of negligence) and therefore he should be labeled as a <i>moreid</i>. In fact, our case should be treated no differently that the case of a husband who is imprisoned for a crime and is deemed a <i>posheia</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Meir</i> 14</i> and therefore a <i>moreid</i>!<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Oneg Yom Tov</i> 168</i> Our conclusion has found support in the Israeli <i>battei din</i> decisions as well as in <i>teshuvot</i> authored by Rabbis Eliezer Waldenburg and Uriel Lavi.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:220–224, 5:329–332, 8:124–128, 12:248–254; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 6:42(83); <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah, EH</i> 2:93.</i> In short, had the <i>Tova’at</i> wanted to resume relations and subsequently the <i>Nitva</i> was forced to leave the marital home by civil authorities, there would be grounds to obligate a <i>get</i> and invoke the <i>harhakot</i>.

<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>The Facts of the Case</b></span>
The couple was married in 2000. Over a period of eleven years, they had four children. Four to five years into the marriage, the <i>Tova’at</i> read the <i>Nitva</i>’s text messages that he sent to other women such as “thank you for the last night” and overheard him having a lengthy telephone conversation with a woman. As a result of these events, the <i>Tova’at</i> confronted him regarding these liaisons and conversations. Subsequent to this conversation, in October 2008, he accused her of sleeping with other men. These accusations did not subside and when her siblings were asked, “what can you say about their marriage”, their immediate reply focused upon his allegations of the <i>Tova’at</i>’s cheating. These were allegations because the <i>Nitva</i> was never able to corroborate that such behavior occurred. Nevertheless, the <i>Nitva</i>’s accusations abounded about his wife. If he saw a tissue or napkin, he thought she was throwing away sperm. He would arrange the pillows at night and if they were not perfectly arranged the way he left them, he accused her bringing over a man. Due to her alleged cheating, he would keep her in their home and not let her leave. A few times, he stalked her, recorded her conversations, and put GPS tracking on her phone. He installed cameras in and outside of the house in order to monitor the <i>Tova’at</i>’s activities. From time to time, he had hallucinations that made life difficult for the couple. With the onset of his allegations of cheating, the <i>Nitva</i> began to engage in emotional and physical abuse, including spousal rape.
Upon observing some of this behavior, the <i>Nitva</i>’s parents took him to a psychiatrist and the diagnosis given was that he had “delusional jealousy disorder”. It is a psychiatric phenomenon in which an individual has a delusional belief that his spouse is being unfaithful. Individuals who suffer from a jealousy disorder, but who fail to experience delusions, will not fit the diagnostic criteria for this type of a disorder. The <i>Tova’at</i>’s representation of his conduct confirms the psychiatrist’s diagnosis. Though the <i>Nitva</i> went for therapy a few times between the end of November 2008 and January or February 2009, the <i>Nitva</i> refused to continue the counseling because he felt that “the <i>Tova’at</i> was the problem, not him”. The <i>Nitva</i> started to take medication for his disorder in December 2008 but ceased taking the medication because the <i>Nitva</i> claimed that “the <i>Tova’at</i> was the problem, not him”. In reply to our question of “what can you tell us about their marriage”, her family members responded that the <i>Nitva</i> continuously claimed that the <i>Tova’at</i> is cheating, but he has never brought any evidence to support such accusations.
Given that the situation failed to improve, the <i>Nitva</i>’s parents suggested to their daughter-in-law to leave him. In July 2010, the couple separated. Given that the marital situation had deteriorated already in October 2008, the <i>Beit Din</i> asked her- why she waited until July 2010 to leave the marriage. Her reply was she had tried to save the marriage for her children and herself and that her in-laws were supportive of her mission; but at the end of the day, she realized (and her in-laws agreed) that there were no prospects to restore her husband to psychological normalcy and therefore she separated from him. (Subsequent to the separation, her in-laws wanted the couple to reconcile). Her reasons for divorce were the emotional abuse, physical abuse, and spousal rape perpetrated by the <i>Nitva</i>. However, on November 2, 2009, the <i>Tova’at</i> reported an incident to the police and from that time onwards, she had a full order of protection. Though in May 2010 the <i>Nitva</i> was allowed to return to the marital home, the abuse did not subside; two months later, the couple separated.
She does not want to return to him under any circumstances and since the separation transpired over a year ago, she is requesting her <i>get</i>. Though sometimes he agrees to give it, at the end of the day he has been recalcitrant both to the pleas of local rabbis as well as to this <i>Beit Din</i> and to this very day continues to want <i>shalom bayit</i> (marital reconciliation). However, the <i>Tova’at</i> informs us that he is living with a non-Jewish woman at the same time that he is requesting <i>shalom bayit</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
Given the fact that the <i>Tova’at</i> refuses to continue to live with the <i>Nitva</i>, is she deemed “a <i>moredet</i>” (a rebellious wife who refuses to engage in conjugal relations)? A <i>moredet</i> can be subdivided into two different situations. One case involves a wife who wants to remain with her husband but refuses to have conjugal relations with him in order to cause him pain and distress without offering reasons for her recalcitrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 63b, s.v. <i>aval</i> in the name of Rabbeinu Tam; <i>Perishah, Tur, EH</i> 77:17; <i>Taz, Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>) <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 77:1.</i> On the other hand, there is a plea called “<i>ma’is ali</i>” (he is repulsive to me), which consequently prevents her from engaging in conjugal relations with her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Ketuvot</i> 63b, s.v. <i>aval omra</i>; <i>Tosafot</i>, supra n. 1.</i>
The question is whether the claim of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” is limited to circumstances where the wife cannot live sexually with her husband or encompasses a situation where she declares that “I do not want this man”. Notwithstanding some authorities who argue that the two pleas are to be distinguished,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ra’ah, Ketuvot</i> 63b; <i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i> 63b.</i> various <i>Poskim</i> conclude that the plea includes a scenario where she doesn’t want to be her husband anymore.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 102; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Tzemah Tzedek</i> EH 2:262(10); <i>Teshuvot Torat Emet</i> 186 cited by <i>Ba’air Hetev, SA EH</i> 77:12 and <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah EH</i> 77, hag’ah 19; <i>Rema, SA EH</i> 77:3; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 77:11; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 1:55. . The wife may argue “I do not want this man” and need not state the plea of “<i>mais ali</i>”. See <i>Knesset ha-Gedolah,</i> op<i>.</i> cit.;<i> Penei Moshe,</i> op. cit.; <i>Rema</i>, op. cit.</i> For example, Ba’al ha-Maor notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ba’al ha-Ma’or, Ketuvot</i> 63b</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Who is a <i>moredet</i>? For example, I want him but I will cause him pain. And when she says I don’t want him, that means that I am repulsed by him.</span>
Or as R. Yosef Kolon observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharik</i>, supra n. 4</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is simple . . . not only a plea of “repulsive to me” but anytime she wants to receive her <i>get</i>.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">In accordance with Rambam <i>z’l</i> and other great scholars concerning a wife who says <i>ma’is ali</i> we coerce and not only “<i>ma’is ali</i>” as Maharik <i>z’’l</i> said . . .</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">And the meaning of being repulsive to me means that she says that she wants to be divorced.</span>
After listing numerous <i>Poskim</i> who link the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” claim with an inability to have sexual relations, R. Yosef Goldberg, an international expert of <i>halakhot</i> of <i>get</i> coercion, invokes Mahara Sasson<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 4.</i> and concurs that <i>ma’is ali</i> encompasses “I do not want this man”.
Following in their footsteps as well as invoking other decisors, in contemporary times, various Israeli <i>battei din</i> and Dayan Uriel Lavi have ruled accordingly.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 3:89, 5:157, 8:126. 9:171, 181–184; File no. 311698393-21-2, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, June 11, 2000; File no. 32555/1, Ashdod Regional Beit Din, May 9, 2011; File no. 284462/9, Netanya Regional Beit Din, April 9, 2012; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 37.</i> In other words, the <i>halakhot</i> that govern the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” claim ought to be applicable to the declaration “I do not want this man”. <sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Goldberg, <i>Elu sh-kofin le-hotzi</i> (Hebrew), Jerusalem, 5773, 145, n. 1 (end).</i>
This notion that the wife’s claim of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” means that she no longer is interested in being married to him is reflected in the <i>Halakhah</i> that a husband is exempt from paying spousal support should his wife desire to end the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Ketuvot</i> 64a; <i>Maggid Mishneh, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 14:8</i>
Must this plea be verifiable or is it sufficient that a wife claim that she is repulsed by the conduct of her husband? In the absence of verifying the claim, how does a panel ascertain that the wife is speaking the truth?
On one hand, as R. Herzog observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 2</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Ma’is ali</i> does not only entail plain hatred but an emotional fear of her husband and this is a secret from the secrets (inner dynamic) of the psyche . . . a person’s soul recoils from touching the person . . .</span>
On the other hand, despite the emotional component of the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea, a victim has the ability to articulate the psychic and emotional feelings in rational terms by communicating to a third party (in our case the <i>beit din</i> panel) the genesis for these feelings via an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>”.
Following in the footsteps of numerous authorities, in defining what an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>” entails, R. Kook states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Shmuel SA EH</i> 77:27; <i>Sefer Hafla’ah</i> <i>Ketuvot</i> 63b; <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 56; H. Izrirer, “The Obligation of a <i>Get</i> and Maintenance for a Rebellious Wife Who is Repulsed,” (Hebrew), 2 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 64, 91 (5754).<br>For the identical understanding of an <i>amatla</i> in a different matter, see <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba Ketuvot</i> 22a;<i> Maggid Mishnah, MT Hilkhot</i> <i>Ishut</i> 9:31; <i>SA EH</i> 46:4. Though numerous <i>Rishonim</i> oppose <i>get</i> coercion in a situation where a wife advances a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”, however in the event she offers an “<i>amatla</i>”, a clear pretext there will be grounds to obligate the giving of a <i>get</i>. See <i>Ezrat Kohen</i>, op. cit.; Dayan H. Izrirer, 2 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 64 (5754); <i>PDR</i> 7:201,205 (Rabbis Nissim, Elyashiv and Goldschmidt).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It has to be clear to the <i>beit din</i> that justice is with her and he deserves that his improper actions and practices that she would be repulsed by him . . . that he caused everything . . .</span>
However, the issue is whether the “<i>amatla mevureret</i>” must be verified via the testimony of two eligible witnesses. Notwithstanding some authorities who require testimony to assess the veracity of her claim,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:145; <i>Beit Shmuel, Kitzur Dinei Moredet</i>, 77 (end); <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 40; File no. 992236/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, May 17, 2015.</i> Tosafot Rid, Avnei Milluim, Helkat Mehokeik, and others do not mandate such verification.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Rid, Ketuvot</i> 64; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, Kitzur Dinei Moredet</i>, 77(4); <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 40; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 69:4, 16. According to <i>Avnei Miluim</i>, we trust her words. See <i>Avnei Miluim</i> 77:7. See also<i>, Tosafot, Ketuvot</i> 63b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Meyuhasot le-Ramban</i> 138; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:573; File no. 980712/1, Haifa Regional Beit Din, October 27, 2014; File no. 77890/10, Be’eir Sheva Regional Beit Din, July 21, 2015. Cf. File no. 1062141/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani, April 12, 2016.<br>In fact, the absence of a requirement to verify based upon submission of two witnesses is seen in another area of divorce. To advance a claim for spousal support in the wake of a wife abandoning the marital home due to her husband’s unjustified incitement, see <i>Beit Shmuel SA, EH</i> 70:37<i>, Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 70:42. Cf. <i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 273.</i>
Nonetheless, even in the absence of requiring the submission of evidence, the advancing of an “<i>amatla me’vureret</i>” does not suffice to impart validity to the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea. As Dayanim Nissim, Elyashiv, Zolty and Daichovsky note,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 3:201, 206–207; 20:193, 200; File no. 884/51, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, June 21, 1992; File Appeal no. 350/165, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, 17 Sivan 5752,(Rabbi Daichovsky’s opinion) which can be accessed in 16 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 167 (5769).</i> the <i>beit din</i> determines the veracity of the plea “according to the discernment of their eyes”. Therefore, upon listening to the plea and in light of the awareness of the circumstances, a panel must sincerely believe that she is raising the claim of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” for substantive reasons relating to her marriage rather than as a ploy because she has an interest in another man.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i> 63a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 43:6. For an additional ploy that she wants “out” because she desires to have children, see <i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, 34:2.</i> Additionally, if it is clear that she is waiving her right to the value of her <i>ketubah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Teshuvot ha-Radvaz</i> 1333; <i>Teshuvot Hikrei Lev, EH</i> 35. In recent years, the value of the <i>ketubah</i> in the Ashkenazic world has been between approximately $35,000 and $55,000 as per the market value of silver based upon how one calculates the value of the silver, a matter which is subject to <i>halakhic</i> controversy.</i> we can impart credence to her plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 40; <i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 79:4; <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash</i> 2; <i>Bah, Kitzur Dinei Moredet</i> 77 (2).</i> In a recent decision, the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol rules that we follow the view of those decisors who require that a <i>beit din</i> discern whether in fact the plea is sincere and genuinely relates to the reason(s) for demanding the dissolving of the marital ties.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 992236/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, May 17, 2015.</i> Similarly, Hazon Ish argues,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazon Ish, EH</i> 69:16</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Everything depends upon the discernment of the arbiters if there is a cause for suspicion due to her claim for the <i>ketubah</i> (the value of it –AYW). But if it seems clear why she is repulsed by him but requests her <i>ketubah</i> in order to have a means of support . . . she does not lose because of her claim . . .</span>
Based upon the foregoing, the question is whether we are dealing with the narrow plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”, which is limited to an abhorrence of sexually living with her partner, or whether it extends to her refusal to live with him under all circumstances. Clearly, the <i>Tova’at</i> admitted to us that she was repulsed by him and did not want to be sexually involved with him anymore, as he is an individual who raped her and due to his psychological condition of exhibiting a “delusional jealousy disorder”—which resulted in all types of abuse—she is unable to continue to live with him. As such, the “<i>amatla mevureret</i>” accompanying the “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea encompasses both her unwillingness to continue to live with him under any circumstances, whether “in the bedroom” or in the marital home.
Based upon her presentation, the <i>Tova’at</i> has no intentions whatsoever to pursue any monetary claims against her husband either in another <i>beit din</i> or in civil court (should a <i>heter arkaot</i>, permission to litigate in court, be forthcoming). Therefore, we arrived at the conclusion that her “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea, couched in the fashion of “I do not want this man”, as well her refusal to engage in conjugal relations is credible rather than being advanced in a manipulative fashion! Furthermore, the <i>Tova’at</i>’s continued and persistent attempts to save the marriage for her children and for herself undermine the allegation that she “cast her eyes on another”. Despite her allegations that in 2006 the <i>Nitva</i> was seeing other women and in 2008–2009 he was texting other women, the <i>Tova’at</i> remained steadfast in trying to save the marriage and during “the ups and downs of the marriage” in April 2010, the <i>Tova’at</i> gave birth to their fourth son. In sum, the case that was presented before us deals with a <i>Tova’at</i> who is advancing a credible claim of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” on both planes—the inability to live under the same roof with him lest she be a victim of abuse and the unwillingness to engage in conjugal relations with him.
The emerging question is whether there are grounds to obligate a <i>get</i> in a case—one where a wife submits a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” accompanied by an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>”. A review of the Israeli <i>battei din</i> decisions reveals that there are four types of divorce judgments—namely, coercing a <i>get</i>, obligating a <i>get</i>, <i>mitzvah</i> to divorce, and recommending a divorce. Without addressing the differences between these four different types of judgments, let us note that coercing a <i>get</i> today may only transpire in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where the rabbinical courts are empowered to imprison a recalcitrant spouse based upon a decision that coerces the giving or the receiving of a <i>get</i>. Unlike in earlier centuries, where the Jewish community, via its <i>battei din</i>, wa empowered by the foreign government to either physically coerce or imprison a recalcitrant spouse to give or receive a <i>get</i>, nowadays in the <i>Golah</i> (the Diaspora) such authorization is not delegated to the Jewish community.
On the other hand, despite the fact that we are not authorized to coerce the giving of a <i>get</i>, we are empowered to obligate a <i>get</i>. The threshold issue is whether there are grounds to coerce a <i>get</i> in a case where a wife submits a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” accompanied by an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>”. Notwithstanding numerous authorities who reject this possibility,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i> 126; <i>Teshuvot Mekor Barukh</i> 17; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> (Algazi), 214a; <i>Teshuvot Zekan Aharon</i> 149.</i> there are <i>Poskim</i> who contend that if a wife advances the argument of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” and provides an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>”, a <i>beit din</i> can coerce a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashbash</i> 93; <i>Teshuvot Yakhin u-Boaz</i> 2:21 in the name of Maharam; <i>Teshuvot Hut ha-Meshullash, Tur Shlishi</i> 35;</i>
As noted by some authorities, the reason why a <i>beit din</i> is bereft of authority to coerce a <i>get</i> involving a “<i>ma’is ali</i>” plea is grounded in the fact that such a plea is not enumerated as one of the <i>ilot gerushin</i> (grounds for compelling a divorce) in Mishnah Ketuvot 7:9–10.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah, Ketuvot</i> 63b; <i>Sefer Meisharim, Netiv</i> 23, <i>helek</i> 8 in the name of Rashba, <i>Zekan Aharon</i>, supra n. 23; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 5:26; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>EH</i> 18; File no. 359388/6, Tel Aviv- Jaffe Regional Beit Din, June 4, 2013.</i> Therefore, it is unsurprising to find that many decisors will equally refrain from <b>obligating</b> a <i>get</i> in a situation of “<i>ma’is ali</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague ed., 946; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1: 573, 1192; <i>Taz, SA, EH</i> 77:7; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 41; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, EH</i> <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> 90;<i> PDR</i> 2: 194-195, 7:4;<i>Teshuvot Ateret Shlomo</i>, vol. 1, 32:6 in the name of <i>Rivash, Ramban, Tur</i>, and <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.</i> However, there are <i>Poskim</i> who recognize such a plea on the condition that the wife submits “<i>amatla me’vureret</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Behirah</i>, supra n. 18 in the name of some scholars of the generations; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva, Ketuvot</i> 63; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i> 102 in the name of Rabbeinu Tam; <i>PDR</i> 3:201, 202–204; <i>Ezrat Kohen</i>, supra n. 14;<i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak EH</i> 3-4; <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> 4:21, 5:26; <i>Yabia Omer</i>, supra n. 25; <i>Teshuvot Shema Shlomo</i> 3:19; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 18(13).</i>
Since, in our scenario, we are dealing with a <i>Tova’at</i> who has submitted a plea of “<i>ma’is ali</i>” accompanied by an “<i>amatla mevureret</i>” and in our estimation there is veracity to the plea, we are obligating the <i>Nitva</i> to give a <i>get</i> to his wife.

In fact, for Rivash, the employment of these measures is due to the fact that the husband is obligated on a rabbinic level to avoid being recalcitrant regarding the granting of a <i>get</i>.

f) A husband's premarital misrepresentations; A case study in bittul kiddushin

<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Rivka Teitelbaum v. Moshe Teitelbaum</i></span>
Mrs. Rivka Teitlebaum (hereafter: the <i>Tova’at—</i>the plaintiff), an <i>agunah</i> (“chained wife”) for the past five years, summoned Mr. Moshe Teitelbaum, her husband (hereafter: the <i>Nitva</i>—the defendant), to <i>beit din</i> for the purpose of freeing her from her status of <i>igun</i> (chained to a marriage). During December of 2009, the <i>Tova’at</i> requested a <i>get</i> and the couple separated in January of 2010. In the summer of 2011, the marriage was civilly annulled. To this very date the <i>Nitva</i> will only grant her a <i>get</i> in exchange for monetary remuneration in the amount of $100,000.00. The <i>Tova’at</i> refuses to comply with his condition and therefore the <i>Nitva</i> refuses to give her a <i>get.</i>
Now let’s briefly summarize the facts of the case: Prior to the marriage, which took place during the summer of 2004, the couple courted each other extensively. Both parties had been married previously and sired children from their respective marriages. There were over a dozen conversations between the parties during their courting and one-third to half of these conversations dealt with what each one expected of the other should they marry each other. Each one was very concerned to have their second marriage be successful. Though the <i>Nitva</i> spoke to the <i>Tova’at</i> about his expectations in the marriage, the majority of these conversations centered on the <i>Tova’at’s</i> hopes. The <i>Tova’at</i> alleges that she wanted to marry a person who would be kind and considerate to her and to her two sons and was looking for someone who would be economically supportive in their marriage. In particular, she was concerned about her two sons who were treated inappropriately by their father and behavior required psychological counseling for an extended period of time as a result of his improper conduct. And, in fact, the <i>Tova’at</i> concedes that the <i>Nitva</i> treated her children nicely prior to their marriage. The <i>Tova’at</i>’s claim of expectations that the <i>Nitva</i> would be amiable, good-natured, and caring with her children was corroborated by a woman who initially was a friend of the <i>Tova’at</i> and subsequently during the marriage became a friend of the couple and had been told by the <i>Tova’at</i> about this expectation during the marriage prior to <i>Tova’at</i>’s decision to seek a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For the requirement to furnish testimony of third parties regarding events which transpired prior to a breakdown in relations of a married couple, see <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>) <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 17:48; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 178:9</i>
Immediately after the marriage, the <i>Nitva’s</i> attitude to her children changed radically. As a controlling personality who dictated that her children accede to his many requests, the <i>Nitva</i> instilled fear in the minds of the <i>Tova’at’</i>s two children and ejected one of her children who challenged his authority from the marital home. This ejection of one of the <i>Tova’at</i> children from the marital home was corroborated by various individuals, including the family rabbi. At the same time, the <i>Tova’at</i> alleges that the <i>Nitva</i> was emotionally abusive to her and slapped her on a few occasions. Though none of the witnesses (children, relatives, friends and third parties) were able to corroborate the physical abuse allegations, nonetheless the family rabbi as well as a woman who was living with the couple from the winter of 2009 until the summer of 2009 stated that her allegations of emotional abuse were true and one witness said that he treated her “like a slave”. After being in the couple’s home for a month or two, the boarder asked the <i>Tova’at</i>, “Why are you staying in the marriage?” Her (approximate) reply was that “she was worried about the situation but she didn’t know what to do”.
Initially, in order to address their marital concerns, the couple attended various sessions with their family rabbi. Despite the prudent counsel that was given by the rabbi, the marriage continued to disintegrate. However, already from 2006 through 2007, at the <i>Tova’at’s</i> request, the couple was attending marital therapy sessions. Though the couple saw three therapists during this period, the <i>Nitva</i> allegedly felt that the problems in the marriage stemmed from the <i>Tova’at’s</i> behavior and he therefore failed to attend future sessions after attending one or two sessions with every therapist. After completing the sessions in 2007, the <i>Tova’at</i> remained adamant in trying to keep the marriage for the sake of her children from her first marriage and her daughter sired from this marriage.
During the marriage her husband’s earned income was expended for the most part for his own personal needs rather than maintaining the domestic household. . Moreover, in certain years, the <i>Nitva</i> failed to pay tuition for his daughter and his wife’s two children and to this very day, the <i>Nitva</i> only pays basic child support for his child (refusing to pay additional monies for child support as mandated by the civil court).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To corroborate these allegations, we received copies of the <i>Tova’at</i>’s personal bank statements, copies of tuition statements, and records of post-dated checks, a copy of the <i>Tova’at</i>’s recent personal tax return, and a copy of the findings of fact, decision, and order of the Family Court, which records the financial history of the couple in painstaking detail.</i> However, for the sake of her children she still wanted the marriage to succeed and therefore acceded to his every request. Moreover during the marriage, the <i>Tova’at</i> worked as a dietician 4 days a week, supported herself, her two sons of the first marriage and their daughter and paid their tuition.
As noted above by the boarder in early 2009, the <i>Tova’at</i> still was unsure how to handle her marital situation and she therefore again enlisted the guidance of a health care professional. From 2008 until the time of marital separation, the <i>Tova’at</i> availed herself again of professional counseling and attended marital counseling sessions given by a therapist for the express purpose in trying to determine who was responsible for the marital tensions. The <i>Nitva</i> participated in six sessions and again refused to continue to participate in the hearings. Nonetheless, still desiring to keep the marriage and the family intact, the <i>Tova’at</i> attended dozens of sessions hoping to find “a light at the end of the tunnel”. By the end of 2009, the <i>Tova’at</i> realized there were no prospects for marital reconciliation and therefore requested of her husband to give her a <i>get</i>. Subsequent to the marital separation in January 2010, the Family Court handed down an order of protection against the <i>Nitva</i> during the summer of 2010, mandating that he “refrain from assault, harassment . . . threats of any criminal offense against” the <i>Tova’at</i> and her three children. In reply to the question posed by the <i>beit din</i> panel of “if your husband would have acted properly to you and your children, would you have remained in the marriage”, the <i>Tova’at</i>’s (approximate) reply was, “No. Given that his misrepresentation regarding how he would treat my children only showed his lack of trustworthiness and his unwillingness to support my family propelled me to get divorced.” At the end of the day, the picture that was portrayed to us by family members, friends of either the <i>Tova’at</i> and/or the couple and third parties, men and women (young and old) alike is that though the <i>Nitva</i> was perceived outwardly in the public eye either as charming, kind and considerate, “a harmless, easygoing, guy”, and sometimes prone to “blowing up”, regretfully, in his marital and familial ties, he was controlling, domineering, emotionally abusive, and subject to fits of anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A friend of the <i>Nitva</i> submitted testimony that he was a <i>mensch</i> and the <i>Tova’at</i> was aggressive and could “eat him up for dinner”, yet he pointed out that his testimony related to his interactions with them prior to the marriage. Though the friendship with the <i>Nitva</i> continued after the marriage, he never observed them interacting as a couple.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
<b>I. <i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i> (lit. A mistaken betrothal, loosely translated as a mistaken marriage)</b>
Prior to a wife invoking the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage retroactively and claim there was an error in the creation of the marriage; three preconditions must have been obtained:
(1) The husband’s defect must be a major one (a <i>mum gadol</i>) such as sexual impotency, refusing to have children, insanity, homosexuality, apostasy, a marital expectation communicated by the prospective husband prior to the marriage which turns out to be a misrepresentation, engaging in criminal behavior such as business fraud, or exposing one’s mate to a contagious disease such as syphilis or HIV, a flaw which must have been existent prior to the onset of the marriage. All of the aforementioned examples of a husband’s flaws have been characterized by one or more <i>Poskim</i> as a <i>mum gadol</i>. Whether a particular defect serves as a major defect and is therefore grounds for voiding a marriage is subject to the discretion of the <i>beit din</i>.
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted, we find that the grounds for <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in our case are that during the days of their courting, the <i>Nitva</i> misrepresented to the <i>Tova’at</i> that he would be considerate and kind to her children from her first marriage and would be financially supportive of his new family. In fact, during the <i>Nitva</i>’s first marriage he acted inappropriately toward his biological children and failed to support his family.
Clearly, in our scenario common sense dictates that a couple who both were previously divorced and contemplating a second marriage (in which the <i>Tova’at’s</i> two children from a first marriage will be living with the <i>Nitva)</i>, any representation regarding such matters is significant. Is there any reason to assume that the mutual representations of the man and woman who are considering embarking into marriage will not be crucial in determining whether a particular party will buy into the marriage? In fact, such matters were under discussion between the two of them. As we mentioned above, we have the submission of one of the couple’s friends that prior to requesting a divorce, the <i>Tova’at</i> confided in her that the <i>Nitva</i> deceived her prior to the marriage regarding how he would treat her children.
As such, as we encounter other <i>Poskim</i> who will void a marriage retroactively based upon different types of deception,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:130;<i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i>. <i>Mahadura Tlita’a</i>, 1:61; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 3:82; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Kohen, EH</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Divrei</i> <i>Malkiel</i> 1:86 Lest one argue that given that <i>Tashbetz</i>’s ruling deals with <i>halitzah</i> and therefore ought to be inapplicable to instances of marriage, we must note there are <i>Poskim</i> who apply <i>halitzah</i> rulings to matters of <i>nissuin</i> (marriage) regarding <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 88; <i>Teshuvot Beit ha-Levi</i> 3:3; <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv</i> 1:100; <i>Teshuvot Shevut Ya’akov</i> 1:101.<br>Whether husband’s representation prior to marriage must be articulated by the wife prior to the marriage, at the time of <i>kiddushin</i> or must be stated as a <i>tenai</i>, condition to the marriage is subject to controversy. See <i>Tashbetz</i>, op. cit.; <i>Ran, Kiddushin</i> 26a on Rif; <i>Teshuvot Malbushei Yom Tov EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak EH</i> vol. 2, 25. In our issue at bar, after hearing the wife’s presentation including her past history with her first husband and assessing her personality, the panel assumes that her husband’s representation would be viewed by her as a misrepresentation. In pursuance to <i>Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av EH</i> 25, the panel invokes an <i>umdana</i> that had the wife been aware of her husband’s deceptive declarations prior to the marriage she never would have married him and the marriage may be voided based upon an error of a husband’s failure to disclose proper information to his wife.</i> we find grounds to void this marriage based upon the aforementioned misrepresentation advanced by the <i>Nitva</i> during his days of courting. The existence of two <i>mumim gedolim</i>, major flaws namely the <i>Nitva’s</i> behavior toward his children of his first marriage and his failure to support his first wife and their children serve as the grounds for viewing his promises during his courting days with his prospective second wife as a misrepresentation.
The following question arises: If the man had simply misrepresented to the woman during their courting days that he promised that he would treat her children of her first marriage properly or would support her, would his statement be construed <i>halakhically</i> as a misrepresentation and therefore a case of “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”? Or is the fact that he had a track record, namely of mistreating his own children from his first marriage and failing to support his first wife, serve as the grounds for viewing his promise as a misrepresentation and consequently a situation of “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”? In the absence of any past history of mistreating his own children from his first marriage or failing to support his wife, various <i>aharonim</i> conclude that given that he could have changed his mind, his failure to keep his word to act properly would not be viewed as grounds for voiding a marriage based upon error.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzmot Yosef, Kiddushin</i> 62a<i>; Teshuvot Helkat Yo’av, EH</i> 25; <i>Hatam Sofer, supra</i> n. 4.</i> However, in our case, at the time of the courting had the woman known about his improper behavior during his first marriage, she never would have married him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi, Pesahim</i> 4b, s.v. <i>lo mibaya</i>; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Ketuvot</i> 12a, s.v.<i> ha amar Rav Ashi</i>; <i>Hiddushei ha-Ra’ah, Ketuvot</i> 11b, s.v.<i> ta’anat betulim</i>.</i> Consequently, in light of her husband’s past marital history, his representation during the courting constituted a misrepresentation and therefore grounds for invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut.</i>
To state it differently<i>, Halakhah</i> does not only ascertain if misrepresentation exists by utilizing subjective standards such as a spouse’s testimony that deception occurred, but equally must arrive at this conclusion by employing “objective” criteria to determine if one can assume that deception transpired. Addressing the scenario of a marriage ceremony that was finalized with the giving of a brass ring by the <i>hatan</i> to the <i>kallah</i> and subsequently invalidated by a rabbi, R. Shimon bar Tzemach Duran (known by the acronym: Tashbetz) notes,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 4.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">. . . Perhaps his reasoning is that given that it is not the usual practice to marry with a brass ring, it is as if he verbally indicated that it was gold. And therefore upon discovery it was brass, she would not be considered married . . . But the matter needs further deliberation.</span>
To state it differently, “usual practice” concerning marital expectations is defined by what the community considers proper conduct.
Whereas R. Duran concludes that his observation requires further deliberation, invoking the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, centuries later R. Avraham Yudlovich rules that one of the grounds for claiming <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> due to a husband’s misrepresentation is the following,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Av</i> 7:28</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">. . . How is it possible . . . for her to marry a man whom she observes with her own eyes as a cruel person, who has no compassion on his wife and three children . . .</span>
The communal expectations are that a husband support his wife and be considerate to his children, regardless if they are biological or not. Given <i>Nitva’s</i> past history from his first marriage and his subsequent misrepresentation to his second wife during their courting days, we invoked <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
(2) The wife must be unaware of the defect prior to the inception of the marriage and only discovered it after the marriage. On the other hand, if for example, during the marriage a husband commits adultery or contracts Alzheimer’s, though both may be characterized as a <i>mum gadol</i> that significant impairs the matrimonial relationship, nevertheless since the conduct or disease respectively occurred after the onset of the marriage, there would be no grounds for a wife’s claim that the marriage was consummated in error.
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted, we find that the <i>Tova’at</i> only became aware of the <i>Nitva’s</i> persona in general and his treatment of her children and failure to support his family in particular after the onset of the marriage. As we mentioned above, we have the submission of one of the couple’s friends that prior to requesting a divorce, the <i>Tova’at</i> confided in her that the <i>Nitva</i> deceived her prior to the marriage regarding how he would treat her children.
(3) Finally, upon a wife’s awareness of the major latent defect, she must decide to leave the marriage. Regarding this condition, whether she must immediately leave the marriage or not is subject to debate. Though in accordance with certain <i>Poskim</i>, upon discovery of a major latent defect one must leave the marriage immediately or refrain from remaining in the marriage for an extended period of time, nonetheless, in pursuance to R. Moshe Feinstein, Dayanim E. Goldschmidt, S. Karelitz, Y.Bavliki, and others she may continue to live with him provided she offers a reasonable explanation for remaining in the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In pursuance to some <i>Poskim</i>, upon discovery of a major defect in her spouse, if a wife delays her decision to bolt the marriage for a reason(s) which is acceptable to the <i>beit din</i>, the marriage may be voided. See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:45 (“<i>ta’am hagun” or “tiruzim nekhonim”</i>)<i>,</i> 48, 4:113; <i>PDR</i>1:5, 11–12. See also supra chapter 5, text accompanying n. 4.</i>
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, the marriage was consummated in the summer of 2004 and she requested a <i>get</i> towards the end of 2009. Clearly, the maltreatment of her children occurred early on in the marriage and in accordance to some <i>Poskim</i> she should have requested a <i>get</i> before the end of 2009. However, our rendition of the facts of the case clearly indicates that given that she was a divorcee with two children she desired to “make this marriage work”. As she communicated to us in the final session, despite the fact that she was emotionally abused and in the eyes of one observer “she was fearful of him”, she set aside her personal reservations and concerns in order to attempt to promote <i>“shalom bayit”</i> to the fullest extent of the word—peace and tranquility for her entire family, their daughter, and her two children from her previous marriage. As such, she enlisted the guidance of her family rabbi on three different occasions, the counsel of four therapists, which lasted until she requested her <i>get</i> and sought the advice of family members and friends. As we mentioned earlier, the reply to the boarder in <b>early</b> <i>2009</i>, almost four years into the marriage says it all. The boarder asked the <i>Tova’at</i>, “Why are you staying in the marriage?” Her (approximate) reply was that “she was worried about the situation but she didn’t know what to do”. In other words, despite the fact that “the writing was on the wall” dating back a few years regarding his treatment of the <i>Tova’at</i> and her children, the <i>Tova’at</i> was a driven person who had already been divorced once and wanted to try every avenue to save this marriage for herself as well as for her kids. We asked one therapist the following question: “If the couple would have seen you earlier, could the marriage have been saved?” The informed and educated reply from a well-seasoned professional was, “It would not have made one iota of a difference. This marriage could never have worked.” After reading the facts of this case, someone may say that that this marriage was doomed from its inception and therefore how could she have stayed with the marriage. Yes, it is very possible that some women would have opted out of the marriage much earlier and, in fact, two women who appeared in front of us submitted such a representation, but as a <i>beit din</i> we are dealing with the <i>Tova’at</i>, her personality, and her expectations and aspiration and it is crucial to rule in light of her situation. As such, the facts of the case indicate that there are reasonable explanations why she remained in the marriage for an extended period of time hoping to salvage it. Once there was no hope in her mind, she requested a <i>get</i> and separated from her husband.
In short, all three conditions have been met prior to employing the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
Our conclusion is seemingly open to challenge. Firstly, the Mishnah in Kiddushin clearly states that the dissolution of matrimonial ties is effected either through the delivery of a <i>get</i> by the husband to the wife or by the husband’s demise and our <i>Amoraim</i> (Talmudic sages) as well as the authors of our classical restatements of <i>Halakhah</i> such as Alfasi, Mishneh Torah, Tur, and Shulhan Arukh never authorized voiding a marriage retroactively based upon the existence of major latent defects found in a spouse without the delivery of a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Mishneh Halakhot</i> 14:146; Rabbi Yosef Henkin, <i>Perushei Ibra</i> 43, 46. For precedent for the inability to address an <i>igun</i> matter if the issue has not been addressed in the Talmud and <i>gaonic</i> rulings, see <i>Teshuvot Bah</i> 74; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 21.</i> Lest one argue that silence regarding <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> does not imply opposition to this solution, we are contradicted by the fact that the Shulhan Arukh and others address the case of latent defects found in a wife and concludes that though the marriage is doubtful, there is a rabbinic requirement of <i>get le-humra</i> (as a precautionary measure).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 39:5; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 35:9; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 50; <i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 27; <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n.4; <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, vol. 1 <i>EH</i> 24; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79; File no. 861252/1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, January 23, 2012.</i> The same conclusion ought to apply concerning discovery of hidden flaws found in the husband.

Yet in an effort to define what constitutes a <i>mum gadol</i> in a husband’s persona, we encounter numerous authorities who utilize the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> under certain conditions as a solution to free an <i>agunah</i> from her marital bonds without the requirement of a <i>get.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohr Zarua</i> 761; <i>Tashbetz</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Hatam Sofer</i>, supra n. 4; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:14 in the name of students of Rabbeinu Yonah and scholars of Lunel; <i>Teshuvot Terumat ha-Deshen, Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> 138; <i>Shoeil u-Meishiv,</i> supra n. 4, <i>Mahadura Tilta’a</i> 1:61; <i>Hazon Yehezkel</i> on <i>Masekhet Zevahim, EH</i> 8; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 7 <i>EH</i> 7 in the name of <i>Mikneh, Tiv Kiddushin,</i> and <i>Atzei Arazim</i>; <i>Teshuvot Dvar Yehoshua</i> 1:20, 71; <i>Teshuvot Beit Av, Sheveai Helek Ezrat Avraham, EH</i> 28; <i>Teshuvot Shevet me-Yehudah</i> vol. 2, EH 25 (see also 1:24); <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:79–80, 3:45, 4:13, 113; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:180–181; R.

See <i>Teshuvot Ezrat Kohen</i> 67.</i> Those who claim that one can utilize the model of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> (a mistaken transaction) from <i>halakhot</i> of sales for defining what constitutes a major latent defect conclude that anything that the majority of the community considers a defect in an item and is neither obvious nor disclosed to the buyer generates the buyer’s right to void the sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 232:6</i> Similarly, numerous contemporary <i>Poskim</i> and <i>dayanim</i> contend that any defect viewed by society that relates to the essence of the marriage and/or its ongoing stability is to be understood as a <i>mum gadol</i> and therefore, under certain prescribed conditions, may free a wife from her marriage without the requisite need for a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 11; <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4; Y. Reizin, <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yosef</i> 44; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Hefetz</i> 30; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:13, 113, 121(a <i>halitzah</i> case).<br>It is important to note that if a purchaser had the possibility to inspect the item prior to purchase and refrained from doing so and subsequently discovered a defect, if he already paid for the item, the sale is final. See <i>Mishnah le-Melekh, Mishnah Torah, Hilkhot Mehirah</i> 15:3; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 232:1. On the other hand, despite the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> serve as the paradigm for defining the defects of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>, nevertheless, there is no duty upon the wife to have performed due diligence and inquire whether the husband had possessed certain flaws prior to the inception of the marriage.</i>
Seemingly, the employing of the instrument of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> is open to challenge from a passage in the Talmud. In Bava Kama,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 110b-111a.</i> the Talmud addresses the situation of a <i>“mekah ta’ut”</i> (a mistaken transaction) where the buyer has to rescind the sale due to a defect found in the item that was bought. Upon discovery of the flaw, the buyer has a right to return the object to the seller. One of the conditions for the rescission is that the buyer was unaware of the defect when he purchased the item. If at the time of the sale the buyer was aware of the defect, the sale is final. Among the <i>mekah ta’ut</i> matters that the Talmud addresses is the case of a <i>yibum</i> (levirate marriage). A <i>yevamah</i> is the widow of a man who died childless and was survived by his brother. Under <i>Halakhah</i>, they are obligated to marry one another. Should the brother-in-law refuse to marry her, he must release her by means of a ceremony called <i>halitzah</i> (removal of one of his shoes). Should the surviving brother, known as the <i>yavam</i> (levir), neither marry the <i>yevama</i> nor perform the <i>halitzah</i>, she becomes an <i>agunah</i>. Dealing with a childless widow, the Talmud states,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Supra n.16.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A childless widow whose lot falls for <i>yibum</i> consideration before a brother-in-law who is afflicted with a severe skin disease (boils) (and as a result is physically repulsive to her) should be released without <i>halitzah</i> because she did not betroth herself in marriage to her brother-in-law with this in mind.</span>
However, rejecting the wife’s reasoning, the Talmud cites Resh Lakish’s following ruling approvingly,
<span class="poetry indentAll">In that case we can attest that a woman is ready to accept any conditions (provided she is married to her first husband) . . . for Resh Lakish said: it is better to live as two than to remain in widowhood.</span>
Consequently, given that marrying a brother-in-law who is afflicted with boils is preferable to remaining a widow, her first marriage cannot be considered a <i>mekah ta’ut</i>. Consequently, Tosafot extrapolates that in all situations where a husband exhibits major defects a wife cannot argue that there is a <i>mekah ta’ut</i> because she prefers living with any man rather than live a life of spinsterhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 110b.</i> Therefore, it is unsurprising to find that many <i>Poskim</i> who prohibit implementing the method of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> rely upon this Talmudic passage as one of the grounds for their position.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n. 4 in the name of some Rabboseinu Ha’acharonim and <i>Teshuvot Shevut</i> <i>Ya’akov</i> <i>EH</i> 110.</i>
On the other hand, argues R. Elchanan Spektor, if the <i>tav le-meitav</i> (Reish Lakish’s reasoning above) is operative under all circumstances, how did the authorities mandate a husband to divorce his wife in a situation where the wife cannot tolerate her husband’s behavior?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ein Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 11.</i> Moreover, according to Rashi’s interpretation of the passage, the two Talmudic statements “she is satisfied with anything” and “it is better for her to live in this state” refer specifically to the case of a <i>yavam</i> who has a serious skin disease rather than to latent flaws in all marriages.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Kama</i> 111a</i> Espousing Rashi’s position, others conclude that a wife may claim <i>mekah ta’ut</i> in many other instances that entail a major defect because she is unwilling to live with a husband who is repulsive to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit ha-Levi</i>, supra n.4; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 221; R. Y. Emden, <i>Teshuvot She’eilat Ya’avetz</i>, 28; <i>Beit Av</i>, supra n. 8; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim shel Shalom</i> 2:81</i>
Given the fact that today outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, civil authorities will not enforce a <i>beit din’s</i> directive to coerce a <i>get,</i> Rabbis Klatzkin, Feinstein, Tzvi P. Frank, O. Yosef, and others state there is a need to implement this type of <i>bittul kiddushin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Dvar Eliyahu</i> 48; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:43 (end), 4:52; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi, EH</i> 2:81; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 38</i> Upon our review of the world of <i>she’eilot</i> and <i>teshuvot</i> in general and the aforesaid reasons in particular, and the concomitant realization that in the absence of <i>kefiyyah</i> (legal coercion) a <i>beit din</i> is bereft of offering a solution to the matter of <i>igun</i>, we have chosen to follow in the footsteps of a well-trodden <i>mesorah</i> of two <i>rishonim</i> and numerous <i>aharonim</i> who advocate freeing an <i>agunah</i> without a <i>get</i> based upon the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
This <i>psak din</i> was approved by a renowned rabbinic authority.

g) A mentally dysfunctional husband; A case study in kiddushei ta'ut

<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Miriam Bloom v. Yisrael Bloom</i></span>
Mrs. Miriam Bloom (hereafter: the <i>Tova’at—</i>the plaintiff), an <i>agunah</i> (“chained wife”) for the past five years, summoned Mr. Yisrael Bloom, her husband (hereafter: the <i>Nitva</i>—the defendant) to <i>beit din</i> for the purpose of freeing her from her status of <i>igun</i> (chained to a marriage). During December of 2010, the <i>Tova’at</i> requested a <i>get</i>; the couple separated in January of 2011. By the time of separation, the couple had sired one son and one daughter. In the summer of 2012, a civil divorce was executed.
Now let’s briefly summarize the facts of the case: Prior to the marriage, which took place during the summer of 2003, they courted. At the time, the <i>Tova’at</i> was 18 years old and the <i>Nitva</i> was 19 years old. He projected himself as a nice Orthodox Jewish boy attending a Yeshiva who had a positive outlook on life, was charming, and was ready to begin studying at a business school in order to earn his MBA degree and embark on a career in the investment world. They married in the fall of 2003.
Approximately a year into the marriage, according to the <i>Tova’at’</i>s representation, he admitted to her that something was wrong to him and therefore decided to proceed to have therapy. But she had already sensed on their wedding night that something might be wrong. At that time, she was “<i>a huppat niddah”</i> and therefore was proscribed from engaging in conjugal relations with her husband. His reaction was that it was her fault that this happened and he became very angry. Subsequently, he got angry for matters that would be insignificant for most people. In effect, his reaction to an event—in terms of “acting out” with anxiety and panic attacks—was not proportionate to the seriousness of the event. Moreover, the <i>Nitva</i> was a controlling personality who chose her friends, single as well as married.
As she communicated to us, during the marriage the <i>Nitva</i> allegedly engaged in risky driving, sometimes wearing headphones and texting while driving, driving down a one way street in the wrong direction, and smashing cars quite a few times. Additionally, he consumed alcohol and was found once by his oldest son with a bleeding nose and lying in front of the synagogue on a Shabbat morning. One DUI (driving under the influence) police report was submitted regarding his level of intoxication and in the report there was mention that his license had been suspended previously for reckless driving.
Though the <i>Nitva</i> did not consume recreational drugs, he medically took a daily regimen of drugs, including Prozac for depression, clonazepam for anxiety, and adderall for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for his entire life <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">At his civil court deposition, the Nitva admitted to taking a daily regimen of medications during his marriage. The records of the deposition were provided to the <i>beit din</i> panel.</i> From time to time, he allegedly overmedicated himself with his regimen of medications and exposed his family and himself to danger while driving in this overmedicated state.
Though during the early years of the marriage, the <i>Nitva</i> admitted to her that he went to a strip club, he subsequently apologized for his indiscretion. The <i>Tova’at</i> felt that he continued to go there and/or be involved in illicit affairs. But she did not provide us with any proof of such. Credit card transactions allegedly showed that he was at strip clubs, but supporting evidence was not provided to the panel. After their separation, her oldest son—who spent time with his father—confided in her that during one of his stays a woman was there and was in the bedroom with his father.
He experienced feelings of being alone [stating that he was “out of his body”] and being abandoned. On a few occasions, he threatened to commit suicide should she leave him.
After earning his MBA degree, he gained employment at an investment company. Shortly after the hire, he was fired. Subsequently, he joined an investment partnership but after a year and a half, that employment opportunity soured. Given that he was allegedly an insomniac, he always woke up late and had no regular schedule as to when his workday began. Having erratic working hours did not gain him friends in the financial world of investments. His business partner testified that he walked into the office at different hours every day. Moreover, the partner testified that the <i>Nitva</i> was manipulative and he never agreed how to address certain business matters. Every issue was “the end of the world and it was his way or the highway”. Though the partnership lasted for a year and half, the primary reason the partnership was not dissolved immediately was that the partner was a friend of his and was hoping that as time passed the working relationship would be improve. But matters only deteriorated even further with the passage of time and the business partnership eventually collapsed.
Though outwardly he was an Orthodox Jew in terms of his synagogue affiliation and his children’s attendance at a local Yeshiva, he nevertheless did not regularly go to synagogue on <i>Shabbat</i>, admitted to the <i>Tova’at</i> that on a few occasions he listened to TV on <i>Shabbat</i>, ate <i>treif</i> (nonkosher food) on three different occasions while at business meetings, and allegedly told his 11-year-old son that one is permitted to watch TV on <i>Shabbat</i>.
Regarding his parenting, the <i>Tova’at</i> alleges that he had no relationship with his children. The oldest one was scared of him and allegedly one of the straws that broke the camel’s back was that he allegedly shook his twelve-year-old son and continued to yell at him for three hours. During this encounter, the <i>Nitva</i> allegedly said to his son that “his grandfather is a thief and your mother doesn’t love you”. For years, despite his lack of ties to his children, the <i>Tova’at</i> “stayed with the marriage”, an avowed position of many Orthodox Jewish mothers who attempt to save their marriage. However, at this point she came to the realization that there was no hope and she had to protect her children and therefore the couple separated. Her decision to leave was reinforced by one act of physical abuse committed against her at that time. Though earlier on in the marriage there were, in her words, “sporadic attempts of abuse”, she didn’t feel that there were in actuality events of abuse. (It is our conjecture that these incidents constituted abuse but either she was not ready to accept that conclusion at that time or did not understand what constitutes abuse.) Two months before separation, he was ready to hit his one-year-old child and she had to stop him. Then, in front of the three children, he sat on her and she almost couldn’t breathe. After he got off her, his response was “it was a joke”. The kids were stunned and scared. In an earlier time, one of the children forgot to cover his mouth when he coughed and the <i>Nitva</i> then pushed the child’s head under the table. This event provides another example of lack of proportionality between the misbehavior and the punishment meted out by the <i>Nitva</i>.
In terms of the <i>Tova’at</i> being emotionally abused, it was defined by his manipulation and lying to her. And when the <i>Nitva</i> did something wrong, she had to apologize for what he did and he sometimes cursed her. In her (approximate) words, “He was a manipulative human being, dishonest, had a narcissistic personality, and exhibited symptoms of having borderline personality disorder, fraught with anxiety and subject to depression and panic attacks.” In fact, in the <i>Nitva’s</i> e-mail communications to the <i>Tova’at’s</i> family, he admitted that he had been combative, disrespectful, and verbally abusive toward the <i>Tova’at</i> and admits his failure as a father.
The <i>Tova’at</i>’s psychological depiction of the <i>Nitva</i> was corroborated by a civil court judge, who stated that “he ought to be committed” and by the <i>Tova’at</i>’s attorney, who testified that he was “out of control” and that her law firm had to hire a bodyguard who would protect the attorney from him both at home and work. An invoice provided by the security company supported the attorney’s allegation.
In response to the wife’s detailed communications of her interaction with her husband, after a psychologist interacted with the <i>Nitva</i>, he testified to us the following: “He is a person with borderline personality disorder (BPD) accompanied by severe depression, is anxiety ridden, and has severe obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic distress disorder.” The psychologist stated that there was no medication for treating BPD. Though there were therapeutic methods to address BPD, given that the person exhibited the aforementioned psychotic conditions, he concluded that therapy was difficult.
His alleged ability to manipulate people was substantiated in the <i>Tova’at</i>’s father’s testimony. In his testimony, the <i>Nitva’s</i> father-in law recounted to the panel that the <i>Nitva</i> behaved nicely to his father-in-law as long as he provided financial support to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to documents submitted to the civil court, her parents contributed over $80,000 to assist them.</i> Initially, the father-in-law did not understand that he was manipulative. In fact, a person who was a neighbor to the couple while they resided in an apartment building in the early years of their marriage told the father-in-law via a third party that he always heard “yelling and screaming” coming from their apartment. However, the father-in-law was unwilling to believe at the time that the marriage was tottering. Therefore, he continued to remain silent and continued to financially assist them. However, once the <i>Nitva’s</i> father-in-law saw “the writing on the wall”, he decided to intervene and tried to extricate his daughter from the marriage. But she failed to heed his advice to bolt the marriage. The <i>Nitva</i> threatened the <i>Tova’at</i> that he would leave her and the children if anyone would become involved in their marriage. The <i>Nitva</i>’s father-in-law testified that his reactions were out of proportion when a particular event happened. The father-in-law witnessed fights that the <i>Nitva</i> had with people in the synagogue that he was regularly attending.
After the marital separation, a civil court noted his irresponsible behavior toward his children and stated,
<span class="poetry indentAll">The wife shall have sole parental responsibility of the three children . . . This Court is manifestly aware of the stress and emotional turmoil that these type of proceedings at times inflict on its participants. However, it is abundantly clear that Husband’s demeanor and speech reflect that he has serious psychological issues that he must attend to in order to properly parent his three minor children. . . . Husband was, until recently taking about five prescribed medications, including Prozac, Adderall and Clonazepam. . . .</span>
Based upon the above psychological evaluation of the <i>Nitva</i>, the court concluded that it was in the children’s best interests that the <i>Tova’at</i> retains sole parental responsibility over the major decisions affecting their children. Furthermore, the <i>Nitva</i> was entitled to eight hours of supervised visitation with both children.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
<b>I. <i>Kiddushei Ta’ut</i> (lit. a mistaken betrothal, loosely translated as a mistaken marriage)</b>
Prior for a wife invoking the tool of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage retroactively and claim that there was an error in the creation of the marriage, three preconditions must have been obtained:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The basis for a portion of our presentation may be found in our earlier discussion of <i>A Husband’s Premarital Misrepresentations: A Case Study in Bittul Kiddushin</i> and in chapter five of this monograph.</i>
(1) The husband’s defect must be a major one (a <i>mum gadol</i>) such as sexual impotency, refusal to have children, insanity, homosexuality, apostasy, a marital expectation communicated by the prospective husband prior to the marriage that turns out to be a misrepresentation, if he is engaging in criminal behavior such as business fraud or if he exposes one’s mate to a contagious disease such as syphilis or HIV; this flaw must have been preexisting at the onset of the marriage. All of the aforementioned examples of a husband’s flaws have been characterized by one or more <i>Poskim</i> as a <i>mum gadol</i>. Whether a particular defect serves as major defect and therefore grounds for voiding a marriage is subject to the discretion of the <i>beit din</i>.
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted, we find that the grounds for <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> in our case is that the <i>Nitva</i> failed to disclose that he was mentally dysfunctional and was taking a daily regimen of Prozac for depression at the time of their courting. Failure to disclose this <i>mum gadol</i> is viewed as improper behavior. As Rema rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i> ) 77:3</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If he conducted himself improperly and consummated <i>kiddushin</i> (a <i>halakhic</i> engagement) by acting deceitfully and with trickery, we coerce him to give a <i>get</i>.</span>
Addressing this conduct, an Israeli Rabbinical Court observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 1: 10–11.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He acted improperly . . . Had the <i>Tova’at</i> been aware of this behavior it is logical to assume that she would not have married him . . . This concealment and misrepresentation of the marriage concerning this serious matter is an improper act . . . Such indecent behavior is a grounds to coerce a get . . .</span>
In fact, even if a husband’s flaw cannot be characterized as a <i>mum gadol</i>, the deception alone serves as grounds to coerce a <i>get</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 117:11</i>
In short, a failure to disclose certain a behavior, which entails deception and misrepresentation, may serve as grounds to coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i> to his wife. Given that this couple lived their married life in the United States, a country that legally will not coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i>, numerous <i>Poskim</i> such as Rabbis Borenstein, Klatzkin, and Feinstein will under certain conditions empower an arbiter or <i>beit din</i> to engage in <i>bittul kiddushin</i> (voiding a marriage).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 2:176; <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Dvar Eliyahu</i> 48; <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 4:52</i> In fact, there is a <i>mesorah</i> of authorities who would void a marriage due to a husband’s misrepresentation prior to the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:130; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 82; <i>Teshuvot Mahari ha-Kohen, EH</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Beit Av</i> 7:28.</i> In short, the <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> was not only in his failure to disclose his psychological condition, but equally due to his misrepresentation prior to marriage that he was a mentally healthy and stable individual.
(2) The wife must be unaware of the defect prior to the inception of the marriage and only discover it after the marriage. On the other hand, if, for example, during the marriage a husband commits adultery or contracts Alzheimer’s, though both may be characterized as a <i>mum gadol</i> significantly impairing the matrimonial relationship, nevertheless since the conduct or disease respectively occurred after the onset of the marriage, there would be no grounds for a wife’s claim that the marriage was consummated in error.
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted, we find that the <i>Tova’at</i> only became aware of the <i>Nitva’s</i> persona in general and his treatment of her children in particular after the onset of the marriage.
Since we are unable to determine whether in fact the <i>Nitva</i> exhibited BPD prior to his marriage, seemingly we fail to have a basis for employing the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and thereby void their marriage. However, as we already noted <i>Nitva</i> failed to disclose at the time of the courting that he was taking medication for depression and misrepresentation and deception serve as grounds for invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
(3) Finally, upon a wife’s awareness of the major latent defect, she must decide to leave the marriage. Regarding this condition, whether she must immediately leave the marriage or not is subject to debate. Though in accordance with certain <i>Poskim</i>, upon discovery of a major latent defect one must leave the marriage immediately or refrain from remaining in the marriage for an extended period of time, nonetheless, in pursuance to R. Moshe Feinstein, Dayanim E. Goldschmidt, S. Karelitz, and Y. Bavliki, and others argue that she may continue to live with him provided she offers a reasonable explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In pursuance to some <i>Poskim</i>, upon discovery of a major defect in her spouse, if a wife delays her decision to bolt the marriage for a reason(s) which is acceptable to the <i>beit din</i>, the marriage may be voided. See <i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 3:45 (“<i>ta’am hagun” or “tirutzim nekhonim”</i>)<i>,</i> 48, 4:113; <i>PDR</i> 1:5, 11–12. See also supra chapter 5, text accompanying n. 4.</i>
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, the marriage was consummated in the fall of 2003 and they separated in January 2011. Given that he admitted that he was taking a daily regimen of Prozac for depression most of his life, a fact that the <i>Tova’at</i> only discovered after their separation, it is clear that during the courting he was taking his meds. Despite this fact, the <i>Tova’at</i> did not observe any “red flags” that would indicate any mental dysfunction. Obviously, during the brief period of courting, nothing triggered him to react psychotically and therefore no signs of mental dysfunction emerged. In fact, had the <i>Tova’at</i> told us that had she known about his taking of Prozac she never would have married him.
Yet, during the first year of the marriage, the <i>Nitva</i> admitted that he had problems and decided to undergo therapy. During the early years of their marriage, the <i>Tova’at</i> witnessed various incidents that were strange to her. For example, the <i>Nitva’s</i> inability to keep to a regular work schedule, that he was subject to bouts of anger regarding insignificant events, and that he chose her friends and engaged in risky driving and yelled and screamed at the <i>Tova’at</i> and their children ought to have served as “red flags”. However, for many years the <i>Tova’at</i> for was unable to discern what was “lurking behind” the <i>Nitva’s</i> conduct. It is important to note that the <i>Tova’at</i> was 18 years old when she married. Being a young woman and unaware of the psychological dynamics of BPD, she was unable to assess what was transpiring in front of her. Addressing the case of a mother of two children who during the span of seven years was living with a psychologically dysfunctional husband before separating from him, Dayan Ben Tzion Boaron, serving at the time as a <i>dayan</i> on the Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, astutely notes, <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 4</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And one cannot say that since she lived with him seven years and had two children and observed the defect, she forgave him. That is not the case since in these matters one cannot comprehend the disease in clear terms for an extended period of time because sometimes due to her love she explains his anger and anxiety . . . (she views it –AYW) as a temporary psychological state and she craves and hopes that his situation will improve. In particular, when a person regularly takes medicine, there are periods that he is relaxed and quiet. Such is the situation in particular after he explodes and then becomes relaxed and pleads for forgiveness . . . Minimally this “lowers” the <i>kiddushin</i> to the level of a doubtful marriage . . . In the case of a doubtful marriage one may be lenient . . . and she has the status of being single . . .</span>
His observations of human nature and their significance in terms of voiding a marriage, as he explains, have been noted by earlier authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:16; <i>Teshuvot Ohr Gadol</i> 5:12; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Eiphod</i> 117:15.</i> Similarly, in our case, it took the wife seven to eight years to be able to be educated regarding her husband’s condition and arrive at the realization that it is was time to separate. Consequently, even after this extended period of time, she still retains the right to claim that the marriage was “in error” and request that we void the marriage without the execution of the <i>get</i>. Given the reasonable explanation for the delay in invoking “<i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>”, as R. Feinstein and others note, said delay should not undermine her claim to be freed!<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See supra n. 9<i>.</i></i>
Moreover, as an Orthodox Jewish wife who was committed to the marriage, her initial reactions to the <i>Nitva’s</i> conduct was to attempt to assist the <i>Nitva</i> in trying “to make him whole” and was fearful of leaving him; apprehensive what he would do to the kids and her. On numerous occasions over the years, the <i>Nitva</i> promised to mend his ways and his words were quite convincing to her but clearly now the <i>Tova’at</i> realizes it was all an act. As the panel understood, the <i>Tova’at</i> became a victim of emotional abuse. Though initially the <i>Tova’at‘s</i> father did not comprehend the <i>Nitva’s</i> problems, he eventually grasped the situation and attempted to persuade his daughter to leave the marriage. Nonetheless, she insisted that she wanted to remain in the marriage in the hope of being able to “save the marriage” for herself and for her children. Being a single mother with children would compromise the family’s good name and status in the Orthodox Jewish community as well as damage the children’s marriageability and will affect the possibility of finding them a <i>“shidduch”</i> (a good marital match). The <i>Tova’at</i> wanted the abuse to end, but as an Orthodox Jewish woman she desired to preserve the family relationship.
In short, the <i>Nitva</i>, who is the abuser, is the person the victim/survivor loves. Like other abusers, the <i>Nitva</i> was remorseful after committing his abuse. He showed moments of contrite behavior, included promising never to hit again, and pointed out the incredible stresses under which he was operating. Such representations make leaving the abuser especially difficult where violent episodes or bouts of anger and panic attacks are followed by periods of affection and positive attention. When the <i>Nitva</i> acknowledged the error in his ways and conceded the need for change, hope was renewed for the <i>Tova’at</i>. Eventually, after six years, she enlisted the services of a health care professional for the purpose of receiving a professional assessment of the situation. Once the nature of <i>Nitva’s</i> psychological disorder was explained to the <i>Tova’at</i>, she realized that BPD cannot be treated with medication and employing therapy was very difficult due to his other psychological complications; after witnessing the <i>Nitva’s</i> physical abuse of her children, she then realized whom she was living with all these years and that there was no hope to salvage the marriage and separated from <i>Nitva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Whether the <i>Tova’at’s</i> behavior indicates that she developed Stockholm syndrome during her marriage which involves expressing love for the abuser, denying or minimizing the abuse, feeling responsible for the abuse and remaining with the abuser we leave as an open question. The following conditions serve as prerequisites for developing this syndrome: Firstly, the victim of domestic violence perceives a person threatening her survival. The threats may be physical or psychological. Secondly, the victim perceives the batterer showing her moments of kindness. Furthermore, the victim is isolated from others and finally the victim does not perceive a way to leave the abuser. See D. Graham and E. Rawlings, “Bonding with Abusive Dating Partners: Dynamics of the Stockholm Syndrome,” in <i>Dating Violence: Young Women in Danger</i>, ed. by E. Levy, Seattle: 1991, 119–135.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>2. A wife’s <i>umdana</i> (assessment of expectations) after the onset of marriage</b></span>
In contradistinction to <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> which focuses upon an event prior to the marriage, namely the existence of preexisting grave flaw in the husband’s physiology or behavior, <i>umdana</i> deals with an event(s) which transpires after the inception of marriage. For example, “had I known that my husband would have been physically abusive to me or would become mentally dysfunctional during our years of marriage I never would have married him” may serve as illustrations of a wife invoking an <i>umdana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the conceptual distinction between <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> and <i>umdana</i>, see <i>Teshuvot She’eilat Moshe EH</i> 2. Further discussion of the technique of <i>umdana</i> may be found in chapter five of this monograph.</i>
Seemingly, the employment of an <i>umdana</i> here is open to challenge. As we know, an <i>umdana</i> to be effective is dependent upon both parties. For example, a sales transaction involves the agreement of parties, the seller and the buyer: “<i>taluy be-da’at shenhem</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See e.g. <i>Teshuvot Shoeil u-Meishiv, Mahadura Kama</i> 1:145,197; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehuda, Mahadura Kama, Yoreh Deah</i> (hereafter:YD) 69, <i>Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 130; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 3:82, 5:5.</i> The voiding of the sale with the appearance of a defect subsequent to purchase would be predicated upon two conditions:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i> 47a; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> 230:1.</i>
1. The buyer would have not consummated the deal if he had realized that the item sold would be defective within a reasonable time.
2. The seller would negotiate the sale contingent upon the utility of the item being sold. In other words, the voiding of the sales transaction is dependent upon the existence of both the seller’s and buyer’s implied conditions.
The requirement of “<i>taluy be-da’at shenhem</i>” as a precondition prior to the invoking of an <i>umdana</i> equally applies to marriage which is based upon the consent of both a man and a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot Ketuvot</i>, ibid.; Rabbi Avraham Teomim, <i>Teshuvot Hessed le-Avraham, Mahadura Tinyana EH</i> 55; <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi EH</i> 1:99</i> For example, if a husband is engaged in criminal activity while married, the fact that a wife would exclaim “had I known he would be a criminal, I never would have married him” would seem to offer no basis for voiding the marriage, since a similar statement must have either been articulated by the husband or be presumed on the husband’s behalf. In fact, the husband may not want to void the marriage in order to avoid his sexual intercourse being viewed as <i>be’ilat zenut</i>, an act of fornification. However, in contradistinction to R. Bezalel Stern’s view, adopting the views of Rabbis Mordekhai Hillel, Zvi Ashkenazi, Shmuel Landau, Hayyim Halberstam, Zvi Shapiro, Moshe Zweig, Moshe Feinstein, Ezra Batzri and others, in cases of a major <i>umdana</i> or what has been labeled as an <i>umdana demukhach</i>, a major inference expressed by one person suffices in order to void a marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot She’eilat Yitzhak</i>, 174,186 (R.

Addressing the situation of a husband who upon marriage becomes dysfunctional and is placed in a mental health care facility, R. Zvi Pesah Frank states,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi</i> <i>EH</i> 2:133. Lest one challenge the authenticity of this ruling given that it was included in the collection of R. Frank’s <i>teshuvot</i> which wre published after his demise, clearly it corresponds to his position as he authored in other rulings. See <i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi EH</i> 1:99 and <i>EH</i> 2:201. Cf. Rabbis Binyamin Be’eri and Eliyahu Bracha, <i>Mishnat Yosef</i>, Tevet 5776, 79–81, 415–417. Secondly, similar to R. Frank who offers two different lines of argumentation as grounds to void the marriage, we offer two different rationales, namely <i>umdana</i> and <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> as a basis to void the marriage.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I saw in Hessed le-Avraham . . . that writes to our pending matter, if a husband became an apostate clearly she did not have in mind to marry him. And equally in our case where he became dysfunctional and no person will live together with a snake and this is much worse than a person afflicted with boils that we say that she had no intention of marrying him and therefore we have to deliberate whether to void the marriage . . . and in a situation of an insane person one cannot live with him and it is analogous to an apostate . . . and therefore we permit her to remarry (without a <i>get</i> –AYW).</span>
In effect, invoking <i>medameh milta le-milta</i> (reasoning by analogy), <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, vol. 1, 53–57.</i> extrapolating from the scenario of voiding the marriage of an apostate Jew based upon employing the tool of <i>umdana</i> to the situation of an insane husband living in a hospital for lunatics who refuses to give a <i>get</i> where a wife ought to be freed without a <i>get</i> serves as the grounds for R. Frank voiding the marriage.
In fact, addressing the situation of husband who failed prior to his marriage to disclose to his spouse the existence of his mental insanity, R. Avraham Shapiro, a former Israeli Chief Rabbi argues,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Avraham</i> 2:10.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is clear that it is impossible that a wife would be enslaved to live with a man who is afflicted with a skin disease, this is an absolute debt, and surely she is not interested in it and this matter cannot be understood and it is against common sense . . . and surely it is an erroneous marriage . . . Therefore a severe defect such as being mentally insane . . . a woman does not desire and it is meaningless for everyone.</span>
To state it differently, R. Shapiro contends that no woman would be willing to live with a man who is mentally dysfunctional. Though dealing with a case of <i>mum gadol</i> which predates the inception of marriage, R. Shapiro formulates an argument for invoking an <i>umdana</i> in a situation where the insanity emerges after the onset of marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yonathan Rosenzweig, <i>Bittul Kiddushin</i> (an unpublished manuscript), 81. But clearly, R. Shapiro understands that the <i>umdana</i> is linked to the existence of a flaw preceding the marriage. See <i>Minhat Avraham</i>, supra n. 23 at subsection 11. See further, supra, Chapter 5, note 58.</i> As other authorities observe,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik</i>, Shoresh 101; <i>Teshuvot Zikhron Yehonathan</i>, vol. 1, <i>YD</i> 5 (46).</i> there exists an <i>umdana</i> that no one wants to be married to a spouse who is mentally dysfunctional.
In light of those <i>Poskim</i> who employ <i>umdana</i> as a means to void a marriage in general and R. Frank’s ruling in particular, we are dealing in our case with a husband who is mentally dysfunctional and as Talmud states “no person will live together with a snake”. Our rendition of the facts of the case including the <i>Tova’at’s</i> presentation, family and third parties’ testimonies and the psychological evaluation of the <i>Nitva</i> demonstrate the workings of an <i>umdana</i>, namely “had I known that my husband would be become mentally dysfunctional during our years of marriage I never would have married him”
In short, focusing upon a husband with BPD as well as communicating false misrepresentation to the <i>Tova’at</i> that he was a mentally healthy individual during their courting, we find grounds based upon <i>umdana</i> as well as <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void the marriage.
This <i>psak din</i> was approved by two renowned rabbinic authorities.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Final Thoughts</b></span>
<b>1.</b>
Are there grounds to void the marriage based upon the fact that the <i>Nitva</i> exhibited behavior that was symptomatic of an individual with BPD? Describing the <i>Nitva</i>, the <i>Tova’at</i> observed (her approximate words),
<span class="poetry indentAll">He was a manipulative human being, dishonest, had a narcissistic personality, exhibited symptoms of having borderline personality disorder, was fraught with anxiety and was subject to depression and panic attacks.</span>
Signs of the disorder are impulsive and risky behavior, such as reckless driving, drug use, wide mood swings, short but intense episodes of anxiety or depression, inappropriate anger, and antagonistic behavior that sometimes escalates into physical fights. Additionally, feeling misunderstood or abandoned as well as fear of being alone are symptomatic feelings of an individual with BPD. All of the above were told to us by the <i>Tova’at</i> and her family, described by the <i>Nitva</i> in his e-mail communications to the family or a friend, and corroborated by some documentation.
Here again, such a psychological condition ought to be viewed as a <i>mum gadol</i>. Even those <i>Poskim</i> who contend that a psychological disorder that is curable must be viewed as a minor defect<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:1; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i> vol. 1, <i>EH</i> 23; <i>Piskei Halakhot-Yad Dovid, Ishut</i> 10</i> would agree that a person who is diagnosed with BPD, which cannot be cured through any medication, ought to be viewed as a husband possessing a major defect. Lest one argue that such an individual may be curable through therapy, in our scenario where the <i>Nitva</i> suffers from major depression and is a victim of anxiety attacks, the health care professional testified that therapy would be very difficult. And in fact, the <i>Nitva</i> underwent therapy and until the time of separation was still mentally dysfunctional and upon separation developed an additional psychological disorder of ADD.
Though, as we have mentioned, the <i>Tova’at</i> communicated to us (and members of the family testified) regarding <i>Nitva’s</i> alleged psychological conditions, these representations are nonetheless at best the opinions of lay people and therefore are open to challenge.
On the other hand, as we mentioned earlier these characterizations have been confirmed by a health care professional who offered the following diagnosis of the <i>Nitva’s</i> psychological profile:
<span class="poetry indentAll">“He is a person with borderline personality disorder (BPD) accompanied by severe depression, is anxiety ridden, and has severe obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic distress disorder.”</span>
Except for a <i>psak din</i> rendered by R. Osher Weiss that, assuming certain conditions are met, who advocates in principle that voiding a marriage of a husband who is professionally diagnosed with borderline personality disorder ought to be recognized,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Asher</i> 1:85.</i> to the best of our knowledge no other <i>posek</i> addresses this scenario. However, the fact that a particular psychological condition has not been the focal point of a <i>psak din</i> should not construe utilizing it as “charting a new course” within the context of <i>bittul kiddushin</i>. For example, recently, addressing the situation of a schizophrenic husband, a Haifa rabbinical court invokes multifarious rulings that dealt with preexisting latent defects of a husband involving physiological, medical, and psychological conditions as grounds to void the marriage of a dysfunctional husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">File no. 870175/4, Haifa Regional Beit Din, December 29, 2014.</i> To date this is the lengthiest <i>teshuvah</i> which has been published dealing with <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>. Among the <i>teshuvot</i> cited by the Israeli <i>beit din</i> were the following: a husband who was castrated, blind in two eyes, sexually impotent, and a <i>shoteh</i> (mentally dysfunctional in accordance with <i>halakhic</i> criteria). The common denominator of these major flaws can be summarized in the words of R. Feinstein, who addresses a situation of a <i>shoteh</i> and states,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe, EH</i> 1:80</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Surely a <i>shoteh</i> is a major flaw that in effect precludes <i>ishut</i> (marital relationship –AYW) . . . one cannot live with a snake . . . one cannot live with him.</span>
To state it differently, engaging in conjugal relations is not only contingent upon the physical ability of a couple “to go through the motions”. A couple may physically and medically be capable “to perform”. But at the end of the day, there may exist psychological conditions that preclude either a wife or a husband to engage in marital relations. For the Haifa <i>beit din</i>, a schizophrenic husband impacts the stability of the home in general and the intimate relations of a couple in particular. But interestingly enough, a review of the Haifa case shows that the panel was unable to demonstrate that “<i>the mum gadol</i>” existed prior to their marriage. As we have explained, in order to void a marriage based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> one must prove that the husband was schizophrenic prior to the marriage and he failed to disclose his psychological disorder to his wife prior to their marriage. However, based upon the assessment of a health care professional, the various <i>dayanim</i> who proffered their approval of the decision inform us,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Haifa Regional Beit Din, supra n. 28, 80.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The phenomena that were discovered with the husband prior to the marriage attests in a clear fashion that he was sick with this disease even before his marriage. In the first stage there were no psychotic attacks but it expressed itself in negative and positive signs which characterize its presence (of the disease –AYW) . . . It was dormant for a few years, but according to his professional experience, the outcome was clear. There was a high degree of probability that sooner or later the psychotic attack would manifest itself, in particular during the marriage which is linked to particular tensions.</span>
In other words, despite the fact that there was no evidence demonstrating that prior to the marriage the husband was schizophrenic, nonetheless, there was behavior which was a precursor to developing this <i>mum gadol</i>, this major psychological disorder. Consequently, relying upon a health care professional’s assessment of the situation, “the second opinion” communicated to the Haifa panel their approval of their decision to void the marriage based upon <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
Similarly, in our case, we have no signs that the <i>Nitva</i> exhibited BPD prior to the marriage. The question is whether there existed any precursors which would indicate that subsequently BBD would rear its head?
The threshold issue is whether the panel can trust the findings of a health care professional. A cursory review of the Talmud will show that medical opinions have been factored into consideration prior to arriving at a <i>psak</i>. Whether a study of each passage would support our conclusion may be subject to debate.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Niddah</i> 22b</i> But clearly there are passages that invoke reliance upon a physician’s assessment that a patient has a certain sickness prior to issuing a decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 72b; <i>Kiddushin</i> 73b-74a; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 75a.<br>On one hand, one may rely upon a physician’s visual assessment that a patient has a particular disease. On the other hand, one may not rely upon a doctor’s opinion which is based upon conjecture and <i>omaid ha’da’at</i>, assessment. See <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, vol. 2, <i>YD</i> 173; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA YD</i> 187:30; <i>PDR</i> 1:128,135-136, 3:248,5:346,351.</i> The common denominator of the various Talmudic passages is that we are dealing with the trustworthiness of a physician.
Despite the fact that the Talmud focuses upon the credibility of a doctor’s findings, it is clear from studying the <i>Poskim’s</i> writings that the guidelines for ascertaining whether one may rely upon a physician’s determination has been equally extended to encompass the assessments of health care professionals such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. For example, there are numerous rulings that have been based upon the findings of the aforementioned professionals concerning the determination of whether a particular individual is <i>halakhically</i> a <i>shoteh</i> (mentally dysfunctional as per <i>halakhic</i> criteria) in dealing with matters of Even ha-Ezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak, EH</i> 1:5; <i>Teshuvot Parshat Mordekhai</i> 26; <i>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai, EH</i> 80; <i>Teshuvot Hayyim shel Shalom</i> 2:19; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 2–3; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai</i> 1:384; <i>PDR</i> 3:353, 360.<br>Implicit in the <i>beit din’s</i> acceptability of these psychological findings is that it is based upon a professional assessment (see supra n. 32). For accepting such evidence in medical matters, see aforementioned authorities as well as R. Herzog, <i>Teshuvot Pesakim u-Ketavim</i> <i>EH</i> 105.</i>
That being said, whatever the parameters of defining the contours of the reliability of the findings of a physician ought to be applied to the assessments of other health care professionals. One of the issues is whether one may trust a physician’s determination when addressing matters of <i>issurei de-oraita</i> (matters of biblical prohibitions) or only <i>issurei de-rabbanan</i> (rabbinical prohibitions)? Clearly, in our scenario, for those <i>Poskim</i> who reject the employment of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage results in the need for a <i>get</i> on a rabbinic level, otherwise known as a <i>get le-humra</i> (the requirement of a <i>get</i> as a precautionary measure). As such, we are dealing with a rabbinic prohibition. Consequently, notwithstanding certain authorities who reject any reliance upon a physician’s (and by extension a psychologist’s) findings, <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See authorities cited by <i>Teshuvot Moshe ha-Ish</i> 29; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, YD</i> 187:30 in the name of <i>Noda be-Yehudah</i> and <i>Hatam Sofer</i>.</i> in instances where there are “<i>raglayim la-davar</i>” (there is credible evidence supporting the psychologist’s determination), there is rabbinic consensus that we trust his conclusions in matters of <i>issurei de-rabbanan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arukh ha-Shulhan, YD</i> 187:69; <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama</i> <i>YD</i> 49; <i>Teshuvot Beit Shlomo</i> 77; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, YD</i> 175; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:24.</i> On the other hand, for those who sanction the use of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> to void a marriage, we are neither involved with biblical or rabbinic prohibitions and therefore, the professional findings are to be recognized.
That being said, what is the scope of matters in which <i>Halakhah</i> would deem his findings credible? Placing our question in the context of the psychological findings of our case, will the psychologist’s diagnosis that his patient has BPD and in his professional opinion had a childhood history of sexual abuse be accepted? The former assessment is based upon counseling his patient and the latter determination is grounded upon the psychologist’s general knowledge of the professional literature that links a patient who has BPD with prior child experiences of abuse. Whereas the latter findings emerge from an awareness of the conclusions of professional literature, the initial findings are based upon the psychologist’s interaction with his patient. Given that there an intrinsic difference between these two types of findings, it is no surprise to encounter a controversy amongst the <i>Poskim</i> whether one can recognize the trustworthiness of both types of determinations. On one hand, some contend that a doctor’s (and by extension a psychologist’s) trustworthiness is limited to the patients he actually examines. Arriving at a finding regarding a patient based upon accepted psychological studies without actually meeting and interacting with a patient will not suffice.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 1:16; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 4:107; <i>PDR</i> 1:34, 10:224. However, for example, if a wife underwent a hysterectomy and a few years later a doctor checked her and confirmed that the procedure took place, some argue that given the doctor wasn’t present at the time of the procedure, his testimony is invalid. See <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> vol. 4, <i>EH</i> 23. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Shem Aryeh,</i> <i>EH</i> 112; <i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak, EH</i> 2:85.</i> However, others claim we can rely upon their understanding of findings that emerge from the professional literature.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tosafot ha-Rosh, Niddah</i> 22b; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, YD</i> 158,175; <i>Teshuvot Levushei Mordekhai, EH</i> <i>Tinyana</i> 80; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, YD</i> 244; <i>PDR</i> 5: 346,351.</i> Our reliance upon a health care professional opinion is no different than similar opinions of Tur and Shulhan Arukh, who permit enlisting the services of an expert to determine whether a particular sales transaction was executed in error.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, Hoshen Mishpat</i> (hereafter: <i>HM</i>) 232:13; <i>SA, HM</i> 232:16. In fact, as we pointed out in chapter five of our monograph, the model of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> for rescinding a sale is applied towards defining the contours of a <i>mum gadol</i> concerning <i>kiddushei</i> <i>ta’ut</i>. As we know, anything that the majority of the community considers a defect in an item and is neither obvious nor disclosed to the buyer generates the buyer’s right to void the sale. Similarly, numerous contemporary <i>Poskim</i> and <i>dayanim</i> contend that anything viewed by society as a defect that relates to the essence of the marriage and/or its ongoing stability is to be understood as a <i>mum gadol</i> and therefore, under certain prescribed conditions, may free a wife from her marriage without the requisite need for a <i>get</i>. Moreover, the model of <i>mekah ta’ut</i> informs us that the definition of what is to be viewed as a <i>mum gadol</i> is in the hands of an expert. Similarly, defining the major latent defect in marriage may under certain conditions, such as in our scenario, reside in the hands of a health care professional.</i>
As the psychologist testified to us, BPD is characterized by a pervasive pattern of mental instability that is marked by tension, including rage, sorrow, terror, suicidal attempts, and chronic feelings of emptiness and loneliness. The cumulative evidence submitted to us during the <i>Tova’at</i>’s presentation and the testimonies of members of the family, an attorney, and a business partner corroborate the psychologist’s appraisal of the <i>Nitva</i>.
Furthermore, as we mentioned, the psychologist offered to us the following diagnosis of the <i>Nitva</i>. “He is a person with borderline personality disorder (BPD) accompanied by severe depression, is anxiety ridden, and has severe obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic distress disorder.” Moreover, as we mentioned he testified that most individuals who have been diagnosed with BPD have been victims of abuse during their childhood. In the therapist’s approximate words “BPD is almost always as a result of trauma in childhood due to parental abuse”.

Regarding the psychologist’s observation that there is a link between individuals who exhibit BPD and their childhood experiences of abuse, upon our review of the literature we find that most studies indicate that a childhood history of child abuse is associated with BPD patients.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Mary Zanarini, et. al., “Reported Pathological Childhood Experiences Associated with the Development of Borderline Personality Disorder,” 154 <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 1101(1997); Klaus Lieb, et. al., “Borderline Personality Disorder,” 364<i>The Lancet</i> 453, (July 31-Aug. 6, 2004).</i> Lest one challenge our conclusion by invoking the position that a review of the professional literature must be accompanied by actual proof that the BPD patient was a victim of child abuse,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Moshe ha-Ish</i> 28.</i> as we noted, the <i>Nitva</i> admitted that as a child he was physically abused by his father.
Placing our matter in a <i>halakhic</i> context, in pursuance to Ramban’s observation,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hiddushei ha-Ramban, Yevamot</i> 2b.</i> one may conclude that if the signs of mental dysfunction do not manifest itself prior to the marriage, should doctors testify that the disease which appears after the onset of marriage, in actuality was present before the marriage, we can rely upon their professional assessment and if one agrees that invoking <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> is valid, the marriage may be voided. Moreover, some <i>Poskim</i> have implicitly contended that even if a physiological or psychological disorder appeared after the onset of the marriage, we may assume the disease existed prior to the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe EH</i> 4:52; <i>Teshuvot Sha’arei Tzion</i>, vol. 3,<i> EH</i> 4, 15. See supra chapter 5, text accompanying n. 45.</i>
Finally, some <i>Poskim</i> claim we can rely upon their understanding of findings that emerge from the professional literature.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 34.</i> That being said, possibly the fact that professional literature has shown that there is a link between parental abuse and the emergence of BPD in the victim of the abuse as well as demonstrated that BPD occurs in childhood or no later than early adolescence or early adulthood,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying nns. 36–37.</i> we may arrive the conclusion that the malady preexisted the marriage may invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i>.
Had our panel employed the technique of <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> based upon the aforementioned argumentation in general and reliance on the psychologist’s testimony and the findings of the professional literature in particular, our posture would have “chartered a new course” in contemporary times beyond the innovative thinking of the <i>dayanim</i> who approved of the Haifa decision. Whereas, in the Haifa case, professional opinion contends that there were psychological precursors to the emergence of schizophrenia, in our case, prior to marriage Nitva’s behavior does not reveal any symptoms which indicate the subsequent emergence of BPD. At best one may argue that the psychologist’s testimony as well as the findings of the professional literature may impart credence to the <i>Poskim</i> who seem to invoke <i>kiddushei ta’ut</i> regarding certain behavior even though the conduct only manifests itself after the marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying n. 40.</i>
We leave this matter as unresolved and left for further discussion.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>2.</b></span>
In our case, we have been addressing a situation where a husband had certain psychological disorders that the husband failed to disclose prior to the marriage. However, it took many years for the wife to discover his impairment.
However, how would a <i>beit din</i> address a scenario where prior to the marriage the husband communicated to his wife that he had a psychological disorder? Let us assume that nonetheless, in consultation with a health care professional, she understood his impairment and yet she chose to marry him. Subsequently, a few years into the marriage, his psychological condition deteriorated and she exclaimed, “Had I known that his condition would degenerate, I never would have married him.” Whereas prior to the marriage she felt that she would be able to handle the situation, the depth and severity of the disorder now preempts that possibility.
Shulhan Arukh rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 154:5</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A man who is mentally dysfunctional on a daily basis and his wife says, “my father in the time of his stress married me off and I thought I would be able to deal with the matter. Now, I realize that he mentally dysfunctional and I fear that in his rage he will kill me.” [In such a case] we don’t coerce him to give a <i>get</i>.</span>
Despite the fact that the wife’s situation is life-threatening, Shulhan Arukh does not sanction <i>get</i> coercion! Explaining the rationale for this ruling, Gaon of Vilna states,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi’ur ha-Gra, SA, EH</i> 154:17. See also, <i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Minhat Asher</i> 3:85(2).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since she knew we do not say that say “she thought she could handle the situation . . .”</span>
To state it differently, a wife cannot initially claim that she thought she would be capable of dealing with her husband’s condition and now realizes that she can’t deal with him. Therefore, we do not coerce a <i>get</i>.
Nonetheless, many <i>Poskim</i> disagree with Vilna Gaon’s view.
Even though she knew that her prospective husband had skin boils prior to the marriage and she accepted this defect in the form of a <i>tenai</i> (a condition to the marriage), nonetheless the students of Rabbeinu Yonah note,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shittah Mekubezet, Ketuvot</i> 77a</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Except for a husband who has skin boils (<i>mukeh shehin</i>) that she can say “now I am unable to deal with it since daily the sickness becomes more severe” . . .</span>
In other words, her change of heart regarding her ability to live with a husband who was afflicted with boils would trump her <i>tenai</i> and <i>get</i> coercion is permissible.
The question is what is the reason why the persistence of a husband’s skin boils ought to undermine the <i>tenai</i>? Addressing a young woman who was dysfunctional the majority of the time and exhibited moments of sanity only portions of the time prior to the marriage and subsequently became a <i>shoteh</i> (completely mentally dysfunctional), R. Aryeh Leibush observes,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Harei Besamim, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 72. See also, <i>Teshuvot Agudat Eizov</i> 22(21).</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Accepting a <i>mum</i> only is applicable if the condition remains the same. However, the degree of mental dysfunction changes from one period to the next therefore he accepted the situation in her condition that she was prior to the marriage; and the insanities that emerged afterwards he could not tolerate them and therefore one cannot say that he accepted it.</span>
On the basis of this reasoning, R. Feibish lifts the <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom, which prohibits a husband to give a <i>get</i> against his wife’s wishes, and permitted him to remarry.
The notion that the depth and severity of a medical condition may change for the worse is also noted regarding a wife who had epilepsy<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:212</i> and a wife who exhibited a neurological and cerebral disease.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher</i> 2:119</i> As such, should there be a behavioral change, a prior statement that he accepts the situation may be discounted. Consequently, these authorities allowed the husband to remarry without the wife receiving her <i>get</i>.
All the aforesaid rulings deal with grave defects concerning a wife; it is open to debate whether we could apply the same conclusion regarding the flaws of a husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See supra chapter five, text accompanying notes 34–38. R. O. Yosef applied it to a case of <i>halitzah</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 9, <i>EH</i> 38(5). However, regarding marriage, such a situation entails a “<i>safek kiddushin</i>”, a doubt in the <i>kiddushin</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer,</i> vol. 9<i>, EH</i> 36(9). Cf. <i>Teshuvot Dibrot Eliyahu</i> 4:22  who voids the <i>kiddushin</i>.</i> In recent years, two Israeli rabbinical court decisions apply this conclusion dealing with a wife’s defects to a husband’s flaws and stated that such a conclusion is acceptable among the <i>Poskim</i> without citing support to their judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 21: 279, 283; 17 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> 123 (5770).</i>

h) May a beit din obligate a husband to give a get due to "igun"?

<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Plonit v. Ploni</i></span>
<b>The Facts of the Case</b>
In June 2000, Ploni and Plonit were married. In the wake of acts of domestic violence, such as unauthorized touching of private parts of her body by Ploni, Plonit filed a police report on July 23, 2005. After the police took depositions from both parties, the police placed Ploni under arrest for forcible touching. Subsequently, Ploni was arraigned in Kings County Court in Brooklyn, NY. In early August 2005, a temporary order of protection was issued against Ploni directing him to refrain from assault, stalking, harassing, forcibly touching, and other matters against Plonit. This order of protection was extended until November 1, 2006 and became a full order of protection in early 2006.
Though they both remained in the marital home, the couple has led separate lives since the time of the incident reported in July 2005. In mid July 2006, the court directed both parties to leave the marital home by the end of the month.
In August 2007, Plonit summoned her husband to the <i>beit din</i> regarding the matter of the <i>get</i>. Despite being summoned to our <i>beit din</i> three times, Ploni refused to appear and we issued a <i>seruv</i> (an order of contempt) against him. Subsequently, Ploni deposited a <i>get al tenai</i> (a conditional divorce) with another <i>beit din</i>. Prior to giving the <i>get</i>, Ploni wanted Plonit to reimburse him for the monies she had absconded from him. To date, Plonit has neither reimbursed the monies nor received her <i>get</i>.
We convened a <i>yeshivat beit din</i> where the panel listened to Plonit’s concerns during the marriage and her request to address the matter of her receiving a <i>get</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
Whether a husband is obligated to give a <i>get</i> hinges generally on whether there exists an “<i>ilat gerushin</i>” (a ground for the divorce). Without providing a systematic presentation of the various <i>ilot gerushin</i>, the <i>ilot</i> may be subdivided into two categories. One type of an <i>ila</i> relates to the inability of a wife to have conjugal relations with her husband due to the fact that he is afflicted by a contagious and/or dangerous disease or by dint of her revulsion of his body odor which is linked to his occupation.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketuvot</i> 77a; <i>Yevamot</i> 65b.</i> On the other hand, a husband’s inappropriate behavior may serve as a justification for divorce. For example, spousal rape, refusal to cohabitate with his wife, physical and/or emotional abuse of his wife, or refusal to financially support her may serve under certain conditions a claim for obligating a husband to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 154:6; <i>SA, EH</i> 76:1, 154:1; Yerushalmi <i>Gittin</i> 9:9; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:793; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:8; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 154:3.</i>
Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this panel, none of the above claims were advanced by Plonit. Therefore, the question is are there any grounds to obligate the husband to give a <i>get</i>?
Rabbeinu Yeruham rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Meisharim</i>, Helek 8, Netiv 23.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">. . . . when the woman says “I don’t want him and he should give a <i>get</i> and <i>ketubah”</i> and he also says “I don’t want you but I don’t want to give you a divorce”. She is not considered a <i>moredet</i> (a rebellious wife). But we wait twelve months maybe they may rethink (their decision). After a year we force him to divorce her. . . .</span>
In accordance with Rabbeinu Yeruham’s position, we are dealing with a “dead marriage” where both parties mutually separate and each one does not want to remain with the other. The wife has left the husband voluntarily and the husband does not want her. The separation began with the wife’s plea for her <i>get</i> by stating, “I don’t want him and he should give a <i>get</i> and <i>ketubah”</i> and as a direct result of her plea, the husband responds, “I don’t want you but I don’t want to give you a divorce.” In such a case, Rabbeinu Yeruham directs the husband to give a <i>get</i>. Rabbeinu Yeruham does not inquire whether the husband’s statement of “I don’t want you” is a result from his wife’s rebellion or is unrelated to this fact. Since neither party wants to live with the other and twelve months have elapsed, the husband is obligated to give her a <i>get</i> and is prohibited from being “<i>me’agein</i>” his wife by withholding a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See further, Dayan Nahum Prover, “The obligation of a <i>get</i>, return of gifts, a justified claim: regarding a couple who are not interested in each other,” (Hebrew), Kenas ha-Dayanim, Yerushalayim, 5768, 110–116; this writer’s, <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, vol. 2, 200-223.<br>However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, if the husband sincerely wants to reconcile and the wife adamantly refuses, he is not obligated to give a <i>get</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Lev Aryeh</i> 23; <i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 89. Similarly, if the wife sincerely wants to reconcile, generally speaking Israeli <i>battei din</i> will not obligate him to divorce her. See <i>Piskei Din Rabbanyim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 1:161, 7:111-113, 8:321-325, 16:156-159, 19:57-71,20:126,129</i> In accordance with Rabbeinu Yeruham, we are not concerned as to who is responsible for the separation. Once the couple separates and does not want to live with each other, a <i>get</i> is coerced in order to preempt the possibility of “i<i>gun</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 61; <i>PDR</i> 13:264, 273;<i>Teshuvot Ateret Devorah</i>, vol. 1,<i> EH</i> 54, vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 89. Given the legal inability (and thus the <i>halakhic</i> incapacity) to coerce a <i>get</i> in the Diaspora today, under certain conditions in pursuance to Rabbeinu Yeruham’s position we would obligate a <i>get</i>.</i>
Though Rabbeinu Yeruham’s view has not been memorialized in Shulhan Arukh or Rema, numerous contemporary <i>dayanim</i> endorse his position.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 6:13, 8:323, 11:95, 2255, 14:183, 193; 19:57; File No. 7479-21-1, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, November 18, 2007; File no. 587739-6, Haifa Regional Beit Din, July 17, 2012; File 833000/5, Netanya Regional Beit Din, July 22, 2013; File no. 849440/19, Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, July 14, 2015; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 3, <i>EH</i> 18:13 (end).</i> In fact, the late R.

Based upon the cumulative evidence submitted to this <i>beit din</i>, it is our understanding that the couple has been separated for over a year. Notwithstanding Rabbis Hayyim Pelagi and Moshe Feinstein as well as numerous Israeli rabbinical courts who mandate the obligation of giving a <i>get</i> only after a year and half of separation provided that there are no prospects for marital reconciliation,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:112; <i>Iggerot Moshe YD</i> 4:15(2); File no. 523426/2, Haifa Regional Beit Din, September 1, 2014; Appeal(Hagadol), 54/168, November 17,1994, ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan 18,6; File no. 8025/1, Ashdod Regional Beit Din, January 21, 2016; File no. 1006595/1, Tel Aviv-Jaffo Regional Beit Din, January 28, 2016.

Given that it is clear to this panel that Ploni is entitled to be reimbursed for the monies that were stolen from him by Plonit, the question is whether Ploni has a right to withhold giving the <i>get</i> until Plonit reimburses him? Addressing the scenario of a husband who was imprisoned for 15 years and, when individuals begged him to give a <i>get</i>, he agreed to give a <i>get</i> contingent upon the wife’s readiness to return some of his assets to his father. Though the wife agreed to the return, the husband’s father refused to accept them. As such, the issue arose for Rabbi Shalom Schwadron whether the husband’s giving of the <i>get</i> could be conditional upon the return of his assets. His reply was that in these circumstances we cannot coerce him to give a <i>get.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:60. Such a ruling would equally apply in terms of obligating the giving of a <i>get</i>. See File no. 043387083-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, May 19, 2004, <i>ha-Din ve-haDayan, gilyon</i> 7, 7–8; File no. 022290027-21-1, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, February 1, 2005, <i>ha-Din veha-Dayan, gilyon</i> 9, 6–7.</i> Some <i>aharonim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Shivat Tzion</i> 96; <i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 120<i>; Beit Meir, EH</i> 77. There are some authorities who contend that these <i>aharonim</i> do not ascribe to Rabbi Schwadron’s view.</i> and some panels of Israeli <i>dayanim</i> have adopted this approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See supra chapter 2, text accompanying notes 24–29.</i>
Responding to the situation of a childless marriage, (which served as the grounds for the <i>beit din</i> judgment to coerce a <i>get</i>), the husband desirous to remarry stipulated that his wife would receive her <i>get</i> provided that she agrees to refrain from marrying any man who was a member of the Jewish municipal government. Rashba rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 4:256.

<span class="poetry indentAll">Regardless of the circumstances, anyone who is obligated to divorce cannot stipulate that she cannot marry whomever she wants, and anyone who divorces thus (under such a condition), we coerce him to divorce with a definitive divorce (<i>get gamur</i>) without a condition.</span>
Seemingly, one may contend that Rashba’s opposition to imposing a condition prior to a husband’s granting a <i>get</i> is limited to the specific condition of the case which circumscribes a wife’s inability to remarry anyone she desires. But, in fact, Rashba’s words “we coerce him with a definitive divorce” teaches us that, in the wake of a <i>beit din’s</i> decision to coerce (or to obligate) a <i>get</i>, a precondition is proscribed under all circumstances.

i) A wife's refusal to receive a get and "the lifting of the herem of Rabbeinu Gershom"

<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Facts of the Case</b></span>
On December 31, 2004, Shlomo Samuels married Dina Stein. Both were Ashkenazic and in their late forties at the time of their marriage. The couple separated on April 19, 2012. It is our understanding that the couple mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage. Approximately a year ago, Dina allegedly told Shlomo she would only receive a <i>get</i> (a Jewish writ of divorce) upon the final resolution of a financial settlement. As of the date of this decision, Dina has refused to receive a <i>get</i> from Shlomo. Shlomo has told us that he would like to remarry and have children and has requested the <i>beit din</i> to address the matter of the <i>get</i>. We have summoned Dina three times to appear at a hearing. However, on June 21, 2014, she communicated to us that upon the finalization of the settlement she would be prepared to receive a <i>get</i> and refused to attend a <i>beit din</i> hearing. Given her unwillingness to appear at the <i>beit din</i> hearing, on July 19, 2014, we convened a hearing and heard Shlomo’s claim regarding the <i>get</i>. Among Shlomo’s statements at the hearing was that it would take between one to two years to finalize the monetary settlement and he was not prepared to wait such an extended period of time to execute a <i>get</i>. It was already over two years since their separation and he argued it was time to be divorced in accordance to Orthodox Jewish law. In reply to our question how he could corroborate his desire to have children, he submitted invoices attesting to the fact that some of Dina’s eggs were frozen for reproductive purposes and he had some of his sperm frozen during their years of marriage prior to separation. After deliberating on the case, we rendered a <i>psak din</i>, a decision that Shlomo ought to give a <i>get</i> to his wife and Dina ought to receive the <i>get</i> from him. To date, Dina has refused to comply with our <i>beit din</i> decision.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Discussion</b></span>
According to the classical sources of <i>Halakhah</i>, namely the Mishnah and Talmud, whereas a woman is proscribed from marrying more than one man at a time, a man is permitted to be married to more than one woman. Second, whereas a man must consent to divorce his wife, the woman’s consent is not required for her husband to divorce her, and if she is given a <i>get</i> against her will, she is <i>halakhically</i> divorced.
Over the course of time and for varying reasons, during the eleventh century there emerged rabbinic legislation known as <i>takanot</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom. Among the pieces of legislation enacted at the time, there was a prohibition upon a man to marry more than one woman<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rema, Shulhan Arukh</i> (hereafter: <i>SA</i>), <i>Even ha-Ezer</i> (hereafter: <i>EH</i>) 1:10. Among the reasons offered for prohibiting bigamy is either due to the financial difficulty in a husband supporting more than one wife or that a polygamous relationship engenders jealousy and strife. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Padua</i> 14; <i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 1:11 in the name of <i>Mordekhai, Ketuvot</i> 291. For additional reasons for the passing of this legislation, see <i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 1:9; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer, EH</i> 1:2.</i> and that the wife must consent to a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague edition, 4:153, 1022; <i>Kol Bo</i> 116; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 42:1; <i>Teshuvot ha-Maharik, shoresh</i> 101 in the name of Rashba;<i> Rema, SA EH</i> 119:6.</i> The former prohibition guaranteed that a husband could not marry a second wife without dissolving his first marriage. In effect, a husband was now on equal footing with his wife when it came to divorce. Neither could end the marriage unilaterally and neither could remarry without a <i>get</i>. Many <i>Poskim</i> were of the opinion that this legislation was in force until the end of the fifth millennium. <sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashba</i>, supra n. 2; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef, Ketuvot</i> 14; <i>SA, EH</i> 1:10. Some contend that the general prohibition against polygamy was temporary, however the prohibition against a husband giving a <i>get</i> against his wife’s will was forever. See <i>Beit Shmuel SA, EH</i> 116:7; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 119:8 in the name of <i>Beit Shmuel, Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama,</i> EH 83; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 3.</i> Others claim that there was no time limit on its operation.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yam shel Shlomo, Yevamot</i> 6:41; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 124; <i>Teshuvot Maharshah</i> 2:36; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 95.</i> However, even those authorities who argue that the legislation lapsed at the end of the fifth millennium agreed that it became <i>minhag</i> (a customary practice) today to comply with its prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 1:10; <i>Rema</i>, supra n. 1; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yosef, Ketuvot</i> 14; <i>Teshuvot Maharshal</i> 14; <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Yevamot</i> 6:41; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 78; <i>Teshuvot Penei Moshe</i> 2:117; <i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 1:19.<br>In accordance with R. Yehezkel Landau, there is a rabbinic consensus that the proscription against giving a <i>get</i> to one’s wife against her will continues to be in force until today. See <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Kama, EH</i> 1.</i> In other words, the <i>herem</i> (the sanction of excommunication) of Rabbeinu Gershom for failure to comply with the legislation continues to be in force.
This double prohibition outlawing bigamy and forbidding the coercing of a <i>get</i> against a wife’s will may result in a husband being unjustifiably fettered in a situation where he would otherwise not be required by <i>Halakhah</i> to maintain his marital ties and yet he may not divorce her against her will. For example, in our scenario, given the duration of time since the separation and the desire of the husband to remarry, there are grounds to obligate a <i>get</i>. However, in accordance with <i>takanot</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom, he is unable to divorce her against her will.
Given that Dina has chosen to refrain from accepting a <i>get</i>, we must address whether there are grounds for a <i>“heter</i>” (release) from this prohibition against bigamy which would permit Shlomo to remarry by depositing a <i>get</i> in a <i>beit din</i>. That being said, that does not mean that the first wife is divorced, but that the husband is granted permission to contract an additional marriage. Should such a <i>heter</i> be given based upon an exhaustive examination of the facts, the husband is obligated to deposit a <i>get</i> (<i>hashlashat ha-get</i>) and the value of the <i>ketubah</i> (assuming the wife is entitled to receive it)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 119; <i>Beit Shmuel</i> <i>SA EH</i> 1 23; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 119:12; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad. locum. 7; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach</i> <i>Tzedek</i> 67. Cf. <i>Teshuvot R.

Should a husband be financially incapable to remit its value, it is a matter of debate whether he can divorce his wife. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:1254; <i>Beit Yosef, Tur Bedek ha-Bayit</i> <i>EH</i> 119; <i>Rema SA EH</i> 119:6 in the name of Rivash and Rosh; <i>R.

In light of the circumstances of our case, can a husband receive a <i>heter</i> from the prohibition of bigamy via a <i>hashlashat ha-get</i> and deposit of the value of the <i>ketubah</i> and thus receive permission to remarry? Is the legislation applicable in all situations or are there cases where the legislation is inapplicable and therefore a husband may marry a second wife? Assuming there are situations where the legislation is inapplicable, may a <i>beit din</i> allow him to remarry without a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>(permission from 100 rabbis from three different countries and three different communities)?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Under appropriate circumstances and a comprehensive investigation of the facts, 100 rabbis may give to the husband a “<i>heter</i>” (a release) from the prohibition of bigamy. This <i>heter</i> does not mean that the first wife is divorced but that the husband is granted permission to contract an additional marriage. For credentials required of these 100 rabbis, <i>see Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 1:16.</i>
The question is whether the fact that <i>a wife refuses to appear</i> in a <i>beit din</i> has ramifications for the applicability of Rabbeinu Gershom’s rabbinic legislation.
The Sanzer Rov and R. Yehoshua Heschel rule if <i>a wife refused to comply with a beit din’s psak din</i> to accept a <i>get</i>, Rabbeinu Gershom’s legislation is inapplicable under such circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim, EH</i> 51; <i>Teshuvot Sefer Yehoshua,</i> <i>EH</i> 98 (end).</i> As such, despite the wife’s protestations, a <i>get</i> may be deposited by a husband in a <i>beit din</i> and the husband is free to remarry.
Other <i>Poskim</i> (decisors of <i>Halakhah</i>) have expanded this <i>heter</i> (permission), which deals with a wife who refuses to comply with a <i>beit din</i> judgment, to the situation of <i>a wife who refuses to appear in beit din</i>. R. Teitelbaum testified that his brother-in-law R. Ashkenazi testified that the author of Havot Da’at allowed a husband to remarry in such a situation with the approval of other scholars of the generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Tzedek</i> 40</i> Others, including but not limited to Rabbis Akiva Eiger, Ya’akov of Lisa, and Ya’akov Katz agree with this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvat R. Akiva Eiger, Mahadura Tinyana</i> 82; <i>Teshuvot Nahalat Ya’akov</i> 2:5; <i>Teshuvot ve-Shev Ya’akov</i>, vol. 2 <i>EH</i> 42.</i> As such, despite the wife’s protestations, a <i>get</i> may be deposited in a <i>beit din</i> and the husband is free to remarry.

Despite the fact that we sent out three <i>hazmanot</i> (summonses) to appear in <i>beit din</i>, she refused to appear. Failure to appear in a <i>beit din</i> labels her as a “<i>mesarevet le-din</i>” (one who refuses to appear in <i>beit din</i>) and may result in a communal sanction known as “<i>niddui</i>” (excommunication).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, HM</i> 11:1; <i>Netivot ha-Mishpat</i> ad locum, <i>hiddushin</i> 9.</i> Given that Dina is a <i>mesarevet le-din</i>, there are grounds for divorce based on her being (or being akin to) “<i>overet al da’at yehudit</i>” (lit. transgressing the religion of Judaism). Conventionally, if a wife exhibits continued immodesty or slights her husband by cursing or assaulting him and/or behaves in a fashion that undermines family stability in front of their children, there would be grounds to label her as an “<i>overet al da’at yehudit</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SA, EH</i> 116:4, <i>Rema</i>, ad locum; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum, 1, 9–16; <i>Helkat Mehokeik</i>, ad locum, 9–15.</i> Consequently, there are <i>Poskim</i> who argue that as an <i>overet al da’at yehudit,</i> a <i>get</i> may be deposited in a <i>beit din</i> despite the wife’s protestations and the husband is free to remarry without the need to receive a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Avnei Tzedek</i> 40; <i>Teshuvot R.

Hayyim Halberstam (the Sanzer Rov) contends that failing to appear in a <i>beit din</i> preempts the husband from engaging in having children and therefore directly relates to her husband. And therefore she is an <i>overet al da’at yehudit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Divrei Hayyim,</i> supra n. 10.</i> R. Shmuel Engel expands this notion by claiming that a wife who withholds a <i>get</i> indirectly causes her husband to engage in “<i>hirhurei aveirah</i>” (i.e. thoughts of sin) and therefore she is to be labeled as an <i>overet al da’at yehudit</i> and we may release him from the prohibition of polygamy.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharash, EH</i> 4:56; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yitzhak</i> 16; <i>Teshuvot Tiferet Tzvi</i> 21; <i>Teshuvot Tirosh ve-Yitzhar</i> 83.</i>
Given that we afforded the opportunity for Shlomo to advance his arguments and for Dina to respond to his claims, based upon the evidence submitted, there are grounds to permit the husband to remarry without transgressing the prohibition against polygamy.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Minhat Yehiel</i> 3:84; <i>Teshuvot Teshurat Shai, Mahadura Kama</i> 209; <i>Maharshag</i>, supra n. 16; File no. 18110/1, Tel Aviv- Yaffo Regional Beit Din, July 5, 2011.</i> Implicit in this position is that when a wife is <i>overet al da’at yehudit,</i> one may divorce her against her will and the <i>herem</i> is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 101; <i>Teshuvot Maharil ha-Hadashot</i> 201; <i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Padua</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 3:126; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 115:4.</i>
Moreover, based upon the foregoing position that a wife who refuses to resolve a matter in <i>beit din</i> may serve as a reason for allowing a husband to remarry without his wife receiving the <i>get</i>, it is not unsurprising to find <i>Poskim</i> who have expanded a husband’s release from the prohibition of bigamy to the situation of a wife who refuses to accept the judgment of a <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot</i> <i>Terumat ha-Deshen</i> 242; <i>Divrei Hayyim</i>, supra n.18; <i>Teshuvot Sefer Yehoshua EH</i> 98 (end); File no. 056015019-12-1, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, May 10, 2010, culled from <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> 26:10</i> In our scenario, we obligated Dina to receive the <i>get</i> but she has chosen to refrain from complying with our judgment.
Furthermore, in a situation where the husband has yet to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of having children, R. Ovadiah Yosef argues this is an additional reason to allow him to remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 3(2)</i> In fact, the Tzemach Tzedek (the third Lubavitcher Rebbe) states that most authorities hold that in a situation of fulfilling a <i>mitzvah</i>, Rabbi Gershom’s legislation is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek, EH</i> 6.</i> As such, despite the wife’s protestations, a <i>get</i> may be deposited by a husband in a <i>beit din</i> and a husband is free to remarry. Whether a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> is required in this situation prior to the deposit of the <i>get</i> is equally subject to controversy.
In our case, Shlomo who presently is 50 years old, wants to remarry and sire a child, and does not want to wait any longer, and therefore he requests relief from our <i>beit din</i>. Should a Jew marry a Jewess and have no children for ten years, he is still required to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of siring children and he ought to divorce her and marry another woman who is capable of having a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur, EH</i> 154</i> Some decisors, Ashkenazic and Sephardic alike, argue that the <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom is inapplicable in this situation.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 3:446; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:94; <i>Teshuvot Maharam of Padua</i> 13, 14, 19; <i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur EH</i> 1:10; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 1:10.</i> Even if there they were childless before the lapse of ten years, the husband would be released from the <i>herem</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Zekhut Avot</i> 82 (120); <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i> 4:9; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 40.</i> Furthermore, in accordance with R. Schneersohn, most <i>Poskim</i> contend that the <i>herem</i> is inapplicable in a case where there is a delay in fulfillment of a <i>mitzvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzemah Tzedek,</i> supra n. 24</i> Finally, though there are authorities who argue that a husband may be released from the <i>herem</i> in a case of <i>igun</i> when he is young and therefore may be subject to thoughts of sin which may lead to engaging in illicit affairs,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Rabbis Yehezkel Landau and Malkiel Tennenbaum raise serious doubts that this reason would be grounds for releasing the husband from the <i>herem</i> (see <i>Teshuvot Noda be-Yehudah, Mahadura Tinyana, EH</i> 6, <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel</i> 3:144), numerous <i>Poskim</i> contend that this reason serves as a valid ground for a release from the <i>herem</i>. See <i>Teshuvot Maharam Alshakar</i> 95; <i>Teshuvot She’eirit Yosef, EH</i> 2; <i>Teshuvot Emek ha-Teshuvah</i> 2:96 in the name of <i>Torat Hessed</i> and <i>Maharsham</i>; 3:90; <i>Sdei Hemed, Ishut</i> 2:1; <i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel</i> 2:7; <i>Teshuvot Shevet ha-Levi</i> 5:190.</i> in our scenario we are dealing with an older man who is not Torah-observant and has been separated from his wife for two years already and may continue to be separated for another year or two until the outstanding financial matter is resolved, those authorities may concur that he should be equally released from the <i>herem</i>!
Another basis for the inapplicability of the prohibition against polygamy is that we are dealing with an <i>igun</i> situation. As we mentioned in our first <i>psak din</i>, in a situation where there exists no prospects for marital reconciliation and a couple have been separated for at least a year<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Meisharim, netiv</i> 23, <i>helek</i> 8; <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, vol. 2, 203-208; supra Chapter 8(h).</i> (some argue eighteen months),<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hayyim ve-Shalom</i> 2:112; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>YD</i> 4:15(2); <i>Rabbinic Authority</i>, vol. 2, 206 at n. 10; supra Chapter 8(h).</i> a <i>get</i> should be given by the husband and received by the wife. Our conclusion is based upon a ruling emerging from a fourteenth-century Sephardic case. A wife was a <i>moredet</i> (she refused to engage in conjugal relations with her husband) for an extended period of time and a <i>beit din</i> attempted to broker <i>shalom bayit</i>. However, their efforts to promote domestic tranquility were unsuccessful and therefore the panel mandated that a <i>get</i> be given. Though the husband was ready and willing to give a <i>get</i> to his wife, his spouse was unwilling to receive the <i>get</i>. Relying upon the well-known position of Ra’avan concerning a rebellious wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Ra’avan</i>, folio 261c</i> Rabbis Hayyim ben Yona, Yisrael ben Yoel Zuslin, and Eliezer ben Yitzhak rule that in a situation of <i>igun</i> the prohibition against bigamy is inapplicable.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam of Rothenberg</i>, Prague ed. 1021.</i> During the same century, the teacher of Rabbi Hayyim ben Yona issues a <i>psak</i> with the approval of the Torah scholars of Prague that a husband could divorce his wife against her will when she was <i>me’agein</i> him.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maharam</i>, supra n. 33.</i> Though in the fifteenth century Maharil rejects their position,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharil ha-Hadashot</i> 201</i> R. Yisrael Kutna, R. Shmuel de Medina, and an Israeli rabbinical court rely upon the earlier rulings of Ravan and others, stating that in a case of <i>igun</i> a husband can divorce her against her will and there is no requirement of receiving a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yeshuot Malko, EH</i> 7; <i>Teshuvot Maharashdam, EH</i> 120; <i>Piskei Din Rabbanayim</i> (hereafter: <i>PDR</i>) 7:111.</i>
In short, there are four grounds for releasing Shlomo from the <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom: his desire to have a child, Dina’s recalcitrance in appearing for a hearing, failure to comply with our <i>beit din</i> decision, and the fact that she is <i>me’agein</i> him.
Whether we can issue a <i>heter ni’ssuin</i> (permission to remarry) without the permission of 100 rabbis from three different countries is contingent upon how one understands the scope of the rabbinic legislation of Rabbeinu Gershom. One approach espoused by Bah and endorsed by R. Moses Issereles is the following:<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bah, Tur, EH</i> 1; <i>Rema</i>, supra n. 1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">What is found in the words of <i>Aharonim</i> (later authorities –AYW) that will agree with a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> and this is the <i>mesorah</i> they received from the <i>beit din</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom . . . when a matter arises between a husband and wife that would be improper to apply the <i>herem</i>, permission ought to be given with the agreement of 100 rabbis in order that it would not be easy in the eyes of future generations to allow for him to marry another woman. Therefore the practice has been by our rabbis to allow him to marry another woman when his wife has become mentally dysfunctional with the concurrence of 100 rabbis and this has been done a few times.</span>
And in pursuance to Ahiezer, under all circumstances the <i>minhag</i> is that we need a <i>heter rabbanim</i> prior to permitting a husband to remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ahiezer</i> 1:10.</i> Rabbis Moshe Sofer, Shalom Schwadron, and others require a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> where a wife refuses to appear in <i>beit din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer, EH</i> 2:167; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 7:193, <i>She’eirit Yosef</i>, supra n. 29; <i>Emek ha-Teshuvah</i>, supra n. 29.</i> When dealing with a <i>mitzvah</i>, some require a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 1:7; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad.locum, 8; <i>Teshuvot Mishkenot Ya’akov</i> 1.</i> Consequently, in the case of a childless marriage, Maharash Engel mandates a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> prior to permitting a husband to remarry where the wife refuses to accept a <i>get</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharash</i> 4:57</i>
On the other hand, other <i>Poskim</i> claim that the scope of the rabbinic legislation is much narrower. In the words of R. Meir of Padua,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharam mi-Padua</i>, supra n. 1.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even if they (the dayyanim –AYW) have a clear reason they required 100 men from three countries . . .

Nonetheless, where we can determine that in a particular place Rabbeinu Gershom did not legislate ever . . . the authority and permission is given to us”</span>
Consequently, where the wife is at fault one does not requires a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot ve-Shev Ya’akov</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 1.</i> In accordance with this view, Rabbeinu Gershom does not proscribe polygamy in situations where a wife was <i>me’agein</i> her husband, a recalcitrant wife who would neither attend a <i>beit din</i> hearing nor comply with a <i>psak</i> of <i>beit din</i>, and/or where there was a childless marriage. Under such circumstances, a <i>beit din</i> is empowered to allow a husband to marry a second woman provided there was <i>hashlashat ha-get</i> and the value of the <i>ketubah</i> was deposited at a recognized <i>beit din</i>. Based upon our foregoing presentation of the various grounds for allowing a <i>heter nissuin</i>, it is clear that those authorities have explicitly or implicitly adopted the latter approach regarding the scope of Rabbeinu Gershom’s <i>takanah</i>. As such, being <i>me’agein</i> a husband, failure to attend a <i>beit din</i> hearing, failure to abide by a <i>beit din</i> judgment, and a childless marriage are grounds for a <i>heter nissuin</i> without a requisite need for the issuance of a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>. Addressing the scenario of an Ashkenazic husband whose wife refused to receive a <i>get</i>, who was recalcitrant concerning appearing in a <i>beit din</i>, and who did not have a child, the late Chief Rabbi R. O. Yosef, relying upon numerous Ashkenazic decisors, contend that he would deposit a <i>get</i> in a <i>beit din</i> accompanied by the value of the <i>ketubah</i> and the husband was free to marry without a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 3.</i> More recently, a Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din opine that a husband would receive a <i>heter nissuin</i> (without the need to execute a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>) in a case where the wife refuses to receive a <i>get</i> and is <i>me’agein</i> her husband while awaiting the resolution of whether she is entitled to a <i>ketubah</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Tel Aviv-Yaffo Regional Beit Din, supra n. 20</i> Based upon these two contemporary rulings, the support of numerous <i>aharonim</i>, and the additional ground that Dina refused to comply with our <i>psak din</i>, we rule that Shlomo may remarry without a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> by executing a <i>hashlashat ha-get</i>, i.e. depositing of a <i>get</i> in <i>beit din</i>.
To buttress our ruling, admittedly there are <i>Poskim</i> who clearly will mandate that a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i> is either required prior to allowing a husband to remarry when his wife refuses to appear in <i>beit din</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i> 2:167; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 5:48, 7:193.</i> or when dealing with a childless marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharam mi-Padua</i> 13; <i>Helkat Mehokeik, SA, EH</i> 119:7; <i>Beit Shmuel</i>, ad locum, 8.</i> Given that there is a debate whether a <i>heter</i> is mandated in certain situations, there emerges a <i>sefek sfeika</i> (a double doubt). Firstly, since according to most authorities we are dealing with rabbinic legislation, we invoke the rule <i>kol sfeika de-rabbanan le’kula</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beitzah</i> 3b</i> (a matter of doubt that relates to a rabbinic issue such as <i>herem</i> of Rabbeinu Gershom is resolved according to the lenient opinion).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Darkhei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 1:10; <i>Teshuvot Hakham Tzvi</i> 117; <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> vol. 2, <i>EH</i> 14, 44; <i>Teshuvot Maharam Schick, EH</i> 4; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 1:21.</i> And even if you argue that the stringent opinion is to be determinative due to the fact that some contend that a violation of this <i>herem</i> is akin to transgressing a <i>de-oraita</i> (a biblical matter),<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Maharik, shoresh</i> 184; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 2:16</i> there remains the <i>safek</i> that this <i>herem</i> was only in force until <i>sof elef hahamishi</i> (i.e. the year 1240).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beit Yosef, Tur, EH</i> 1; <i>Darkei Moshe, Tur, EH</i> 1:10; <i>SA, EH</i> 1:10.</i> Given the <i>safek sfeika</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak, EH</i> 4:3; <i>Rema, SA, EH</i> 118:6; <i>Beit Shmuel, SA, EH</i> 1:21; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i> vol. 7, <i>EH</i> 2 (7).</i> we rely on the lenient opinions, which would release the husband from the prohibition of bigamy.
Given that there is an outstanding financial matter between the couple, the question is whether a wife is entitled to withhold a <i>get</i> until the issue is resolved. To state it differently, even if the wife is <i>me’agein</i> her husband, can this situation continue until all financial matters have been resolved between the couple? In accordance with at least three Israeli rabbinical court decisions, the question is which party is responsible for the divorce. If the dissolution of the marriage is due to the fact that the husband acted improperly and left the marriage, then the wife may refuse to receive the <i>get</i> prior to resolving her financial claim(s). On the other hand, should the wife be liable for the marital breakdown then she is obligated to receive the <i>get</i> unconditionally and the pending financial issue(s) ought to be resolved after the <i>get</i> has been executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PDR</i> 13:264, 274; File no. 7787/57, Beit Din ha-Rabbani ha-Gadol, December 26, 1999; File no. 289160/5, Netanya Regional Beit Din, September 19, 2012.</i>
However, implicitly following Pithei Teshuvah’s view and foreshadowing an Israeli <i>psak din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pithei Teshuvah, SA, EH</i> 1:17 in the name of <i>Teshuvot Minhat Ani</i>; File no. 73266/15, Jerusalem Regional Beit Din, March 17, 2013.</i> as we mentioned, R. Moshe Feinstein rules,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i> <i>Yoreh De’ah</i> 4:15</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In the matter of a husband and wife who have for many years have not experienced marital tranquility, and they have been residing in separate homes for one-and-a-half years already . . . and we have a signed <i>beit din</i> statement that marital reconciliation is impossible, therefore according to <i>Halakhah</i> they are obligated to divorce. And neither party has permission to be <i>me’again</i> (chain) his partner, neither the husband of the wife nor the wife of the husband, by delaying [the <i>get</i>] due to a monetary claim.</span>
In other words, in pursuance to R. Feinstein’s position, neither party can be <i>me’agein</i> his/her spouse regardless of who is responsible for the marital dissolution due to an outstanding monetary matter.
Since Dina never appeared in front of this panel and therefore we were unable to ascertain who was responsible for the breakdown, we aren’t required to decide whether we would follow the view of R. Feinstein or the Israeli <i>beit din</i> rulings. As such, in light of the aforementioned authorities, in a situation where a wife is <i>me’agein</i> her husband there are grounds for a husband to remarry without requiring a <i>heter me’ah rabbanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See supra text accompanying notes 32, 33, 34, and 36.

Therefore, Shlomo is not obligated to pay the value of the <i>ketubah</i>.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><b>Decision</b></span>
Shlomo is directed to personally or via the appointment of a <i>shaliah</i> (an agent)<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Notwithstanding R. Yehezekel Landau who prohibited a husband to appoint an agent to give a<i> get</i> in a situation of delivering a <i>get</i> against a wife’s will, numerous<i> Poskim</i> sanction his appointment.
