Siman 1




And that which [Ramban] said that the making of the ark should also be brought into the count [of the commandments] - it appears to me [that the reason it is not counted] is because it is not practiced for [all] the generations. For we will never need to make another, since the one Betzalel made exists for [all] the generations, and it did not get lost from the world, as it is hidden away. Also when it returns to us, it will never be lost. And if so, there is no scenario in the world in which we would make another ark. And [regarding] that which the author of the Zohar HaRakiya said, in Positive Commandment 120, that one can bring a proof that is practiced for [all] the generations from that which they said as a question (rhetorically) in Menachot (28b) in Chapter 3, "If that is so, that which is written (Deuteronomy 10:1), 'Make for you an Ark of wood,' should also be for you, but not for all generations" - it appears to me that it is not for that reason. As the explanation of that which it said, "'for you,' but not for all generations," is not to say, "Is this commandment not practiced for [all] the generations?" Rather its explanation is, "And is the ark that was made in the days of Moshe fitting to be used [only] by Moshe and not by [all] the generations?" As behold, this is the challenge that they challenged about that which it said there, "The Sages taught, 'All of the vessels that Moses fashioned were fit for his generation and were fit for [all] the generations. Yet the trumpets that Moses fashioned were fit for his generation but were unfit for [all] the generations': What is the reason [the trumpets were unfit]? If we say because the verse states (Numbers 10:2), 'Make for you,' for you, but not for [all] the generations; if that is so, that which is written, 'Make for you an Ark of wood,' should also be, for you, but not for [all] the generations!"
