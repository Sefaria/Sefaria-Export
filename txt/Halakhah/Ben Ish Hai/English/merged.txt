Introduction

Praised be the Creator and Glorified be the Designer, Who has caused us to inherit a hidden and precious thing of desire, wonderful wisdom, "For the Jews there was Light;"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ester 8:16</i> light is Torah, to labor in it and to heed to it.
Rabbi Shimon gave this introduction, saying (Zohar Vol. 3, daf 166b): "<i>Ayelet ahavim ve'ya'alat chen, dadeiha yeravukha bekhol 'et; be'ahavatah tishgeh tamid</i>/A lovely ewe and a graceful she-ibex, let her teats satisfy you at all times; with her love be involved (to the [partial] neglect of other matters) always. (Prov. 5:19)" Oraita! Oraita! (Torah! Torah!) the light of all the worlds! How many seas and rivers and wells and springs spread out from you to in all directions! From you is everything, by you the upper and lower [worlds] are sustained. His upper light goes out from you. Oraita! Oraita! what shall I say of you, <i>ayelet ahavim ve'ya`alat chen</i>, above and below are your mercies, whoever merits to acquire from you in the proper fashion. Oraita! Oraita! The delights of those who master you! Who can reveal and tell your secret and hidden things!
Master of Universe, let it be Your will to give strength and power to me and to all Yisrael, and let us enter in without shame before you and before the <i>Matronita `Ila'ah</i> (Higher Divine Presence), of which it is said, "<i>em-habanim smechah</i>/as joyful as a mother of children"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 113</i>. And let us not be in shame before the <i>Barta DiMalka</i> (Lower Divine Presence), of which it is said, "<i>kol kevudah bat melekh penimah</i>/all honor [shall be] for the King's daughter (His entourage) who is within (i.e. humble)," and of which it is said, "<i>Rabot banot `asu chayil, ve'at `alit `al kulanah</i>/Many women have acquired riches, but you surpass them all" (Prov. 31).
And being that the holy way of the genius who wrote <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> is very pleasant to me, who opened the preface with <i>Birkot Hatorah</i>/Blessings recited before learning Torah, I too, the humble one, shall also proceed in this straight way, and give thanks first in reciting the Birkot Hatorah:
Blessed are You Hashem, Our God King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us regarding <i>divrei</i>/words/matters of Torah. Now please make sweet, Hashem our God, the dirvei of Your Torah in our mouths, and in the mouths of Your people Yisrael. And be we and our offspring and the offspring of our offspring, all us us knowers of Your name and learning Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You Hashem, Who teaches Torah to His people Yisrael.
Blessed are You Hashem, our God King of the Universe, Who has chosen us from all the nations, and given us His Torah. Blessed are You Hashem, Who gives the Torah.
<i>Ki Hashem yiten chokhmah, mipiv da`at utevunah</i>/For Hashem gives wisdom; out of His mouth [comes] knowledge and understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 2:6</i> <i>Gal einai ve'abitah nifle'ot mitorarekha</i>/Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i> <i>Tov atah umeitiv ; lamdeini chukeikha</i>/Good and benevolent are You; teach me Your statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i> <i>Baruch atah Adonai, lamdeini chukeikha</i>/Blessed are You Hashem; teach me Your statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i>
Oraita Oraita! how beloved are your words, what a tree having roots, and having bark, and having brains, and having branches, and having foliage, and having flowers, and having buds; and also your words have simple meanings of the scripture, comparative meanings, clues, which hint wisdom, gematrias, hidden hints. Concealed hints, one on another, <i>kasher</i> (valid) and <i>pasul</i> (invalid), <i>tameh</i> (impure) and <i>tahor</i> (pure), <i>assur</i> (forbidden) and <i>mutar</i> (permitted), <i>chayav</i> (obligated) and <i>zakai</i> (entitled), and from thenceforth spread out branches to all sides, wide as the sea; you have no end or finish.
Oraita Oraita! This love and glow of flame of the heart for you! May it be the [Divine] will that you be engraved in on our hearts returning to you holy Torah. And your glory upon us holy Torah, your knowledge on us holy Torah, and our minds on you holy Torah, be not lifted from you, and do not part from us, not in this world and not in the coming world.
Blessed is our God who has created us for His glory, and separated us from those who err, and given us the Torah of truth, and planted eternal life among us, "<i>Mah ashiv laShem kol tagmuluhi `alai</i>/How can I return to Hashem all his benevolences toward me?"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 116</i>, Who has permitted me in His great mercies and great compassions, to serve in the "courtyards of the Temple of Hashem," in the place that our holy forefathers served, <i>nishmatam eden</i>/their souls in Paradise, in the permanent dwelling each and every Shabbat, when the children of Yisrael assemble there, to expound to them holy scriptures, which they read on their Shabbatot each parashah in its time, as its arrangement and order is given; <i>zot chuqat hatorah</i>/This is the statute of the Torah. Also including <i>drashahs</i> of the Haftarah readings, though my original [work] was review of the Torah, and as Hashem Yitbarakh graced me in His great compassion, to some produce <i>chidushim</i>/novel words by the way of <i>peshat</i> [basic explanation of the scripture] or <i>derash</i> [mystical explanation] or the <b>crown</b> of <i>remez</i>, I recorded the chidushim for reminder. And already in the year 5624 I printed from my chidushim with the help of Heaven a book small in quantity, on the Pentateuch, and I named it <i>Aderet Eliyahu</i> (the cape of Eliyahu<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 2</i>), and behold, from that time until now, praise to El Yitbarakh, the chidushei Torah increased from what Hashem bestowed to me, and because we have heard an admonition from the mouth of scribes and from the mouth of <i>sefarim</i>/holy books that a man is obligated to print his sefarim in his lifetime, I awakened myself to bring to the printhouse chidushei Torah in the way of drash and remez on the Pentateuch, because I reasoned that it is proper to advance this before other chidushei Torah, because it is food for every man, and it is a staple for every soul, and benefits the masses a bit more, but because the printing expenses were great, and I have not the financial means, I was forced to bring to print at this time only a little of my produce, one quarter of what I have by the grace of `El Eylon, and if Hashem Yitbarakh desires He will help me bring what remains with me in a separate book, because that which remains has a great quantity, and furthermore has also the chidushei Torah that I darshened on the verses of the Haftarot of the whole year; I have not brought one of the here, because due to their great quantity they are fit to be a large sefer by themselves, if Hashem helps.
Nonetheless I interlaced settled <i>halakhot</i>/laws of conduct throughout this collection, from all kinds of halakhot that are brought in the Shulchan Arukh "Orach Chayim" and "Yoreh De`ah," because I was already accustomed to publicly lecture also one these each and every Shabbat, because I immersed myself in the sefarim and enlightened my eyes with the words of our Sages of blessed memory, and I knew that the ancient way of our Rabbis the Rishonim [or "our early Rabbis"] z"l who would lecture to the people every Shabbat, that they would not make a constant [study] only on <i>aggada</i>/homily in the Midrashim and <i>peshatim</i>, but rather they also lectured them halakhot to let them know the statutes of God and His Torahs/instructions, to know the way they should go, and the things they should do, because likewise we find in the Gemara in Sanhedrin (daf 38), "Said Rabbi Yochanan, 'When Rabbi Meir would lecture on his piece, he would say one-third legal decisions, one-third aggada, one-third parables,'" see there. And likewise we find in our Rabbis z"l in Mekhilta, they bring the words of Rabbeinu Maharam Alshich z"l, at the beginning of <i>parashat</i>/the Torah portion Vayakhel, that Moshe Rabbeinu the servant of Hashem taught the children of Yisrael that they should gather on Shabbatot, to lecture to them the laws of Shabbat and His Torahs, see there. And likewise they said the same in the Gemara, "Moshe ordained for Yisrael, to teach the laws of Pesach at Pesach [time], laws of Atzeret at Atzeret [time], laws of the [Sukkot] Festival at Sukkot [time], and such is the report from several devotees in the Gemara, that their custom was to teach halakhot each and every Shabbat, and truthfully logical reasoning also requires this, to teach halakhot to the people, to know what Yisrael should do in the mitzvot of Hashem, and see Pri Chadash in Yoreh De`ah hilkhot Tol`ayim [laws regarding prohibition of eating worms], siman 84, that he wrote, verbatim, "And it is necessary to inspire and teach these matters to the people more that teaching them peshatim," end of quote.
Actually it is a known thing that to lecture on halakhot alone, the heart of the masses is not drawn after this, rather it is necessary to make the derash the root and most of it words of agadda and <i>mussar</i>/ethical teaching, and the lecturer should also mention in the middle the decided halakhot, through the tie that that he ties in the lecture that he says on the text, in order to draw the hearts of the people to these things in <i>chokhmah</i>/wisdom and <i>da`at</i>/knowledge, and this was the intention of our master the Tanna Rabbi Meir a"h, who wuold lecture a third in halakhot, a third in aggadot and a third in <i>mashalim</i>/allegories in order to draw the heart of the masses to hear the halakhot via two thirds of aggada and mashalim, and it seems to me the mashalim were in the manner of mussar, and so will you find in Shabbat daf 30: The question was asked of Rabbi Tanchum, "What does it mean to extinguish a lamp for a sick person on Shabbat?" And he opened with this introduction and said first some long words of aggada, and afterwards at the end of his words he gave them a short answer on the legal question mentioned, and Rashi z"l explains there, so were they accustomed to give an introduction with aggada first, in order to draw the hearts of the audience to hear the halakhah.
And likewise we find in the Gemara of Sotah daf 40: Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba happened uppon that place. Rabbi Chiya bar Abba spoke about halakhic decisions, and Rabbi Abbahu told aggada. Everybody abandoned Rabbi Chiya bar Abba, and came before Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Chiya was downcast. Rabbi Abahu said to him, "I will tell you a parable what this is like. To two men who come to a city, one selling gems and jewels, and one selling tinsel. Who do they jump to? Not to the one who sells tinsel!" See there. Hence the world chases after homiletics and peshatim, therefore you must proceed wisely according to the minds of people, namely to make most of the lecture in aggada and explanation of the scripture, and the lesser part words of halakhah absorbed into it in the middle or in the end, and this is the proper way.
Therefore I, the young one, after the year 5630, it came to my heart to mention in the lecture on the parashah that I am publicly speaking each Shabbat, some halakhot from matters mentioned in the Orach Chayim and Yoreh De`ah, and I would tie the beginnings of the halakhot with the lecture on the Torah, and after the halakhot I would end the lecture with verses of the Haftarah. However it was not possible to finish all the halakhot that I decided to teach on every Shabbat in one year, rather they needed a length of two years, as they are organized in the eyes of the reader in the second part of this book, and every two years they are to be repeated, and therefore I made the halakhot with their ties in separate parts, Part One and Part Two, and brought them to the printhouse to join them with the lectures that are in this book, so that the eyes of the Tzadikim should see straight [ways]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 17:2</i>, and also in the halakhot I mentioned I omitted for now several halakhot from the first part and the second part, due to the expense of printing, and if Hashem helps, in the halakhot part too there will be a later edition, and they will come in a separate book.
And behold since I named my book on Talmud discourses <b>" Ben Yehoyada"</b> -- which I have not yet printed but only on two tractates -- and Hashem Yitbarakh allow me to print all of it for good life and peace -- I chose to call this book <b>"Ben Ish Chai"</b>. And Hashem Yitbarakh help me to print the rest of the books which He has graced me in His great compassion and great kindness. And the name of the man who donated money for printed expenses shall be displayed at the end of this introduction in a certain form on his good name. Hashem Yitbarakh make his days and life long, long good and sweet life, Amen so let it be [His] will.
And from now on, behold I reveal my mind and will with all my heart and soul, that my whole intention in this collection, and also in all the collections that Hashem Yitbarakh allowed me to assemble in the Written Torah and in Oral Torah, it is all for the unification of Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and in awe and love and in fear and love, to unify the name of Hashem, Y"H with W"H, in complete unity, in the name of all Yisrael, and all my reasoning and thought and speech that is not according to the His will Yitbarakh, let them be null and anulled, so that all my desire in this collection, and the other collections that I do in chidushei Torah wit the help of heaven, and also any mitzvah that I do, it be in order to unify Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and to rest of spirit before Him Yitbarakh specifically, without any outward turning, and Hashem Yitbarakh in His compasion help me to learn and teach Torah for its own sake, Amen so may it be [His] will.
And since my proclamation is steadfast, in truth and in faith, before Hashem Yitbarakh, and in the eyes of all Yisrael<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">לעיני כל ישראל, the last words of the Torah, Deut. 34:12</i> a declaration great and strong, valid and lasting, I will prolong my prayer before Hashem, Please Hashem save us [from affliction], Please Hashem make us successful [in our deeds]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 118</i>, and establish the fallen Sukkah of David, and let the Redeemer come to Tziyon, righteous [in deeds] and victorious is he<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. 9:9</i>, and let our eyes see the coming of our Righteous Mashiach, and the rebuilding of our Holy Temple, soon in our days, and let the pleasantness of Hashem our God be on us, and the work of our hands, establish for us (w/o mishap to us), and the work of our hands, establish it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 90</i>, and let the great name of Y-H be magnified and sanctified speedily and soon, Amen so let it be [His] will.
These are the words of the youth who awaits the salvation of Hashem, and who trusts in His great compassions and His great mercies; may he illuminate my eyes with His Torah, the Torah of <b>Chaim/Life</b>:

And a man of Levi went, and took a daughter of Levi - it appears to me, with the help of heaven, that the letters in Levi, written in full as Lamed Vav Yud sums up Ayin [the are letters spelled out in full, and then the letters in the spelling out are added up, not including the letters themselves, so if לוי is למ"ד וא"ו יו"ד, we add up: / מ"ד – 44/א"ו – 7 /ו"ד – 10 for a total of 61 = אין ], and it is known that every letter in their full form is called House (Bayit), and Amram merited to take the characteristic of humility, which is Ayin, which is hinted at in "house of Levi", that is, in the letters of Levi, in their full form, they are called Houses, and this is how he merited to take a daughter from Levi that gave birth to Moshe, our teacher, peace be upon him whose humility surpassed any living person, and he seized the characteristic of Ayin to its fullest. Or you can understand "he took a daughter of Levi" because the letter in its full form is called daughter or son of the simple letter, as it is known, and we know what the Ari of blessed memory wrote, that when Amram took his wife this time, the soul of Chava mixed itself in her, and that is why this was like a new marriage, and her youth returned to her, and this is the secret of "and the woman conceived", that is to say the idea is that the first woman, which was in the world, see there, and also note that Chava plus Yocheved sum up 61 like the full form of Levi. And this is why it says "and he took a daughter of Levi", this is a hint to "Chava Yocheved" which is hinted by the full form, which is called "daughter" in the simple reading.

Introduction

"And Hashem-Elohim made for Adam and his wife honorable garments from [animal] hides, and dressed them." Behold it is known, what Rabbeinu the Arizal wrote regarding the garments of Adam haRishon. Before the <i>chet</i> ["sin," lit. missing-the-mark], there were <i>ketonet ohr</i>/garments of light from the Chashmal and when he sinned he lost those clothings of Chashmal which are 378 lights, gematria of chashmal, and He made him a different clothing from klipat nogah which are the <i>ketonet `or</i>/garments of hide, as mentioned in Etz Chayim Shaar 106 Amud 4, q.v., also the Arizal wrote in Sha`ar Hakavanot regarding the intentions in the [morning blessing] "<i>malbish `arumim</i>/Who dresses the bare," that the clothing of a man is from <i>kedushah</i>/holiness, and through transgressions that one does he causes the klipot to have a grip on the garments, and behold the garments have an <i>ohr hamakif</i> ["surrounding light;" aura] outside them as known, because there is an inner light inside included which is included in the body, and the clothings surrounds the body and over the clothing are the orot hamakifim and they stand outside the garments, and for each and every garment there is an aspect of ohr makif according to its value, and there is nothing that pushes off the klipot as much as ohr makif, since the klipot have no ability to feed from and take grip on the ohr hamakif, and therefore it stands outside and he has no fear of the klipot etc., see there.  
And behold by this is understood the jealousy of the <i>nachash</i>/serpent who was jealous of Adam Harishon before the chet and provoked him to make him stumble, because he was jealous of his ketonet ohr since he saw he had a great ohr makif around him according to the value of the ketonet ohr, and he had no grip on the ohr makif, in the <i>sod</i>/secret, and the nachash was <i>`arum</i>/bare as it says, and therefore he provoked him to make him stumble and he caused that the ketonet ohr be removed from him and for `or to be instead of ohr, as it is written, "<i>Vaya`as Hashem Elohim le'adam ve'ishto kotnot `ohr vayalbishem</i>/And Hashem Elohim made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them," and they said in the Holy Zohar that serpent skin clung to him, and with this I explained the remez of the scripture in the word "<i>vayalbishem</i>," reading it as "<i>vai levusham</i>/Woe for their clothing!", it was the serpent skin; it was "<i>vai</i>" because it clung to them, which was all due to the chet, and it seems to me, bsd, the difference between "<i>ohr</i>" and "<i>`or</i>" is a gematria of 69, gematria of <i>yagon</i>/grief, and it is known that grief is from the side of the <i>sitra achra</i> as is known is the intention in <i>vehaser mimenu yagon ve'anachah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">[1]</sup><i class="footnote"> from <i>hashiva shofteinu</i> in the `<i>Amidah</i> prayer</i> which is the force of impurity aliased <i>yagon</i> and the force of impurity aliased <i>anachah</i>, as mentioned in the siddur of the Rashash z"l, and therefore we find that <i>evyon</i>/impoverished and <i>yagon</i> are the same gematria, because someone who becomes evyon of mitzvot, yagon clings to him, as the two letters aleft-vet become gimel, and then the letters of evyon become the letters of yagon, but in the future when the <i>tikkun</i>/perfection is completed the yagon will be removed completely and then the count of yagon will be missing from the letter `ayin of `or/skin, and what will remain is aleph, and then there will be the reunion of ohr/light as the crown returns to its old place: What follows from the above is that the <i>chitzonim</i>  ["outside;" forces that are outside of kedushah] have no grip on the ohr hamakif, which is why the serpent was jealous of Adam Harishon because of his ohr hamakif which he was bare of since he had no grip on it, behold from this is understood bsd the reason that the mitzvah of tzitzit is effective in remembering the mitzvot of Hashem as it is written, "<i>u're'item oto u'zechartem et kol mitzvot Hashem</i>/and you shall see it and remember all the mitzvot of Hashem"<sup class="footnote-marker">[2]</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 15</i>. The reason is the tzitzit are aspect of ohr makif as Rabeinu the Arizal wrote, and therefore it has power to repel the klipot and since it repels the klipot therefore it aids memory, for it is known what Rabeinu z"l wrote in the Kavanot regarding the secret of the garments that a man wears, that it is necessary to be careful to not put on two garments simultaneously, and doing so breeds forgetfulness, and the secret of the thing is that each garment has an aspect of ohr hamakif, and nothings repels the klipot like the ohr hamakif, since they are unable to feed from them and grip them, and therefore one who joins two garments and dons them together does not leave a space for the ohr hamakif to enter between the two garments to surround each garment, and thereby the klipot are not repelled from there, and it is known that forgetfulness does not happen except because of the klipot, because memory is from the side of kedushah in the sod of "<i>ein shikhechah lifnei kise kevodekha</i>/nothing is forgotten before Your throne of glory,"<sup class="footnote-marker">[3]</sup><i class="footnote">Berakhot 32b and Yamim Nora'im prayers</i> end quote, q.v.. And from this it is understood the beautiful reason why the tzitzit because it is the aspect of ohr makif therefore it has power to push off the klipot and thereby forgetfulness is repelled and memory dominates, by one's seeing and remembering the mitzvot of Hashem, because by seeing it, via the contemplations related to it the illumination of the ohr hamakif is stimulated which is the sod of the tzitzit. And therefore tzitzit is gematria "<i>beit ya`akov</i>", of which we say "<i>beit ya`akov lekhu ve nelekhah be'ohr Hashem</i>/House of Ya`akov go and let us walk in the light of Hashem"<sup class="footnote-marker">[4]</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 2:5, recited in morning prayers</i>, because the grip of the ohr hamakif which is the sod of tzitzit is only for Yisrael who are the Beit Ya`akov, and on this we say "<i>va'esa etchem `al kanfei nesharim</i>/And I shall lift you up on wings of eagles..."<sup class="footnote-marker">[5]</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 19:4</i> but when the tikkun is finished "<i>...ve'avi etchem elai</i>/and I shall bring you to Me," i.e. you will perceive everthying, even regarding the tallit; [also] <i>elai</i> is spelled <i>el-yud</i> (to the yud) which is the sod of chokhmah.





Chapter 1

Before saying the berachah/blessing and wrapping [yourself in the zizith] direct your thoughts to fulfill the positive commandment to wear zizith that are fringed according to halakhah, as it says "And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments.," which is a positive time bound commandment. And by means of this kawanah/intention there will be power in his preparation in the berachah to raise the mayin nuqvin and to draw down the moḥin as Rabbeinu haRashash wrote in Nahar Shalom, and therefore it is good to say with his mouth before the berakhah "Leshem yiḥud qudsha berikh hu ushekhinteh/For the unification of the Holy Blessed One and His Shekhinah" etc. "Hareini muchan lilvosh Zizith mezuyezeth kehalakhah kemo sheziwanu Hashem Eloheinu 'Ve'asu lehem zitzith `al kanfei vighdheihem kedei la`asoth nachath ruaḥ leyozreinu/I declare myself ready to don zizith fringed according to halakhah as Hashem Eloheinu commanded us 'And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments'" in order to bring satisfaction to our Designer etc. And also he needs to have kawanah at the time of wrapping in them that Haqadosh Barukh Hu commanded us to wrap in them in order that we remember all His mizwoth, to perform them, and the Aḥaronim z"l have written that whoever does not do so, of him is said, "wa'thehi yir'atham othi mizwath anashim melumdhah/Their fear of Me was like commandments of men done by rote."

Chapter 2

One should say the berachah "lehit`atef betzitzit" with a shva under the beit, not a patach [i.e. betzitzit and not batzitzit], and it is necessary to direct intention during the berachah over the tallit gadol/large tallit to exempt the tallit katan/small tallit that is on him that he did not remove during the night, because there is a svara/rationale that one might need to say a berakhah on the tallit katan in the morning, but because of safek berakhot lehakel [if doubtful of a berakhah, be lenient] we do not say it. And I wrote in my holy sefer Mekabtziel that if one makes that kavanah then it applies to the other, and it is not necessary to handle the tallit katan at the time of the berakhah also according to the opinion of Maran z"l, and therefore since forgetfulness happens with people and they wander and do not have kavanah sometimes, therefore it is proper to accustom oneself to add the nusach/phrasing "leshem yichud kusha brikh hu u'shekhinteh.." mentioned above, as well as these words, "Hareinu muhcan levarekh `al `atifat hatalit ketikun chazal/I declare myself ready to say the berakhah on wrapping in a tallit as our Sages ordained," and "hareini mechavin liftor bavrakhah zu gam hatalit katan she`alai/I declare that I intend to exempt with this berakhah also the tallit katan that is on me."

Chapter 3

Before saying the berakhah one should see and check the strings of the tzitzit that they should have no missing part that disqualifies, and also separate the tzitzit by hand so that they not be tangled. And only on Shabbat he should not distangle them but only check them. Also further one should be careful to check each day and look at the strings at the top at the foundation at the hole, because if even one is severed there they are is disqualified. And in a pressing time, when he is late to come or the tzibur/congregation is waiting for him to do petichat haheichal/opening the ark or to read the Torah he can rely on a chazakah and not check that time. And likewise one who is traveling and unable to repair, the Acharonim have written that one could rely on a chazakah and not check.

Chapter 4

Also one should be careful to check the tallit katan beforehand, and in this also his wife should help him in the mitzvah, that she should be careful to check the tallit katan when she summons the clothes for her husband to change them, and she should be careful likewise the separate the strings because due to washing they will certainly be tangled, and then she will get reward for the mitzvah to save her husband from a prohibition, because sometimes a man is panicked to don clothes and does not check. But nonetheless he should not rely on his wife, but check and afterwards say the berakhah.

Chapter 5

The order of wrapping in the tallit gadol is as follows. After finishing the berekhah wrap only your head with it, and not like those who are overwise and wrap their entire bodies initially, because we only have the words of Rabeinu the Arizal. And after you have wrapped your head let the four wings go down the shoulders towards your front, two to the right and two to the left. Then first grab the two on the right and cast them behind you to the left, so that they be wrapped around your neck over your left shoulder to the back, while the two left ones remain hanging in front of you, and wait the short time length of walking four amot or slightly less, then follow by sending the left ones also behind you to the left, so that now all four corners are hanging behind you together on the left, and wait the time of walking four amot and then let the tallit that is wrapped around your neck go down over all your body. And now you will be wrapped in it, your head and body together. Such is the way it is detailed in Sefer Hakavanot, drush hatzitzit perek 1, and as the Rav El"Y [? ] z"l beautifully explained on daf 107 amud 4, and likewise explicitly stated in the siddur of Rabeinu haRashash z"l. And what he wrote that one should wait between throwing the two right ones and the two left ones, a time length of walking 4 amot, is not explained explicitly in the words of Rabeinu z"l and in the words of the Rashash z"l, but because it is explained there that it is necessary to do kavanot in that part by itself, and kavanot in the other part by itself, thus the throwing of the first two while the two left ones are still hanging in front has a matter to it by itself. And we do not make these kavanot, therefore it suffices for us to wait the time of walking four amot, in order to fulfill the precept of this matter, and as written "`eder `eder levado/each flock by itself... and put a space between one flock and the other."

Chapter 6

The tallit gadol and tallit katan, in either case say the berakhah standing. And the custom of Rabeinu the Arizal is that he also wrap his head first with the tallit katan, and afterwards let it down on his body, and therefore he would say a berakhah of "lehit`atef" for the tallit katan. And whoever does this, it is good, however whoever does not wrap his head but immediately lets it down over his body and dons it, should say the berakhah `al mitzvat tzitzi" and not say "lehit`atef.

Chapter 7

One who dons a new tallit should say the berekhah "shehechiyanu" after the berakhah of "lehit`atef," but for a tallit katan we do not say "shehechiyanu" because the common way is not to make it of valuable material so that he rejoice in it, but if one makes it from a valuable material that he rejoices in, he should say shehechiyanu.

Chapter 8

One need not bother to make some sign on the tallit to always place one side of the tallit on his head and not the other way, as some are accustomed to do and make a sign, because it is explicit in the words of the Arizal that we need not bother, and therefore one can don it as it comes to him.

Chapter 9

One should be careful to never remove the tallit katan from him at any time, neither during sleep, neither during marital relations, but only when he enters the bathhouse remove it, or when he enters the toilet room and he has no outer garment on him covering the tallit katan, then he should cover and conceal the tzitzit on it so they not hang openly.

Chapter 10

If he removed the tallit gadol in order to enter the toilet room or for some other business with the intention of putting it back on immediately, he need not say the blessing over it again. Even though Maran z"l reasons that one should recite it, we maintain "safek berakhot lehakel/if in doubt, do not recite a berakhah," and even against the reasoning of Maran z"l. This too is the rule with the tallit katan if he removed in to go in to immerse [in a mikvah], he should not say a berakhah when he dons it when he goes out, due to safek berakhot lehakel, and even though it is explicitly stated in Sefer Hakavanot of Rabeinu the Arizal that his practice was to say the berakhah on the tallit katan after immersion, and we do not say that safek berakhot takes precedence over Rabeinu the Arizal, anyhow it could be said that Rabeinu the Arizal is different, because he would linger in the immersion and do many kavanot, so that some hesech da`at/diversion of mind is made. However if he removes it in order to enter the bath where he will stay long, it is preferable to say the berakhah as the Arizal did. This is what I brought up in my holy book Mekabtzi`el. But if he changes his clothes and dons a different tallit katan, even if he dons it immediately after removing the first one, he should say the berakhah on the new one, an this too is the rule with a tallit gadol if he removes the one that is on him and dons a different tallit gadol, he should say the berakhah on the second one. And in my holy book Rav Pe`alim I wrote a responsa bs"d, regarding someone whose practice it is to don tzitzit and tefilin each day in his house, in order to enter the synagogue in tzitzit and tefilin, but because he walks in pathways where many people pass back and forth, those of the Brit and those who are not of the Brit, he does not don the tallit gadol that he has in the synagogue, because it is visible to people, but instead he has a very thin tallit that large enough to be a tallit gadol but is not very big, and he dons in his house under his coat, and because it is very fine and also because it is not long it is not visible to people who apss by, and when he enters the synagogue he leaves this one on him under his coat, and dons the tallit gadol that he has, and I brought up bs"d that he can say the berakhah in the synagogue on the second tallit, even though the first one is on him that he said a blessing over in his house, because there is a gap between [going from] his house to the synagogue, and also there is a hesech da`at since he says verses by the mezuzah, and furthermore it takes him much time to walk the path, and there in the synagogue he dons a different tallit that is full-sized, wrapping his head and body, while the tallit that is on him rests on his shoulder and legs, and also I found other reasons regarding this why he should say the berakhah, so one should not have any doubt on this regarding safek berakhot.

Introduction







Chapter 1

There are three kinds of tallit. The first is of lamb and sheep's wool. On this kind of tallit, one should also make the tzitzit of this kind of wool, and this is the Torah obligation according to all opinions, and according to everyone, wearing this fulfills the positive mitzvah of the Torah: 
The second kind of tallit is from cotton or silk, and regarding this there is a disagreement in which some say the obligation is from the Torah and some say the obligation is from the Rabbis, and also for those who say that it is a rabbinic obligation one can bless upon it as one would for rabbinic mitzvot, and regarding the tzitzit even though according to our teacher and his people you can affix tzitzit of lamb's wool onto other kinds of garments, nonetheless, if the tallit is made of a good kind of wool upon which one could affix tzitzit of the same kind of material (i.e. cotton), since according to the Maharam meRotenburg and his people, we don't dismiss wool tzitzit that are on a different kind of garment, and therefore in order to fulfill the obligation according to the aforementioned disagreement, one should affix tzitzit of the same material as the garment. However, all of this is specifically in a case in which the tallit is cotton and then one affixes cotton tzitzit, but if the tallit is silk, it is hard to find silk tzitzit that were made correctly. Since I've heard of one particular person who brought silk... because with silk, the throwing and pulling must be for the sake of the mitzvah, because the throwing and pulling of silk is like spinning wool... therefore it is hard to find proper silk tzitzit...and even though... it seems that this opinion is not in accordance with that particular

Chapter 6

A garment that does not have four corners is exempt from the requirement to affix fringes. And if the garment has five corners or more must [have fringes affixed]. However, [for a garment with more than four corners, do not affix fringes to all the corners, but just to four corners. And one must be careful to affix the fringes onto the four corners that are farthest away from each other, because those that are farthest from each other meet the definition of "corners" more so than corners that are closer to each other. And if one affixed [fringes to] more than four corners, they will have transgressed [the negative commandment of] not adding [to the commandments of the Torah] when adorning such a garment. Nevertheless, one should be careful to distance themselves from a garment like this and not wear a garment that has more than four corners, even if one affixes fringes to only four of the corners, as certain authorities disagree and exempt such a garment [with more than four corners] from the requirement to affix fringes.

Four sections are in the tefillin: <i>Kadesh</i> (Exodus 13:1-10); <i>VeHaya ki Yiviecha</i> (Exodus 13:11-16); <i>Shema</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); and <i>VeHaya im Shemoa</i> (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). And that is the order of their placement according to Rashi, may his memory be blessed. However, according to the understanding of Rabbenu Tam, may his memory be blessed, their order is <i>Kadesh; VeHaya ki Yiviecha; VeHaya im Shemoa</i>; and <i>Shema</i>. But the practice is according to the Rashi's understanding, may his memory be blessed. And the Levush, may his memory be blessed, wrote that once the stand over Ezekiel the prophet's tomb, may his memory be blessed, fell and they found old tefillin there which were [arranged] according to the order of Rashi. So at the beginning, they thought this disagreement was like other disagreements in which one understanding was dispelled. But our teacher, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, came along and said from a tradition spoken by Eliyahu, his memory should be for the good, that both understandings are true and that one should [follow] both of them; and that they would wear two pairs from the days of our teacher, Moshe, up until the Geonim. And so is it found in the Gemara (Eruvin 95b), "there is room on the head to place two pairs." And in the Zohar Chadash it is found that there were some people who would put on two pairs based on the doubt, "as they did not know this secret that both are required." Hence one who fears the Heavens should make two pairs of tefillin, one like the understanding of Rashi and one like the understanding of Rabbenu Tam. And he should grab both of them in his hand and bring them up on his forearm and tie them, one on top of the other. As he needs to put them on together; and not like those who place that of Rashi by itself and that of Rabbenu Tam by itself. It is also necessary that he place the tefillin of Rabbenu Tam above that of Rashi, both with the head and with the arm. For the aspect of Rabbenu Tam's tefillin is greater than the aspect of Rashi's tefillin. Hence the practice is to make the Rabbenu Tam tefillin smaller than that of Rashi. But the connected (hence lower) part of the forearm is the higher. Hence he should first bring up that of Rashi and recite the blessing upon it after he ties it on the biceps; and afterwards bring up that of Rabbenu Tam. And it comes out with this that that of Rabbenu Tam is resting higher than that of Rashi. And all of that is with the boxes; but regarding the straps, he should place the strap of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin below the strap of Rashi. Hence he should make the width of the strap of Rabbenu Tam narrower than that of Rashi, in order that it can be covered by it. And likewise with the head, he should place the Rabbenu Tam tefillin above that of Rashi; and also the knot of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin should be on the nape a little higher than that of Rashi. However one should pass the straps, that hang down from the knot on the nape and below, underneath the Rashi strap, such that it cover it. The hint to this is (Psalms 37:37), "Guard the blameless (<i>tam</i>), and see the upright (<i>yashar</i>, which is Rashi spelled backwards). And there is a reason for all of these things according to [Kabbalah], so one should not change a thing. One should also be careful not to place the box of one over the connection of the other, but rather adjacently, one below the other, with all of them resting upon the flesh - and as I wrote with the help of the Heavens in my holy book, MeKabtziel.

We eat dairy foods on Channukah in memory of the miracle that occured through the milk that Judith fed to the enemy, who was one of the Grecian kings, as is recounted in the book 'Hemdat Yamim'. This miracle occured some years before the chief miracle of Channukah, but since the enemy was also a Grecian king, and he also wanted to make the Jews abandon their religion, we also commemorate this miracle during the days of Channukah. This is similar to the tradition of eating seeds on Purim to commemorate the miracle that occured to Daniel and his companions, peace be upon them. It seems to me, with God's help, that there is a hint in the word <i>chalav</i>, milk, that refers to the three mitzvot that the Greeks wanted to abolish, and over which the Jews were ready to sacrifice themselves: The first letter, <i>chet</i>, refers to the first letter of <i>Chodesh</i>, the calendar. The letter <i>bet</i> refers to the second letter of Shabbat. And the letter <i>lamed</i> refers to the third letter of <i>Milah</i>, the covenant of circumcision that they were forced to abandon.

Chapter 1

Since the greatness of prayer nourishes both the upper and lower worlds through it, as it is a pillar of the universe, and even to the upper worlds abundance will flow through it, therefore the Holy Zohar cautioned to pray quietly until even his own ears do not hear his voice. The reason for this is so that outsiders will not become jealous of it because of the greatness of its virtues. As our teacher and master Rabbi Chaim Vital of blessed memory wrote in "Olat Tamid," page 56b, and this is his language: "Prayer does not enter any firmament unless it is a prayer that is not audible to others. Therefore, in the reading of Shema, they ordained that one should hear it with his ears. But here, if the prayer is audible to his ears, it is impossible, for outsiders hear it and interfere with it, and when it is whispered and is not audible to his ears, then it is very spiritual, of the nature of the spirit of man, which is internal and more spiritual than the external inclination, and therefore it is not seen. This contradicts the opinion of the Maharik, in the Beit Yosef, who ruled that it is better to hear it with one's ears. And see in the Baraita and in the Jerusalem Talmud and you will find that his opinion is the opposite, and similarly, one who reads the Torah scroll, whether he reads it aloud or whispers, one horn of faith is missing, for prayer and the reading of the Torah are both from the highest concealment, and for this reason we recite them in a whisper and so on." See there for his exact words.

The place where the priests (kohanim) stand to bless [the congregation] is on the platform adjacent to the western wall (in Baghdad, that is the direction of Jerusalem) toward which we pray. As the meaning of the word <i>dukhan</i> is to say, a platform. And one who is negligent about this, not to ascend the platform to stand there but rather to stand on the floor of the sanctuary, is surely deviating from the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed. For the Sages, may their memory be blessed, did not say that the priests ascend the <i>dukhan</i> for nothing. And here in our city, may God protect it, their custom was for the priests to stand on the floor of the sanctuary and to recite the blessing of the priests (<i>birkat kohanim</i>), and not to stand on the platform at the edge of the sanctuary. But, praises to God, I made the custom that they ascend the platform at the edge of the sanctuary and bless there. And so is fit to be exacting about this in each and every place.

These hours — of the six and a half or the nine and a half — are called time-based hours, since they are measured according to the content of the day, whether it is long or short. So we divide it into 12 sections. And every place where the sages, may their memory be blessed, measured by hours with these hours — some say that we measure from the dawn to the appearance of the stars and some say from the sunrise to the sunset. But the first approach is the main one, as we concern ourselves about stringency and measure from the dawn to the appearance of the stars. And that is the custom that has spread in our city, Baghdad, may God protect it, to measure from the dawn to the appearance of the stars. As here we calculate the appearance of the stars as a third of an hour after the call of the muezzin in this city. And so did they have it transmitted to them about this by the crown of my head, Rabbi Gaon, the master, my elder, our teacher Moshe Chaim, may his memory be for a blessing in the world to come.

Introduction







Chapter 1

Before the night of the fourteenth of Nissan, it is necessary to tidy all the rooms and houses in the courtyard. A woman should also thoroughly inspect all her clothes and their pockets; for perhaps she put chametz in them, and even if there is a doubt one needs to check and verify. At the beginning of the night of the fourteenth we search for chametz with the light of the candle immediately after the stars become visible. One should do <i>netilat yadayim</i> before saying the blessing on the search, as mentioned by the later rabbis of blessed memory.

Chapter 2

It is necessary to search by the light of a wax candle, and one should not bring two that are large or stuck together, for it would be considered an <i>avukah</i>, a torch, and one does not search with the flame of a torch. The lamps forbidden for search with are those made of suet, lard, and those arranged like a torch (one can usethe mnemonic "chashasha", doubt.) See the book <i>Mo'ed Lekol Chai</i> by R. Chaim Palaggi for more details. The candles that presently come from European cities are made from suet, so we do not use them for searching. 

Chapter 3

One needs to search in holes and cracks in the house, and any place where chametz is usually placed. One should not be frivolous in searching, even if it is very tedious on the account of the unplastered walls being made of small stones, for one is rewarded according to one's effort. One should check in the <i>rawazin</i> [روازن‎, holes carved in the walls used to display items] and other such places. If one was absolutely unable to search at night, they should search in the morning immediately after the morning prayers. This search should also be by the light of a candle, except for the main rooms filled with sunlight, which do not need candlelight as well. 

Chapter 4

One should not begin any kind of creative work, nor should one eat, until one conducts this search for chametz. One is however permitted to eat a small snack, such as fruits or less than the volume of an egg's worth of bread. Even if one has a regular habit to study Torah at a specific time in the evening, they should not study until they have conducted the search.

Chapter 5

Before the search, one should recite the blessing "... who has sanctified us and commanded us to destroy chametz," since the search is a necessary factor for the destruction the next day. Even though this is an annual mitzvah, we don't recite the <i>Shehechiyanu</i> blessing. However, some recent rabbis have advised that if one has a new item of clothing or a new fruit [that one hasn't eaten for over a year], one then recites the <i>Shehechiyanu</i> blessing, and has in mind to include this mitzvah as well. If one forgot to recite the blessing ("...to destroy chametz"), it can be said at any point while the search is taking place. If other members of the household are taking part in the search, one person says the blessing and everyone intends to be included by it. One should not speak between the recitation of the blessing and the beginning of the search, unless it pertains to relevant matters. If one did speak, they should repeat the blessing, and ideally one should not speak about irrelevant matters until the search is concluded. Before beginning, one should hide away any chametz that is left for eating the next morning, and cover it with a vessel. 

Chapter 6

The custom is to have a bowl in which to gather the chametz found, with a piece of bread already in it, and to have a knife in order to check the nooks and crannies of the house. There are those who have the custom to place ten morsels of bread in different corners of the house before the search takes place, in order to have something to find and destroy. Here in our city of Baghdad, we place in the aforementioned bowl some salt. The reason is that Satan and his entourage are particularly jealous of the mitzvah of searching for chametz, and the salt repels all these negative forces, in the same way that the kabbalists spoke about the importance of having salt at the table. We also do this for good fortune, that we may merit to perform this mitzvah of searching for chametz for many years to come, since salt lasts for a long time and signifies eternity, as the Torah says: "It is a covenant of salt" (Numbers 18:19)

Chapter 7

After the search in the evening, one should immediately annul the chametz, with the formulation "All leavened produce... that I have not seen... may it be annulled and insignificant like the dust of the earth." The first word [when recited in Aramaic, <i>hamira</i>] is a general word for chametz (leavened food) and se'or (leavening agent). One should also understand that this nullification makes the food ownerless, and it is no longer legally in one's possession.  One should recite this nullification formula three times, as is written in the work "Machzik Beracha".

Chapter 8

The consumption of chametz is forbidden on the 14th of Nissan from the fourth hour of the day, but one can still derive benefit from it throughout the fifth hour too. (These refer to halachic hours, calculated from sunrise.) After the last consumption of chametz, one should clean out their teeth with a wooden toothpick, picking out anything stuck in the gaps and making sure that nothing is left. One should then wash their hands and rinse their mouth well, rubbing their teeth with their finger, because even the most minute amount of chametz is forbidden on Pesach. It once happened that there was a certain pious man, who was extremely careful with guarding the flour for his matzah, and baked it meticulously and observed all the laws of Pesach. On the eve of Pesach, as he fell asleep, he dreamed that a man was telling him: "Woe to he who ate some chametz!" He woke up and was very distraught and wept profusely, and while weeping fell back asleep. He dreamed again, and a man was speaking to him, saying: "You ate chametz! It was a small crumb that stayed between your teeth from the morning before Pesach, and in eating the matzah at the Seder, the crumb was dislodged, and you ate chametz together with your matzah!" Therefore, it is extremely important to be diligent to clean one's teeth well.

Chapter 9

One who owns chametz in their shop, and it would be impossible for them to remove it from their shop and sell it to a non-Jew, should be careful to sell it according to the law. They should receive money from the non-Jew and say explicitly that they are selling such-and-such chametz that is placed in the shop. They should also sell any of the vessels in which the chametz is placed, for if not, it would not be a valid transfer of ownership. They should give the keys of the shop, and say explicitly: you may enter the shop at any moment, and can do with the chametz as you wish, as one does with one's own property, and none shall protest. However, it's preferable not to sell one's chametz but to give it as a gift. The chametz and the vessels they are placed in should be given as an absolute and wholehearted gift to a non-Jew, and the keys should be given to the non-Jew so that they may do with the chametz as they please. A gift is more correct, for many people do not do the sale properly. All this should be done on the morning of the 14th of Nissan, just after the morning prayers so that one does not forget due to distractions. Even if the non-Jew gives back all the chametz after Pesach and did not use it at all, it does not matter since the ownership was legally transferred. Those who own sweets that contain flour should not keep them at home, but should either sell or give it to a non-Jew, even if they eventually give it back after Pesach. The same applies to the grain called <i>Burjil</i> [burghul: steamed cracked wheat], and the beverage known as <i>bira</i> [beer] -- these need to be sold or given over absolutely to a non-Jew, and should be brought to their house. If one erred and did not give or sell chametz before Pesach, these items are forbidden for use after Pesach is over. However, sugar from the cities of India, and <i>qand<i> [ﻗَﻨﺪ, sugar cubes] that comes from the cities of Europe, as well as the food known as <i>nabat</i> [long rock candy for sweetening tea] - all these can stay in the home during Pesach, yet may not be eaten during the festival. One who has chametz in a trading caravan or on a ship should sell it with money and a contract, and should come before a rabbi who can help them formulate the contract.</i></i>

Chapter 10

After eating the last chametz on the fourteenth of Nissan, one should burn the remaining chametz in person, for it is more fitting to do it oneself than to assign it to someone else. It is forbidden to throw the chametz into the public domain, for this is undignified and is a desecration of the name of God in the eyes of the gentiles. The custom is to burn the chametz with the willow branches from Sukkot (see the book Chaim Larosh p.12). After burning, one should immediately nullify the chametz, using the language "[all chametz] that I have seen or that I have not seen". This should be recited three times, and it should not be done before the burning, because one has to own what they burn. If one borrowed a loaf of bread before Pesach, [an equivalent loaf] should be given back before Pesach too, but if not, it should be given back after Pesach. If one does not return it, this is a form of theft.

Chapter 11

One who wears a new robe in which there is hard chametz known in Arabic as <i>nasha</i> [نشاء, wheat starch] must launder the robe very well before Pesach begins, soaking it in water to remove the <i>nasha</i> in order to be able to wear it on the festival. For if any of this <i>nasha</i> remains in it, it is very probable that at some point during the festival, when any amount of chametz is forbidden, the robe will come into contact with one's mouth. For it is very common while going to the toilet to hold the robe between the teeth, and sometimes people wipe their mouth or teeth with their robes. One should also be careful to wash new serviettes that come from the cities of Europe, for they too contain <i>nasha</i>, and one should launder the tablecloth if it contains <i>nasha</i>. So too, the cloth that is spread on couches near the table, which absorbs moist bread or wet fruit that draws out the aforementioned <i>nasha</i>, and then one comes to eat it - all these should be washed well in advance. 

Chapter 12

One should not use vessels that had previously been used for chametz without making them kosher [=valid for Pesach use]. The way to make them kosher is in the same way that they were used for chametz. If, for example, they were used for hot liquids then the way to make them kosher is by immersing them in boiling water. The vessel should not be placed in the water unless it is boiling, but if it has ceased from actively boiling more fuel should be added to the fire in order to boil the water, and then the vessel may be placed in it. It should remain a few moments in the boiling water, enough that the water could enter into the vessel and the taste of the old food would leave (as mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch of R. Zalman of blessed memory). Still, it should stay for a short time only, and before being immersed one should scrub the pots and remove any rust. If there are any cracks from which rust cannot be removed, one needs to treat these places with <i>libun</i> (=extreme heat from a flame). The handles of the vessels also need to be immersed in boiling water. All this process needs to be done before the fifth hour on the eve of Pesach, in order to avoid several complications. Even if one does this before the fifth hour, one needs to be sure that the vessels have not been used in the last day in order not to get confused with the usual process of making vessels kosher. For at other times than Pesach, if one wants to make a vessel kosher it needs to have not been used for a full day. If the vessels are submerged into the water using tongs, the vessel needs to be turned [so that the water touches the place that the tongs were holding]. The lid of the pot needs to be immersed in boiling water too. In R. Haim Vital's writings, a warning is brought in the name of the Ari of blessed memory. He says that it is inadvisable to use molten lead for the <i>libun</i> of copper vessels without first immersing them in boiling water. For the molten lead becomes a covering over the copper and prevents the chametz from leaving the vessel if it is immersed afterwards, and the <i>libun</i> by molten lead isn't itself an effective way to make vessels kosher since the sages said that there need to be sparks flying, which is not the case with molten lead. It is therefore preferable to first immerse the dishes in boiling water, and then have a non-Jew plate it with molten lead. Nonetheless, one should be careful that this non-Jew does not then cool it off in water that was used for chametz vessels. Such is the advice of the Ari of blessed memory, yet here in the city of Baghdad, may God preserve it, we do not act accordingly. The prevalent custom is to first heat with molten lead and then immerse in boiling water. The rabbis do not protest, because in our city it is not the practice to use such pots for actual chametz, like a dish with flour and bread, and we only use pans for frying dough, and even in that case it is not the regular usage of the vessel. Therefore, we do not protest and require them to act according to the aforementioned practice of the Ari of blessed memory, yet one who fears heaven should certainly do so, as well as for dishes which have become unkosher through the mixtures of meat and milk or any other issue of kashrut that might require <i>libun</i> with molten lead - the immersion should happen first.

Chapter 13

It has become customary to rinse the vessels in cold water after the immersion in boiling water, to avoid the vessel reabsorbing the boiling water that was now mixed with the chametz discharges of the vessel. Even though these have been nullified and are less than one in sixty of the volume, people still ideally rinse it in cold water, as prescribed by the Shulchan Aruch of our great master Zalman [Shneur Zalman of Liadi] of blessed memory, and the Levush gave a different explanation for this practice.

One takes less than a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of an olive) of <i>karpas</i> - so that he not become obligated to recite a final blessing for it -  and recites the blessing, "who creates the fruit of the ground," upon it and dips it in vinegar. Then he eats it without reclining, which is as was written by the Gaon, Chida (Chaim Yosef David Azulay); and also like our custom from the time of the crown of my head, the teacher and Gaon, my master grandfather, may his memory be for life in the world to come - to eat it without reclining. And this first dipping, which is the <i>karpas</i> in vinegar, is a remembrance of the cause for the hardship of the subjugation - as it was because of the sale of the righteous Yosef; that they dipped his cloak of <i>pasim</i> into blood, sold him and caused anguish to our father, Yaakov, may his memory be blessed. And this is hinted to in (the word,) <i>karpas</i>. And that is since the letters, <i>kar</i>, are the end of <i>makhar</i> (sold), and the letters, <i>pas</i>, are the beginning of <i>pasim</i>. And the second dipping, which is the bitter herbs (<i>maror</i>) in <i>charoset</i>, is a remembrance of the hardship of the subjugation itself. As they embittered (<i>mararu</i>) their lives with the work of clay, which is hinted to by the <i>charoset</i>, as I have written about in my small book, Mikabtze'el. And even though we said that one needs to take less than a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>karpas</i>, so that he not become obligated to recite a final blessing for it - behold, if he erred and ate a <i>kazayit</i>, he needs to recite the blessing, "who created many souls," after it. Nevertheless, he does not recite the blessing, "who creates the fruit of the ground," upon bitter herbs, since it is considered something needed for the meal that comes within the meal (and hence covered by the earlier blessing over the matzah). And he should take care not to eat all of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate, but rather leave some of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate until after [eating from the matzah]. As the secret of the Seder plate needs to be complete until after the eating of matzah and bitter herbs.

Ben Bag Bag said: Turn it over, turn it over, for everything is in it. (Avot, Ch. 5, 26)  We will see, with the help of heaven:  [Regarding] the separation of the sparks of holiness, there are two parts - the first that "turns over" the sparks of holiness from "muddy matter" to pure matter, this is called clarifying the external.  The second that "turns over" the sparks from pure matter to spirituality, and this is called clarifying the internal. And this is the matter because the sparks of holiness are contained in the inanimate objects, plants, and animals; the meat of domestic animals, wild animals, and chicken are all "muddy matter".  And if a man eats meat and raises up the spark in the meat that is "muddy matter"to the man that is "pure matter", or if he eats plants, or if he eats something that is mixed with dust it is considered inanimate and the dust has sparks of holiness. 
And then it is required to elevate the spark of holiness from the man to the spiritual, that is the place of holiness above the highest worlds...And behold, this is "turning" form "pure matter" to the "spiritual".  And the completion of these two parts of clarifying, they are the essence of external, and the essence of internal...it is not possible to complete except only through the study of Torah.  Because the words of Torah have external, the plain (pshat), and the internal, the secret (sod).  And that is why it says "turn it over, turn it over", there are two types of "small jugs": the first is from "muddy matter" to "pure matter" that is called "clarifying the external" and the second is from "pure matter" to "spiritual", this is called "clarifying the internal". 
Since it is all in the Torah it is "imprisoned" there, that is to say, the "external" and the "internal" and therefore it is the completion of the two clarifications, the "external" and the "internal", and regarding this, even though the clarification was made through eating, the clarification was not complete.  Because the clarification of the "external" from "muddy matter" to "pure matter" is not possible only through eating and therefore our Sages of blessed memory, warned us to study words of Torah at the table during the week.  And the study of the "petach Eliyahu [prayer]", he should be remembered for good, is a great segulah to clarify the sparks of holiness.  And the usual way [of having books on the table] is good for him but sometimes he is busy, or he is eating on his roof during the summer and it is not possible to learn by the light of a candle.

"And you shall not fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their protection has departed from them, and God is with us; do not fear them" (Numbers 14:9), it seems to me, with God's help, that it is known that the nations of the world have their strength from the sparks of holiness that are mixed in their "shell", for the sparks of holiness are their life and power. And therefore God commanded to kill off the Canaanites, as it is written "You shall surely destroy them etc." (Deuteronomy 12:2) and "You shall not let any soul live" (Deuteronomy 20:16), because there were many and mighty sparks of holiness in their shell, and if Israel had treated them well and kept them in the world, they would not have been able to separate those sparks of holiness, and on the contrary, the "shell" would have been strengthened more, but by Israel destroying them below and killing them off to fulfill the commandment of the Lord, they were able to crush and destroy also the "shell" and take out what was "swallowed from its mouth".
We wrote elsewhere with the help of Heaven that the nations of idolaters and their "shells" are similar to bread that the clarification comes out of it and is completed by four threshings.
The first one when they thresh the grain to remove the chaff from it which is its shell and in this threshing one level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the second one when they grind the wheat with millstones to make it flour and in this a second level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the third one when they knead the flour with water that the kneader needs to knead the dough and soften it with his hands and in this a third level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the fourth one after the bread is baked and the person threshes it with his teeth when he chews it. And in this the clarification of sparks of holiness from it is completed.
And these four steps of clarification are against four letters of the name of God, and therefore they established four blessings after eating food. And just as the purifying of bread needs to be with the threshings we have mentioned, so is the purification of sparks of holiness from the nation of idolatry and the "shell", which does not need to be by us; that we will crush them until they are destroyed. Therefore God did not destroy the Canaanites in the hands of heaven that he did not send them bad plagues in their land until they were destroyed, as he did to the Egyptians in the land of Egypt with ten plagues, rather he decreed that Israel would come to their lands and fight them and destroy them themselves, so that the clarification of sparks of holiness from their "shell" would be by Israel who would crush them themselves as they do with bread, and by this He destroys them in their place from heaven as He did to the Egyptians who did not need Israel to fight them. For this he said "for they are our bread", meaning God wanted to make them like bread that needs to be purified by man through the threshings that he does with it, and these "remove their shadow" - the good part - "from them". When the good part - which is sparks of holiness - is removed from bread,  "and God" - the name of God which is against four steps of clarification mentioned above is "with us" to help us in war in order to complete purification of sparks of holiness by our hands, and therefore "do not fear them" now, that they remain existing and they were not destroyed by heaven.

During all the regular days, every person completes [at least] 100 blessings by way of the morning blessings, the blessings in prayer, from beginning to end, and through the blessings over eating and drinking. And on Shabbat and holidays, when he lacks blessings in the [silent] prayer, he completes [them] with various types of fruit and scents. And on a fast day, one will be missing many blessings - and especially when he is fasting night and day, when there will not be eating or drinking night and day - one should be careful to listen to the blessing of those reading the Torah and answer, amen, after them. And this is effective in completing the [100 blessings] in [such] a pressing situation when it is impossible [to otherwise get to 100]. However, he must listen to the entire blessing, from beginning to end.

Chapter 1

Before you say the “Birkat Hagomel”[the Blessing of those who overcome a danger] you say the verse (Psalms 111, 1) : “I praise the Lord with all my heart in the assembled congregation of the upright”, and afterwards you bless by saying “Blessed Thou Lord, King of the Universe, showing goodness to us beyond our merits and bestowing favour upon me” , the congregation responds: “May God who has been gracious to you, continue to be gracious to you selah”, and he says after them: “Amen, may this be God’s will.”

Chapter 2

You have to bless in front of ten and two out of these ten have to be learned in Halachah. And it’s good to be careful that you have twelve people including the blessing person and also including the aforementioned learned Rabbanan. If one doesn’t happen to have two learned people, even then, one should nevertheless bless and the saying of the blessing should not be prevented because of that fact. We have the custom to bless after the reading of the Torah in the assembly, when in most cases there are two halachically learned people found. And if one blesses when there are less than ten, there are those who say that one does not fulfill his obligation and there are those who say that that one fulfills. And it’s good to repeat the blessing in front of ten without Shem and Malchut but one should think of Shem and Malchut in his mind. One who blessed silently, it is as if they did not bless in front of ten, and they should repeat it in front of ten, not uttering the Shem and Malchut but thinking it in their mind. 

Chapter 3

The ten sit, as it is written: and “in the assembly of the elders they will give thanks to God”, and the one who blesses stands because this blessing is instead of the thanksgiving sacrifice and the person who gives the sacrifice stands and sacrifices. And therefore we do not say Birkat HaGomel at night, but rather during the day. And retrospectively if someone blessed at night they fulfilled their duty – and see the Hatam Sofer Orakh Hayyim Siman 51.    

Chapter 4

A child younger than 13 years old, when he is ready for education he needs to bless. Although some disagree with this, in a place in which there is a minhag (custom) that the kid blesses with Name and Kingdom, he should bless. In a place, in which such a custom does not exist, he should bless without Name nor Kingdom because of the explanations of those who disagree (that a child under 13 should bless).

Chapter 5

Women are obliged to bless the Birkat haGomel; and they bless with among Minian with Name and Kingdom. If it is difficult for her to bless with 10 persons because she is timid, she should bless without Name nor Kingdom. If she does not know the blessing, her husband should teach her or someone else, since it is a short blessing.

Chapter 6



Chapter 7

On pain like headache and the one who is exempt and is not sick with a sickness that includes the whole body, this person does not bless, and such a person is not considered sick to be obligated to bless unless the person has fallen into bed for three complete days, and it does not need to be three days that all include 24 hours.

There are certain pious people, who, after writing the Prozbul, lend a small amount of money to their friends: only ten <i>grush</i> or so, and make sure that the Prozbul doesn't apply to that, since it was given afterwards. After Rosh Hashanah, when the friend comes to repay the loan, they announce "I annul the loan," and don't take the money back. Afterwards, the friend buys some food and rejoices with this free money, and the lender can rejoice at having really performed the mitzvah of cancelling debts. With praise to the blessed God, I enacted such a mitzvah in our city of Baghdad, may God protect it. I printed Prozbul forms and handed them out to many people who used them, and I also instructed them to do as I described above, to lend a small sum after filling out the Prozbul in order to really perform the mitzvah. Happy are Israel, lovers of God's commandments, who fulfil them with joy!

One should make it a practice on both nights of Rosh Hashanah to eating according to this order at his table: Dates are first. He should recite the blessing, "who has created the fruit of the tree," and eat a date [<i>tamrah</i>]. And afterward, he should say, "May it be His will that our enemies come to an end [<i>yitamu</i>]." Then one should eat a second date. And his intention should be for the lower enemies with this petition. And then he should eat beans [<i>rubiya</i>] — and that is what we call <i>lubia</i> in Arabic — and he should say, "May it be His will that our merits increase [<i>yirbu</i>]!" And according to that which the brilliant Magen Avraham wrote, that one should also make petitions according to the apparent meaning [of the sound of the Hebrew and Aramaic words] in the language of the country, we people of Baghdad who call it <i>lubia</i> should accordingly say, "May it be His will that our merits increase and You take us to heart [<i>telabevenu</i>]!" And it is like that which we are accustomed to saying two petitions with pumpkin [<i>kra</i>, "May it be His will that You rip up [<i>tikraa</i>] the bad decree of our punishment, and may our merits be read out [<i>yikreu</i>] before You," [the latter] being the meaning of the tearing, which is based on <i>kraa</i>. And likewise is it with the matter of beans in our country's language [Arabic]. And then one eats leeks [<i>karti</i>] and says, "that our enemies and haters be cut off [<i>yekaretu</i>)!" And with this, his intention should be for the evil forces created by the inequities of a person and the drops of seminal emissions that we have in mind with the recital of Shema at bedtime. And about them, it is said, those that inhabit a man's house are his enemies (alluding to Micah 7:6). And after the leeks, one eats the beets [<i>selek</i>] and says, "that our enemies be removed [<i>yistalku</i>], etc." And with this, his intention should be for the prosecutors and the forces of judgment that accuse [us] above. And afterward, he should eat the pumpkin and say, "that You rip up the bad decree of our punishment (and his intention should be for the name, <i>Karaa</i> [which refers to God's judgment]) and may our merits be read out before You!" And then one eats a sweet pomegranate and says, "that we should be as full of commandments as the pomegranate!" And then one should eat an apple cooked in sugar and say, "May it be His will that a sweet and good year be renewed upon us!" But we do not say, "like honey." And the later scholars, may their memory be blessed, wrote [that] the reason that we bring an apple [to the table] is as a hint about the field of holy apples from the secret of <i>See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field</i> (Genesis 27:27). And, with the help of the Heavens, it appears to me that the reason for the apple on Rosh Hashanah night is because the apple has three types of enjoyment, taste, appearance, and smell. And that is a good omen for our request for general bounty — which is 'life, children, and sustenance' — for the whole year. And, with the help of the Heavens, it also appears to me that there is another reason, according to that which is written in the Zohar, Parashat Shemini 40, about the verse: <i>refresh me with apples</i> (Song of Songs 2:5): The apple removes the wine, and directs [God's] will, such that the wine not cause damage. And that is [why] we eat an apple after the wine, so that the wine does not cause damage. Hence, people's custom is to dunk the apple into a cup of wine, as is written in the books. And it is known that wine is [considered indicative of the] restrictive powers [<i>gevurot</i>]. Yet now on Rosh Hashanah, our entire goal is to flavor and sweeten the restrictive powers. That is why we eat an apple. And, with the help of the Heavens, there is another reason that appears to me: It is found in the holy Zohar that the root of all the fruits is in Kingship [<i>Malkhut</i>], whereas only the root of the apple is in the Male, which is the secret of Splendor [<i>Tiferet</i>]. And this is as I have written in a preface [about this] in another place. And that which Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote is well known: That the months of summer, from Nissan to Tishrei, are in the Female, which is the secret of Kingship, whereas the months of winter are in the Male, which is the secret of Splendor. And that is why on Rosh Hashanah, which is the beginning of the months of the Male, we eat an apple, the root of which is in the Male.

Chapter 1

The Shabbat Candles: the obligation according to the Law is only (to light) one candle. However, according to the  mystical secret , it is necessary to light two candles, one against “remember!”, one against “keep!”. On top of that, they are also against the two letters ה that appear in the name הויה blessed be He, that represent the spheres of Binah and Malchut which in Gematria are equivalent to 563 as also it is when doing the Gematria of the quote “Enjoy in the splendor of the Schechina”. Punctilious people light seven candles and say: “the world against the seven lower sephirot hinted at [in the idea] of the week. And even those who light seven lights, with all this [which we said], when he comes home he should stare at daffka/exactly/particularly two candles, and he should intent that one of them is against [the word] “remember” and the other against [the word] “keep”. He should also intend that one of the candles represents the first ‘Hey’ [of the ‘HAVAYA’] and the other the last ‘Hey’ [of the HAVAYA]. He should also intend that the candles illuminate in the holiness of the upper world. 

Chapter 2

One should perform the of the lighting candles in the place where one eats, and the woman lights and blesses the lighting of the candles.  The sages however  ruled that one lights one candle in the place where one sleeps, as well as in the kitchen, and anywhere that one goes  in or out on Shabbat.  In all these places a woman should light without a blessing, and afterwards she should light in a place with a table/dining room with a blessing.  If a man wishes to light in his bedroom by himself, he receives a blessing, but he doesn’t bless, because his wife blesses the candles in the dining room.  And if he doesn’t have the means to purchase oil for Shabbat, he should acquire via begging, but for a man in this position one candles suffices.

Chapter 3

The candle of Shabbat and the wine for Kiddush:  the candle comes first; even though the kiddush is d’oraita, one can make Kiddush with  bread according to the Torah, and only according to the sages what is needed is wine. Thus the Shabbat candle comes first on account of the peace of his home. However, if he has just enough to buy either oil for one candle or for wine to sanctify, but has not enough to buy the second candle, he should not refrain from buying the wine because of the second candle, because the rule holds that one candle is enough.

Chapter 4

Even though you eat and do make kiddush on the roof-top, where the moonlight illuminates the table, nonetheless you have to light the shabbat candle and say a bracha over it, because although the pshat rationale of  lightning the shabbat candle is  “shlom bayit”, peace at home, there is an (additional) obligation because of the sod, the secret. Thus, I noted in my holy book “Mikavtze’el”, and look as well in the “Eshel-Avraham”, Ch. 263, small paragraph 21; look there. 

Chapter 5

A man and a woman are obligated equally in the mitzvah of the shabbat candle. But the woman is cautioned to a greater extent, and she also has the priority in that commandment over her husband. If the husband wants to light himself, she can obstruct his hand. However, if the husband wants to light in the place of sleeping - he is allowed to, but without blessing - as I wrote above. But it is the custom regarding a woman who gave birth - that the husband would light in the place of the table and bless on the first shabbat after giving birth. 

Chapter 6

It’s considered good that a husband prepares the lights before Shabbat, such as preparing the oil and the wick, as explained in the words of our teacher, the Ari, in his book, ‘Sefer HaKavanot’ and this is his wording: “Also you (the husband) should be meticulous in preparing the Shabbat candles, although the woman of the house is commanded to do so…” - His description finishes here.  We too are accustomed to set up and prepare the candles ourselves.

One has to be very careful in the prayer of Minchah of the holy Shabbat, for it has [the potential for] many ascents upwards. And even though there are siddurim in which it is written "And who is like Your nation Israel?"--the main idea is that one must say "like Your nation, like Israel" [and not "like Your nation Israel"], and just as [the author] wrote in Shalmei Chagigah in the name of Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach in Nagid UMitzvah, and so it is in the siddur of our master, Rabbi Shalom Shar'abi of blessed memory, which is found among us. And from the language of Sha'ar HaKavvanot [by Rabbi Chayyim Vital], which mentions "like Your nation Israel"--from this [citation] there is no proof in general. And I said, with the help of Heaven, that the language of "like Israel" is more correct, for in II Samuel 7[:23], it says "like Israel," and, in [I] Chronicles 17[:21], it says, "Israel," and therefore what our master Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach of blessed memory well wrote is correct, that we must say "like Israel"--on account of this being a verse from Prophets. And like this, we have found the pronouncing of 'Migdol yeshu'ot malko'  (II Samuel 22:51) in Birkat HaMazon, for on Shabbat, we say "Migdol," just as it is written in Prophets (II Samuel 22:51), and, on a profane day, "Magdil," just as it is written in Scriptures (Psalm 18:21).

Sour "Lemons" are forbidden by some when they are squeezed into an empty bowl, even if they will later be used for food, since in lands where many lemons grow, they are used to squeezing them for their juice, in order to prepare the drink known as <i>'Limonada'</i>, and they fill up barrels of juice for this purpose. Even though the blessed Shulchan Aruch allowed the squeezing of lemons, those who forbid it nowadays make sense, and therefore modern authorities forbid squeezing it into an empty vessel. However, one who wishes to prepare <i>'Limonada'</i>, which is a beverage made of squeezed lemons together with sugar and water, they should first put the sugar in a bowl and squeeze lemons over it, and only then pour over water. But do not put the water before the squeezing of the lemons. They have found a sign for this in the Torah (Genesis 28:12) "Behold, a ladder (<i>sulam</i>) standing on the earth". The word <i>Sulam</i> is the initials of the words Sugar, Lemon, Mayim (water), which is the order that the lemonade is to be made.

Chapter 1

Some of the works forbidden by the Torah are Writing and Erasing, and this prohibition refers not only to erasing letters when one is evidently liable, but also one is liable by only erasing some ink when one could instead in that same place write two letters. If the amount corresponds to only one letter, even though one is exempt from bringing the Hatat sacrifice and lapidation, this is still prohibited by the Torah as a “half measure” forbidden by the Torah. If a drop of ink remained on his hand since he was writing just before Shabbat, it is forbidden to wash it during Shabbat, but should cover it with a piece of cloth when doing netila, so the water does not touch it. And so is the ruling if he has on him color, that it is forbidden to wash it away.

Chapter 2

One who writes, although he is not liable according to the Torah but only in the case when writes with something permanent over a permanent thing (like engraving letters over stone), in all other cases it is still forbidding according to the rabbis, even if he writes with something not permanent over something not permanent (writing on snow with your finger). Therefore, it is forbidden to write with your finger using liquid over the table, or to leave an impression on the dust which is on the glass / cristal, or to leave an impression with the nails over a piece of paper, and also one should be careful not to leave an impression with a nail over a book in order to remember something, and even if he did leave an impression with no writing form whatsoever, this is still forbidden. 

Chapter 3

There is no such thing as dying food; therefore it is permitted to dip your bread on something liquid which has a colour itself  even if the bread gets coloured: and also it is permitted to give to put something that colours into food if there is no intention to colour it, but if there is an intention to colour it, it is also forbidden for the food itself, since one had the intention of dying it… and it is forbidden to put make-up on on the eyes on Shabbat, on account of colouring.

Chapter 4

Here in our city there is the costume of making white beer and red beer, sometimes we mix one with the other- we need to pay attention that the red does not colour the white one, because they want to make the white red on purpose. See “Nishmat-Adam”, part 4-3, see there. See “Eshil-Avraham”, comment 25, which forbade the commerce of brandy and liquor, from putting colour inside it so as others buy it, on account of getting benefit from it and so on and see there. And if you do the opposite, that is, put white into the red, as it is written in “Mahari Hagiz”, blessed be his memory, about putting the white in the red wine, I would hesitate in this leniency in a place where the intention is to dye the white, but only when there is no intention to dye the white, then in such cases it should be allowed to put the white in the red.

Squeezing of the  hair is not forbidden from the Torah because the hair is hard and does not absorb the water but squeezing the hair is forbidden according to the rabbis.  Whoever immerses in water on Shabbat, whether a man or a woman, they cannot wring their hair but should bring a large and special towel to wipe  and rub their face and their head with it. Even though the rubbing results in the  squeezing of the hair this is indirect [as with the back of your hand] squeezing.  Because the squeezing of the hair is rabbinical [and not forbidden from the Torah], the sages allowed to do it in this way, because it   is not possible [otherwise], and because it is indirect, and the water that is squeezed out is waste water. And nevertheless one should not rub with force, but caress it slowly, until the water that is in the hair is absorbed by the towel. And there are the pious who don’t rub their beard hair… When one drinks water or other beverages, it’s correct to be meticulous in not squeezing the mustache hair. But you can rub it with a towel.

An egg that was laid on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move.  But if you cover it with a vessel so it does not break, be careful not to touch it. And fruit that falls from the tree on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move them, and even in a  doubtful case it is forbidden. 

Chapter 11

One who spits into the wind, and the wind scatters the spit, it is forbidden, on account of its similarity to winnowing; even though there is no intention to do it- being unavoidable [that it will be winnowed], it is forbidden by the Rabbanan. And even though there are those who disagree with this, many Acharonim, blessed be their memory, are concerned with this.

Rinsing dishes to use on the same day, and even rinsing dishes on the night of Shabbat to be used the next day for Shacharit. After the third meal one should not wash dishes to be used on Hol-days during the week. Glasses however are allowed to be washed during Shabbat, since we could use them any moment. One should draw the attention of the people concerning the preparation of the beds, to prepare their beds during the day to be used in the night; during the summer when people usually prepare their beds on the tops of their houses in order to be fresher, since it is forbidden to do so. The person that reminds others and the reminded will be blessed.

It is the way of fava beans to draw insects when they are attached [to the ground]. And hence even though the space [inside the bean] is constraining and they certainly did not move, they are forbidden. And it is not necessary [to say] a complete insect, but even if a block spot is found, one must locate it and remove it, as it is forbidden like an actual insect. For the place that the insect begins to form turns into a black spot. And such is the practice in our city to look through it carefully, to remove [any] black spot.

Chapter 8

It is the way of figs and squash called "kier" in Arabic (cucumbers) and also those called "taarozi" (thin long cucumbers) to draw insects when they are attached [to the ground]. And likewise a fruit they call "koch" in Arabic (peach), and also Egyptian fava beans they call "lubia" (beans called "rubia" in Israel) and also cabbage they call "lahana" (kohlrabi with leaves) and also lettuce called "kas" (romaine lettuce) - it is the way of all of these to draw insects when they are attached. So they should not be eaten without examination. Furthermore, karpas (celery), leeks and also that which they call "madanos" (parsley) draw worms when they are attached, so they should not be eaten without examination. Radish leaves which they call "fagel" need a careful examination. And there are some greens that have many small insects and it is difficult to examine them, and these are what they call "selek" (beet leaves) and that which they call "nana" (mint) - one who guards his soul should distance himself from them! And here in our city they eat this "selek" and say that they examine it, but one who fears the Heavens should <i>yisalko</i> (remove it) from his home and should not have it come to his table! And in our home, the "selek" does not enter into food. Only on Rosh Hashanah, they bring it to the table only to look at it because of the supplication with it. And the rabbis of Aram Tzova (Syria), may God protect them completely, already forbade grape leaves, and examination is not effective for them. Likewise in our city, Baghdad, they are treated as forbidden. And there is a green in our city called "rashad" (a hot wild grass) and it grows in the desert. Hence, in Arabic, they call it "rashad al'bar. And there are some people that say that there are no insects in it and that insects are only found in "rashad" which is planted in a garden. But that is a lie! For there are insects even in that which grows by itself in the desert; so it requires examination. And likewise a green they call "keveg" (an herb for pickling) in Arabic, and its manner is to pickle it - there are insects in it as well; so it requires examination. And there are many insects commonly found in the grains of cumin, as was written by the Pri Chadash. Hence we do not eat cumin in our home at all! And we have written that the green they call "betneg" (a mint-like medicinal herb) in Arabic draws insects when it is attached. And with us, in our home, we let it wait twelve months, and eat it afterwards.

The foregoing only applies to fruit of which we are certain that no worms occur while growing. Fruit which may possibly become infested while still growing must be inspected and the insects removed. Since this prohibition is m’dorayta, any doubt that may arise is to be treated stringently. (BIH English - Yeshivat Ahavat Shalom)

And behold it is well known that the work of the refinement of the holy sparks which is incumbent upon man is hefty work. However the refinement of that which is living and that which is vegetative is more incumbent upon man than the refinement of that which is inanimate. The essence [of the latter] is in the hands of God, may He be blessed, as it is through rain - like our master, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote about the statement (Taanit 7a), "A rainy day is as great as the revival of the dead." For that is why they fixed the mention of rain in the blessing, "who revives the dead." For through the rain, the dead will be revived - they are the holy sparks in the inanimate that will rise from it, and that is their revival on the first level. And likewise did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say (Taanit 7a), "A rainy day is as great as the ingathering of the exiles" - for the holy sparks are gathered on it. However it is clear that there is more of a need incumbent upon man to refine the living and the vegetative, since he is to refine them through eating, as it is something edible. And therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded two commandments that are by way of a statute (<i>chok</i>). One is with the vegetative, which is forbidden mixtures (<i>kilayim</i>); and the other is with living flesh and that is milk and meat. For these two commandments are statutes that do not have explanations. As this is permissible by itself and that is permissible by itself, so why should they be forbidden when they are in a mixture? And it is well known that any commandment of the statute type which a man keeps has a gap in its performance, since the Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel and mock the statute commandment saying, "What is this commandment and what explanation is there about it?" And there will hence be help and support from it to overcome the husk and to break its power, to separate the holy spark from it that is absorbed amidst the evil part of the husk and mixed in with the vegetative and with the living. And that is why the numerical count (<i>gematria</i>) of statute  <i>chok</i> is that of <i>Geihinnom</i> - since through the performance of the statute, man extracts the good spark from the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>, which is the evil that is attached to it. So Israel is victorious. Hence a person must be careful about this statute concerning the prohibition of milk and meat, so that he not stumble in it, God forbid - even with something small in it. For through it, he will have a great boost with the refinement that he needs to refine from the food.

Wine becomes forbidden through the touch of a non-Jew as soon as the pressed grapes are separated from the juice. If a non-Jew scooped out a handful of grapes together with their juice, the juice is not forbidden, and may even be returned to the vat. However, if he were to scoop out a cup full of juice alone, the entire contents of the vat would become forbidden, as the process of separation has already started.

This immersion is on account of the ejection of impurity, so that the vessel will go out from its impurity to the holiness of Israel, similar to a convert who goes out from the domain of idolatry into the domain of Israel. Therefore, even if they are new, such that he bought them from a gentile artisan [who made them], he must [still] immerse them. And it is forbidden to use it without immersion, even for cold [food]. But if a Jew rented or borrowed a vessel from a gentile, it does not require immersion. And this is specifically with culinary vessels, since the verse is dealing with culinary vessels - as it is written (Numbers 31:23), "Anything that is placed on a fire, etc." And what is something that is placed on a fire and and one needs to make it fit (kosher) with a fire? I would say that is a culinary vessel that absorbs [flavor] with fire, and so requires fire for the ejection of what is absorbed.
