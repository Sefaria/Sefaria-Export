Introduction

Praised be the Creator and Glorified be the Designer, Who has caused us to inherit a hidden and precious thing of desire, wonderful wisdom, "For the Jews there was Light;"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ester 8:16</i> light is Torah, to labor in it and to heed to it.
Rabbi Shimon gave this introduction, saying (Zohar Vol. 3, daf 166b): "<i>Ayelet ahavim ve'ya'alat chen, dadeiha yeravukha bekhol 'et; be'ahavatah tishgeh tamid</i>/A lovely ewe and a graceful she-ibex, let her teats satisfy you at all times; with her love be involved (to the [partial] neglect of other matters) always. (Prov. 5:19)" Oraita! Oraita! (Torah! Torah!) the light of all the worlds! How many seas and rivers and wells and springs spread out from you to in all directions! From you is everything, by you the upper and lower [worlds] are sustained. His upper light goes out from you. Oraita! Oraita! what shall I say of you, <i>ayelet ahavim ve'ya`alat chen</i>, above and below are your mercies, whoever merits to acquire from you in the proper fashion. Oraita! Oraita! The delights of those who master you! Who can reveal and tell your secret and hidden things!
Master of Universe, let it be Your will to give strength and power to me and to all Yisrael, and let us enter in without shame before you and before the <i>Matronita `Ila'ah</i> (Higher Divine Presence), of which it is said, "<i>em-habanim smechah</i>/as joyful as a mother of children"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 113</i>. And let us not be in shame before the <i>Barta DiMalka</i> (Lower Divine Presence), of which it is said, "<i>kol kevudah bat melekh penimah</i>/all honor [shall be] for the King's daughter (His entourage) who is within (i.e. humble)," and of which it is said, "<i>Rabot banot `asu chayil, ve'at `alit `al kulanah</i>/Many women have acquired riches, but you surpass them all" (Prov. 31).
And being that the holy way of the genius who wrote <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> is very pleasant to me, who opened the preface with <i>Birkot Hatorah</i>/Blessings recited before learning Torah, I too, the humble one, shall also proceed in this straight way, and give thanks first in reciting the Birkot Hatorah:
Blessed are You Hashem, Our God King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us regarding <i>divrei</i>/words/matters of Torah. Now please make sweet, Hashem our God, the dirvei of Your Torah in our mouths, and in the mouths of Your people Yisrael. And be we and our offspring and the offspring of our offspring, all us us knowers of Your name and learning Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You Hashem, Who teaches Torah to His people Yisrael.
Blessed are You Hashem, our God King of the Universe, Who has chosen us from all the nations, and given us His Torah. Blessed are You Hashem, Who gives the Torah.
<i>Ki Hashem yiten chokhmah, mipiv da`at utevunah</i>/For Hashem gives wisdom; out of His mouth [comes] knowledge and understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 2:6</i> <i>Gal einai ve'abitah nifle'ot mitorarekha</i>/Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i> <i>Tov atah umeitiv ; lamdeini chukeikha</i>/Good and benevolent are You; teach me Your statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i> <i>Baruch atah Adonai, lamdeini chukeikha</i>/Blessed are You Hashem; teach me Your statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119</i>
Oraita Oraita! how beloved are your words, what a tree having roots, and having bark, and having brains, and having branches, and having foliage, and having flowers, and having buds; and also your words have simple meanings of the scripture, comparative meanings, clues, which hint wisdom, gematrias, hidden hints. Concealed hints, one on another, <i>kasher</i> (valid) and <i>pasul</i> (invalid), <i>tameh</i> (impure) and <i>tahor</i> (pure), <i>assur</i> (forbidden) and <i>mutar</i> (permitted), <i>chayav</i> (obligated) and <i>zakai</i> (entitled), and from thenceforth spread out branches to all sides, wide as the sea; you have no end or finish.
Oraita Oraita! This love and glow of flame of the heart for you! May it be the [Divine] will that you be engraved in on our hearts returning to you holy Torah. And your glory upon us holy Torah, your knowledge on us holy Torah, and our minds on you holy Torah, be not lifted from you, and do not part from us, not in this world and not in the coming world.
Blessed is our God who has created us for His glory, and separated us from those who err, and given us the Torah of truth, and planted eternal life among us, "<i>Mah ashiv laShem kol tagmuluhi `alai</i>/How can I return to Hashem all his benevolences toward me?"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 116</i>, Who has permitted me in His great mercies and great compassions, to serve in the "courtyards of the Temple of Hashem," in the place that our holy forefathers served, <i>nishmatam eden</i>/their souls in Paradise, in the permanent dwelling each and every Shabbat, when the children of Yisrael assemble there, to expound to them holy scriptures, which they read on their Shabbatot each parashah in its time, as its arrangement and order is given; <i>zot chuqat hatorah</i>/This is the statute of the Torah. Also including <i>drashahs</i> of the Haftarah readings, though my original [work] was review of the Torah, and as Hashem Yitbarakh graced me in His great compassion, to some produce <i>chidushim</i>/novel words by the way of <i>peshat</i> [basic explanation of the scripture] or <i>derash</i> [mystical explanation] or the <b>crown</b> of <i>remez</i>, I recorded the chidushim for reminder. And already in the year 5624 I printed from my chidushim with the help of Heaven a book small in quantity, on the Pentateuch, and I named it <i>Aderet Eliyahu</i> (the cape of Eliyahu<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 2</i>), and behold, from that time until now, praise to El Yitbarakh, the chidushei Torah increased from what Hashem bestowed to me, and because we have heard an admonition from the mouth of scribes and from the mouth of <i>sefarim</i>/holy books that a man is obligated to print his sefarim in his lifetime, I awakened myself to bring to the printhouse chidushei Torah in the way of drash and remez on the Pentateuch, because I reasoned that it is proper to advance this before other chidushei Torah, because it is food for every man, and it is a staple for every soul, and benefits the masses a bit more, but because the printing expenses were great, and I have not the financial means, I was forced to bring to print at this time only a little of my produce, one quarter of what I have by the grace of `El Eylon, and if Hashem Yitbarakh desires He will help me bring what remains with me in a separate book, because that which remains has a great quantity, and furthermore has also the chidushei Torah that I darshened on the verses of the Haftarot of the whole year; I have not brought one of the here, because due to their great quantity they are fit to be a large sefer by themselves, if Hashem helps.
Nonetheless I interlaced settled <i>halakhot</i>/laws of conduct throughout this collection, from all kinds of halakhot that are brought in the Shulchan Arukh "Orach Chayim" and "Yoreh De`ah," because I was already accustomed to publicly lecture also one these each and every Shabbat, because I immersed myself in the sefarim and enlightened my eyes with the words of our Sages of blessed memory, and I knew that the ancient way of our Rabbis the Rishonim [or "our early Rabbis"] z"l who would lecture to the people every Shabbat, that they would not make a constant [study] only on <i>aggada</i>/homily in the Midrashim and <i>peshatim</i>, but rather they also lectured them halakhot to let them know the statutes of God and His Torahs/instructions, to know the way they should go, and the things they should do, because likewise we find in the Gemara in Sanhedrin (daf 38), "Said Rabbi Yochanan, 'When Rabbi Meir would lecture on his piece, he would say one-third legal decisions, one-third aggada, one-third parables,'" see there. And likewise we find in our Rabbis z"l in Mekhilta, they bring the words of Rabbeinu Maharam Alshich z"l, at the beginning of <i>parashat</i>/the Torah portion Vayakhel, that Moshe Rabbeinu the servant of Hashem taught the children of Yisrael that they should gather on Shabbatot, to lecture to them the laws of Shabbat and His Torahs, see there. And likewise they said the same in the Gemara, "Moshe ordained for Yisrael, to teach the laws of Pesach at Pesach [time], laws of Atzeret at Atzeret [time], laws of the [Sukkot] Festival at Sukkot [time], and such is the report from several devotees in the Gemara, that their custom was to teach halakhot each and every Shabbat, and truthfully logical reasoning also requires this, to teach halakhot to the people, to know what Yisrael should do in the mitzvot of Hashem, and see Pri Chadash in Yoreh De`ah hilkhot Tol`ayim [laws regarding prohibition of eating worms], siman 84, that he wrote, verbatim, "And it is necessary to inspire and teach these matters to the people more that teaching them peshatim," end of quote.
Actually it is a known thing that to lecture on halakhot alone, the heart of the masses is not drawn after this, rather it is necessary to make the derash the root and most of it words of agadda and <i>mussar</i>/ethical teaching, and the lecturer should also mention in the middle the decided halakhot, through the tie that that he ties in the lecture that he says on the text, in order to draw the hearts of the people to these things in <i>chokhmah</i>/wisdom and <i>da`at</i>/knowledge, and this was the intention of our master the Tanna Rabbi Meir a"h, who wuold lecture a third in halakhot, a third in aggadot and a third in <i>mashalim</i>/allegories in order to draw the heart of the masses to hear the halakhot via two thirds of aggada and mashalim, and it seems to me the mashalim were in the manner of mussar, and so will you find in Shabbat daf 30: The question was asked of Rabbi Tanchum, "What does it mean to extinguish a lamp for a sick person on Shabbat?" And he opened with this introduction and said first some long words of aggada, and afterwards at the end of his words he gave them a short answer on the legal question mentioned, and Rashi z"l explains there, so were they accustomed to give an introduction with aggada first, in order to draw the hearts of the audience to hear the halakhah.
And likewise we find in the Gemara of Sotah daf 40: Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba happened uppon that place. Rabbi Chiya bar Abba spoke about halakhic decisions, and Rabbi Abbahu told aggada. Everybody abandoned Rabbi Chiya bar Abba, and came before Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Chiya was downcast. Rabbi Abahu said to him, "I will tell you a parable what this is like. To two men who come to a city, one selling gems and jewels, and one selling tinsel. Who do they jump to? Not to the one who sells tinsel!" See there. Hence the world chases after homiletics and peshatim, therefore you must proceed wisely according to the minds of people, namely to make most of the lecture in aggada and explanation of the scripture, and the lesser part words of halakhah absorbed into it in the middle or in the end, and this is the proper way.
Therefore I, the young one, after the year 5630, it came to my heart to mention in the lecture on the parashah that I am publicly speaking each Shabbat, some halakhot from matters mentioned in the Orach Chayim and Yoreh De`ah, and I would tie the beginnings of the halakhot with the lecture on the Torah, and after the halakhot I would end the lecture with verses of the Haftarah. However it was not possible to finish all the halakhot that I decided to teach on every Shabbat in one year, rather they needed a length of two years, as they are organized in the eyes of the reader in the second part of this book, and every two years they are to be repeated, and therefore I made the halakhot with their ties in separate parts, Part One and Part Two, and brought them to the printhouse to join them with the lectures that are in this book, so that the eyes of the Tzadikim should see straight [ways]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 17:2</i>, and also in the halakhot I mentioned I omitted for now several halakhot from the first part and the second part, due to the expense of printing, and if Hashem helps, in the halakhot part too there will be a later edition, and they will come in a separate book.
And behold since I named my book on Talmud discourses <b>" Ben Yehoyada"</b> -- which I have not yet printed but only on two tractates -- and Hashem Yitbarakh allow me to print all of it for good life and peace -- I chose to call this book <b>"Ben Ish Chai"</b>. And Hashem Yitbarakh help me to print the rest of the books which He has graced me in His great compassion and great kindness. And the name of the man who donated money for printed expenses shall be displayed at the end of this introduction in a certain form on his good name. Hashem Yitbarakh make his days and life long, long good and sweet life, Amen so let it be [His] will.
And from now on, behold I reveal my mind and will with all my heart and soul, that my whole intention in this collection, and also in all the collections that Hashem Yitbarakh allowed me to assemble in the Written Torah and in Oral Torah, it is all for the unification of Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and in awe and love and in fear and love, to unify the name of Hashem, Y"H with W"H, in complete unity, in the name of all Yisrael, and all my reasoning and thought and speech that is not according to the His will Yitbarakh, let them be null and anulled, so that all my desire in this collection, and the other collections that I do in chidushei Torah wit the help of heaven, and also any mitzvah that I do, it be in order to unify Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and to rest of spirit before Him Yitbarakh specifically, without any outward turning, and Hashem Yitbarakh in His compasion help me to learn and teach Torah for its own sake, Amen so may it be [His] will.
And since my proclamation is steadfast, in truth and in faith, before Hashem Yitbarakh, and in the eyes of all Yisrael<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">לעיני כל ישראל, the last words of the Torah, Deut. 34:12</i> a declaration great and strong, valid and lasting, I will prolong my prayer before Hashem, Please Hashem save us [from affliction], Please Hashem make us successful [in our deeds]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 118</i>, and establish the fallen Sukkah of David, and let the Redeemer come to Tziyon, righteous [in deeds] and victorious is he<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. 9:9</i>, and let our eyes see the coming of our Righteous Mashiach, and the rebuilding of our Holy Temple, soon in our days, and let the pleasantness of Hashem our God be on us, and the work of our hands, establish for us (w/o mishap to us), and the work of our hands, establish it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 90</i>, and let the great name of Y-H be magnified and sanctified speedily and soon, Amen so let it be [His] will.
These are the words of the youth who awaits the salvation of Hashem, and who trusts in His great compassions and His great mercies; may he illuminate my eyes with His Torah, the Torah of <b>Chaim/Life</b>:
The junior, <b>Yosef Chaim</b>, son of His Honor Our Great Teacher Rabbi <b>Eliyahu</b>, son of His Honor Our Great Teacher Rabbi <b>Moshe Chaim</b>, Sefardi Tahor<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, having none in his lineage who converted in the Spanish Inquisitions</i>.

Introduction

"And Hashem-Elohim made for Adam and his wife honorable garments from [animal] hides, and dressed them." Behold it is known, what Rabbeinu the Arizal wrote regarding the garments of Adam haRishon. Before the <i>chet</i> ["sin," lit. missing-the-mark], there were <i>ketonet ohr</i>/garments of light from the Chashmal and when he sinned he lost those clothings of Chashmal which are 378 lights, gematria of chashmal, and He made him a different clothing from klipat nogah which are the <i>ketonet `or</i>/garments of hide, as mentioned in Etz Chayim Shaar 106 Amud 4, q.v., also the Arizal wrote in Sha`ar Hakavanot regarding the intentions in the [morning blessing] "<i>malbish `arumim</i>/Who dresses the bare," that the clothing of a man is from <i>kedushah</i>/holiness, and through transgressions that one does he causes the klipot to have a grip on the garments, and behold the garments have an <i>ohr hamakif</i> ["surrounding light;" aura] outside them as known, because there is an inner light inside included which is included in the body, and the clothings surrounds the body and over the clothing are the orot hamakifim and they stand outside the garments, and for each and every garment there is an aspect of ohr makif according to its value, and there is nothing that pushes off the klipot as much as ohr makif, since the klipot have no ability to feed from and take grip on the ohr hamakif, and therefore it stands outside and he has no fear of the klipot etc., see there.  
And behold by this is understood the jealousy of the <i>nachash</i>/serpent who was jealous of Adam Harishon before the chet and provoked him to make him stumble, because he was jealous of his ketonet ohr since he saw he had a great ohr makif around him according to the value of the ketonet ohr, and he had no grip on the ohr makif, in the <i>sod</i>/secret, and the nachash was <i>`arum</i>/bare as it says, and therefore he provoked him to make him stumble and he caused that the ketonet ohr be removed from him and for `or to be instead of ohr, as it is written, "<i>Vaya`as Hashem Elohim le'adam ve'ishto kotnot `ohr vayalbishem</i>/And Hashem Elohim made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them," and they said in the Holy Zohar that serpent skin clung to him, and with this I explained the remez of the scripture in the word "<i>vayalbishem</i>," reading it as "<i>vai levusham</i>/Woe for their clothing!", it was the serpent skin; it was "<i>vai</i>" because it clung to them, which was all due to the chet, and it seems to me, bsd, the difference between "<i>ohr</i>" and "<i>`or</i>" is a gematria of 69, gematria of <i>yagon</i>/grief, and it is known that grief is from the side of the <i>sitra achra</i> as is known is the intention in <i>vehaser mimenu yagon ve'anachah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">[1]</sup><i class="footnote"> from <i>hashiva shofteinu</i> in the `<i>Amidah</i> prayer</i> which is the force of impurity aliased <i>yagon</i> and the force of impurity aliased <i>anachah</i>, as mentioned in the siddur of the Rashash z"l, and therefore we find that <i>evyon</i>/impoverished and <i>yagon</i> are the same gematria, because someone who becomes evyon of mitzvot, yagon clings to him, as the two letters aleft-vet become gimel, and then the letters of evyon become the letters of yagon, but in the future when the <i>tikkun</i>/perfection is completed the yagon will be removed completely and then the count of yagon will be missing from the letter `ayin of `or/skin, and what will remain is aleph, and then there will be the reunion of ohr/light as the crown returns to its old place: What follows from the above is that the <i>chitzonim</i>  ["outside;" forces that are outside of kedushah] have no grip on the ohr hamakif, which is why the serpent was jealous of Adam Harishon because of his ohr hamakif which he was bare of since he had no grip on it, behold from this is understood bsd the reason that the mitzvah of tzitzit is effective in remembering the mitzvot of Hashem as it is written, "<i>u're'item oto u'zechartem et kol mitzvot Hashem</i>/and you shall see it and remember all the mitzvot of Hashem"<sup class="footnote-marker">[2]</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 15</i>. The reason is the tzitzit are aspect of ohr makif as Rabeinu the Arizal wrote, and therefore it has power to repel the klipot and since it repels the klipot therefore it aids memory, for it is known what Rabeinu z"l wrote in the Kavanot regarding the secret of the garments that a man wears, that it is necessary to be careful to not put on two garments simultaneously, and doing so breeds forgetfulness, and the secret of the thing is that each garment has an aspect of ohr hamakif, and nothings repels the klipot like the ohr hamakif, since they are unable to feed from them and grip them, and therefore one who joins two garments and dons them together does not leave a space for the ohr hamakif to enter between the two garments to surround each garment, and thereby the klipot are not repelled from there, and it is known that forgetfulness does not happen except because of the klipot, because memory is from the side of kedushah in the sod of "<i>ein shikhechah lifnei kise kevodekha</i>/nothing is forgotten before Your throne of glory,"<sup class="footnote-marker">[3]</sup><i class="footnote">Berakhot 32b and Yamim Nora'im prayers</i> end quote, q.v.. And from this it is understood the beautiful reason why the tzitzit because it is the aspect of ohr makif therefore it has power to push off the klipot and thereby forgetfulness is repelled and memory dominates, by one's seeing and remembering the mitzvot of Hashem, because by seeing it, via the contemplations related to it the illumination of the ohr hamakif is stimulated which is the sod of the tzitzit. And therefore tzitzit is gematria "<i>beit ya`akov</i>", of which we say "<i>beit ya`akov lekhu ve nelekhah be'ohr Hashem</i>/House of Ya`akov go and let us walk in the light of Hashem"<sup class="footnote-marker">[4]</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 2:5, recited in morning prayers</i>, because the grip of the ohr hamakif which is the sod of tzitzit is only for Yisrael who are the Beit Ya`akov, and on this we say "<i>va'esa etchem `al kanfei nesharim</i>/And I shall lift you up on wings of eagles..."<sup class="footnote-marker">[5]</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 19:4</i> but when the tikkun is finished "<i>...ve'avi etchem elai</i>/and I shall bring you to Me," i.e. you will perceive everthying, even regarding the tallit; [also] <i>elai</i> is spelled <i>el-yud</i> (to the yud) which is the sod of chokhmah.





Chapter 1

Before saying the <i>berachah</i>/blessing and wrapping [yourself in the tzitzit] direct your thoughts to fulfill the positive commandment to wear tzitzit that are fringed according to halakhah, as it says "And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments."<sup class="footnote-marker">[6]</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 15</i>, which is a positive time bound commandment. And be means of this <i>kavanah</i>/intention there will be power in his preparation in the berachah to raise the <i>mayin nukvin</i> and to draw down the <i>mochin</i> as Rabbeinu haRashash wrote in <i>Nahar Shalom</i>, and therefore it is good to say with his mouth before the berakhah "<i>Leshem yichud kudsha brikh hu ushekhinteh</i>/For the unification of the Holy Blessed One and His Shekhinah" etc. "<i>Hareini muchan lilvosh tzitzit metzuyetzet kehalakhah kemo shetzivanu Hashem Eloheinu 'Ve'asu lehem tzitzit `al kanfei bigdeihem kedei la`asot nachat ruach leyotzreinu</i>/I declare myself ready to don tzitzit fringed according to halakhah as Hashem Eloheinu commanded us 'And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments'" in order to bring satisfaction to our Designer etc. And also he needs to have kavanah at the time of wrapping in them that Hakadosh Barukh Hu commanded us to wrap in them in order that we remember all His mitvot, to perform them, and the Acharonim z"l have written that whoever does not do so, of him is said, "<i>va'tehi yir'atam oti mitzvat anashim melumdah</i>/Their fear of Me was like commandments of men done by rote."

Chapter 2

One should say the berachah "<i>lehit`atef betzitzit</i>" with a <i>shva</i> under the <i>beit</i>, not a <i>patach</i> [i.e. betzitzit and not batzitzit], and it is necessary to direct intention during the berachah over the <i>tallit gadol</i>/large tallit to exempt the <i>tallit katan</i>/small tallit that is on him that he did not remove during the night, because there is a <i>svara</i>/rationale that one might need to say a berakhah on the tallit katan in the morning, but because of <i>safek berakhot lehakel</i> [if doubtful of a berakhah, be lenient] we do not say it. And I wrote in my holy sefer Mekabtziel that if one makes that kavanah then it applies to the other, and it is not necessary to handle the tallit katan at the time of the berakhah also according to the opinion of Maran z"l, and therefore since forgetfulness happens with people and they wander and do not have kavanah sometimes, therefore it is proper to accustom oneself to add the <i>nusach</i>/phrasing "<i>leshem yichud kusha brikh hu u'shekhinteh..</i>" mentioned above, as well as these words, "<i>Hareinu muhcan levarekh `al `atifat hatalit ketikun chazal/I declare myself ready to say the berakhah on wrapping in a tallit as our Sages ordained," and "</i>hareini mechavin liftor bavrakhah zu gam hatalit katan she`alai<i>/I declare that I intend to exempt with this berakhah also the tallit katan that is on me."</i>

Chapter 3

Before saying the berakhah one should see and check the strings of the tzitzit that they should have no missing part that disqualifies, and also separate the tzitzit by hand so that they not be tangled. And only on Shabbat he should not distangle them but only check them. Also further one should be careful to check each day and look at the strings at the top at the foundation at the hole, because if even one is severed there they are is disqualified. And in a pressing time, when he is late to come or the <i>tzibur</i>/congregation is waiting for him to do <i>petichat haheichal</i>/opening the ark or to read the Torah he can rely on a chazakah and not check that time. And likewise one who is traveling and unable to repair, the Acharonim have written that one could rely on a chazakah and not check.

Chapter 4

Also one should be careful to check the tallit katan beforehand, and in this also his wife should help him in the mitzvah, that she should be careful to check the tallit katan when she summons the clothes for her husband to change them, and she should be careful likewise the separate the strings because due to washing they will certainly be tangled, and then she will get reward for the mitzvah to save her husband from a prohibition, because sometimes a man is panicked to don clothes and does not check. But nonetheless he should not rely on his wife, but check and afterwards say the berakhah.

Chapter 5

The order of wrapping in the tallit gadol is as follows. After finishing the berekhah wrap only your head with it, and not like those who are overwise and wrap their entire bodies initially, because we only have the words of Rabeinu the Arizal. And after you have wrapped your head let the four wings go down the shoulders towards your front, two to the right and two to the left. Then first grab the two on the right and cast them behind you to the left, so that they be wrapped around your neck over your left shoulder to the back, while the two left ones remain hanging in front of you, and wait the short time length of walking fouramot or slightly less, then follow by sending the left ones also behind you to the left, so that now all four corners are hanging behind you together on the left, and wait the time of walking four amot and then let the tallit that is wrapped around your neck go down over all your body. And now you will be wrapped in it, your head and body together. Such is the way it is detailed in <i>Sefer Hakavanot, drush hatzitzit</i> perek 1, and as the Rav El"Y [? ] z"l beautifully explained on daf 107 amud 4, and likewise explicitly stated in the siddur of Rabeinu haRashash z"l. And what he wrote that one should wait between throwing the two right ones and the two left ones, a time length of walking 4 amot, is not explained explicitly in the words of Rabeinu z"l and in the words of the Rashash z"l, but because it is explained there that it is necessary to do kavanot in that part by itself, and kavanot in the other part by itself, thus the throwing of the the first two while the two left ones are still hanging in front has a matter to it by itself. And we do not make these kavanot, therefore it suffices for us to wait the time of walking four amot, in order to fulfill the precept of this matter, and as written "<i>`eder `eder levado</i>/each flock by itself... and put a space between one flock and the other."<sup class="footnote-marker">[7]</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 32</i>.

Chapter 6

The tallit gadol and tallit katan, in either case say the berakhah standing. And the custom of Rabeinu the Arizal is that he also wrap his head first with the tallit katan, and afterwards let it down on his body, and therefore he would say a berakhah of "<i>lehit`atef</i>" for the tallit katan. And whoever does this, it is good, however whoever does not wrap his head but immediately lets it down over his body and dons it, should say the berakhah <i>`al mitzvat tzitzi</i>" and not say "<i>lehit`atef</i>."

Chapter 7

One who dons a new tallit should say the berekhah "<i>shehechiyanu</i>" after the berakhah of "<i>lehit`atef</i>," but for a tallit katan we do not say "<i>shehechiyanu</i>" because the common way is not to make it of valuable material so that he rejoice in it, but if one makes it from a valuable material that he rejoices in, he should say <i>shehechiyanu</i>.

Chapter 8

One need not bother to make some sign on the tallit to always place one side of the tallit on his head and not the other way, as some are accustomed to do and make a sign, because it is explicit in the words of the Arizal that we need not bother, and therefore one can don it as it comes to him.

Chapter 9

One should be careful to never remove the tallit katan from him at any time, neither during sleep, neither during marital relations, but only when he enters the bathhouse remove it, or when he enters the toilet room and he has no outer garment on him covering the tallit katan, then he should cover and conceal the tzitzit on it so they not hang openly.

Chapter 10

If he removed the tallit gadol in order to enter the toilet room or for some other business with the intention of putting it back on immediately, he need not say the blessing over it again. Even though Maran z"l reasons that one should recite it, we maintain "<i>safek berakhot lehakel</i>/if in doubt, do not recite a berakhah," and even against the reasoning of Maran z"l. This too is the rule with the tallit katan if he removed in to go in to immerse [in a <i>mikvah</i>], he should not say a berakhah when he dons it when he goes out, due to <i>safek berakhot lehakel</i>, and even though it is explicitly stated in <i>Sefer Hakavanot</i> of Rabeinu the Arizal that his practice was to say the berakhah on the tallit katan after immersion, and we do not say that <i>safek berakhot</i> takes precedence over Rabeinu the Arizal, anyhow it could be said that Rabeinu the Arizal is different, because he would linger in the immersion and do many kavanot, so that some <i>hesech da`at</i>/diversion of mind is made. However if he removes it in order to enter the bath where he will stay long, it is preferable to say the berakhah as the Arizal did. This is what I brought up in my holy book <i>Mekabtzi`el</i>. But if he changes his clothes and dons a different tallit katan, even if he dons it immediately after removing the first one, he should say the berakhah on the new one, an this too is the rule with a tallit gadol if he removes the one that is on him and dons a different tallit gadol, he should say the berakhah on the second one. And in my holy book <i>Rav Pe`alim</i> I wrote a responsa bs"d, regarding someone whose practice it is to don tzitzit and tefilin each day in his house, in order to enter the synagogue in tzitzit and tefilin, but because he walks in pathways where many people pass back and forth, those of the Brit and those who are not of the Brit, he does not don the tallit gadol that he has in the synagogue, because it is visible to people, but instead he has a very thin tallit that large enough to be a tallit gadol but is not very big, and he dons in his house under his coat, and because it is very fine and also because it is not long it is not visible to people who apss by, and when he enters the synagogue he leaves this one on him under his coat, and dons the tallit gadol that he has, and I brought up bs"d that he can say the berakhah in the synagogue on the second tallit, even though the first one is on him that he said a blessing over in his house, because there is a gap between [going from] his house to the synagogue, and also there is a <i>hesech da`at</i> since he says verses by the mezuzah, and furthermore it takes him much time to walk the path, and there in the synagogue he dons a different tallit that is full-sized, wrapping his head and body, while the tallit that is on him rests on his shoulder and legs, and also I found other reasons regarding this why he should say the berakhah, so one should not have any doubt on this regarding <i>safek berakhot</i>.
