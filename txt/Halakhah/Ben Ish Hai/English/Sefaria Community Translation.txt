And a man of Levi went, and took a daughter of Levi - it appears to me, with the help of heaven, that the letters in Levi, written in full as Lamed Vav Yud sums up Ayin [the are letters spelled out in full, and then the letters in the spelling out are added up, not including the letters themselves, so if לוי is למ"ד וא"ו יו"ד, we add up: / מ"ד – 44/א"ו – 7 /ו"ד – 10 for a total of 61 = אין ], and it is known that every letter in their full form is called House (Bayit), and Amram merited to take the characteristic of humility, which is Ayin, which is hinted at in "house of Levi", that is, in the letters of Levi, in their full form, they are called Houses, and this is how he merited to take a daughter from Levi that gave birth to Moshe, our teacher, peace be upon him whose humility surpassed any living person, and he seized the characteristic of Ayin to its fullest. Or you can understand "he took a daughter of Levi" because the letter in its full form is called daughter or son of the simple letter, as it is known, and we know what the Ari of blessed memory wrote, that when Amram took his wife this time, the soul of Chava mixed itself in her, and that is why this was like a new marriage, and her youth returned to her, and this is the secret of "and the woman conceived", that is to say the idea is that the first woman, which was in the world, see there, and also note that Chava plus Yocheved sum up 61 like the full form of Levi. And this is why it says "and he took a daughter of Levi", this is a hint to "Chava Yocheved" which is hinted by the full form, which is called "daughter" in the simple reading.

Introduction







Chapter 1

Before saying the berachah/blessing and wrapping [yourself in the tzitzit] direct your thoughts to fulfill the positive commandment to wear tzitzit that are fringed according to halakhah, as it says "And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments.," which is a positive time bound commandment. And by means of this kavanah/intention there will be power in his preparation in the berachah to raise the mayin nukvin and to draw down the mochin as Rabbeinu haRashash wrote in Nahar Shalom, and therefore it is good to say with his mouth before the berakhah "Leshem yichud kudsha brikh hu ushekhinteh/For the unification of the Holy Blessed One and His Shekhinah" etc. "Hareini muchan lilvosh tzitzit metzuyetzet kehalakhah kemo shetzivanu Hashem Eloheinu 'Ve'asu lehem tzitzit `al kanfei bigdeihem kedei la`asot nachat ruach leyotzreinu/I declare myself ready to don tzitzit fringed according to halakhah as Hashem Eloheinu commanded us 'And they shall make for themselves fringes on the wings of their garments'" in order to bring satisfaction to our Designer etc. And also he needs to have kavanah at the time of wrapping in them that Hakadosh Barukh Hu commanded us to wrap in them in order that we remember all His mitvot, to perform them, and the Acharonim z"l have written that whoever does not do so, of him is said, "va'tehi yir'atam oti mitzvat anashim melumdah/Their fear of Me was like commandments of men done by rote."

Chapter 2

One should say the berachah "lehit`atef betzitzit" with a shva under the beit, not a patach [i.e. betzitzit and not batzitzit], and it is necessary to direct intention during the berachah over the tallit gadol/large tallit to exempt the tallit katan/small tallit that is on him that he did not remove during the night, because there is a svara/rationale that one might need to say a berakhah on the tallit katan in the morning, but because of safek berakhot lehakel [if doubtful of a berakhah, be lenient] we do not say it. And I wrote in my holy sefer Mekabtziel that if one makes that kavanah then it applies to the other, and it is not necessary to handle the tallit katan at the time of the berakhah also according to the opinion of Maran z"l, and therefore since forgetfulness happens with people and they wander and do not have kavanah sometimes, therefore it is proper to accustom oneself to add the nusach/phrasing "leshem yichud kusha brikh hu u'shekhinteh.." mentioned above, as well as these words, "Hareinu muhcan levarekh `al `atifat hatalit ketikun chazal/I declare myself ready to say the berakhah on wrapping in a tallit as our Sages ordained," and "hareini mechavin liftor bavrakhah zu gam hatalit katan she`alai/I declare that I intend to exempt with this berakhah also the tallit katan that is on me."

Chapter 3

Before saying the berakhah one should see and check the strings of the tzitzit that they should have no missing part that disqualifies, and also separate the tzitzit by hand so that they not be tangled. And only on Shabbat he should not distangle them but only check them. Also further one should be careful to check each day and look at the strings at the top at the foundation at the hole, because if even one is severed there they are is disqualified. And in a pressing time, when he is late to come or the tzibur/congregation is waiting for him to do petichat haheichal/opening the ark or to read the Torah he can rely on a chazakah and not check that time. And likewise one who is traveling and unable to repair, the Acharonim have written that one could rely on a chazakah and not check.

Chapter 4

Also one should be careful to check the tallit katan beforehand, and in this also his wife should help him in the mitzvah, that she should be careful to check the tallit katan when she summons the clothes for her husband to change them, and she should be careful likewise the separate the strings because due to washing they will certainly be tangled, and then she will get reward for the mitzvah to save her husband from a prohibition, because sometimes a man is panicked to don clothes and does not check. But nonetheless he should not rely on his wife, but check and afterwards say the berakhah.

Chapter 5

The order of wrapping in the tallit gadol is as follows. After finishing the berekhah wrap only your head with it, and not like those who are overwise and wrap their entire bodies initially, because we only have the words of Rabeinu the Arizal. And after you have wrapped your head let the four wings go down the shoulders towards your front, two to the right and two to the left. Then first grab the two on the right and cast them behind you to the left, so that they be wrapped around your neck over your left shoulder to the back, while the two left ones remain hanging in front of you, and wait the short time length of walking four amot or slightly less, then follow by sending the left ones also behind you to the left, so that now all four corners are hanging behind you together on the left, and wait the time of walking four amot and then let the tallit that is wrapped around your neck go down over all your body. And now you will be wrapped in it, your head and body together. Such is the way it is detailed in Sefer Hakavanot, drush hatzitzit perek 1, and as the Rav El"Y [? ] z"l beautifully explained on daf 107 amud 4, and likewise explicitly stated in the siddur of Rabeinu haRashash z"l. And what he wrote that one should wait between throwing the two right ones and the two left ones, a time length of walking 4 amot, is not explained explicitly in the words of Rabeinu z"l and in the words of the Rashash z"l, but because it is explained there that it is necessary to do kavanot in that part by itself, and kavanot in the other part by itself, thus the throwing of the first two while the two left ones are still hanging in front has a matter to it by itself. And we do not make these kavanot, therefore it suffices for us to wait the time of walking four amot, in order to fulfill the precept of this matter, and as written "`eder `eder levado/each flock by itself... and put a space between one flock and the other."

Chapter 6

The tallit gadol and tallit katan, in either case say the berakhah standing. And the custom of Rabeinu the Arizal is that he also wrap his head first with the tallit katan, and afterwards let it down on his body, and therefore he would say a berakhah of "lehit`atef" for the tallit katan. And whoever does this, it is good, however whoever does not wrap his head but immediately lets it down over his body and dons it, should say the berakhah `al mitzvat tzitzi" and not say "lehit`atef.

Chapter 7

One who dons a new tallit should say the berekhah "shehechiyanu" after the berakhah of "lehit`atef," but for a tallit katan we do not say "shehechiyanu" because the common way is not to make it of valuable material so that he rejoice in it, but if one makes it from a valuable material that he rejoices in, he should say shehechiyanu.

Chapter 8

One need not bother to make some sign on the tallit to always place one side of the tallit on his head and not the other way, as some are accustomed to do and make a sign, because it is explicit in the words of the Arizal that we need not bother, and therefore one can don it as it comes to him.

Chapter 9

One should be careful to never remove the tallit katan from him at any time, neither during sleep, neither during marital relations, but only when he enters the bathhouse remove it, or when he enters the toilet room and he has no outer garment on him covering the tallit katan, then he should cover and conceal the tzitzit on it so they not hang openly.

Chapter 10

If he removed the tallit gadol in order to enter the toilet room or for some other business with the intention of putting it back on immediately, he need not say the blessing over it again. Even though Maran z"l reasons that one should recite it, we maintain "safek berakhot lehakel/if in doubt, do not recite a berakhah," and even against the reasoning of Maran z"l. This too is the rule with the tallit katan if he removed in to go in to immerse [in a mikvah], he should not say a berakhah when he dons it when he goes out, due to safek berakhot lehakel, and even though it is explicitly stated in Sefer Hakavanot of Rabeinu the Arizal that his practice was to say the berakhah on the tallit katan after immersion, and we do not say that safek berakhot takes precedence over Rabeinu the Arizal, anyhow it could be said that Rabeinu the Arizal is different, because he would linger in the immersion and do many kavanot, so that some hesech da`at/diversion of mind is made. However if he removes it in order to enter the bath where he will stay long, it is preferable to say the berakhah as the Arizal did. This is what I brought up in my holy book Mekabtzi`el. But if he changes his clothes and dons a different tallit katan, even if he dons it immediately after removing the first one, he should say the berakhah on the new one, an this too is the rule with a tallit gadol if he removes the one that is on him and dons a different tallit gadol, he should say the berakhah on the second one. And in my holy book Rav Pe`alim I wrote a responsa bs"d, regarding someone whose practice it is to don tzitzit and tefilin each day in his house, in order to enter the synagogue in tzitzit and tefilin, but because he walks in pathways where many people pass back and forth, those of the Brit and those who are not of the Brit, he does not don the tallit gadol that he has in the synagogue, because it is visible to people, but instead he has a very thin tallit that large enough to be a tallit gadol but is not very big, and he dons in his house under his coat, and because it is very fine and also because it is not long it is not visible to people who apss by, and when he enters the synagogue he leaves this one on him under his coat, and dons the tallit gadol that he has, and I brought up bs"d that he can say the berakhah in the synagogue on the second tallit, even though the first one is on him that he said a blessing over in his house, because there is a gap between [going from] his house to the synagogue, and also there is a hesech da`at since he says verses by the mezuzah, and furthermore it takes him much time to walk the path, and there in the synagogue he dons a different tallit that is full-sized, wrapping his head and body, while the tallit that is on him rests on his shoulder and legs, and also I found other reasons regarding this why he should say the berakhah, so one should not have any doubt on this regarding safek berakhot.

Introduction







Chapter 1

There are three kinds of tallit. The first is of lamb and sheep's wool. On this kind of tallit, one should also make the tzitzit of this kind of wool, and this is the Torah obligation according to all opinions, and according to everyone, wearing this fulfills the positive mitzvah of the Torah: 
The second kind of tallit is from cotton or silk, and regarding this there is a disagreement in which some say the obligation is from the Torah and some say the obligation is from the Rabbis, and also for those who say that it is a rabbinic obligation one can bless upon it as one would for rabbinic mitzvot, and regarding the tzitzit even though according to our teacher and his people you can affix tzitzit of lamb's wool onto other kinds of garments, nonetheless, if the tallit is made of a good kind of wool upon which one could affix tzitzit of the same kind of material (i.e. cotton), since according to the Maharam meRotenburg and his people, we don't dismiss wool tzitzit that are on a different kind of garment, and therefore in order to fulfill the obligation according to the aforementioned disagreement, one should affix tzitzit of the same material as the garment. However, all of this is specifically in a case in which the tallit is cotton and then one affixes cotton tzitzit, but if the tallit is silk, it is hard to find silk tzitzit that were made correctly. Since I've heard of one particular person who brought silk... because with silk, the throwing and pulling must be for the sake of the mitzvah, because the throwing and pulling of silk is like spinning wool... therefore it is hard to find proper silk tzitzit...and even though... it seems that this opinion is not in accordance with that particular

Chapter 3

A leather tallith does not require ziziyoth, according to any halachic authority, since a garment which is not woven is not considered a garment, as far as the laws of zizith are concerned.   

Chapter 4



Chapter 5



Chapter 6

A garment that does not have four corners is exempt from the requirement to affix fringes. And if the garment has five corners or more must [have fringes affixed]. However, [for a garment with more than four corners, do not affix fringes to all the corners, but just to four corners. And one must be careful to affix the fringes onto the four corners that are farthest away from each other, because those that are farthest from each other meet the definition of "corners" more so than corners that are closer to each other. And if one affixed [fringes to] more than four corners, they will have transgressed [the negative commandment of] not adding [to the commandments of the Torah] when adorning such a garment. Nevertheless, one should be careful to distance themselves from a garment like this and not wear a garment that has more than four corners, even if one affixes fringes to only four of the corners, as certain authorities disagree and exempt such a garment [with more than four corners] from the requirement to affix fringes.

Four sections are in the tefillin: <i>Kadesh</i> (Exodus 13:1-10); <i>VeHaya ki Yiviecha</i> (Exodus 13:11-16); <i>Shema</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); and <i>VeHaya im Shemoa</i> (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). And that is the order of their placement according to Rashi, may his memory be blessed. However, according to the understanding of Rabbenu Tam, may his memory be blessed, their order is <i>Kadesh; VeHaya ki Yiviecha; VeHaya im Shemoa</i>; and <i>Shema</i>. But the practice is according to the Rashi's understanding, may his memory be blessed. And the Levush, may his memory be blessed, wrote that once the stand over Ezekiel the prophet's tomb, may his memory be blessed, fell and they found old tefillin there which were [arranged] according to the order of Rashi. So at the beginning, they thought this disagreement was like other disagreements in which one understanding was dispelled. But our teacher, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, came along and said from a tradition spoken by Eliyahu, his memory should be for the good, that both understandings are true and that one should [follow] both of them; and that they would wear two pairs from the days of our teacher, Moshe, up until the Geonim. And so is it found in the Gemara (Eruvin 95b), "there is room on the head to place two pairs." And in the Zohar Chadash it is found that there were some people who would put on two pairs based on the doubt, "as they did not know this secret that both are required." Hence one who fears the Heavens should make two pairs of tefillin, one like the understanding of Rashi and one like the understanding of Rabbenu Tam. And he should grab both of them in his hand and bring them up on his forearm and tie them, one on top of the other. As he needs to put them on together; and not like those who place that of Rashi by itself and that of Rabbenu Tam by itself. It is also necessary that he place the tefillin of Rabbenu Tam above that of Rashi, both with the head and with the arm. For the aspect of Rabbenu Tam's tefillin is greater than the aspect of Rashi's tefillin. Hence the practice is to make the Rabbenu Tam tefillin smaller than that of Rashi. But the connected (hence lower) part of the forearm is the higher. Hence he should first bring up that of Rashi and recite the blessing upon it after he ties it on the biceps; and afterwards bring up that of Rabbenu Tam. And it comes out with this that that of Rabbenu Tam is resting higher than that of Rashi. And all of that is with the boxes; but regarding the straps, he should place the strap of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin below the strap of Rashi. Hence he should make the width of the strap of Rabbenu Tam narrower than that of Rashi, in order that it can be covered by it. And likewise with the head, he should place the Rabbenu Tam tefillin above that of Rashi; and also the knot of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin should be on the nape a little higher than that of Rashi. However one should pass the straps, that hang down from the knot on the nape and below, underneath the Rashi strap, such that it cover it. The hint to this is (Psalms 37:37), "Guard the blameless (<i>tam</i>), and see the upright (<i>yashar</i>, which is Rashi spelled backwards). And there is a reason for all of these things according to [Kabbalah], so one should not change a thing. One should also be careful not to place the box of one over the connection of the other, but rather adjacently, one below the other, with all of them resting upon the flesh - and as I wrote with the help of the Heavens in my holy book, MeKabtziel.

We eat dairy foods on Channukah in memory of the miracle that occured through the milk that Judith fed to the enemy, who was one of the Grecian kings, as is recounted in the book 'Hemdat Yamim'. This miracle occured some years before the chief miracle of Channukah, but since the enemy was also a Grecian king, and he also wanted to make the Jews abandon their religion, we also commemorate this miracle during the days of Channukah. This is similar to the tradition of eating seeds on Purim to commemorate the miracle that occured to Daniel and his companions, peace be upon them. It seems to me, with God's help, that there is a hint in the word <i>chalav</i>, milk, that refers to the three mitzvot that the Greeks wanted to abolish, and over which the Jews were ready to sacrifice themselves: The first letter, <i>chet</i>, refers to the first letter of <i>Chodesh</i>, the calendar. The letter <i>bet</i> refers to the second letter of Shabbat. And the letter <i>lamed</i> refers to the third letter of <i>Milah</i>, the covenant of circumcision that they were forced to abandon.

And then at the beginning of the night of the fourteenth we check for chametz with the light of the candle after the stars come out, immediately and right away. And he should do netilat yadayim before saying the berakhah on the bedikah, as mentioned by the acharonim z"l.

It is necessary to check with the light of a candle made of wax, and he should not bring two that are large or stuck together, for it would be like an avukah/torch, and we do not check with the light of a torch. And the lamps that we do not check with were given a mnemonic, חשש"א/chashasha, meaning simply, chelev/suet, shuman/oil, avukah/torch; and see [the book] מל"ח.

One takes less than a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of an olive) of <i>karpas</i> - so that he not become obligated to recite a final blessing for it -  and recites the blessing, "who creates the fruit of the ground," upon it and dips it in vinegar. Then he eats it without reclining, which is as was written by the Gaon, Chida (Chaim Yosef David Azulay); and also like our custom from the time of the crown of my head, the teacher and Gaon, my master grandfather, may his memory be for life in the world to come - to eat it without reclining. And this first dipping, which is the <i>karpas</i> in vinegar, is a remembrance of the cause for the hardship of the subjugation - as it was because of the sale of the righteous Yosef; that they dipped his cloak of <i>pasim</i> into blood, sold him and caused anguish to our father, Yaakov, may his memory be blessed. And this is hinted to in (the word,) <i>karpas</i>. And that is since the letters, <i>kar</i>, are the end of <i>makhar</i> (sold), and the letters, <i>pas</i>, are the beginning of <i>pasim</i>. And the second dipping, which is the bitter herbs (<i>maror</i>) in <i>charoset</i>, is a remembrance of the hardship of the subjugation itself. As they embittered (<i>mararu</i>) their lives with the work of clay, which is hinted to by the <i>charoset</i>, as I have written about in my small book, Mikabtze'el. And even though we said that one needs to take less than a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>karpas</i>, so that he not become obligated to recite a final blessing for it - behold, if he erred and ate a <i>kazayit</i>, he needs to recite the blessing, "who created many souls," after it. Nevertheless, he does not recite the blessing, "who creates the fruit of the ground," upon bitter herbs, since it is considered something needed for the meal that comes within the meal (and hence covered by the earlier blessing over the matzah). And he should take care not to eat all of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate, but rather leave some of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate until after [eating from the matzah]. As the secret of the Seder plate needs to be complete until after the eating of matzah and bitter herbs.

Ben Bag Bag said: Turn it over, turn it over, for everything is in it. (Avot, Ch. 5, 26)  We will see, with the help of heaven:  [Regarding] the separation of the sparks of holiness, there are two parts - the first that "turns over" the sparks of holiness from "muddy matter" to pure matter, this is called clarifying the external.  The second that "turns over" the sparks from pure matter to spirituality, and this is called clarifying the internal. And this is the matter because the sparks of holiness are contained in the inanimate objects, plants, and animals; the meat of domestic animals, wild animals, and chicken are all "muddy matter".  And if a man eats meat and raises up the spark in the meat that is "muddy matter"to the man that is "pure matter", or if he eats plants, or if he eats something that is mixed with dust it is considered inanimate and the dust has sparks of holiness. 
And then it is required to elevate the spark of holiness from the man to the spiritual, that is the place of holiness above the highest worlds...And behold, this is "turning" form "pure matter" to the "spiritual".  And the completion of these two parts of clarifying, they are the essence of external, and the essence of internal...it is not possible to complete except only through the study of Torah.  Because the words of Torah have external, the plain (pshat), and the internal, the secret (sod).  And that is why it says "turn it over, turn it over", there are two types of "small jugs": the first is from "muddy matter" to "pure matter" that is called "clarifying the external" and the second is from "pure matter" to "spiritual", this is called "clarifying the internal". 
Since it is all in the Torah it is "imprisoned" there, that is to say, the "external" and the "internal" and therefore it is the completion of the two clarifications, the "external" and the "internal", and regarding this, even though the clarification was made through eating, the clarification was not complete.  Because the clarification of the "external" from "muddy matter" to "pure matter" is not possible only through eating and therefore our Sages of blessed memory, warned us to study words of Torah at the table during the week.  And the study of the "petach Eliyahu [prayer]", he should be remembered for good, is a great segulah to clarify the sparks of holiness.  And the usual way [of having books on the table] is good for him but sometimes he is busy, or he is eating on his roof during the summer and it is not possible to learn by the light of a candle.

"And you shall not fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their protection has departed from them, and God is with us; do not fear them" (Numbers 14:9), it seems to me, with God's help, that it is known that the nations of the world have their strength from the sparks of holiness that are mixed in their "shell", for the sparks of holiness are their life and power. And therefore God commanded to kill off the Canaanites, as it is written "You shall surely destroy them etc." (Deuteronomy 12:2) and "You shall not let any soul live" (Deuteronomy 20:16), because there were many and mighty sparks of holiness in their shell, and if Israel had treated them well and kept them in the world, they would not have been able to separate those sparks of holiness, and on the contrary, the "shell" would have been strengthened more, but by Israel destroying them below and killing them off to fulfill the commandment of the Lord, they were able to crush and destroy also the "shell" and take out what was "swallowed from its mouth".
We wrote elsewhere with the help of Heaven that the nations of idolaters and their "shells" are similar to bread that the clarification comes out of it and is completed by four threshings.
The first one when they thresh the grain to remove the chaff from it which is its shell and in this threshing one level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the second one when they grind the wheat with millstones to make it flour and in this a second level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the third one when they knead the flour with water that the kneader needs to knead the dough and soften it with his hands and in this a third level is made in clarifying sparks of holiness.
And the fourth one after the bread is baked and the person threshes it with his teeth when he chews it. And in this the clarification of sparks of holiness from it is completed.
And these four steps of clarification are against four letters of the name of God, and therefore they established four blessings after eating food. And just as the purifying of bread needs to be with the threshings we have mentioned, so is the purification of sparks of holiness from the nation of idolatry and the "shell", which does not need to be by us; that we will crush them until they are destroyed. Therefore God did not destroy the Canaanites in the hands of heaven that he did not send them bad plagues in their land until they were destroyed, as he did to the Egyptians in the land of Egypt with ten plagues, rather he decreed that Israel would come to their lands and fight them and destroy them themselves, so that the clarification of sparks of holiness from their "shell" would be by Israel who would crush them themselves as they do with bread, and by this He destroys them in their place from heaven as He did to the Egyptians who did not need Israel to fight them. For this he said "for they are our bread", meaning God wanted to make them like bread that needs to be purified by man through the threshings that he does with it, and these "remove their shadow" - the good part - "from them". When the good part - which is sparks of holiness - is removed from bread,  "and God" - the name of God which is against four steps of clarification mentioned above is "with us" to help us in war in order to complete purification of sparks of holiness by our hands, and therefore "do not fear them" now, that they remain existing and they were not destroyed by heaven.

Chapter 1

Before you say the “Birkat Hagomel”[the Blessing of those who overcome a danger] you say the verse (Psalms 111, 1) : “I praise the Lord with all my heart in the assembled congregation of the upright”, and afterwards you bless by saying “Blessed Thou Lord, King of the Universe, showing goodness to us beyond our merits and bestowing favour upon me” , the congregation responds: “May God who has been gracious to you, continue to be gracious to you selah”, and he says after them: “Amen, may this be God’s will.”

Chapter 2

You have to bless in front of ten and two out of these ten have to be learned in Halachah. And it’s good to be careful that you have twelve people including the blessing person and also including the aforementioned learned Rabbanan. If one doesn’t happen to have two learned people, even then, one should nevertheless bless and the saying of the blessing should not be prevented because of that fact. We have the custom to bless after the reading of the Torah in the assembly, when in most cases there are two halachically learned people found. And if one blesses when there are less than ten, there are those who say that one does not fulfill his obligation and there are those who say that that one fulfills. And it’s good to repeat the blessing in front of ten without Shem and Malchut but one should think of Shem and Malchut in his mind. One who blessed silently, it is as if they did not bless in front of ten, and they should repeat it in front of ten, not uttering the Shem and Malchut but thinking it in their mind. 

Chapter 3

The ten sit, as it is written: and “in the assembly of the elders they will give thanks to God”, and the one who blesses stands because this blessing is instead of the thanksgiving sacrifice and the person who gives the sacrifice stands and sacrifices. And therefore we do not say Birkat HaGomel at night, but rather during the day. And retrospectively if someone blessed at night they fulfilled their duty – and see the Hatam Sofer Orakh Hayyim Siman 51.    

Chapter 4

A child younger than 13 years old, when he is ready for education he needs to bless. Although some disagree with this, in a place in which there is a minhag (custom) that the kid blesses with Name and Kingdom, he should bless. In a place, in which such a custom does not exist, he should bless without Name nor Kingdom because of the explanations of those who disagree (that a child under 13 should bless).

Chapter 5

Women are obliged to bless the Birkat haGomel; and they bless with among Minian with Name and Kingdom. If it is difficult for her to bless with 10 persons because she is timid, she should bless without Name nor Kingdom. If she does not know the blessing, her husband should teach her or someone else, since it is a short blessing.

Chapter 6



Chapter 7

On pain like headache and the one who is exempt and is not sick with a sickness that includes the whole body, this person does not bless, and such a person is not considered sick to be obligated to bless unless the person has fallen into bed for three complete days, and it does not need to be three days that all include 24 hours.

There are certain pious people, who, after writing the Prozbul, lend a small amount of money to their friends: only ten <i>grush</i> or so, and make sure that the Prozbul doesn't apply to that, since it was given afterwards. After Rosh Hashanah, when the friend comes to repay the loan, they announce "I annul the loan," and don't take the money back. Afterwards, the friend buys some food and rejoices with this free money, and the lender can rejoice at having really performed the mitzvah of cancelling debts. With praise to the blessed God, I enacted such a mitzvah in our city of Baghdad, may God protect it. I printed Prozbul forms and handed them out to many people who used them, and I also instructed them to do as I described above, to lend a small sum after filling out the Prozbul in order to really perform the mitzvah. Happy are Israel, lovers of God's commandments, who fulfil them with joy!

Chapter 1

The Shabbat Candles: the obligation according to the Law is only (to light) one candle. However, according to the  mystical secret , it is necessary to light two candles, one against “remember!”, one against “keep!”. On top of that, they are also against the two letters ה that appear in the name הויה blessed be He, that represent the spheres of Binah and Malchut which in Gematria are equivalent to 563 as also it is when doing the Gematria of the quote “Enjoy in the splendor of the Schechina”. Punctilious people light seven candles and say: “the world against the seven lower sephirot hinted at [in the idea] of the week. And even those who light seven lights, with all this [which we said], when he comes home he should stare at daffka/exactly/particularly two candles, and he should intent that one of them is against [the word] “remember” and the other against [the word] “keep”. He should also intend that one of the candles represents the first ‘Hey’ [of the ‘HAVAYA’] and the other the last ‘Hey’ [of the HAVAYA]. He should also intend that the candles illuminate in the holiness of the upper world. 

Chapter 2

One should perform the of the lighting candles in the place where one eats, and the woman lights and blesses the lighting of the candles.  The sages however  ruled that one lights one candle in the place where one sleeps, as well as in the kitchen, and anywhere that one goes  in or out on Shabbat.  In all these places a woman should light without a blessing, and afterwards she should light in a place with a table/dining room with a blessing.  If a man wishes to light in his bedroom by himself, he receives a blessing, but he doesn’t bless, because his wife blesses the candles in the dining room.  And if he doesn’t have the means to purchase oil for Shabbat, he should acquire via begging, but for a man in this position one candles suffices.

Chapter 3

The candle of Shabbat and the wine for Kiddush:  the candle comes first; even though the kiddush is d’oraita, one can make Kiddush with  bread according to the Torah, and only according to the sages what is needed is wine. Thus the Shabbat candle comes first on account of the peace of his home. However, if he has just enough to buy either oil for one candle or for wine to sanctify, but has not enough to buy the second candle, he should not refrain from buying the wine because of the second candle, because the rule holds that one candle is enough.

Chapter 4

Even though you eat and do make kiddush on the roof-top, where the moonlight illuminates the table, nonetheless you have to light the shabbat candle and say a bracha over it, because although the pshat rationale of  lightning the shabbat candle is  “shlom bayit”, peace at home, there is an (additional) obligation because of the sod, the secret. Thus, I noted in my holy book “Mikavtze’el”, and look as well in the “Eshel-Avraham”, Ch. 263, small paragraph 21; look there. 

Chapter 5

A man and a woman are obligated equally in the mitzvah of the shabbat candle. But the woman is cautioned to a greater extent, and she also has the priority in that commandment over her husband. If the husband wants to light himself, she can obstruct his hand. However, if the husband wants to light in the place of sleeping - he is allowed to, but without blessing - as I wrote above. But it is the custom regarding a woman who gave birth - that the husband would light in the place of the table and bless on the first shabbat after giving birth. 

Chapter 6

It’s considered good that a husband prepares the lights before Shabbat, such as preparing the oil and the wick, as explained in the words of our teacher, the Ari, in his book, ‘Sefer HaKavanot’ and this is his wording: “Also you (the husband) should be meticulous in preparing the Shabbat candles, although the woman of the house is commanded to do so…” - His description finishes here.  We too are accustomed to set up and prepare the candles ourselves.

One has to be very careful in the prayer of Minchah of the holy Shabbat, for it has [the potential for] many ascents upwards. And even though there are siddurim in which it is written "And who is like Your nation Israel?"--the main idea is that one must say "like Your nation, like Israel" [and not "like Your nation Israel"], and just as [the author] wrote in Shalmei Chagigah in the name of Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach in Nagid UMitzvah, and so it is in the siddur of our master, Rabbi Shalom Shar'abi of blessed memory, which is found among us. And from the language of Sha'ar HaKavvanot [by Rabbi Chayyim Vital], which mentions "like Your nation Israel"--from this [citation] there is no proof in general. And I said, with the help of Heaven, that the language of "like Israel" is more correct, for in II Samuel 7[:23], it says "like Israel," and, in [I] Chronicles 17[:21], it says, "Israel," and therefore what our master Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach of blessed memory well wrote is correct, that we must say "like Israel"--on account of this being a verse from Prophets. And like this, we have found the pronouncing of 'Migdol yeshu'ot malko'  (II Samuel 22:51) in Birkat HaMazon, for on Shabbat, we say "Migdol," just as it is written in Prophets (II Samuel 22:51), and, on a profane day, "Magdil," just as it is written in Scriptures (Psalm 18:21).

Sour "Lemons" are forbidden by some when they are squeezed into an empty bowl, even if they will later be used for food, since in lands where many lemons grow, they are used to squeezing them for their juice, in order to prepare the drink known as <i>'Limonada'</i>, and they fill up barrels of juice for this purpose. Even though the blessed Shulchan Aruch allowed the squeezing of lemons, those who forbid it nowadays make sense, and therefore modern authorities forbid squeezing it into an empty vessel. However, one who wishes to prepare <i>'Limonada'</i>, which is a beverage made of squeezed lemons together with sugar and water, they should first put the sugar in a bowl and squeeze lemons over it, and only then pour over water. But do not put the water before the squeezing of the lemons. They have found a sign for this in the Torah (Genesis 28:12) "Behold, a ladder (<i>sulam</i>) standing on the earth". The word <i>Sulam</i> is the initials of the words Sugar, Lemon, Mayim (water), which is the order that the lemonade is to be made.

Chapter 1

Some of the works forbidden by the Torah are Writing and Erasing, and this prohibition refers not only to erasing letters when one is evidently liable, but also one is liable by only erasing some ink when one could instead in that same place write two letters. If the amount corresponds to only one letter, even though one is exempt from bringing the Hatat sacrifice and lapidation, this is still prohibited by the Torah as a “half measure” forbidden by the Torah. If a drop of ink remained on his hand since he was writing just before Shabbat, it is forbidden to wash it during Shabbat, but should cover it with a piece of cloth when doing netila, so the water does not touch it. And so is the ruling if he has on him color, that it is forbidden to wash it away.

Chapter 2

One who writes, although he is not liable according to the Torah but only in the case when writes with something permanent over a permanent thing (like engraving letters over stone), in all other cases it is still forbidding according to the rabbis, even if he writes with something not permanent over something not permanent (writing on snow with your finger). Therefore, it is forbidden to write with your finger using liquid over the table, or to leave an impression on the dust which is on the glass / cristal, or to leave an impression with the nails over a piece of paper, and also one should be careful not to leave an impression with a nail over a book in order to remember something, and even if he did leave an impression with no writing form whatsoever, this is still forbidden. 

Chapter 3

There is no such thing as dying food; therefore it is permitted to dip your bread on something liquid which has a colour itself  even if the bread gets coloured: and also it is permitted to give to put something that colours into food if there is no intention to colour it, but if there is an intention to colour it, it is also forbidden for the food itself, since one had the intention of dying it… and it is forbidden to put make-up on on the eyes on Shabbat, on account of colouring.

Chapter 4

Here in our city there is the costume of making white beer and red beer, sometimes we mix one with the other- we need to pay attention that the red does not colour the white one, because they want to make the white red on purpose. See “Nishmat-Adam”, part 4-3, see there. See “Eshil-Avraham”, comment 25, which forbade the commerce of brandy and liquor, from putting colour inside it so as others buy it, on account of getting benefit from it and so on and see there. And if you do the opposite, that is, put white into the red, as it is written in “Mahari Hagiz”, blessed be his memory, about putting the white in the red wine, I would hesitate in this leniency in a place where the intention is to dye the white, but only when there is no intention to dye the white, then in such cases it should be allowed to put the white in the red.

Squeezing of the  hair is not forbidden from the Torah because the hair is hard and does not absorb the water but squeezing the hair is forbidden according to the rabbis.  Whoever immerses in water on Shabbat, whether a man or a woman, they cannot wring their hair but should bring a large and special towel to wipe  and rub their face and their head with it. Even though the rubbing results in the  squeezing of the hair this is indirect [as with the back of your hand] squeezing.  Because the squeezing of the hair is rabbinical [and not forbidden from the Torah], the sages allowed to do it in this way, because it   is not possible [otherwise], and because it is indirect, and the water that is squeezed out is waste water. And nevertheless one should not rub with force, but caress it slowly, until the water that is in the hair is absorbed by the towel. And there are the pious who don’t rub their beard hair… When one drinks water or other beverages, it’s correct to be meticulous in not squeezing the mustache hair. But you can rub it with a towel.

Chapter 10

An egg that was laid on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move.  But if you cover it with a vessel so it does not break, be careful not to touch it. And fruit that falls from the tree on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move them, and even in a  doubtful case it is forbidden. 

Chapter 11

One who spits into the wind, and the wind scatters the spit, it is forbidden, on account of its similarity to winnowing; even though there is no intention to do it- being unavoidable [that it will be winnowed], it is forbidden by the Rabbanan. And even though there are those who disagree with this, many Acharonim, blessed be their memory, are concerned with this.

Chapter 15

Rinsing dishes to use on the same day, and even rinsing dishes on the night of Shabbat to be used the next day for Shacharit. After the third meal one should not wash dishes to be used on Hol-days during the week. Glasses however are allowed to be washed during Shabbat, since we could use them any moment. One should draw the attention of the people concerning the preparation of the beds, to prepare their beds during the day to be used in the night; during the summer when people usually prepare their beds on the tops of their houses in order to be fresher, since it is forbidden to do so. The person that reminds others and the reminded will be blessed.

And behold it is well known that the work of the refinement of the holy sparks which is incumbent upon man is hefty work. However the refinement of that which is living and that which is vegetative is more incumbent upon man than the refinement of that which is inanimate. The essence [of the latter] is in the hands of God, may He be blessed, as it is through rain - like our master, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote about the statement (Taanit 7a), "A rainy day is as great as the revival of the dead." For that is why they fixed the mention of rain in the blessing, "who revives the dead." For through the rain, the dead will be revived - they are the holy sparks in the inanimate that will rise from it, and that is their revival on the first level. And likewise did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say (Taanit 7a), "A rainy day is as great as the ingathering of the exiles" - for the holy sparks are gathered on it. However it is clear that there is more of a need incumbent upon man to refine the living and the vegetative, since he is to refine them through eating, as it is something edible. And therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded two commandments that are by way of a statute (<i>chok</i>). One is with the vegetative, which is forbidden mixtures (<i>kilayim</i>); and the other is with living flesh and that is milk and meat. For these two commandments are statutes that do not have explanations. As this is permissible by itself and that is permissible by itself, so why should they be forbidden when they are in a mixture? And it is well known that any commandment of the statute type which a man keeps has a gap in its performance, since the Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel and mock the statute commandment saying, "What is this commandment and what explanation is there about it?" And there will hence be help and support from it to overcome the husk and to break its power, to separate the holy spark from it that is absorbed amidst the evil part of the husk and mixed in with the vegetative and with the living. And that is why the numerical count (<i>gematria</i>) of statute  <i>chok</i> is that of <i>Geihinnom</i> - since through the performance of the statute, man extracts the good spark from the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>, which is the evil that is attached to it. So Israel is victorious. Hence a person must be careful about this statute concerning the prohibition of milk and meat, so that he not stumble in it, God forbid - even with something small in it. For through it, he will have a great boost with the refinement that he needs to refine from the food.

Wine becomes forbidden through the touch of a non-Jew as soon as the pressed grapes are separated from the juice. If a non-Jew scooped out a handful of grapes together with their juice, the juice is not forbidden, and may even be returned to the vat. However, if he were to scoop out a cup full of juice alone, the entire contents of the vat would become forbidden, as the process of separation has already started.

Chapter 1

This immersion is on account of the ejection of impurity, so that the vessel will go out from its impurity to the holiness of Israel, similar to a convert who goes out from the domain of idolatry into the domain of Israel. Therefore, even if they are new, such that he bought them from a gentile artisan [who made them], he must [still] immerse them. And it is forbidden to use it without immersion, even for cold [food]. But if a Jew rented or borrowed a vessel from a gentile, it does not require immersion. And this is specifically with culinary vessels, since the verse is dealing with culinary vessels - as it is written (Numbers 31:23), "Anything that is placed on a fire, etc." And what is something that is placed on a fire and and one needs to make it fit (kosher) with a fire? I would say that is a culinary vessel that absorbs [flavor] with fire, and so requires fire for the ejection of what is absorbed.
