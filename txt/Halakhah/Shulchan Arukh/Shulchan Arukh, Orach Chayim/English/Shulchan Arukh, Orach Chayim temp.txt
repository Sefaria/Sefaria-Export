Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayim



Siman 1

1:1 One should strengthen himself like a lion to get up in the morning (1) for the service of his Creator, in order that he “wake up” (2) the morning [meaning arise before dawn]. {Rema: In any event, one should not delay the time for praying [beyond the time] (3) that the congregation prays (Tur).}{Rema: “I have set Hashem constantly before me” is a major principle in the Torah and in the virtues of (4) the righteous who walk before G-d. This is true because the way a person sits, moves and conducts himself alone in his house is not like the way he sits, moves, and conducts himself in the presence of a great king, nor are his speech and facial expression however he likes, [as they are] when he is with the members of his household or with relatives, as when having an audience with the king. So how much more so [should his conduct etc. be not like that which might otherwise be at home] when he considers that the Great King, the Holy One Blessed be He, whose glory fills the whole world, is standing over him and sees all his deeds (as it is written “‘Is a man [able] to hide himself in any hiding place and I cannot see him?’, says Hashem”).[From this realization] one will immediately be overcome with the fear and humility that comes from the dread of Hashem, may He be Blessed, and he will constantly be ashamed (The Guide to the Perplexed Part 3 Chapter 52), and [on the contrary] he will not be ashamed (5) because of those people who (6) mock his service of Hashem, may He be Blessed. (7) Even in one’s conduct in private or when he goes to bed, he should know before whom he is laying down, and when he wakes up he should get up (8) quickly [in order to carry out] the service of his Creator, may He be Blessed and Exalted (Tur).}
1:2. One who rises early to say supplications before his Creator should aim to do so at those times when the watches change [the nighttime hours being divided into three “watches”], namely after one third of the night, at the end of two thirds of the night and at the end of the night itself — for any prayer offered at these times concerning the destruction [of the Temple] and the exile [of the Jews] is accepted.
1:3. (9) It is fitting for every G-d fearing person (10) to feel grief and concern over (11) the destruction of the Temple.
1:4. It is better to say a few supplications with proper concentration [Kavonoh] than many (12) without
1:5. It is good to recite (13) the portion relating to the binding of Isaac [the “Akeidah” — Genesis 22:1-19], the portion relating to the Mannah [ the “Mon” — Exodus 16:11-36], the Ten Utterances [“Asseres HaDibros” — Exodus 20:1-14 (often mistranslated as the “Ten Commandments”)] and the portions relating to the burnt offering [“Oloh” — Leviticus 1:1-9], the meal-offering [“Minchah” — ibid. 2:1-13], (14) the peace offering [“Sh’lomim” — ibid 3:1-5 and 7:11 through 8:38], (15) the sin offering [“Chattos” — ibid 4:27-31] and the guilt offering [“Oshom” — ibid 7:1-5]. {Rema: Only an individual is permitted to recite the Ten Utterances every day; it is forbidden to recite them (16) as a congregation (The Responsa of the Rashboh Siman 144).}
1:6. The sections [relating to] sacrifices should only be recited (17) during the day (See also 47:13)...
1:7. After completion of the section of the burnt offering [Olah], one should say “May it be Your will … that this [reading] should be regarded and accepted as if I brought a burnt offering.” One should say a similar recitation after completing the sections of the bread [Mincha] and peace [Shlamim] offerings because they may be (18) brought voluntarily
1:8. When reciting the portions concerning (19) the Sacrificial Offerings, one should also say the verse [Leviticus 1:11] “(20) And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before Hashem…”
1:9. Some have the custom to say the portion relating to the washbasin [Kiyor] [Exodus 30:17], the portion relating to the removal of the ashes [Terumas HaDeshen] [Leviticus 6:1], the portion relating to the Continual Sacrifice [Tamid] [Numbers 28:1], the portion relating to the altar on which to burn incense [Exodus 30:1], and the portion relating to the ingredients and making up of the incense [ibid 30:34], in that order.
