Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer





Siman 1

Every man is obligated to marry a woman in order to be fruitful, and to multiply and anyone who doesn't engage in being fruitful and multiplying is as if he spills blood, and lessens the appearance, and causes the divine presence to depart from Israel. Rem"a: He who does not marry is not allowed to make a blessing or to engage in Torah etc. and he is not called a man, and when he marries a woman, his sins are cast into doubt, as it is said: "One who has found a wife has found goodness and obtains favor in the eyes of God." (Proverbs 18:22)
One can only sell a sefer Torah in order to learn Torah or marry a woman.
It is incumbent on every man that they should marry a woman at the age of 18 and the diligent get married at 13 and this mitzvah is for those who choose it, but before the age of 13 one should not marry, because it is similar to harlotry. If 20 years go by and he has not taken a wife and he who lets 20 years pass, or he who does not want to marry, the courts can force him to marry in order to fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. What are the things that might delay marriage? If he is busy with Torah, or if it is too burdensome and he fears to marry a women in order that he is not burdened in his livelihood and he will not fail in Torah it is permitted to delay. Rem"a: In this time, its custom that one does not force in regards to this. Likewise he who does not fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying and he comes to marry a woman who is not a bat banim, for example...
He who spends all of his entire life engrossed in Torah study like Ben Azai and did not marry a woman is not considered a sinner, as his urges did not overcome him.
Once a man has had a son and a daughter, he has fulfilled the obligation to be fruitful and multiply. And a ben siris (castrated son) and a nekivah ayalonit (girl who doesn't achieve signs of puberty) do not count. Rem"a: The ram is the male of the flock, in other words, that the woman has a male nature and those signs she does not have like breasts of a woman and her voice is thick...doesn't stick out from her body like women]
If a man and a woman bear children and they die, and they leave behind sons, the man dies having fulfilled the mitzvah to be fruitful and multiply. What are the circumstances for this case? When there are grandchildren, a male and a female, and they came from the son and the daughter (of the obligated individal of halakha 5) despite the fact that the male grandchild comes from the daughter and the female grandchild comes from the son, since they came from his two kids, they fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. But if he has a son and a daughter and they die and only one grandchild remains he still has not fulfilled his obligation. Rem"a: if the son is a mamzer or deaf-mute, or an idiot, or a minor, he has fulfilled the mitzvah.
If he had sons that in his lifetime and he was an idolater and all parties converts (to Judaism) it this case his mitzvah is fulfilled. But if he has children when he is a slave and he and they are freed he has not fulfilled his obligation until he bears one after he is freed.
Even though he fulfilled the obligation of be fruitful and multiply, he is forbidden from being without a wife and he needs to marry a woman who is capable of bearing children (see Yevamot 61b). He may sell a sefer Torah in order to do so if he has a doubt that he has enough children or if he has a doubt that he has married a women of child bearing capability. If he does not have children he sells so that he can marry a woman capable of bearing children but if he has children he should not sell it and marry a woman who is capable of bearing children, but he should not be without a wife. And some say, that even if he has sons, he sells the sefer Torah to marry a woman capable of bearing children. Isserless: However, if it is recognized that the will not be more grandchildren and it is not appropriate that more will not be born to him, he marries a women who is not capable of bearing children, and thus if he has many sons and he fears that if he marries a woman of child bearing age an altercation will come and discord will come between the children and his wife he is permitted to marry a woman who is not capable of bearing children but it is forbidden to settle down without a wife because of this fear.
A man may marry a number of women provided that he has the means to sustain them, and what we find is that the sages gave worthy suggestion that a man marry no more than four women so that he may fulfill his sexual obligation once a month. In a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman they are not permitted to marry another woman. Note: it is forbidden to marry two women in two places.
RABBEINU GERSHOM DECREED CHEREM for one who marries [another] in addition to his wife, but in regards to a Leverite marriage, he did not decree cherem, and such is also the case with a betrothed woman. Rema: If he doesn't want to marry another, but rather to release her, and this is the rule in any place that a mitzvah would be delayed -- for instance, if he was married to his wife for ten years and she didn't give birth (Mordechai, Perek 'Hacholetz' Rashba siman 280 and Maharam Padua Siman 19). However there are those who disagree and say that Rabbeinu Gershom's decree applies even in a case in which a mitzvah is involved, and even in the case of a Levirite marriage, and one must do Chalitza (see Hagahot Mordechai in Yebamot and Ketubot). And in the case where the first wife is not easily divorceable, e.g. she became mentally infirmed, or the husband is legally allowed to divorce her but she won't accept a Get from him, one should be more lenient and allow him to marry another (see Rashb"a). And this case if she is betrothed and neither wants to marry him nor to be released from the betrothal. AND HIS [Rabbeinu Gershom's] DECREE was not unilaterally accepted in all the lands. Rema: Particularly in a plce where it is known that his decree wasn't unilaterally accepted, but basically it applies everywhere. See Section 14 Siman 228 for what one should do if he moved from a place where they are stringent on this ruling to a place where they are more lenient. AND HE ONLY EXTENDED THE DECREE until the end of the 5th centure (i.e. 500 years from when he said it). Rema: In any case, in all of these lands, the decree and the custom stand in their place, and we don't marry two women, and this is a punishable offense, and we force someone who did marry two wives to divorce one of them. And there are those who say that in this day and age, we shouldn't punish one who disobeys this decree because the fifth century [since it was declared] has already passed [and so it is expired], but this is not our custom. There are those who say that one whose wife refuses to accept a Get, he can serve it to her through someone else and then marry another, and this is the custom in some places. And in a place where this is not the custom, one should not be stringent, and a man may marry a second [wife] without divorcing the first.
It is good to make a Takanah in relation to forbidding and to excommunicate a person who takes more than one wife
If he swears that he will never marry another woman but 10 years go by and she has not born a child, this will be explained in Siman 118.
A woman is not obligated in the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying [this idea is talked about in siman 154] <i>RMA: nonetheless some say that she should not remain unmarried, due to suspicion.</i>
Laws associated with someone who marries a woman and 10 years pass and she does not bear a child will be explained there (siman 118).

Siman 2

A man should not marry a woman who has any kind of inappropriateness. [Isserless: Anyone who marries an inappropriate wife for money will bring them children who are not respectable, but aside from that, if there is no inappropriateness on her, rather he just marries her for money, it is allowed. If someone wants to marry an inappropriate wife, his family members may protest him. If he does not want to be supervised by them, he may make a type of sign such that their offspring will not intermingle with that of his family; and someone who offered a lot of money for him to get married and then took back the offer (even though they got married) he should not hold his wife like a hostage because of this and he should not quarrel with her over her family's property, and someone who does this will not be successful and the relationship will not be a good one because the money that a man takes along with his wife is not appropriate money; and anyone who does this is called someone who "marries for money". Rather, everything that a father or mother in-law gives him should be taken with a good-eye (a full heart) and he will be successful.]
Any family with the presumption of a good lineage and he's permitted to marry her a priori. Nevertheless, if you see two families that always irritate one another [Isserless: or two individuals that irritate one another]or you see a family that are upholders of mitzvot and argue always or you see a man that argues disputes with everyone and especially brazen, then we should suspect their lineage and it is fitting to distance oneself from them b/c these are disqualifying characteristics. Similar a person who always invalidates others, for example he puts a stain on the lineage of families or on individuals and he says about them, that that they are mamzerim then we suspect him of being a mamzer. And if he says that they are slaves then we suspect that he is a slave. And all who invalidates others, that blemish (actually) invalidates him. And likewise he who is brazen, cruel, and hates others and he doesn't show them loving kindness we suspect him the most, lest he is gibionite (see Mishnah Torah, Isuri Biya 19:17).
3. When the purity of a families lineage has been disputed, whoever two people testify that there was intermingled with one another, a mamzer or a challal or that they have slaves in their lineage, behold this is doubtful. And if it is a family of priests no one may marry a women from them until they will check about her up through four generations because there are eight involved: her mother, her maternal grandmother, the mother of her maternal grandfather, the maternal grandmother of her maternal grandfather. And likewise we check the mothers of the fathers side: the mother of her paternal grandmother, the mother of her paternal grandfather, and the mother of the mother of her paternal grandfather. And if the family that was called into question is a Levite or Israelite they add to the checking of them another one and we find that they check 10 mothers. But a women that is brought to be married doesn't need to check (her husband's family) because kosher women are not warned against marrying blemished men.
Anyone who is called a mamzer or netin or challal or a servant and he is silent about his status, we suspect him and his family and we don't marry them even if we check as was explained. [Isserless: There are some that say this applies only to a family that is known to blend with one of these psulim (inappropriate ones), but an individual that is called thus and keeps quiet, means nothing. There are others who say that all this (from the Mechaber) only applies to earlier generations where Beis Din would keep track of the yichus of families and appropriately apply punishments, so if someone is silent, it can be considered that he admits since he knows that the truth will be revealed. But now, silence is an indication only that he does not want to argue or fight and is thus praiseworthy, so rather today, we accept this as a sign of good yichus as long as he does not cause an argument. Others say that we do not say at all that 'silence is like an admission' and that all this only goes as a sign against the accuser himself and we question his Yichus (not the accused one). Yet, if he is trying to Possel his children in front of him and he remains silent, the silence is never considered and admission (not even by the Mechaber) although, it does raise some concern and reason to check his family. And in all cases, someone who hears troubling words about other matters (aside from Yichus) and he remains silent, this is a clear sign of proper upbringing and that he is appropriate to marry.]
A family that might have in their lineage a suspected chalal any kosher woman may marry one of these. And if she is widowed she is forbidden to a Cohen A Priori. But [after the fact] if she is married [to a priest], she doesn't need to be divorced because of these two doubts: Maybe she became a widow of this chalal and maybe she is not a widow. Even if you say that she is a widow maybe he is not chalal. [Isserless: And some hold this is Davka for a the widow herself, since she has a chazaka of Kashrus (having been married to a Kohen) but this does not apply to her daughter and if she is already married, he must divorce her. But, others are Maikel and make no distinction between the widow and her daughter)] But if someone who was certainly a chalal marries into a family, then every women in that family is forbidden (to a priest) until he the priest does an investigation. If she was married (without an investigation), she is then divorced. And this is also the rule if a doubtful or certain mamzer marries into a family. [Isserless: Yet all this is particularly for someone about whom it is known, but a family that is blended with (at least one known) passul that is not known to the public, for example this one or that one was tamei and the knowledge of this passul is not appropriate for public exposure, rather we assume a Hazakah of Kashrut that all the families that become tamei in Israel are Kosher in the days of the Messiah and in every place, this is kosher to reveal and demonstrates their modesty. This is davka for a family that is blended with tameiim, but any time that this tuma is not blended (and the passulim are known) then the tameiim should be revealed and publicly announced about them so that kosher people will keep away from them.]
Israelite man should always make an effort to marry a scholar's daughter and to marry his daughter to a scholar. If he can't find a daughter of a scholar he marries the daughter of a gedolei hador (great Rabbi) and he can't find a gedolei hador he marries the daughter of one of the heads of the congregations and if he can't find one of the heads of congregations he marries a collector of Tzedakah and if he he can't find that he marries a school teacher but his daughter should not marry an am haaretz (simpleton). [Isserless: Pertaining to their daughters he says, cursed is the one that lies with beasts and all this pertains to the am haaretz because they are not diligent with the mitzvot. But its a mitzvah for a man to marry the daughter of his sister and there are those who say even the daughter of his brother].
A man shouldn't marry a women from a leporous family nor from a nekafim. If a family has three instances the next children will have the presumption of being this way.
An am ha'aretz should not marry a cohen. And if he marries one, their pairing will not develop well (Pesachim 49a) because she will die or it (meaning the child) will die from the pregnancy or problems will come between them. But a scholar that marries an Cohen woman, this is pleasant and praiseworthy for then the Torah and the Priesthood will be found in the same place.
A young man should not marry an old woman and an old man should not marry a young girl for this thing causes whoredom.
A man should not marry a woman with the intention of divorcing her and if he announces from the beginning that he is going to marry her for a few days then that is permitted.
A man should not marry a woman in one land and marry another woman in a different land lest the children of this one and that one (meaning, of each woman) pair off with each other and we find that a brother marries his sister but a famous person and his children are well known because of him, then it is permitted (to marry women in different lands).

Siman 3

Someone who comes in our time and says, "I am a Cohen," we don't believe him and we don't raise him to Priesthood by his own word and he does not read (the) first (Aliyah) from the Torah and he does not raise his hands (for the Priestly blessing of the congregation). [Rama: But there are those who say that he is believed in order to read first from the Torah and to raise his hands (for the blessing) in our time since we don't have tithing from the Torah, about which we should be concerned that perhaps they would raise him (inappropriately) to (one who accepts holy) tithings. Thus, it is established as our universal custom not to accept tithings in our time and thus, we have no concern for this practice (of allowing him to read first from the Torah and raising his hands)] And we do not feed him from the kodshim of Israel unless there is at least one witness (that his is in fact a Priest). Nonetheless, he would make himself Assur to marry a divorcee a harlot or a Hallal and he would not be allowed to Metamei himself by the dead, but if he did marry or become tamei, he would suffer whiplashes and the woman whom he married (improperly) [who is for him pasula for Cohanim] a safek H'llala. If he was questioned in a way as to not reveal the purpose of the discussion (L'fi Tumo and reveals that he knows for sure that he is a Cohen) he would be believed. How is it possible to question him in a way that does not reveal the intent of the question? Ask him to recall the time when he was a child that "I would ride on my father's shoulders and he would remove me from school take off my clothes and Tovel me in the mikveh so I would eat Trumot after sunset and my friends separated from me and they would call me "Yochanan Who Eats Challah [Terumah]," Here, our holy sages would raise him to priesthood status by himself.
If there was one witness that testified (that he is a Cohen), he is believed in order to feed him (the Cohen) tithes in these times, and he can read the first Aliyah from the Torah and to raise his hands (for the congregation). Even his father is believed for him and legal/court-documents can support his claim to Priesthood in these times, how so? if it was written in a court/legal-document he may show the document that was written with his name, Ploni Cohen borrowed from Ploni so much money and witnesses signed this document, thus, he will have the Hazaka of priesthood (on account of the document) like the Cohanim of this time. Hence, he may raise his hands and read First from the Torah and to be a priest like the priests of this time. [Rama: And there are those who say that even if he signed the document himself "I am Ploni the Cohen" this counts as a witness in these times.]
If one of the "Anusim" (Jews who were forced to convert) bears witness that one of them is Muchzak (known by Hazaka) in priesthood, he may be raised to read (First Aliyah) from the Torah and we are not concerned that he is a Kuti (goy).
Even if two came and they each give witness to the other as being a priest, they are believed and we are not concerned that they are acting together to reward each other.
We believe an adult who says "I remember when I was a child that I saw this Ploni (guy) immerse (in a mikveh) and eat tithings," we raise him to read first from the Torah by his words and he will be a Cohen (priest) like other Cohanim of our time.
Someone who comes and says "I am a Cohen" and a single witness testifies that he knows his father that he is a Cohen, we do not raise him to priesthood by his word lest he is really a Hallal (ineligible for Cahuna by his mother) until there is testimony (from at least one witness) that he (himself) is a Cohen. But, if his father is known by hazakah to be a priest or if two witnesses testify that his father is a priest, thus, that would suffice to make his father known as a priest. [Rama: In all instances, we follow the Hazakah, we even burn and stone based on (the principle of) Hazakah].
Someone who's father is established as a Cohen but some voice were raised that he is the son of a divorcee or the son of a Halitzah (so he would be passul for priesthood, even if his father was a priest), we are concerned for him and we take him down (to disallow him as a Cohen). If one witness came afterwards and testified that he is Kosher, we raise him up again to Priesthood by this testimony. If then 2 more witnesses came to testify together that he is a Hallal (disqualified) we take him down again. Then, if one more witness came to testify that he is Kosher, we raise him up once again since this last witness combines with the first witness and we have two witnesses that testify that he is Kosher versus two who testify that he is passul. These two witnesses (for Kashrut) push off two (who would passul him) and the voice against him since these two are like 100 and he remains a Cohen based on these two witnesses and the establishment of his father.
A woman who did not wait 3 full months after she was (last) with her husband and she gave birth and she does not know if the baby is a 9 month baby from the first husband or a 7 month baby from the second husband and the first one was a Cohen and the second was from Israel, this makes a Saffek (doubtful) Cohen. The same would be true for a baby Cohen who was confused with an Israel baby and they grew up, each of these are a Saffek Cohen and we impose on them the strictures of Cohanim and strictures of Israel; They can only marry a woman who is fit to marry a priest and they may not be Metamei from the dead and they can't eat Trumot (priestly tithes) and if he married a divorcee, he must divorce her but he does not get whiplashes for marrying her.
Two Cohanim whos babies got mixed up or the wife of a Cohen who did not wait after her husband (died) 3 months before marrying another Cohen and we don't know if the baby is a 9 month baby from the first husband or a 7 month baby from the second husband, in any case, he is a Cohen and we impose on him the strictures of both fathers; he would be required to be an Onen for all the possible relatives (from both fathers' relatives when they die) and they would be in Onenus for him and he would not be allowed to be Metamei from either of the family members and they would not be allowed to be metamei for him. In which cases do these apply? where the marriage was proper, but if this was through harlotry (or another forbidden relation, but certainly with a Cohen) we silence him from the category of priesthood as we would do if we don't know for certain who is the father (but we are certain that he is a Cohen and not a Halal). What is this case? for example, there are 10 Cohanim out of which one of them and had relations with her (the widow or pnuya); even though he is certainly a priest, such that if he intentionally metameis himself with the dead or marries a divorcee, he would get whiplashes but he would not perform the holy services at the Temple or eat priestly tithings (since he does not know exactly who is his father). [Rama: If she was a penuya (a kosher single girl who is not a harlot by the Torah) who had relations with a Cohen and within 3 months married a different Cohen, the offspring is passul from the priesthood. Although, a Cohen who has carnal relations with a penuya and admits that the child is his son, the child is a Cohen for all things (including Trumot and Avoda) and we are not concerned that perhaps she is giving over her nefesh as a harlot.

Siman 4

A child born of an arayot union and Gibeonites are forbidden for eternity to the end of days, whether males or females:
Amonites and Moabites are forbidden, and their prohibition is an eternal prohibition; but their females are immediately permitted.
Egyptians and Edomites are forbidden [to be married into] until after three generations - both female and male.  That is, after one [Edomite or Egyptian] converts, they and their son (born after the conversion) are forbidden [for marriage]. The grandchildren are permissible.
An Egyptian woman who is pregnant when she converts - her son [or daughter] is Egyptian.
A [male] Israelite who comes to one of these, the child shall follow her tribe. And if one of these - except for a bastard - comes to a daughter of Israel, the child will be ok for the congregation [to marry], except for kohanim.
A convert (male or female) from one of these who marries an Israelite (male or female), the child goes according to the one who is invalid. Thus, a second generation Amonite or Egyptian convert who marries an Israelite - the daughter is permissible, even to a cohen, since after either of these [the daugher] would become permissible. But a second generation male Egyptian who marries a first generation female Egyptian, yields a second generation Egyptian child. A first generation male Egyptian who marries a second generation female Egyptian: some say they yield a third generation child, and RaMBaM says a second genaration [Egyptian] child.
If an Ammonite man weds and Egyptian woman, the offspring is considered and Ammonite.  If an Egyptian man weds an Ammonite woman, the offpsring is considered an Egyptian, because parentage is determined [exclusively] by paternity for non-Jews.  If they convert to Judaism we follow the more 'damaged' of the two.  Therefore, if an Ammonite male convert weds an Egyptian female convert, any male offspring is considered an Ammonite and retains his prohibition forever, while a female offspring is considered Egyptian.  Rem"a:  If an Egyptian male convert that weds a non-Jewish Ammonite woman, male offspring are considered Ammonites, while female offspring are permitted (another version reads: are considered Egyptian)
And an Egyptian convert who marries a [female] Amonite convert, the child [from such a union] is an Egyptian and is prohibited until the third generation.
All other nations, after they convert they are like [native born] Jews, [and they are permitted to marry into the congregation] immediately.
Today all nations are confused.  Therefore, if an Ammonite, Moabite or Edomite convert, they may marry into the congregation immediately.  Individuals are always seen as emerging from the majority, and we depend on the rationale that this person's origins are from the majority of nations who are permissible immediately.   The Rambam extends this rule to an Egyptian, but according to the Rosh, the Egyptian retains his original prohibition.
A slave that was immersed in the mikva with the intent of keeping him as a slave may not wed a Jewish woman.  A Jew may not wed a maid-servant, whether she belongs to him or anyone else.
After his master sets him free he is considered a Jew in all respects.  If his master relinquished ownership rights, or if his master placed teffilin on him, or if his master served as the public officiant and called him to the Torah, or is his master married him off to a Jewish woman, the slave is still prohibited from cohabiting with a Jewish woman until his master writes a writ of freedom.  Nevertheless, we must be concerned about his betrothal.  Some say that even if his master did not marry him off, but instead he married in the presence of his master, we should be concerned about the betrothal.  (Rem"a:  Certainly if the master weds his own maidservant, we must be concerned about the betrothal.)
What is a mamzer?  He is the product of a union that is called arayot, whether it is a capital offense or one punishable by spiritual death, with the exception of a menstruant woman, where the offspring is considered damaged but not a mamzer, even on rabbinic level.
If a woman's husband traveled abroad and remained there for more than twelve months, and she had a child after twelve months, that child his a mamzer, because gestation is never longer than twelve months.  Some say he is not definitively a mamzer.  Since it is subject to debate, he is considered a doubtful mamzer.  Rem"a:  During the twelve months, however, there is no concern, because we can say that this was a very long gestation.  This is only if we see nothing distasteful about her,  but if we did see something distasteful we do not say that it was a long gestation, and we are concerned for the offspring.  If a woman was impregnated by her husband at the end of Sivan and she gave birth at the beginning of Kislev, even though there are only five months between them we need not be concerned that she was impregnated before then,  because the determinant is the new month, and there were seven months of gestation.  Even if she miscarried in Tishrei, and she heard the baby crying, we need not be concerned that she was impregnated earlier, because a five month gestated fetus can cry, and this was a stillborn who could not survive.  
If a rumor spreads that a married woman committed adultery, and everyone is talking about her, we do not need to be concerned that her children are mamzerim, because we rely on the assumption that most of her cohabitation was with her husband.  With regard to herself, however, we must be concerned that she is a harlot, and if her husband is a kohen the concern is a at a Torah level (Rem"a:  If her husband is a kohen, we are concerned that her children are disgraced from the priesthood), and if he is a regular Jew, he may elect to distance himself from the repulsive.  If she is extremely loose, we must even be concerned about her children.  Rem"a:  Nevertheless, she is believed if she says here children are legitimate.  If she was loose when she was single or betrothed, but not after she married, even if she was seen committing an act of adultery, her children are legitimate.
[In the case of ] a woman whose husband [is presumed dead] at sea, and becomes married [to another man], but then [later learns] her [initial] husband is alive: any child from the second [marriage] is a complete bastard and is permitted to marry a female bastard. If the first husband returns to her before the second [husband] divorces her, and bears a child - the child is a rabinnic bastard, who is forbidden to marry a complete bastard, but is permitted to marry another rabinnic bastard. (But, if she becomes promiscuous, and her husband returns to her, the child does not become a bastard) (Mordekhai)
If a man who is half slave half free man cohabits with a married woman, there is no recourse for the offspring because he has both mamzer and permitted aspects combined.  Therefore he may not wed a maid-servant, and his offspring will carry his characteristics for all generations. 
An female or male Israelite who marries a bastard child, they always produce bastard [children].
If a non-Jew or a slave cohabit with a female mamzer, the offspring is a mamzer.  If they cohabit with a Jewish woman, whether she is single or married, the offspring is permitted [to marry into the congregation], but is considered damaged with regard to marrying a kohen.
If a mamzer cohabits with a non-Jewish woman, the offspring is considered a non-Jew.  If he converts, he is a full Jew.  If a mamzer cohabits with a maid-servant the offspring is a slave.  If he is freed, he is a free Jew.  Therefore a mamzer may wed, as a matter of first resort, a maidservant who has accepted Jewish observance and has immersed in the mikva for the sake of slavery, so that his offspring may be permitted after they are freed and they may marry a Jewish woman.
A non-Jew who cohabits with his mother and she gives birth to a son from that [union] and that son converts [to Judaism], he [i.e., the son] is permitted to enter the congregation [i.e., he is not considered a mamzer].
A proselyte and a freed slave are permitted [to marry] a female mamzer. Similarly, a mamzer is permitted [to marry] a female proselyte or freed slave, since the community of proselytes is not properly called a community, and therefore a child born from them is a mamzer. This applies even if ones parentage and birth were within a [seemingly valid] marriage, for example, if ones father were a proselyte and he married a proselyte; even in such a situation, this person is  permitted to marry a mamzer, even to the 10th generation; however after [the 10th generation], it would be forbidden, for by then the awareness of the proselyte origins would be gone and he then falls into the category of an Israelite man who marries a mamzer. The Rambam permits their child to marry a mamzer, as well as his son and grandson until the time when the awareness of the proselyte origins are gone and no one knows he is a proselyte; from then on, his descendents may not marry a mamzer women. The law is the same for proselytes and freed slaves; the same law applies to all of them.
a convert marries a daughter of a Jew, or a Jew marries a convert. They have a child who is then a jew, that child cannot marry a bastard.
[The general principle is:] A mamzer should only marry a female mamzer. When does this [principle] apply? To a situation where both of their statuses [as mamzer] is certain.  However, if [the status of] one is certain and the other is in suspect or even if both of their statuses are suspect, then they are forbidden to marry one another lest [they marry and] one is a mamzer and the other is not a mamzer. When does a mamzer of suspect status arise? For example, one who is born from a union suspected of being forbidden, such as when ones father had sex with ones mother and the possibility of them contracting a legal marriage was in doubt or they were divorced but the legality of their divorce was in doubt.
A childless widow subject to levirate marriage who did not wait 3 months after her husband [died] prior to performing levirate marriage [i.e., relations with the levir], and then giving birth, there is a doubt whether the offspring is a 9-month baby of the first [husband] or a 7-month baby of the latter [husband/levir], [but] the child is kosher [i.e., not a mamzer because even if the baby belonged to the first husband, in which case levirate marriage would not be required and therefore relations with her husband's brother would normally be forbidden, the prohibition against relations does not strictly begin until the child of the first husband is actually born]. But, if afterwards the levir returned and cohabited with her and she became pregnant and gave birth, the [second] offspring has a doubtful mamzer status [because once the first child was born, since it could have been the first husband's child, levirate marriage would not have been necessary, meaning that relations with the husband's brother would be strictly forbidden; however, the status is subject to a doubt because if the child actually belonged to the levir, then the levirate marriage was legitimate] and is [therefore] prohibited to [marry either] a mamzeret or a Jewess.
An unmarried woman who became pregnant and gave birth: if she is not present to examine, is deranged, or is mute, or even if she says, "[The child] is Ploni's," and we know that Ploni to be a mamzer [i.e., is unfit to marry within the Jewish community], the child is [of] uncertain [status]. Even if said Ploni admits that she had intercourse with him, for just as she was promiscuous with him, she was also promiscuous with another. Yet if said Ploni is fit [i.e., not a mamzer], the child is fit. Nevertheless, we do not presume him to be his son definitively [so as] to inherit him unless he admits that this is his son. Rem"a: Even if she was exclusively his, she is not believed concerning him (Ra"n). And even one witness is not believed concerning him when he contradicts him.   But we are concerned about her statements, and he may not marry the relatives of said Ploni. Rem"a: Specifically an unmarried woman. However, if she cheated on her husband, even if she says '[The child] is Ploni's and is a mamzer,' we show no concern for her words, for we ascribe most intercourse to the husband. He is therefore fit and may marry the relatives of said Ploni.
A betrothed woman who conceived and she is in her father's house, if she says from her betrothed-to she conceived, [then] if he concurs or is not before us, the child is kosher, and is heir. And even if the betrothed man says that he does not recall, just that he does not contradict her (R"an). And if he does not concur, but rather contradicts her that it is not from him, the child is an unquestionable bastard. And if she is not before us to ask her, or she says I do not know from whom it is, it is a questionable bastard. And the woman is not a presumed whore, rather, she is believed to say: "to by betrothed I was laid", even if he contradicts her. And these [aforementioned] matters are [as regards] the general world, [for example] that if she is married to a priest she does not leave [the marriage] and the child from him is kosher; but to the betrothed man himself, she is forbidden, for behold she "has placed it as to himself a piece of forbidden matter".
If the people were gossiping that she was promiscuous with her betrothed as well as with other men, even if the betrothed had intercourse with her in his father-in-law's home, the child is suspected of being a mamzer, for just as she was reckless with her betrothed, so too she was reckless with others. If she was examined and she said, "I had intercourse with my betrothed," the child is fit. Rem"a: So too if it is known that the betrothed had intercourse with her and there have been no rumors that she was promiscuous with others.
A married woman that says about her fetus that he is not from her husband, she is not believed to invalidate him. HG"H - There are those that say, specifically with a woman married through nissuin, that the son has a assumption (chazakah) of being valid. But a women only married through arusin that she says her son is a mamzer, even though the engaged husband says that it is his, and that his hand did not move from her's. There are those that say, that the son is a doubt of a mamzer, and there are those that say he is believed. But a father that says on a fetus that it is not from him, or on one of his sons that it is not his son, he is believed to invalidate him and he is a absolute mamzer. And if there are sons to the son, he is not believed even on the son. And if she says: "from a idol worshiper or from a slave I became pregnant," the baby is valid because the husband is not able to contradict her on this. HG"H- This that the father is believed on the son this is specifically that he didn't have a assumption of validity from the father's mouth, but if he had a assumption of validity, furthermore the father is not believed unless with witnesses (Ri in the name of Ramah), The father that says on his son that he is a mamzer, and retracts and says an excuse for why he said it, he is believed. That which the father is believed about the son, that is where he is in the father's control, for example, with his wife in nisuin, but a unmarried woman who says "this is Plony's son," and he says "she was impregnated from a mamzer," he is not believed to invalidate him, but he is believed to make him valid. 
One who says on himself that he is a mamzer, he is believed to make himself forbidden to a Israelite girl and he is forbidden to a mamzeres until he knows for sure that he is a mamzer, and his son is like him. If he has grandchildren, he is not believed to invalidate anyone but himself. 
A foundling who is gathered from the market has [the status of] a questionable bastard; [that is] for example [where] there is no proof that he was not cast there to die; but if there is proof that he was not cast there to die--whether there is a proof in his body, for example that he is circumcised or that his limbs are corrected and straightened similar to that which they do for children, or that he is anointed with oil, or that they put for him makeup on his eyes, or they hung for him an amulet; whether there is proof in the location, for example that he was found in a place that many [people] are found there, or that he is hanging on a tree in a place that beasts cannot reach there and it was close to a city, or that he is found in a synagogue that is nearby, or in the sides of the public thoroughfare--there is not in him from [the issue of] foundling, since they are concerned for him to protect him, and he was not cast there but on account of hunger. 
The child that was cast in the road, and a person comes and says: "it is my child and I cast it", he is believed. And similarly his mother is believed. If [the child] was gathered from the market, and his father and mother come and say "it is our child", they are not believed since there already came out on him the name "foundling". And in years of famine they are believed, for on account of hunger they cast him and they want that others should feed him and therefore they  were quiet until he was gathered.  
The foundling that is found in a city that has in it idolaters and jews, whether that there was a majority of idolaters or jews, this is a questionable idolater for purposes of lineage. If he [the foundling] betrothed a woman, she requires a get on account of doubt. If a court immerses him [in a mikva] for the purpose of conversion, or he immersed himself when he grew up, he is for purposes of lineage like other foundlings found in jewish cities, because the immersion does not function except to remove him from the hands of the idolaters. 
If he did not immerse (in a mikva) and a court did not immerse him, if most of the city is idolaters, it is permitted to feed him forbidden foods. If most are jews, [we] return to him his lost objects like a jew. [If the population was] half on half, it is a mitzva to keep him alive (exp. to feed him) like a jew, and [we] inquire for him into the heap on shabbos, and he is for purposes of damages and for all questions [in the status of] "one who demands from another, on him is the [burden of] prof". Gloss: And some say that even among a majority of idolaters, [we] inquire for him into the heap on shabbos and [we] are not commanded to keep him alive (exp. to feed him) except among a majority of jews (Tur)
Women that have given birth together, the wife of a Cohen, Levite and a Bastard (illegitimate person) . The mid-wife is trusted to say this one is the Cohen's son or the Levite or Bastard, because they are not yet assigned a status and we do not know their lineage. When does this apply in a case that she has a status of a trusted person and no one has cast doubt upon her. However if even one person has cast doubt and claimed, "She testifies falsely", She is not trusted and the boy is legitimate but has no lineage.  
The questionables, for example the shushed one and the foundling, it is prohibited for them to come one onto the other (in marriage), and if they did marry, they should not keep (their spouse)  rather they should divorce with a get, and the child is a questionable [person] like his parents. And there is no solution for these questionable except that they should marry converts and the child will follow the blemish. How is this? A shushed one or a foundling that married a convertess or a freedwoman, or a convert or freedman that married a shushed one or foundling, the child is a shushed one or foundling.
Any country that has in it a maidservant or idolater who is fit to give birth, since a foundling found in it is a questionable idolater or slave, when he will marry a convert behold this [woman] will be a questionable married woman. And similarly a shushed one who marries a woman that it is possible that she is to him a forbidden relative, behold she is in a [status of] questionable married woman, because betrothal does not take effect on forbidden relatives. And which one is a woman that it is possible that she is a forbidden relative to him? Any woman whose father or brothers were living when his mother conceived, and any woman who is divorced or widowed, [because] perhaps she is the wife of his father or the wife of his father's brother. Gloss: It is forbidden to marry among the Karaites, and all of them are questionable bastards, and [we] do not accept them if the wish to return (Beis Yosef found written in the responsa of R. Shimshon). But the anusim (marranos) who return to the law of Israel, it appears to me that it is permitted to marry among them similar to other converts (id.)

Siman 5

A petzua daka and a krus shafcha are prohibited to marry a jewess, and permitted with a convertess and a freedwoman. And even a priest who is a petzua daka is permitted to marry a convertess and a freedwoman, since he is not in his sanctity. And even a nesina or one of the questionables are permitted to him; since a petzua daka is forbidden to enter the congregation, they did not decree on him regarding nesin's nor regarding questionables. However, he is forbidden in an unquestionable bastardess, for behold she is forbidden from the Torah. And some permit even a bastardess. (Tur, and Raavad, and Rashba)
What is a petzua daka? Someone whose testicles are wounded. And a krus shofchoh, all that his penis is severed. And with three limbs it is possible that a male will become invalid: in the penis, and in the testicles, and in the paths within which the semen is prepared and they are what is called cords [of the] testicles. And when one of these three limbs is wounded or severed or crushed, behold he is invalid. For example, if the penis is wounded or crushed, or the glans is severed or above the glans [is severed], [he is] invalid. And if there is severed from the glans and there is left even as much as a hair's breadth encompassing the entire penis, [he is] kosher.
If someone cut from the tendon above from the crown in the shap of a kulmus, it is kosher. Like a marzev, that took the vacant [part of] of the tendon and left the left side, [if cut so] [according to]  Rashi and the Rosh, pasul. [According to] the Rambam, kosher. 
[If] it was pierced below the glans, [he is] kosher. If the glans itself was pierced, if when he ejaculates the semen leaks from the hole, he is invalid. And if the hole becomes sealed, he returns to his kosher status. 
[If] it was pierced below the glans in a way that opposite it, above, is inside the glans, [he is] invalid; for the entire glans is principal. 
(If) the vas deferens is blocked and returns to being unblocked and afterwards he sees semen when urinating, he is invalid. 
If the testicles are castrated, or [just] one of them, or one of them is damaged, or one of them is crushed, or incomplete, or  is pierced by a hole (Rama: A full-through hole, B"Y in the name of the N"Y in the name of Tosafot Chapter HeArel) that is disqualified. Rama: That is the essence. And it is not like those who permit a person with one remaining testicle which is complete, and the rest of it is to the right (which is the position of Rabbeinu Tam). However, I see there are those who are lenient like that latter opinion, but it is better to be suspicious in a case of a Biblical prohibition towards those who are strict, and they are the majority and the authority.
If both testicles are cut off, or if only one, or if it the testicle is wounded, the man is disqualified.
If the tube connecting the testicles was pierced into the urethra and he urinates from both the urethra and the path of semen, he is valid. 
The disqualifications they have said about this, is when it was not an act of God, such as [his testicles] were severed by a man or a dog, he was struck by a thorn, or things similar to that. However, if he was born with a severed urethra, or crushed testicles, or was born without testicles, or he became ill because of a sickness of the body and these organs were terminated, or a blister occurred which made them wither or be severed, he is kosher to enter [marry] into the Jewish people. For all of these were acts of God, according to the Rambam. But Rashi and the Rosh only call it an act of God if it was lightning, or hail, or within the womb, but not through sickness, which is considered an act of man, and it disqualifies, and the Rosh writes that the Jerusalem Talmud implies this.
It is prohibited to cause the loss of the seminal organs, whether regarding a human, domesticated animal, wild animal, bird, whether kosher or not, whether in the land of Israel or the diaspora. Anyone who castrates is lashed according to the Torah, in any place. Even one who castrates after a castration is lashed. How so? One comes and severs the penis, and another comes and severs the testicles or pulls them out, and another comes and severs the testicular tracts. Or one comes and crushes the penis, and another comes and pulls out [his testicles] , and another comes and severs it. All are lashed, even though the last castrator did not [truly] castrate, whether regarding a human, a domesticated animal, wild animal, or bird. One who castrates a female, whether human or the other species, is exempt (Rama: but forbidden).
A person who gives a cup of root drink to a person or any living thing in order to render him impotent, this is forbidden. But, he (the giver of the drink) is not lashed. However, for a woman it is permitted to drink this root drink in order that she become impotent so she cannot give birth. 
If one holds down a man and and sics a dog or any other animal upon him until his sexual organs are severed, or if one forces a man to sit in water or in snow until his sexual organs terminated function, he is not lashed until he castrates him by hand. It is, however, fitting to lash him for rebellious conduct. Rama: But it is permitted to take hold of the crest of a rooster, even though it will be castrated through it, and anything else like that, because nothing was done to the seminal organs (Hagahot Alfasi, Perek Bameh Beheimah).
It is forbidden to tell a gentile to castrate our animals. If he takes it upon himself and castrates it, it is permitted. And if a Jew is devious in this matter [and tells a gentile to castrate it], we fine him, (Rama: even if he isn't devious, but the gentile recognizes and understands it is for [the Jew's] benefit) and we make him sell it to a different Jew, and it is permitted to sell it even to his oldest son, but not to his younger son, he neither sells it nor gives it to him. Rama: And it is permitted to give the animal to a gentile for a semi-yield lease, even if the gentile will certainly castrate it (Hagaot Maimoni 16:1-2), for the gentile will only have his [benefit] in mind when he is doing it (Bet Yosef). And it is permitted to sell gentiles animals and chicken, even if the buyer will definitely castrate them. (And some prohibit, the explanation of which can be found in the Terumat Hadeshen 294). However, if the gentile buyer will not castrate them himself, but will give it to another gentile to castrate, all permit (G"Z ibid). Any [action] needed for healing or other reasons, there is no prohibition of "causing pain to animals" (Issur V'Heter Extended 59). And therefore it is permitted to pluck the feathers of wild geese, and there is no potential problem of "causing pain to animals" (Mahar"i 105). Nevertheless, the world withholds from it because of its cruelty.

Siman 6

A priest if forbidden from the Torah to marry a divorced woman, a harlot, or a challalah (a woman of invalid priestly lineage) and is forbidden from a Chalutzah from the rabbis.  Therefore if he transgressed and married a a questionable Chalutzah he does not have to divorce her, but if he married a divorced woman, even if she was only questionably divorced, he must divorce her regardless if she was divorced out of engagement or full marriage.  Even the spirit of a Get (document of divorce) invalidates a woman from marrying a priest and they force him to divorce her.  What's the case of the spirit of a Get? If he says to her "You are divorced from me put you are not permitted to anyone else, even though she is not divorced via this type of Get she becomes invalidated for priests.  [Rema: Even if she was only divorced from the voice of engagement, even if it was clear that there was no substance to the engagement and they only give her a Get due to a stringency she is invalidated from marrying a priest.]  But if he gives her a Get on a condition that was not fulfilled, it is not considered a Get and she is not invalidated and a priest can divorce a woman on a condition. 
A minor girl who refuses her husband is permitted to marry a priest, but if he gave her a Get she is forbidden.  If after he gave her a Get, he remarried her and she then refused she becomes permitted to a priest because her refusal nullifies the Get.  If after she was divorced she was married to a different man and refused him, there are those who say she is permitted to a priest. 
A rumor goes out: "Ploni the kohen divorced his wife." Yet behold, she sits beneath him [i.e. there is no doubt they are still together], we do not force her apart from him. For we don't listen to rumors after marriage or after engagement. And if [the rumor is] he died, and she marries a different kohen, [we don't listen to the rumor and] she must separate [from her new husband].
If a voice went out that so-and-so the priest has written a Get for his wife if they call in the place giving a Get writing, even if they also call writing, writing it is as if the voice went out saying, so-and-so has divorced his wife, but if they do not call giving a Get writing, there is no concern.
If a "voice" goes out about a woman that she got married and [then] divorced, we suspect the "voice" to prohibit her to a priest. Specifically when the "voice" emanated without a excuse, but if it emanated with an excuse, e.g. the "voice" emanated that got married or divorced on a condition, or he threw the marriage [money/object/document] or divorce document and it  is a doubt whether it was closer to him or her, we do not suspect the "voice." If there was an excuse for the divorce but not the marriage, we suspect the "voice" of the marriage to prohibit her to the world and we do not suspect the "voice" of the divorce to prohibit her to a priest. Specifically when the excuse emanates with the "voice" immediately but if the "voice" emanated clearly and after some time the excuse emanates, it does not nullify the "voice." If afterwards it becomes clear that the "voice" was a lie, even if there wasn't an excuse, we nullify [the "voice"]. Any "voice" that wasn't upheld in a Jewish court is not a "voice" to be concerned for. (If a "voice" emanated that she was a chalutza (woman whose husband died without children her brother-in-law refused to marry her) some say we are not concerned.)
A Kohen who marries any one of the women who are forbidden to him, we excommunicate them and anybody who does business with them, and similar severe actions such as this, until he divorces her.
A priest who divorced his wife, she should not live with him in the alley. If they were living in rented quarters or a shared courtyard, she is pushed aside because of him [i.e. she must leave]. If it was her courtyard, he is pushed aside because of her [i.e. he must leave]. These things will be explained in siman 119.
Who is deemed a "zonah" [who is forbidden to a kohen]? Whoever is not a Jewess, or who is a Jewess that had sexual relations with a man to whom she is forbidden to marry in a generally applicable prohibition, or who had sexual relations with a "cholol" (the child of a kohen and a woman who was forbidden to the kohen), even though she is permitted to be married to this man. Accordingly, a woman who committed bestiality, even though she [is punished] with stoning, she does not become a zonah and she does not become invalid to a kohen, because she did not have sexual relations with a human. And a man that has relations with a menstruating woman, even though she is punished with kareth, she does not become a zonah and she does not become invalid to a kohen, because she is not forbidden to him. And similarly a man that has relations with a single woman, even though she is a lewd woman that made herself freely available, which is punishable with lashes, she does not become  a zonah and she does not become invalid to a kohen, because she is not forbidden to him. However, a woman who had sexual relations with someone who is forbidden by a Biblical negative commandment, which are generally prohibited and are not uniquely [forbidden] to kohanim, or with someone who is forbidden by a Biblical affirmative commandment—and it need not even be said with someone who is forbidden by virtue of a forbidden incestual relationship—or with a non-Jew or slave, since she is forbidden to this person to marry, she is deemed a zonah. And so with a convert and a freed slave, even if she converted or was freed while she was less than three years old, since she was not a Jewess, she is deemed a zonah and is forbidden to a kohen. And so a woman who is subject to yibum (levirate marriage) with whom an unrelated person had relations, she becomes a zona. Some opinions say that one who has relations with one who is forbidden by a Biblical affirmative commandment or by a Biblical negative commandment—even the other negative commandments—she does not become a zonah except for instance in which one has relations with a woman subject to yibum.
Any woman who becomes a zonah upon sexual relations, it is whether she was raped or consented or was inadvertent, whether it was the usual way or the unusual way (sodomy), once there is penetration she is disqualified as a zonah, provided that she is at least three years and one day old, and the male is at least nine years and one day old, or older.
The wife of a priest who had relations [with another man] even if she was forced is forbidden to him. 
The wife of a non-levite Jew who was raped even though she is permitted to her husband is forbidden to marry a priest. 
The wife of a priest who said to her husband I was raped or a made a mistake and another man slept with me, or if one witness came and testified that she committed adultery whether forced or willingly, she is not forbidden to her husband because perhaps she has taken interest in a different man.  But if her husband believes her the witness is believed as well and he must divorce her to remove them from suspicion. 
The wife of a priest who said to her husband I was raped, even though she is permitted to her husband as was explained, she is forbidden to any other priest after her husband dies because she admitted she slept with another man and made herself forbidden and has become partially forbidden.
A Cohen who betrothes an adult or child, and after some time has relations with her and finds her not a virgin, she is forbidden to him by doubt - perhaps she had relations before betrothal [and is permitted] or perhaps after betrothal [and is forbidden]. But if a Yisrael who makes this claim, she is not forbidden to him, for there are two doubts here - perhaps before betrothal and perhaps after betrothal, and even if it was after betrothal, perhaps it was forced [and she is not forbidden] and perhaps it was willingly [and she is forbidden], for if she is raped she remains permitted to a Yisrael. Therefore if her father betrothed her to a Yisrael when she was less than three years and one day old, and he claims to have found her not a virgin, she is forbidden to him by doubt, because there is only one doubt here - perhaps it was forced, or perhaps willingly, and in a Torah prohibition we must be stringent in a doubtful case.
Any woman whose husband (or the Court) expressed jealousy about her, and then she was privately with the man she was warned about, and did not drink the Sotah-waters, is forbidden to her husband, even if he is a Yisrael. If her husband dies, she is forbidden to marry a Cohen.
If she becomes know in the city as unfaithful, we don't suspect her.   Even if her husband sent her out because she violated Dat Yehudit [the customs of Jewish women] or for something disgusting, and he died before he gave her the divorce document , she is permitted to a Cohen.  
A single woman whom they saw having intercourse with someone, and the one who had intercourse left and they said to her: Who was this that had intercourse with you? And she said: A valid man. She is believed.
Furthermore, even if they saw her pregnant and they said to her: Who impregnated you? And she said: A valid man. Behold, she is believed and she (and her daughter) are permitted to a priest. 
When is this so? When the place where she had intercourse was a crossroads, or at the corners of a field where everyone passes by, and most passersby are valid, and most of the city from which the passersby came from are valid. For the sages made a stringency with genealogy and required two majorities.
But if most passersby would disqualify her [from marrying a priest] such as non-Jews, or mamzers or other such ilk, even though the place they came from was mostly valid, or if most of the men of the place were invalid, even though most passersby were valid, we cannot trust her and we must say: You had relations with one who would disqualify you, and you may not marry a priest. But if she does marry [a priest] she need not be divorced.
And there are those who say that if she says: I had relations with a valid man, one majority alone is sufficient to make her valid, and ex post facto, even if most are invalid. 
If they saw that she had intercourse or she was impregnated in the city, even if there was only one non-Jew there or one disqualified priest or someone like that, she may not be married ab initio to a priest, for all [populations] that are fixed are judged as fifty/fifty. 
And if she is married, she need not be divorced since she says, "I had relations with a valid one."
If she was mute or deaf or if she said, "I don't know whom I had intercourse with" or if she was a minor who couldn't tell the difference between a valid one and an invalid one, this one is a doubtfully profaned woman and if she is married to a priest she must be divorced, unless there were two majorities found there who were valid. 
And there are those who say that even if she was impregnated in the city if the man who had intercourse went to her she may be married ab initio, since most of the city and most of its groups are valid, unless she went to him.
And in general as well, when we don't know who went to whom, she may be married ab initio.
If the child of a non-Jew was mixed up with a Jewish child, they immerse both for the sake of conversion, and each of them is a doubtful convert.

Siman 7

A girl who was taken captive and was three years and a day or older is prohibited to a Cohen, because she is suspected to have had illicit relations, that she was copulated with by a non-Jew.  And if she has a witness that no non-Jew was secluded with her, she is allowed to a Cohen.  Even a slave or maidservant or relative is trusted in this testimony. Rema: and even women who are not trusted in women's testimony, like her mother-in-law, etc. are trusted with a captive (Rif on Ketubot 2).  Two captives that testify about each other are trusted.  Also a minor who speaks in innocence [without knowing the implications of his testimony] is trusted.   An event: a child was captured with his mother, the child spoke in his innocence and said: We were captured among the non-Jews, me and my mother,  I went to draw water, and my mind was on my mother, to gather wood, and my mind was on my mother.  The wise-ones married her to a Cohen according to his testimony.   There is one who writes that a child is believed even if he means to testify. 
The husband is not trusted to testify for his captive wife,  because a man does not testify for himself. And her handmaid does not testify for her. But the maid of her husband testifies for her. And a handmaid who speaks without knowing the implications of her statement, is believed. Rema: Kuti (non-Jews) are invalid to testify about captives, and even without knowing the implications of their statements, he is not trusted. (Rosh 32). There are those that are lenient in the case of "knowing the implications of their statements" (Ravid). And it is the same law in a case of a witness testifying he heard from another witness. And "knowing the implications of their statements" is only effective in case of being lenient, not when being strict (Rid Cohen 8).  
A priest who testified about a woman that she is pure [was not violated] he may not marry her, lest he set his eyes on her. And if he redeemed her and testified about her, he may marry her, for had he not known that she was pure, he wouldn't have placed his money on her.
A woman that says "I was captive, and I remained clean" she is trusted, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted - even if there is a witnesses that testifies she was taken captive. But if there are two witnesses that say say she was taken captive, she is not trusted until one testifies that she is clean. 
If there were two witnesses that she was taken captive, and one witness testifies that she was defiled, and one contradicts the others and testifies about her that she is pure and that no non-Jew was secluded with her before she was redeemed, even if the one who testifies that she is pure is a slave or handmaiden, she is permitted.  Hagah: And there are those who say that if she says: I was defiled, she is believed to oppose the one witness who says she is pure, but not the two witnesses (Hagahot Alfasi, Haishah Shenitarmalah).
One who says: I was taken captive and I am pure, and the court allowed her to remarry or she was married in the presence of the court and they didn't protest against her, and afterwards two witnesses came and testified that she was taken captive, behold this one can be married ab initio and she does not lose the permission she has to remarry. And even if the captor comes in after her and she is now seen to be a captive in front of us in the hands of her masters, she doesn't lose the permission she has to remarry. And they guard her from this point onwards until she is redeemed. And if two witnesses later come saying she was defiled, even if she married and had children, she need be divorced. And if one witness comes, it is nothing.
If she said: I was taken captive and I am pure and I have witnesses that I am pure. We don't say: Let's wait until witnesses come, rather we permit her immediately.  Furthermore, even if a voice goes out that there are witnesses to her being defiled, they permit her immediately until the witnesses come, for with a captive the rabbis were lenient.
A father who said: My daughter was taken captive and I redeemed her, whether she is of majority age or a minor, he is not trusted to make her prohibited. The same is true if he says that she had relations with someone forbidden (Hagahot Maymoniyot, 18, in the name of the Rashba).
A priest's wife who was prohibited to him because she was taken captive, since the issue [of whether she was defiled] is doubtful, behold she is permitted to live with him in the same courtyard, as long as his sons and the members of his household are always there to watch over him.
A city that was under siege and was taken captive, if non-Jews surrounded the city from all directions in order that not even one woman could escape before they see her and take her back, behold all of the women in the city are invalid as captives, lest they had intercourse with non-Jews, unless they were three years old or younger. But if it was possible for a woman to escape without them knowing, or if there was one hiding place in the city, even if it doesn't hold more than one woman, behold this saves all of them. How does it save? That any woman who says, I am pure, she is believed even without a witness, for she could say, "I escaped when the city was taken captive" or "I was in the hiding place and I was protected" therefore she is believed to say I didn't escape, I didn't hide and I wasn't defiled. To what does this refer? With a band from that kingship, that dwells in that city and has no fear, therefore we are concerned lest they had intercourse. But a band from another kingship that broke through, the women are not prohibited, for there was no time for them to fornicate, for they are busy taking booty and escaping. And if women were taken captive into their domain, even if Israel chased after them and saved them, behold they are forbidden. And there are those who disagree and say that even with a band from another kingship, they are forbidden.
A woman who was kidnapped by idol-worshippers for  monetary reasons, is permitted even to a priest.   Note: Only if  they owe money to the kidnappers, in which case they fear to touch the woman so that they do not lose [their money] from their pocket. But if they grabbed her in order to ransom her for money, in which case there would be no out-of-pocket loss, she is forbidden to her priestly husband (Toldot Adam V'Chava / Rabbenu Yerucham chapter 23, and as suggested in Tosafot in  chapter Ain Maamidin Avoda Zara 23a).   If she was kidnapped for capital reasons, she is forbidden to the priesthood, and therefore if her husband was a priest, she is forbidden to him.   Note: Some say that if she was kidnapped for capital reasons, she is forbidden even to her Israelite husband, because we fear that she acceded to the kidnappers to save her life (Tosafot, Rosh, Tur, Ran, and Piskei Maharai chapter 92). This is only when she is accused of capital crimes and she fears dying (Hagahot Maimoni chap. 18 in the name of "some say"). But those captured on their husbands' account are not forbidden unless the husband was sentenced to death ( Piskei Maharai chapter 92). Some say that any place that she can presume to live by being redeemed and returned, she is not forbidden to her Israelite husband, for she does not accede [to the kidnappers] even when she is captured on her own account (ibid.). And in times of anger and widespread murder, our Rabbis permitted her to her Israelite husband, following the first approach. If she is captured by Kuthites, and Jews are coming in and out by her, she is permitted to her husband (Hagahot Maimoni chap. 18). An Israelite who became apostate along with his wife, and then both returned [to Judaism], she is permitted to him and we do not worry that she committed adultery, even if the husband was a priest. If the wife became apostate herself, she is forbidden to her husband, even an Israelite (Responsa Rashba, Hagahot Mordechai Ketuboth), unless she has [at least] one witness that she did not commit adultery, similar to a captive. And some are lenient and say that we do not worry about adultery in this case (ibid.). In times of inquisition, when people converted under threat, and then returned after the threat had passed, it is appropriate to be lenient and permit women to return even to their priestly husbands (Rosh, rule 32). If a woman vowed to convert but did not yet convert, and then retracted, she is permitted to her husband (Maharik, root 160).   Under what circumstances? When Israel rules over the Kuthites and they fear Israel, but when the Kuthites are stronger, even if [she was kidnapped] for financial matters, since it was done under the rule of the Kuthites she is forbidden [to her husband] unless someone testified on her behalf, similar to the case of a [war] captive.  Note: All this applies to one who was incarcerated at the hands of the Kuthites and under their control. But if she was alone with Kuthites, even if she owes them money, we do not forbid her for sequestering alone [with the Kuthite] even though she violated religious law. Even if a rumor of adultery circulated, all rumors after marriage are insufficient to forbid her to her husband (Responsa Rosh). However, if she sequestered with the intent of adultery, it is appropriate to be stringent (Maharik, root 160). 
Which [women] are chalalah [not holy]? One who is born of those forbidden to the priesthood, such as a priest other than the high priest who comes to a prostitute or divorcee, and the high priest comes to those [prostitute and divorcee] or to a widow, or who marries a woman who is not a virgin and comes to her, these are made not holy forever.   And if he begets a child from her, whether he is the one who rendered her chalalah or whether it was another, the offspring, whether male or female is chalal, and she herself is rendered chalalah by his coming to her to awaken her, whether he come onto her by accident or on purpose, whether unwillingly or willingly, and the man who will be a priest from the age of nine years and one day and older, and the woman with whom intercourse has been had from the age of three years and one day and older.   But a priest who betrothes a woman from those forbidden to the priesthood, but she is widowed or divorced from the forbidden one, she is not chalalah. But if he has married her, even if they haven't had sex, she is chalalah, because all who are married are assume to no longer be virgins, even if she is found to be a virgin. 
A priest who transgressed and had sexual relations with a woman forbidden to priests [e.g. a divorcee] does not become deconsecrated from the priesthood.
A priest who had sexual relations with one of the forbidden partners or with a woman awaiting levirate marriage, and she became pregnant from the first intercourse, the child is not deconsecrated [i.e. invalidated] from priesthood, but he has caused her to be treated as a prostitute. If he or another priest subsequently had relations with her, the child is deconsecrated. But a priest who has relations with a convert or a freed [Canaanite] slave even if she conceived with the first intercourse, the child is deconsecrated. 
A priest who had sexual relations with a menstruant woman, the child is kosher and not deconsecrated [i.e. invalidated from the priesthood].
...A <i> Halal </i> who marries a kosher woman, the resulting child from her is also a Halal, as is the grandson, and so on to the end of all generations. If the child is a girl, that child is forbidden to the priesthood. But if she marries an Israelite and has a daughter, that daughter is kosher for the priesthood, for the child of an Israelite who marries a Halalah is kosher.
A non-Jew and a slave that have relations with an Israelite girl and a girl is born from them, the daughter is not allowed to marry a priest.
A priest who married a pregnant divorcee, whether [she was pregnant] by him or by another, and she gave birth after she had been desanctified to the priesthood, the child is valid [to the priesthood] for he didn't come from a sinful drop. 
A priest who had relations with a woman who had previously been released from levirate marriage, she and her offspring are halalim from rabbinic decree. But a priest who had relations with a woman prohibited due to second degree incest, she is valid and his offspring with her are valid. 
A Cohen who comes to a possible prostitute (or a possible divorcee or a possible released woman - Tur), this is possible desecration and the offspring is a possible halal, and is given the restrictions of Cohanim and the restrictions of Israel. He may not eat Trumah and may not be exposed to a dead body, may only marry a woman permitted to a Cohen, and if he ate (trumah) or was exposed (to a dead body) or married a divorcee, they strike him with a stroke of rebellion. And this is the ruling regarding a halal of their words [i.e., rabbinic]. But the confirmed halal of Torah is like a Zar and may marry a divorcee and be exposed to the dead, as it is said "Say to the Cohanim the sons of Aaron" (Lev. 21:1) even though they are the sons of Aaron, not until they are serving as Cohanim.
If a male convert marries a female convert who then gives birth to a daughter, she may not in principle be married to a kohen (priest) -- even the daughter's daughter for several generations, despite the fact that her conception and birth were in holiness.  And if she was [nonetheless] married to a kohen, she does not go out [necessarily from her marriage]. And if she were on one side Israelite, such as if a male convert married an Israelite woman or an Israelite man married a female convert, the daughter is permitted to a kohen even in principle.  And that is the rule for a male emancipated slave who marries a Israelite woman or an Israelite man who marries an female emancipated slave.
A daughter of priests may be married to a hallal (the son of a priest through a forbidden relationship), or to a convert, or to an emancipated slave, women with fitting ancestry not having been warned against marrying those unfit for priesthood, as the verse says, "Sons of Aaron" (Lev 21:1) and not 'daughters of Aaron."
A family that has within it a doubtful case of halal or a certain one, and so too if it has a doubtful case of a mamzer [born of a forbidden relationship] or a certain mamzer, this is clarified in section 2.

Siman 8

Cohanim, Leviim, and Yisraelim are permitted to cohabit with one another and the child retains the (ancestral) status of the man
Leviim, Yisraelim, and Challim (those whose father is a Cohen and whose mother is someone forbidden to Cohanim) are permitted to cohabit with one another and the child retains the (ancestral) status of the man
Leviim, Yisraelim, Challim, converts, and freed slaves are permitted to cohabit with one another. A male convert or freed slave who marry a female Levi, Yisraelite, of Chalilit, their son is an Yisraelite. A male Yisraelite, Levi, or Chalil who marries a female convert or freed slave, the child retains the (ancestral) status of the man.
Anyone who marries someone who is forbidden to them, the child retains that status of the one who has a defect. If one of them is invalid to a Cohen then the offspring (of their union) will be invalid to a Cohen. If one of them is invalid to the community of Israel (ex. a Mamzer), their offspring will be invalid to the community of Israel.
The child of a female maidservant, non-Jewish woman retain their status (lit. are just like them) whether or not she became pregnant in a valid way (kasher) or an invalid way (pasal).

Siman 9

A woman who was married (Rem"a: or engaged) (Maggid Mishneh ch. 21 and Nimmukei Yosef ch. Haba `Al Yevimto) to two men [sequentially] and they died may not become married to a third, for she is already assumed to be [a woman whose] husbands die. But if she married [a third husband] she need not get divorced, and even if she was [only] engaged, he may marry [her]. And if he is aware of her [as a woman whose husbands die, and nevertheless consents to marry her] she receives a ketubah; [but] if he is unaware of her [past], she gets not ketubah from the third. But from the second [husband whom she married after the first died] she has a ketubah even [if] he was unaware of her.
Rem"a: There are those who say that [this law applies] specifically if they died natural deaths, but if one of them was murdered or died in a plague, or fell and died, etc., that doesn't count. And therefore most people are lenient in these matters, and one ought not prevent them [from acting leniently]. (Beit Yosef in the name of a responsum of the Ramban 121, who wrote this in the name of "those who say.") There are those who say that this law applies to a woman who is divorced twice, that one ought not marry her. (Rashi, ch. 10 of Yevamot and the Ra"n in the beginning of ch. Na`arah.) But there are those who say that [this law applies] specifically to dying (Hagahat Maimoni in the name of the Tosafot), and thus is the norm.
A man whose two wives die may not prevent himself from marrying a third

Siman 10

One who divorces his wife, and after that she engages in nonmarital relations with another, she is permitted to return to her husband. Ram''a: And this is also the case if she engaged in nonmarital relations with the first [husband], then she was betrothed to a second [husband], who divorces her, she is permitted to return to the first [husband], even if she was designated to him first. Shulchan Arukh: But if she was betrothed to another and he divorced her, or he died, it is forbidden for her to return to the first [husband]. Ram''a: And even if she was only divorced on the basis of mere gossip.
A deaf person who divorces by hinting and she went and betroths a different deaf person, and it goes without saying to a hearing-person, she is forbidden to return to her deaf husband. But the wife of a hearing-person that was divorced, and she went and married a deaf person, and was divorced, she is permitted to return to her hearing-husband.
One who sends out his wife because of a bad reputation about her, or because she is a person who habitually vows, or because she is barren, he may not accept her back. And there are those who say, only if he said to her: Because of this [reason] I am sending you out, and doubles his words to say, were it not for this, I would not be sending you out. But if he did not double his words, he is able to accept her back. And there are those who say that if he said to her: Because of this I am sending you out, even though he did not double his words, he is not able to accept her back. And there is one who says, that even if he did not say to her: Because of this I am sending you out, he may not accept her back.
One who sends out his wife because she saw blood every time she had sex, he may not accept her back.
All of these that said, he may not accept her back, if he sinned and accepted her back before she was betrothed to another, he should not send her out; and if he sent her out, if he had sons from when she returned, it is permitted for him to accept her back, in order to not subject them to scorn. 
One who sends out his wife because of one of these things, they say to him, know that you will not be able to ever accept her back.
One who sends out his wife because of a vow that he vowed to send her out, he is able to accept her back.

Siman 11

A woman suspected of adultery, if there was jealousy [= her husband's suspicion of her having intercourse with a specific man] and seclusion [with that man] but she did not drink the bitter waters [= undergo the Sotah ritual], since she is forbidden to her husband on his [= the suspected adulterer's] account, she is [also] forbidden forever to the one with whom she was secluded, just as she is forbidden to her husband. And if he transgressed and married her, [the court] removes her from him with a divorce document, even if she had many children with him. Based on oral tradition they learned: just as she is forbidden to her husband, so too is she forbidden to the one who had intercourse with her [i.e., the man with whom she committed adultery]. Rem"a: And this is the law as well if she becomes forbidden to her husband on his account [even without having actual intercourse], she is forbidden to him. (Rem"a's own reasoning.) But if jealousy did not precede [= the husband did not yet suspect his wife of having sex with this specific man], and witnesses came [to testify] about her that she was secluded with this man, and they came and found an ugly matter, e.g., they entered after her and found her getting up off the bed and wearing [only] undergarments or fastening her belt, or they found spit on the canopy [overhanging the bed], Rem"a: or they saw the place of the shoes inverted (Tur), or they [the woman and the man with whom she is suspected of committing adultery] were leaving a dark place, or helping each other out of a pit, etc., or they [the witnesses] saw him kissing her on the neck of her garment, or they saw them kissing each other [on the lips], or that they entered one after the other and barred the door (Rem"a: with a lock) (Beit Yosef in the name of a responsum of the Rashb"a 1251), and similar things (Rem"a: according to the seeing of the eyes of the judges), if he husband divorces her for an ugly matter like this, she may not get married to the defendant [= the man with whom she is suspected of having committed adultery]; but if he transgressed and married her, and he has children with her, she need not divorce him. When does this apply? When the city is gossiping about her and the defendant for a day and a half or more, saying: 'So-and-so committed adultery with so-and-so" and the rumor didn't stop, and when neither she nor he (Rem"a: nor the husband) (Ra"n to Yevamot ch. 2) have enemies who are spreading the rumor. But if there is no rumor to this effect in the city, or the rumor stopped not because of fear, if she is married to the defendant she needn't divorce even if she has no children [with him]. Even if one witness came that she committed adultery with him, she needn't divorce him. Rem"a: And there are those who say that if there was here an actual rumor in the manner explained, in addition to witnesses to the ugly matter, the court removes her even from her husband (Rash"i and She'iltot and Mordekhai in the name of the Ra"m ch. 2 of Yevamot) if he has no children with her. But in the presence of only one of them [rumor OR witnesses] the court does not remove [her] from the husband, unless her husband divorces her and the suspect marries her -- [in that case] the court removes [her] from the suspect in the presence of only one of them, if she has no children from him. (Thus is the implication from the Ri"f and the Ramba"m.) Two witnesses to ugliness join together, even though they saw it sequentially, and the ugliness that one saw the other did not see (Mordekhai ch. 2 of Yevamot in the name of a responsum of the Mahara"m). One witness to a matter of ugliness is legally meaningless. (Responsum of Mahara"m, end of Nashim.)
A woman whose husband divorced her due to witnesses to an ugly matter, and gets married to someone else and he divorces her, she is forbidden to marry the suspect [= the man with whom she was seen engaging in sexual behaviors while married to her first husband] because she left her [first] husband due to him, but if she gets married [to the suspect] she need not divorce, even though they have no children. Any woman [about] whom witnesses came and testified that she committed adultery with this [man] when she was with her first husband, she must divorce him [= the man with whom she committed adultery as confirmed by witnesses, even when she is married to and divorced from another man after her first husband], even though she has many children with him.
In every instance where they said that the woman must be divorced, she is divorced without [payment of] her ketubah. 
There are those who say that if witnesses testify that the woman committed adultery, they need to be investigated carefully. And they [beis din] cannot accept testimony that is not in front of her or her husband (Teshuvas Harosh Klal 46). 
[If] one is accused [of sleeping with] a maidservant or a non-Jew, and [then] she converts or is freed, he still cannot enter [marry her], but if he has already married her, he does not need to exit [divorce]. If they divorced, she cannot return to him, unless he had sons with her (Bais Yoseif in the name of the Rashba). 
A Cuthite or a slave who has relations with a daughter of Israel, even if the Cuthite returns and converts or if the slave is freed, he may not marry her, but if he does, he need not divorce her.
Those whom the Sages said "he may not marry," she may not live even in the same mavoi [with him], and all the more so may not serve him.
Any case in which [the court] warned him [not to marry a particular woman] and he transgressed and married [her], this is not considered "after-the-fact" [when we would ordinarily be lenient] and we remove her from him. Rem"a: Someone who divorces his wife in order that his friend may marry her, [the friend] is forbidden from marrying her, as will be explained below in 143:15.

Siman 12

One who brings a divorce document who must say: "In front of me it was written and in front of me it was signed," and likewise a single witness who testified for a woman that her husband died, may not marry her because of suspicion [that he lied in order to marry her]; but if he married her, he need not divorce her. But one who brings a divorce document who needn't say: "In front of me it was written and in front of me it was signed" [i.e. he is just the messenger and not a witness to its writing or signing] is permitted to marry her, since she is not [eligible to] marry based on his word. And two witnesses who testify for a woman that her husband died, it is permitted for one of them to marry her, since two people don't ordinarily sin for the sake of one [of them]. And see this in this Tur [Even haEzer] 141. Rem"a: In the responsum of the Ro"sh that he brought in Even haEzer. And there are those who say that even with two [witnesses testifying about the death of her husband], although it is permitted [for one of them to marry her], in any case a pious person will distance himself from this. (Hagahot Maimoni ch. 10 of Gerushin, Kol Bo, and Tosafot on Yevamot.)
A woman who vowed not to receive any benefit from her husband, and he did not annul [that vow] for her, and she came before a Sage to release her [from the vow], and he forbade her [and as a consequence she and her husband must divorce] because he did not find for her an opening to release her, [the Sage] may not marry her, lest they say: "He forbade her in order to marry her." But if he married her, he need not divorce her. This applies to an individual expert, but a court [of three] is not suspected [of not releasing her from her vow so that one of them could marry her]. Based on this reason, if [a young girl] refuses [to marry a man whom her mother or brothers arrange for her to marry when she was a child] or is released from a levirate marriage in front of a court, one of them [= the members of the court] can marry her.
And all of them who are married to others, and become widowed or divorced, are permitted to be married to them.
And any of them who had wives at that time [that they testified about the death of a woman's husband or her divorce document], and afterwards their wives die or they divorce them, and it was the women who convinced their husbands to divorce them, they may marry [the woman about whom they testified] ab initio. Rem"a: If their wives were sick [at the time they testified] and die [after their testimony] they may not marry [the woman about whom they testified]. (Nimmukei Yosef ch. 2 of Yevamot) And every one of them is permitted to marry the son of the witness who testified for her or the son of the Sage who forbade her to her husband, or any other relatives [of the testifier or Sage], for none suspect that they removed them from their husbands for the sake of their relatives.

Siman 13

Any woman who is divorced or widowed may not get married or engaged to another until she waits 90 days, excluding the day she was divorced or on which her husband died and the day on which she becomes engaged, so that it be known if she is pregnant or not pregnant, to distinguish between the seed of the former and the seed of the latter. Rem"a: But she is permitted to make a commitment for marriage without formal engagement (Beit Yosef in the name of a responsum of the Rosh and Terumat haDeshen 217) as long as he doesn't enter into a house with her. From the day of the writing of the divorce document one counts for a divorcee, even if it was [written] on condition [of going into effect later than the day on which it was written] or she didn't receive it until many years later -- from the day of the writing one counts, for he does not seclude himself with her after writing it for her. Rem"a: And some say that one counts from the day of the giving of the divorce document (Tur in the name of the Rosh) and in accordance with that it is appropriate to be stringent, thus it appears to me. And it is a decree of the Sages that even a woman who is unable to give birth, and even if she is divorced or widowed during the engagement period [when sexual relations with the future husband are forbidden], must wait 90 days. Even a minor or an elderly woman or an infertile woman or a woman who never underwent puberty, or even if her husband is abroad or a eunuch or ill or imprisoned, or [even] someone who miscarries after her husband's death, or even a virgin from the engagement period, [all these] must wait 90 days.
A woman waiting to marry her brother-in-law [after the death of her husband before having children with him] whose brother-in-law dies, must wait three months after the death of the brother-in-law.
If she was impregnated by Reuven, and both of them agree that from him she became pregnant, and she goes and gets engaged to Shimon, and he divorces her, and she wishes to marry Reuven, she must wait 90 days after divorcing Shimon.
Someone remarrying the woman he divorced need not wait.
A maidservant or a female convert who were married to husbands while they were non-Jews or servants and converted or were freed must wait. Even a convert and his wife who convert; [the court] separates them for 90 days in order to distinguish between seed implanted in holiness and seed implanted not in holiness.
A [young girl who] refuses [to marry the man her mother or brothers arranged for her to marry while she was a minor] need not wait [90 days after this refusal before marrying someone else]. They only decreed [the waiting period] for a divorcee. And likewise a [single] woman who has relations need not wait, because she turns herself during sex such that she will not become pregnant. And likewise a raped women or a seduced woman need not wait [90 days after the rape or seduction to marry another man]. And the same applies to a woman taken captive, even if she is an adult. Rem"a: Some say that all of these need to wait if they are adults and capable of becoming pregnant (Tur). A woman who is raped while married to her husband, if she had not had sex with her husband prior to the rape, she must wait (Or Zarua).
A concubine who is designated for one man, but wants to marry another, needs to wait [before marrying the other].
A woman who was married by mistake and it is known that she is forbidden to her husband, and the beis din sends her out from him [makes them divorce]: if she is a minor [under 12] and is not able to give birth, she does not need to wait [before marrying someone else], because this is not common and anything that is uncommon within a majority, they [the Rabbis] did not decree upon it. 
A woman who is divorced and a rumor of invalidity against the divorce document goes out, and [the court] requires another divorce document because of the slander, some say she must wait three months from the second divorce document and some say that she need count only from the first divorce document. Rem"a: One should follow the first position (this is the opinion of the R"I and the Rosh, which the Tur wrote in their names). And likewise if she is divorced merely due to rumors that she had become engaged to someone, she must wait (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashba).
Someone who engages [one of these women] within [the] 90 day [period] -- [the court] excommunicates him. Rem"a: And some say that he needs to divorce her], and if he is an Israelite [i.e., not a priest] he takes her back after 3 months, while a priest may not take her back (Tur). This applies specifically if he transgressed deliberately, but if he engaged her by accident, he need not divorce her, but [the court] separates them (Mahari"v 73) and some are strict even in the accidental case (Terumat haDeshen 216). And it appears that in the case of a priest who is forbidden to take her back, one should rely on the lenient opinion and not require divorce; but in the case of an Israelite [= non-priest], one should not rely on the lenient position regarding accidents, thus it appears to me. If he divorced her, she is forbidden to live with him in the same mavoi (Riva"sh 360). If the court did not compel him [to divorce her] until after 3 months had passed, even though he engaged her transgressively, they no longer compel him [to divorce her], since once they passed, they passed (Mordekhai ch. Haholetz in the name of the Mahara"m). And if he married [her] and divorced [her], see below in this section subsection 12 the law regarding the ketubah. If he engaged her and fled, we do not excommunicate him. Rem"a: And we advise him to flee (Tur in the name of Rabbenu Yehiel). There is one who says that this fleeing must be so far that his return would be after three months, but this does not appear to be the case based on the words of other decisors.
The Rabbis decreed that a man should not engage a woman who is pregnant from another, or who is nursing another ['s child], until the infant has twenty four months. Rem"a: which is [counted] in the way that they set the month--one full and one missing [i.e. 30 days and 29 days] (<i>Hagot Mordechai</i> Chapter <i>HaCholetz</i>) except for the day he was born and the day she was engaged. The intercalary month is part of the twenty four month count. Rem"a: And some say that ideally that one should take into account the intercalary month (<i>Terumat HaDeshen Siman </i> 216). whether she is a widow or a divorcee or engaged in sex while single. Rem"a: Some are lenient with one who had sex while single (<i>Hagot Mordechai</i> Chapter <i>HaCholetz</i>). And some are lenient with one who abandoned herself to promiscuity so that her husband can guard her (Responsa of <i> Ri Mintz Siman </i> 5). Even if she gave her child to a nurse, or if she weaned him within 24 months, she should not marry. Even if the nurse swore or vowed in public that she would not go back on [the deal]. Rem"a: And some say that if the nurse swore and she entered [into the engagement], she should not leave (<i>Hagot Mordechai Ketubot</i>). Even if she swore to a great man, like those who go in the courtyard of the king.  But if her child died, she is permitted to marry and we don't suspect that she might kill her child [in order to marry]. So too if she weaned [the child] while her [previous] husband was still alive, or if she never gave milk at all. For example, if her breasts had shriveled. Or if her milk stopped while her [previous] husband was still alive. Or if she gave her child to a nurse three months before her [previous] husband died and she had not nursed at all within the three months. [In these cases] she is permitted to remarry.
If he transgressed and married a pregnant or breastfeeding woman within this time, we ostracize him, unless he fled. And he shall divorce the woman, even if he is a priest. He has to pay the ketubah (marriage contract) if she claims it from him.  If he is an Israelite, he may remarry her after 24 months of breastfeeding, and he must write her another ketubah.  If he married and fled, and then after a time returned and lived with his wife, there is no problem.  If he completed kiddushin (i.e. he gave a ring but did not perform the chupa ceremony) with a pregnant or breastfeeding woman, we do not force him to divorce, but he may not complete the marriage (i.e. nisuin - with chupa) until after the time of breastfeeding or until the child dies.   Note: Some say that there is no difference between kiddushin and nisuin (most adjudicators), and this is primary. See supra se'if 10 how to act.  
A widow who was breastfeeding her child may say, "I will not breastfeed except for wages."  And she may claim her ketuba immediately even though she may not marry until the end of 24 months.   Rema: And there is no difference whether she [actually] started to breastfeed or not (Maharam Padua Chap. 30, Mahariv, Rivash, and Responsa Rosh rule 53).
That which we said [se'if 11] regarding a divorcee [that a man should not marry a woman who is breastfeeding], there is an authority who says that it applies only when she breastfed the child prior to her divorce to the point where he [the infant] recognized her.  However, before this time the rule does not apply, because if she so desired, she would not be compelled to breastfeed him at all [after the divorce], even for payment. Another authority [disagrees and] says that a woman whose husband died, leaving her pregnant, and she gave birth and did not breastfeed her child, she still has to wait 24 months before remarrying, and it can be inferred from this opinion that the same rule would apply to a divorcee.  

Siman 14

If his wife or one of his relatives that he has to mourn died, until when is it prohibited for one to marry? It is explained in Tur YD Chp:392.

Siman 15

These are the forbidden unions that stem from ervah, those from the Torah and those from the rabbis. Those that are from the Torah, kiddushin doesn't take effect. Those that are from the rabbis, kiddushin does take effect and you must deliver a get. And likewise a betrothal with a doubtful ervah also needs a get.
A man's mother is forbidden to him according to the Torah, but his grandmother is only forbidden to him from rabbinic law and this law doesn't stop even through the great great great grandmother.
The mother of his mother's father is forbidden to him through rabbinic law, her alone.
The mother of his father is forbidden to him through rabbinic law and this law doesn't stop even through the great great great grandmother.
The mother of his father's father is forbidden to him through rabbinic law, her alone. His father's wife is forbidden to him through the Torah whether or not she's his wife through nisuin (ie fully married) or through erusin (engaged). Whether or not his father is living or whether he's dead or if he divorced her. (Isserles: But if she is his handmaiden she is permitted to him). But if the father took her in force the woman is permitted to him.
His paternal grandfather's wife is forbidden to him according to rabbinic law and this doesn't cease because the wife of Jacob our Father is forbidden for every one of us.

The wife of a man's father's brother is forbidden to him by Torah law. However, the wife of a man's father's maternal half-brother is only forbidden to him by Rabbinic law.
The wife of a man's mother's father is forbidden to him by Rabbinic law, she alone. There are those who say that the wife of his father's mother's father is forbidden to him.
A man's sister is forbidden to him by Torah law, whether she is his sister from his mother or his father, from wedded or unwed parents. Even if his father had a forbidden relationship and produced a daughter, she is his sister and forbidden to him, unless she is his sister from a female slave or a non-Jewish woman.   Rem"a: "It seems to me that a priori she [a man's sister from a mother who is a female slave or non-Jewish] is forbidden to him, because there are those who are satisfied with saying that under Torah law the fetus has the status of the female slave or the non-Jewish woman, but under Rabbinic law it is his child, so therefore one should be stringent a priori."   And there are those who say that these words apply to a regular maidservant, but if a man's father had relations with his own maidservant and produced a daughter, she is his sister.  Rem"a: Even if he said his intentions were merely for promiscuity, he is not to be believed. 
A man is permitted to [marry] the daughter of his father's wife that she has from another man [i.e. his stepsister]. Even if she grew up in the house among the brothers [i.e. her stepbrothers] she is permitted to them, and we are not afraid of marit ha'ayin [an action that appears to be sinful] of people thinking that she is their sister.
A man's daughter, daughter's daughter and son's daughter are forbidden to him under Torah law. But the daughter of his son's daughter and the daughter of his son's daughter and the daughter of his son's son and daughter of his daughter's son are forbidden to him under Rabbinic law, and there is no end to this [i.e. even great-great-grandchildren are forbidden]. And thus it says in Talmud Yerushalmi: Avraham would be forbidden to Jewish women and Sara to all Jewish men. But according to the Rambam, the prohibition does end [after a certain number of generations].
A man's wife's daughter and her daughter's daughter and her son's daughter are forbidden to him under Torah law. Specifically his wife's daughter, but the daughter of his anusah [a woman he married after he raped her] is permitted to him after she dies. Rem"a: Even while she is still alive, if he married her under the condition that he cannot divorce her (See the Gemara about marriages regarding an anusah).
A man's wife's daughter's daughter's daughter and son's son's daughter are forbidden to him under Rabbinic law, and there is no end to this prohibition [i.e. it does not matter how many generations they are removed from each other]. But for the Rambam there is an end.
A man's wife's mother and wife's father's mother are forbidden to him under Torah law. But his wife's mother's mother's mother and father's mother's mother and father's father's mother and father's mother's mother are forbidden to him under Rabbinic law, and there is no end to this prohibition [i.e. it does not matter how many generations they are removed from each other]. But to the Rambam, there is an end.
A man's father's sister and mother's sister are forbidden to him under Torah law, whether she is a sister [to his father or mother] from their father or from their mother.
A man is permitted to the daughter of his father's brother and the daughter of his mother's brother. His father's brother and his mother's brother are permitted to his wife and his daughter.
A man's father's brother's wife is forbidden to him under Torah law. But the wife of his father's maternal half-brother, and the wife of his mother's brother, maternal or paternal, are only forbidden to him under Rabbinic law. And from there on, such as the wife of his father's father's maternal brother (and the wife of his mother's mother's brother) are permitted. The wife of his father's father's paternal brother, and the sister of his father's father whether maternal or paternal, and the sister of his mother's mother are permitted. And there are those who forbid these.
A man's son's wife is forbidden to him under Torah law, and his son's son's wife is forbidden to him under Rabbinic law. There is no end to this prohibition until the [generation of] Yaakov Avinu.
A man's daughter's son's wife is forbidden to him under Rabbinic law, but there is an end to this prohibition.
The wife of his (own) wife's son (his stepson) is pemitted to him, and his wife's son (his stepson) is permitted to his (other) wife.
The wife of his brother, whether (that brother be) from his father or from his mother, whether (that brother was born) from a (legitimate) marriage or from harlotry, is forbidden to him from the Torah.
(Regarding) two stepsiblings who grew up together in the (same) house - each is permitted to marry his friend's wife, and we do not suspect for (the principle of) The Appearance to the Eye which would dictate that (the woman) seems to be his brother's wife (and therefore forbidden on a Rabbinic level although she is actually permitted to him).
One is permitted to his father-in-law's wife, and his father-in-law is permitted to his wife. And there are those who forbid it.
A man is permitted to The wife of his brother's son and the wife of his sister's son. And one is permitted to the daughter of his brother or sister, and it is a Mitzvah to marry her as was stated above, 2.
His wife's sister is forbidden to him from the Torah, all the while his wife is alive; it makes no difference if (the sister) is paternal or maternal, or even if he has already divorced his wife. However, after her (his wife's) death, he may marry her sister. And anyone who gets divorced, even for just a simple rumor, he is forbidden to her relatives (Beit Yosef in the name of RaShB"A s. 13) 
One who betrothed a woman and (she) went to a different country and witnesses testified that she died and he went and married her sister and after the fact (it) was revealed that she had not died - he is forbidden to the both of them and the both of them require a divorce from him, as well, all of the other matters listed in the chapter HaIsha Rabbah (lit. The Great Woman, one of the few chapters in Mishna which begins with the word HaIsha, the woman, the word rabbah, great, a discription about the chapter which differenciates it from others with a similar name, Yevamot 87b) and chapter HaZorek (lit. he who throws, Gittin 79b) apply to them. If one of them died, he is permitted to marry her friend (her sister). However if his wife (fully married via nesuin and not merely betrothed) traveled to a different country and witnesses came and testified that she died and he married her sister and then it was understood that his wife did not die - her sister does not require a divorce from him and his (first) wife is permitted to him, and he is permitted to marry the relatives of the second (wife) and she is permitted to marry his relatives and if the first dies he is permitted to the second one. And so (applies) to all 'Arayot (certain forbidden relationships) that one married under the chazaka (halachikally legitimate status-quo assumption) that they were permitted and were then found to be 'Arayot- they do not require a divorce from him because kiddushin (halachikally binding betrothal) does not operate (lit. catch) with 'Arayot. So too all acts harlotry one committed with relatives who are forbidden to him because of his wife do not forbid his wife to him and they (the forbidden relationships) do not become forbidden to him (Tur). However, if that relative would normally come to him because of his wife, (the court) forces him to divorce his wife (al-Fasi there). And why did (the sages) require (the giving of) a divorce to the sister of one's betrothed? Lest (people) say "there was a clause in the engagement and he married her sister legitimately," and once she has exited (the betrothal) with a divorce, her sister, his first betrothed, is forbidden so that (people) do not say "he has married the sister of his divorcée." However when his wife (via nisuin) traveled (to another country), there is no need to suspect that (people) will say "there was a clause in the marriage," because one does not (regularly) render his (legitimate) sexual relations to be(come) promiscuous relations; therefore, all will understand that marriage of the second (wife) was meaningless. 
,הַגָּה: וְאִם בָּא בִּזְנוּת עַל אֲחוֹת אִשְׁתּוֹ, וּמֵתָה אִשְׁתּוֹ וְגִיסוֹ אַחַר כֵּן, יֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים דְּאָסוּר לִשָּׂא אַחַר כָּךְ אֲחוֹת אִשְׁתּוֹ, דִּכְשֵׁם שֶׁאֲסוּרָה לַבַּעַל כָּךְ אֲסוּרָה לַבּוֹעֵל, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהָיְתָה אֲסוּרָה עָלָיו בְּלָאו הָכִי (פִּסְקֵי מהרא''י סִימָן כ''ח). (וְעַיֵּן לְקַמָּן סִימָן קע''ח): (If) his wife traveled with the husband of his wife's sister to a different country, and they came and told him: "your wife has died as well as her sister's wife," and he married his wife's sister and later his wife and brother-in-law came (back) - his wife's sister requires a divorce from him, no matter if she was married to him through the testimony (lit. mouth) of two witnesses or through the testimony of a single witness, and she is forbidden to his brother-in-law (her first husband) and his (first) wife is forbidden to him, no matter if she was married to him or merely his betrothed. Rem"a: and if he came upon his wife's sister through harlotry and his wife and brother-in-law died afterward, there are those who say that he may not not marry his wife's sister because (even disregarding the familial relationship) "just as she (a wife who had committed adultery) is forbidden to the husband, she is forbidden to the adulterer," even though she was (already) forbidden to him without that (Rulings of MaHaRA"I s. 28). (and see later s.178)
They told him: "your wife died," and he then married her sister and later they told him: "(the first time we had told you that she was dead) she was (actually) alive and (only after he had married her sister) died," the first child (conceived before she had died) is a bastard and the last one (conceived after the wife's death) is not a bastard.
One who had a pilegesh and it was not testified that he betrothed her (via formal kiddushin) - she is permitted to his relatives. However, if there were witnesses that the (pilegesh) woman (herself) said: "he betrothed me before two witnesses," she is forbidden to his relatives. However, if she said: "he betrothed me," simply, and she did not say: "before two witnesses," there is nothing (of relevance to court) in her words. 
One who betrothed  a woman and the engagement was annulled because it was predicated on a clause and the clause was not fulfilled, or he betrothed one's daughter without her knowledge (what would work if she was a minor) and she was found (to be) an adult - he is permitted to her relatives. And (this applies) specifically if the engagement was annulled without a divorce bill; however, if he gave a bill of divorce - he is forbidden to all of her relatives, as we will explain.

Siman 16

If a Jew engages in sexual relations with a female idolater, derech ishut (that is, for the purpose of marriage), or a Jewess engages in sexual relations with a male idolater, that Jew or Jewess is given lashes on a Biblical level.  As it is written (Deuteronomy 7:3): "You shall not marry them." (There are those who disagree with this ruling). However, if he engages in sexual relations derech zenut (that is, for licentiousness), casually, he is culpable only on a Rabbinic level for idolatry and for engaging in relations with a prostitute and he is given makat mardut (that is, lashes on a Rabbinic level).  And, if he sets her aside for licentious activity, he is culpable on a Rabbinic level for having sexual relations with a nida (that is, menstruant), having sexual relations with a shifcha, (that is, slavewoman), idolatry, and having sexual relations with a prostitute.  And, if he is a Kohen (that is, a priest), even if he engages in sexual relations casually, he receives lashes on a Biblical level, as it is written (Leviticus 21:7) ["(A kohen) may not marry a prostitute..."]
A man who has sexual relations with an idol worshiper, if zealots have not killed him and he has not received lashes at the hands of the court, his punishment is explicit in the words of tradition (Prophets), that he receives excision, as is written, “…For Judah has profaned the holiness of God which He loves, and has married the daughter of his strange god.  May God cut off the man that does this, he that calls and he that answers…” (Malachi 2:11-12).  He shall not have a caller among the wise nor a responder among the students.

Note: This sin has a deficit which is not present among all the other sexual proscriptions, for the son derived from a (Canaanite) female slave or from a Kuthite (non-Jewish) female is not considered his son, as opposed to descendents from other sexually proscribed women (Tur in the name of Rambam). One who has sexual relations with an idol worshiper in public, whose law is that zealots kill him, as will be explained Choshen Mishpat chapter 425, is included in the classification of sexual proscriptions, and the law is that he should permit himself to be killed rather than transgress (Beit Yosef in the name of Orchot Chaim in the name of Rambam) as is the case with other sexual proscriptions and as explained in Yoreh Deah chapter 157.
A maidservant who immersed for the name of slavery, is forbidden to a freed-man, whether it was his or his friend's slave.  One who sleeps with her, is liable for Mardut lashes (lashes from the rabbis). 
One who is caught with his maidservant, they take her from him, sell her and scatter the money among the poor people and give his lashes, and shave his hair and seclude him for thirty days. 
If the child of a Jewish woman was mixed up with the child of a maidservant both of them are questionable and both are possibly slaves and they force the master of the maidservant to free both of them.  If one of the babies was the son of the master of the slave, when they get older, they free each other and they are permitted to marry regular Jews. 
If the mixture was [of] girls, they are both slavewomen-in-doubt; [if] someone has intercourse with [either] one of them, the [child] born [of that union] is in doubt. Likewise, if the [child] born of an idolator became mixed with the [child] born of an Israelite, we immerse both of them for the sake of conversion, and each one of them is a convert-in-doubt.

Siman 17

A married woman is included in the category of sexual proscriptions, and kiddushin (the acquisition aspect of marriage) to her is void. In what case are we dealing? With a woman who is definitely married. However, is she is doubtfully married, or doubtfully divorced, then kiddushin is valid by doubt, and she needs a writ of divorce from both men.  The same law applies to writs of divorce which are invalid by Rabbinic decree, that if another man came and gave her kiddushin, she needs a writ of divorce from both, from the first (original husband) by Rabbinic decree, and from the second by Biblical law. 
A married woman who put out her hand and accepted betrothal money in front of her husband is married to the second one, for a woman who says in front of her husband: You divorced me, is believed, for there is a presumption that a woman would not be so brazen [as to lie] in front of her husband. Hagah: There are those who say that this is specifically with regard to the fact that betrothal avails and she is believed and she requires a get, but she is not believed to marry someone else (Ran, ch. 2 of Ketubot in the name of "there are those who say") or to receive her ketubah (Hagahot Maimoniyot, ch. 2 of Divorce Laws). But there are those who disagree and hold that she is believed for all matters (Rambam).  And there are those who further say that in our time when brazenness and licentiousness are rampant, she is not believed except when the result is a stringency, for the presumption that she would not be brazen has been weakened (Bet Yosef in the name of Orah Hayyim).  But if another betrothed her not in front of her husband, the betrothal is not valid until she brings proof that she was divorced from her husband before she accepted her betrothal. For any woman not in front of her husband will act brazenly.  And the Rosh wrote that in any case when the husband is in the city when the other betrothed her, this is considered "in his presence." But there are those who disagree and hold that she must actually be in his presence (Maharik, root 72 and Ribash siman 127).  And that which we say: A woman would not be so brazen as to say in front of her husband, "You divorced me" is only in a case where there is no one to support her, but if there is someone to support her, she will certainly be brazen. And if she is married to another when she is not in her husband's presence, even if she says to her husband when he arrives, "You divorced me," she is not believed for since she has already been married [to the second] one, she will certainly be brazen, so that she doesn't make herself into a prostitute. And there is one who says that even if she had not yet been married to another but had been betrothed to him while not in her husband's presence, and then her husband comes and she says to him, "You divorced me," she is not believed. And there are those who say that if there was some strife between them, or if she has asked for her ketubah, she is not believed to say: "You divorced me," even in his presence.  There are those who say that if she is believed to remarry, she also collects her ketubah (Maharik, root 72 and Ribash, siman 127). And there are those who say that she is not believed at all vis a vis monetary matters.  
A woman whose husband went overseas, and has been testified to be dead, even by one witness, even the witness being a slave or a maidservant or a woman or a relative, is free. and even a witness from the words of a witness, or a woman from the words of a woman, or a slave or a maidservant or a relative, are worthy of this testimony. and testimony invalids, if by Rabbis, are fit for this testimony. but testimony invalids by Torah, are invalid. and if [they are] innocently speaking, [they are] fit. and so a Cuthean or an Israelite converted to idolatry and for the whole torah, if he's innocently speaking, [he is] trustworthy. ???: no witness came in the above manners, only a rumour is going out in town, that [he's] dead,  his wife is not wedded.
Everyone is trusted to testify for her on this matter, except for five women who presumed to hate each other, such that they may not testify as to the death of her husband, lest they intend to prohibit her upon him and he is still alive. And these are: her mother-in-law, even if she is not currently her mother-in-law just her levir's mother (Tur), the daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival wife, her husband's brother's wife and her husband's daughter. And so too she may not testify for them (Tur). 
We have already said that a witness who stated: "I heard that so-and-so died," even if he heard from a woman who heard from a (Canaanite) slave, this is still acceptable for testimony, and we allow a woman to remarry on his word.  Note: Even if did not say from whom he had heard the information, and only said that he heard the information, it is still acceptable, and we do not worry that the original witness was an invalid witness.  But if the witness or woman or witness said: "So-and-so died, and I saw him die," we ask him: "How did you see, and how do you know [he died]?"  If he testifies clearly in the matter, he is believed. But if he testified that most people die [in such circumstances], we do not allow the woman to remarry, because we do accept testimony regarding death unless he certainly died, without any doubt.  Note: If he heard professional weepers who mentioned his name among the dead and eulogized him, we allow the wife to remarry (so wrote Magid Mishna in the name of Tosefta). Therefore we caution women not to eulogize someone on the basis of accepted suppositions (i.e. circumstantial evidence) that a man died, and not to weep for him until we know [certainly] that he died.  Similarly, his wife is forbidden to mourn him or to wear black clothes as long as there is no definitive evidence sufficient to allow her to remarry (logical derivation of the Rav, and so writes Rivash chaper 508).  Similarly no court should give a writ of testimony to a woman as to what the witnesses testified in front of them, if that testimony is insufficient to allow her to remarry, unless the explicitly write why they did not permit her to remarry on the basis of that testimony, for we worry of potential pitfalls which may occur with inexpert courts (ibid. in Responsa Rivash).
During a time of a decree [against the Jewish people], women are permitted by the report of penitents [that their husbands died]. Rem"a: That they testify to what they saw during the time of [religious] persecution [(var. time of distress)], even though they were forcibly apostatized (Responsa of the Rosh, § 54). [Regarding] vacuous and dissolute apostates who returned in penitence, but not in complete penitence, their testimony is not to be relied upon unless they were [either] conversing innocently (Mahar"i in his writings, § 220) or it is clear that they testified without deceit or guile (ibid., § 224). And everything depends on the nature of the witness, and according to the apprehension of the judge.
One came and said "I killed him", she can remarry. [And since] a person may not place himself [into the category of] evil, we divide his speech [so that he is believed that the husband is dead but not that he killed him]. And this is the law also for the Kuthean when he speaks according to his innocence [saying],  "I killed ploni" that they [the beit din] can marry off his wife (the haguna).
If one witness says to a woman by herself (lit. between them), "Your husband has died", she no longer needs his testimony. Rather, she can go to <i> Beis Din </i> and say, "My husband has died". But if the witness who she said in his name, "he [your husband] died", comes [later on] and says that he didn't say that he died, she is [no longer] believed. Rem"a: And <i> Beis Din </i> doesn't need to inquire after him, even if he is in the city, rather we rely on a witness in the name of [another] witness <i> L'chatchilah </i>
One witness says "he died", and [another] witness says "he was killed". Even if they contradict one another, since each one agrees that he [the decedent] is no longer alive, she [the deceased's wife] shall [re-] marry.
If they heard a voice saying "So-and-so died," and they went [to look] but did not find a man (i.e. they did not find a source for the voice), they may still permit his wife to remarry. If they heard this voice in the field or a cistern or a ruin, we do not permit remarriage on the basis of this voice because we are concerned that it came from a demon, as the voice derived from locales frequented by demons.
If they found written in a document, "So and so son of so and so has died", or "has been killed", his wife may [re]marry even if [the document] is not established [by witnesses]. And according to the <i> Rambam </i> they need to know that it was the handwriting of a Jew. Rem"a: And it is worthwhile to be stringent. And even if they know that it was the handwriting of a Jew, if there are those that say that he wrote [the document] because of a rumor that he died, for example that he drowned in water without an end (i.e. a large body of water) and similar [cases], they don't permit [remarriage] through the handwriting, because they suspect he wrote it [only] because of a rumor that was spread. 
A man who lost the ability to speak, and they checked him in the manner used for checking [intellectual ability] for writs of divorce, and he was found to be of sound mind, and he wrote that so-and-so died, we rely on his writing and permit his [so-and-so's] wife to remarry.
That which we said that a witness [testifying] on behalf of [another] witness is valid regarding the testimony of a woman [regarding remarriage]. When is this true? [lit. what things are we talking about]. That he heard from a mentally-capable person that so-and-so died, for example, a slave or a maidservant. but if he heard from a mentally-incapable person or a minor, he may not testify and we don't rely on his words. [If] he heard from the little girls that said, "Now we are coming from the eulogy of so-and-so, these were the eulogizers there, as well as so-and-so the wise, and so-and-so went after the coffin, this is what they did with the coffin" this can be testified in their names according to the those [above] words and similar ones. And one can marry his wife [of the dead husband]. Rem"a: And specifically [if he heard it] immediately, for example, if they said, "Now we are coming from the eulogy of so-and-so". But if it wasn't immediately, their testimony doesn't help at all. And even if they (the children at the eulogy) later grew up, they are not able to testify what they saw in their youth.
We already said that a Kuthean that innocently (unprompted) talks, we can marry [off someone] based on his words. How so - if he spoke innocently and said, "Woe onto so-and-so who died, how nice was he and how much good he did for me," or he spoke and says, "When I was coming along the way and so-and-so who was walking with us fell and died, and we were bewildered for such a thing how he died suddenly," and other similar things that show his intention is not to bear witness, behold he is trusted. And a Jew who hears from a Kuthean who spoke innocently, can testify that he hear from him and his wife can marry based on his words. Note (Rama): And similarly if he said, "So-and-so died", innocently, even though he didn't say anything else, it's sufficient to be called "speaking innocently (Rivash Siman 377). And some are stringent (Beit Yosef in name of the Ran). [Shulchan Aruch:] In was case are we talking about? When there was no "excuse." But if there was an excuse in the speech of the Kuthean, perhaps he intended for something else, as if he said to someone, "Do for me this and that so that I won't kill you just like I killed so-and-so," this is not speaking innocently, since his intention is to instill fear on this [person].  Note (Rama): Similarly in a situation where there is concern for falsehood, that they taught him to say thus, we don't rely on him (R"I, Path 23). [Shulchan Arukh:] And similarly if he heard from the courts of the Kutheans that they said, "We killed so-and-so," they aren't trusted, since they strengthen themselves through falsehood, and so too any similar thing like these. Note (Rama): Some say that all non-Jewish courts are not trusted, even if they say he was killed in judgement not by them (Tur in name of the Rosh). And all of this is specifically in non-Jewish courts, but other Kutheans that speak innocently and say he was judged in the courts of Kutheans, are trusted (Ruling of the Mahar"i Siman 34).
 
A Kuthean who spoke innocently based on a Kuthean who spoke innocently, we marry [off someone] based on his words. Note (Rama): Even if he didn't explicitly testify that the first Kuthean spoke innocently, we go from a doubt to a leniency and say that he certainly spoke innocently (Maharik root 121). And some argue on this (Teshuvas HaRan)..
A <i>kutti </i> and a Jew goes out to another place, and the <i>kutti </i> says: a man that goes out with me dies, and I will marry his wife, even though the <i>kutti </i> knows that this is the man. There are those who say: bury him [kill him]. The Rama comments: specifically in this circumstance that does not remember the name of the deceased or does not recognize him. But if he does recognize him, he should not come near him, and stay away from his ritual impurity (according to the Rambam and similar it says in the Arizal's decisions siman 324, in the Beit Yosef, and also in the responsa of the Ran and the Rivash). This is the  <i>minhag </i>. If so, if ten people will come out to this place, and it is forbidden carry him with collared [animals] or camels and exit with him in this manner, but you should put aside the <i>kutti </i> before his <i>tuma</i> and you should carry him like, fully dead, like one marries his wife.There are those who say: bury him. 
If someone came and said to us: The court or some people said, "When you go to that place tell them that Isaac ben Michael died."  The messenger arrived and told us and he does not know who this person is, since we know that such a person with that name exists, his wife may remarry, and we do not say that perhaps it was some other Isaac ben Michael who died.  That is if we do not know that there are two people with this name, or that we know that there were two, but one is no longer alive.  Rem"a: Some say that all of this is true only if the messenger names his city, but if he does not mention the city, even though we know that one person [with this name] is missing, it is not effective even if he mentions his name.  Some are lenient.  Some say that if he only mentions his name, we also require the city.  But if he mentions his name and his father's name we do not require the city.  In a situation where there are other circumstances or proofs that this is the person, we can be lenient and rely on the authorities that say that a name suffices without mentioning the city.
.....
If someone objected about a woman, saying that she is bound to a yavam (that is, she must perform a levirate marriage with the brother of her deceased husband), and afterward he himself testifies in front of a court that he heard that this man died long ago, we rely on him since his earlier words were not said in a court.
We do not examine witnesses for women [to allow them to remarry] with formal inquiries and investigations, and even if they were contradicted on cross-checking, they are still valid.    Note: It is forbidden to inquire and investigate excessively (Responsa Rambam) except when there is reason to suspect trickery, then inquiry and investigation are required (Mahariv chapter 150).
When looking at his body to recognize it and testify about him, we check and look at it even at night with the light of a candle or the moonlight.
If they saw someone at a distance, and he identified himself as Ploni son of Ploni, or Ploni from location Ploni, and he was bitten by a snake and he was dead, and they walked closer, and found that his shape had changed and they did not recognize him, we can still permit his wife to remarry.
If they found him murdered or dead, if his forehead, nose, and facial features are extant, and they recognized him as ploni (e.g. John Doe), they testify about him.  If one of these identifying features was missing, even if they have extremely reliable signs in his clothing, these do not count because we are concerned about loans. Even if they had signs in his body, even a mole, they may not testify about him. But if they identified extremely reliable signs on his body, they may testify to his death.  Note: For example he had an extra limb or missing limb or variation in one of his limbs. But short or tall or pale or ruddy do not qualify as a reliable sign (Responsa Rosh, rule 51).  Even 100 unreliable signs [together] do not count, and even when combined with other circumstantial evidence they are not acceptable (Piskei Mahari, chapters 161 and 224).  A large lump on his nose or his nose was extremely curved or similar findings are considered reliable sign, while a slightly curved nose is not reliable (ibid. chapter 134).  And we rule similarly regarding a mark on his body or one of his limbs. But large teeth, even if very large are not a reliable sign (Piskei Maharai chapter 161). Any identification sign which is acceptable from an Israelite witness is similarly acceptable from a Kuthite (non-Jew) who is conversing innocently (Responsa Moharam in Hilchot Nashim, and Maharam Padua chapters 2 and 36). 
Rabbenu Tam wrote that the rule excluding testimony [of a husband's death] unless his forehead, nose and his facial features are extant, applies only when the remains are limited to the head, but if the entire body is present, even without the facial features, forehead, and nose, they can identify him by an overall recognition ("tviut ayin"). However, later authorities disagreed with him. 
They [the witnesses] can't testify about him unless they found him within three days after he was murdered or died, but after three [days] they cannot testify about him, because his face has changed. What [case] are we talking about? When he [died] on dry land. But if he drowned in water, and the water threw him on dry land, even after a few days, if they recognize him they can testify about him, because he doesn't change in water except after a lot of time. And the one who sees him immediately when [his corpse] emerges, and also there is no wound on him, if he waits after he was thrown by the water, they cannot testify about him, even within three [days] (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ramban and the Rashba). And so too, if he had a wound, they cannot testify about him, because the water worsen the wound is water-logged and he changes. Rem"a: [If] it is doubtful whether he waited [more than the time period] or not, we rule stringently, and even if she got [re]married, she must get divorced (Riva"sh siman 380). And all this is for testifying about him through the naked eye, but through known signs, even if he waited, we permit his wife [to remarry].
If they found him murdered, and recognize him by overall impression, but do not know when he was killed, some say that  they surmise he was killed within the last three days, and may testify regarding his death, and others forbid. Nevertheless, if there had been a rumor that so-and-so was dead or murdered, and after 3 days he was found dead and they recognized him, his wife is permitted [to remarry] according to all authorities. 
Some say in the name of Rabbenu Tam that the rule limiting testimony of death to the first three days after death applies when the face has been battered, but if the face is not battered, it is acceptable to testify of his death even after more days by virtue of clearly recognizing his body and shape, even if he had fallen into water.  But this is not clear in the eyes of later authorities.   Note: Some are lenient, that anyone who was present when he drowned in water even though the body was intact may not testify regarding his death; but someone who did not see his drowning, but identified him (i.e. his corpse) by clear visual recognition, and the body was whole, may testify to his death (Tur and Terumat haDeshen chapter 205 in the name of Asheri).
They may not testify that a man died unless they saw him definitively die without doubt. If they saw him fall into a den of lions or leopards or other such [animals], they may not testify to his death, for they may not have been hungry and may not have eaten him.  But if he fell into a hole of snakes or scorpions, the witnesses may testify, because the tight quarters will cause them [the snakes or scorpions] to attack when he steps on them.  
If he fell into a furnace or into a boiling vat full for wine or oil or water, or was slaughtered fully or mostly through the two signs (trachea and esophagus), even if he arose and escaped, they may testify to his death, because he will definitely die subsequently.  In similar situations where it is impossible that he will live but will die in the immediate future, they may testify to his death. 
If they saw him crucified and the bird eating from his flesh, even if they also stabbed him or shot him with arrows, they may not testify to his death. But if they saw the bird eating from a place where the life force leaves when it is removed, such as the brain or the heart or the intestines, he may testify to his death. 
If they saw him fall into the sea, even if he sank in the Great Sea, they may not testify about him that he died, for maybe he ascended from another place. And if he fell into gathered waters, like a pit or a cave, that he stands and sees all around him, and waited until his soul [would have] left, and he did not ascend, he may testify that he died and will allow his wife to marry. So too if they bound his legs and lowered him to the sea and the only thing they pulled up was his knee and up, we allow his wife to marry after twelve months, for a treifa (a person that cannot survive in his current physical state) does not survive twelve months. However, if he fell into the sea and they threw a net and pulled out a single leg from the knee up, or the like, we will not allow his wife to remarry, for I say: "that was the leg of someone else" However, if there was a very distinct sign on the leg, we rely on it, saying that it is the leg of the man who fell. Rem"a: And there are those that say that even a distinct sign on his clothes works here, since they saw him sink in these clothes (Maharam Padawa section 36)
[If] one witness said, "I saw that he was dead in war" or "in a collapse" or "that he sank in the great sea and died" or, similar to these things, the majority of which [lead] to death: if he said "I buried him", he is believed and she [may] marry on his word; and if he did not say "I buried him", she [may] not marry but if she did marry she [need] not leave [the marriage].
Similarly, a woman for whom a single witness testified that her husband drowned in waters without end, and he did not come up [to the surface], his memory was lost and his name forgotten, she may not remarry on the basis of this testimony as explained.   Note: Even if a court permitted her to remarry, but she has not yet remarried, she may not remarry (Rivash chapter 379).   If she remarried on the basis of this testimony, she does not require divorce.  Note: Only is she remarried on the ruling of a wise man or by mistake, that she thought she was permitted to remarry. But if she purposely transgressed and remarried, she must undergo divorce (Responsa Moharam, brought in Hagahot Mordechai end of tractate Yevamot). This refers specifically to one regarding whom they testified that he literally drowned (i.e. they saw him drown) in waters without end.  But if they testified that he was on a boat breaking up in the sea or something similar, or even if the testified that he drowned but they did not testify that he stayed underwater for a time that would cause death, then she must divorce. Even if they testified simply that he drowned, we must be concerned that they used the terminology of drowning for similar processes [without necessarily meaning death by drowning], for it is the way of the world to call this drowning; and she must undergo divorce unless he specifically testified that he [the husband] definitely drowned and remained underwater for the time that his life force would depart (Beit Yosef in the name of Responsa Ramban chapter 128).  Even if it was a Kuthite (non-Jew) conversing innocently who said, "So-and-so drowned," and she married on this basis, she does not need to undergo divorce.  However, if a wise man ruled to permit her to remarry a priori in a case of drowning in waters without end, we ostracize him.  
There is an authority who says that if he fell into waters without end, the wife may collect her ketuba monies even though she is forbidden to remarry. 
A city surrounded by a troop of soldiers, or a boat foundering at sea, or a man taken out for judgement are all considered to have a status of being alive. Therefore testimony regarding these situations is not accepted to permit a wife to remarry.  Even [regarding] a man in a city conquered by troops, or in a boat that sank, or a man taken out to be killed, testimony may not be given, for they still have a status of possibly alive, and we  place upon them both the strictures of being dead and the strictures of being alive. 
If a single witness came and testified that her husband died, and they permitted her to remarry on his word, and then another witness came and contradicted the first witness, saying, "He did not die," she is not removed from her permission, and she may still remarry, for a single witness with respect to a woman's [remarriage] testimony is believed just like two witnesses in other testimonies; the subsequent testimony of the single [contradicting] witness is negligible in the face of two witnesses.   Note: Nevertheless, because of the risk of slander she should not remarry (Tur).  However, if the second witness came before the court permitted her to remarry, she is not permitted to remarry, and if she did remarry, she must divorce, because it is doubtful.  If she married the witness who testified that her [previous] husband had died, and she says, "It is clear to me that he died," she need not divorce. But some authorities say that [even in this latter case] she must divorce. If two witnesses came forward and said, "He did not die," even if she already remarried, all authorities agree that she must divorce.    Note: This applies when she is silent, but if she says, "He died," it is considered as two witnesses (i.e. the wife and her supporting witness, c.f. Bet Shmuel) against two witnesses as long as all the witnesses are women.  But the husband who married is not considered as reliable for himself [against the two subsequent witnesses] (Nimukei Yosef, chapter haIsha Kamma).    What are the circumstances of this ruling? When the single witness upon whose word she remarried can be considered as two witnesses against the two witnesses who later came and contradicted, as in the case where she remarried on the word of an adult male who was contradicted by two adult males saying, "He did not die;" or she remarried on the word of an adult female or her own assertion, and two subsequent female witnesses or two Rabbinically invalid male witnesses came and said, "He did not die."  But if a kosher (valid adult male) witness said, "He died," and numerous women said, "He did not die," or invalid male witnesses said, "He did not die," this is viewed as half against half.  Note: This applies when the witnesses arrived together before the court permitted her to remarry on the testimony of the first witness. But if the court had permitted her to remarry on the testimony of the kosher witness, and then the invalid witnesses arrived, she is not removed from her permission to remarry (Tur).  If she married one of her witnesses, and she says, "It is clear to me that he died," she does not need to divorce.  Note: Kuthites who are conversing innocently have the same status as invalid witnesses (Mordechai chapter haIsha Bathra), but a Kuthite who is not conversing innocently (e.g. he knowingly claims to the court that the husband died) is not reliable whether to forbid or permit remarriage. 
If a woman say: He died, or she [the wife] says: My husband died, and then a valid witness comes and says: He didn't die, she may not get married and if she did get married she must be divorced. But there are those who say that if a different woman or the wife say: He died, and then the court allowed her to be married based on her words and then a valid witness came and said: He didn't die, she doesn't lose permission to remarry. But if two women come at the outset and they allow her to be married based on their testimony, and then one witness comes, all agree that she does not lose her permission to remarry (Bet Yosef in the name of "there are those who say"). 
A woman who is married based on the testimony of one witness, she may not be remarried except with the permission of a court. And if she remarries without the permission of the court, there are those who say she need not be divorced even if one witness comes and says: He didn't die. And the court must comprise three valid judges, those not related to each other or to the witnesses. 
If a woman says: He didn't die, and two [other women] say: He did die, she may not be married. And similarly if ten women say: He didn't die, and eleven women say: He died, she may not be remarried, for we don't say two are like 100 except with valid witnesses, but with invalid witnesses we follow a majority, whether to rule strictly or leniently. 
If two testify that they each of them heard from one witness that so-and-so died, and one witness testifies that he heard from one witness that he was alive, she is permitted [to remarry]. 
Two witnesses say: He died, and two witnesses say: He did not die, she may not be married and if she is married she must be divorced, for the matter is doubtful.  And if she married one of her witnesses, and she says: I am certain that he has died, she need not be divorced. We don't force a wife to leave her husband if a rumor goes out that her first husband is alive (Rabbenu Yeruham). 
A wife is trusted to say that her husband died and she may be remarried or undergo levirate marriage based on her testimony, and she receives the main part of her ketubah. If she goes through levirate marriage, the levir takes the inheritance based on her words. And even if the woman lacks s0und senses, she is trusted (Responsa Or Zarua, 50:23). As long as she knows the nature of marriage and widowhood (ibid in the name of Ramah).  When is this so? When she comes to the court and says: My husband died, permit me to remarry, but she doesn't mention her ketubah. In that case they permit her immediately and they adjure her and then give her the ketubah.  But if she comes and says: My husband died, give me my ketubah, they don't even permit her to marry, for she came asking for her ketubah. And she is presumed to be a woman whose husband has not died, and she didn't want to remarry, just get her ketubah while he is still alive. And there are those who say that even if she has a witness that he has died, it doesn't help in such a circumstance (Nimmukei Yosef in the name of the Ritba). 
If a woman came to us and said, "My husband died.  Permit me to remarry and give me my Ketubah,"  we allow her to remarry and we give her the Ketubah, because the primary focus of her statement concerned marital issues.   But if she came and said, "Give me my Ketubah and permit me to remarry," we permit her [to remarry] butwe do not give her the Ketubah, and if she siezes it we do not extract it from her hands.  Some authorities say that in either case she is not permitted to remarry, since she mentioned her Ketubah.
A man who has two wives, and one of them came and said, "My husband died," she may remarry on her own assertion. But her co-wife is forbidden to remarry, for a co-wife is not an acceptable witness with respect to her friend. Even if the one wife remarried already, we do not say that had the husband not truly died she would not have caused herself to become forbidden to her original husband (by marrying another man), because we are concerned that because of her hatred for her c0-wife she wants to cause her to become forbidden to the original husband as well.
This woman says "my husband died" and her co-wife objects and says "he did not die," this woman may remarry.  Just as she is not able to testify to permit her, so too she is not able to testify to forbid her [from remarrying].
If one woman says [her husband] dies and her co-wife says that he was murdered, since both say that he is not alive, both may remarry. 
When does this rule apply that a woman is believed to say "my husband died?" When there is peace between him and her and peace in the world.  But, if there is strife between him and her, such as she said, "He divorced me in front of so-and-so and such-and-such [witnesses]," and those witnesses came and contradict [her statement], --in italics: or if her husband converted and left her an aguna (that is, bound to her absent husband) (the commentary of Alfasi)--  and afterwards she and her husband went to a different state, and she came and said, "my husband died" she is not believed --in italics: Even if she said, "I buried him" (Beit Yosef in the name of the Magid Mishna chapter 13 in the Laws of Divorce)-- even though there is peace in the world. And even if one witness came and testified that her husband died, she may not marry, because maybe she hired him.  And if she married, she does not [need] to remarry, for she has a witness. And likewise with there was war in the world, and she came and said: "my husband died in the war" she is not believed, even though there is peace between him and her, she relies on the fact that the majority die, and she said he died, like if the first ones and the last ones were killed, and her husband was in the middle, she says, "since these and these were killed, he was killed with them." Therefore, she is not believed, even if she says, "I buried him."  And there are those that say that if she said: "I buried him," then she is believed.  And if she says, "He died on his bed," she is believed according to everyone. hegeh: And the same rule applies if she said that he died or was killed far from the war, she is believed, for it is only applicable to say that she surmised [that he died], if she says he died or was killed in actual battle, but if not in battle, even if he went close to the battlefront to purchase booty, she is believed (in the Mordechai in the second chapter [called] "The Woman" in the name of Raavya)
If there is no known war in the world, and a woman came and said, "There was a war in such and such a place and [my husband] died in the war," she should not remarry (as a matter of first resort).  If she does remarry we do not insist that she divorce.   Rem"a: Some say that even if she did remarry, she must divorce. 
One witness came and said, "I saw a man die in war or a building collapse."  If he says, "I buried him," [his wife] may remarry on his testimony.  If he did not say, "I buried him," she should not remarry, but if she did, she need not divorce.  Rem"a: But if two [witnesses came], even if they did not say, "we buried him," they are trusted.  Some authorities say that even in a case of one witness, even if he says, "he died" or "he was killed, and I saw him after and recognized him by his general appearance and I saw he was dead," he is trusted, because that is like saying "I buried him."  A non-Jew who speaks casually and says that [the man] died in war must also say, "I buried him."  Some authorities are lenient in this case.   
A woman who said, "My husband died under a building collapse" is not trusted.  Similarly, if there was an outbreak of snakes and scorpions and she said, "he was bit by a snake, or a scorpion, and he died," she is not trusted.  Perhaps she based her assumption on the majority of cases wherein such bites are fatal.  Rem"a: Therefore, the case is judged like a war, and she must say, "He died in his bed" or "I buried him".
If a woman said, "We were smoked out of our house, or our cave.  [My husband] died and I was saved," she is not trusted.  Just as a miracle happened for her, [it may have] also happened for him.
If it was a year of famine and a woman said, "My husband died," she is not trusted.  Rem"a: Even if she said, "He died in his bed." [If she said,] "He died and I buried him," she is trusted." Rem"a:  If she said, "He died of thirst," it is like she said, "he died of starvation." 
If she said: Kutheans fell upon us, or bandits, and he was killed and I was saved, then she is believed, for it is not their manner to kill women, so that we should say just as she was saved, so too he was saved.
If there was plague in the world and she said: "my husband died" she is believed. Rama : and there are those that say that she is not believed (Tur and Rabbeinu Yerucham)
A woman whose husband went to a different country and they came and told her, your husband died and she remarried and then her husband returned, it does not matter if she married by the word of one witness or two, even if she never had relations with the second man, she must leave both of them and she needs a Get from both, but she does not get Ketubah money from either of them, even if the first one takes her back.  Nor does she receive the benefits from her Melog property even though they are not obligated in redeeming it, but only what the second ate before the first one returned, but what he ate after the first one returned he must return to her.  Hew is not obligated to give that which was depreciated from her Tzon Barzel property, if they become completely depreciated, but what monetary value they have she receives.  And if she received from either of them Ketubah money or money for sustenance she must return it, but only if she took from the second after the first one came back, but if she took it from him before the first one came back she does not have to return it.  Neither of them must become impure for her if they were priests and neither of them acquire her findings, her handiwork and they cannot nullify her vows. She becomes invalid from marrying priests and eating Terumah or Ma'aser if she was the daughter of a Levite.  But her first husband does inherit her if she died.  If both men die, the bother of this man and that man perform Chalitzah but not Yibum.  A child from the second man is a Mamzer from the Torah if she gave birth before the first man divorced her, but if she gave birth after the first man divorced her, or if her died, the child from the second one is only a Mamzer according to the Rabbis.  And if the first man slept with her before the second one divorced her, the child he has from her is a Mamzer According to the Rabbis.   
If they told her, your husband died and she remarried, and then they told her, he was alive at the time and then he died, any child she had before he died is a Mamzer according to the Torah, and a child she has after is not a Mamzer.  Some say he is a Mamzer according to the Rabbis. 
If she did not marry a second man but was merely engaged and then her husband returns, she does not need a Get from the second man and she can return to her husband.  She would be permitted to the second man in the event her husband dies or divorces her [Rema: A woman who was engaged and mistakenly thought she was not engaged and married another man, she must leave both men and all laws stated above apply to her.  But if they forced her to get married or if the courts ruled in error and she married on their word, it is as if she was raped and she is still permitted to her first husband (The Rashbah's commentary brought by the Beit Yosef)].

Siman 18

Betrothal takes hold between those who are prohibited by a negative commandment or positive commandment, and all the more so, [between those] with secondary Rabbinic prohibitions (Tur).

Siman 19

One who is held to be a kinsman [in regards to illicit relations], we judge on this presumption in spite of the fact that there is no clear proof that he is a relative, and we lash [him] and strangle [him] and stone [him] according to this presumption.
A man and a woman that came from a foreign country, she says: this is my husband, and he says: this is my wife, if it becomes known in that city for thirty days that she is his wife, they kill because of her. 

Siman 20

If one has bodily contact or petting with one of the arayot (people with whom sexual relations are forbidden), or he hugged and had genital contact (literally kissing;  c.f. Yevamot 55b) and benefited from nearness of the flesh, he receives (biblically sanctioned) lashes, and in suspected of having relations with arayot.   Note: if he had intercourse with her, whether vaginally or anally, as soon as he begins intercourse, which is defined as insertion of the glans, he is liable for death or excision.  And the witnesses do not need to observe closely similar to insertion of the eyeliner in the tube, rather as soon as the witnesses see them intertwined with one another in the manner of adulterers, they are punishable by death (Tur), and the women is forbidden to her husband (Nimukei Yosef, Yevamot chapter 2). An adult woman who had relations with a minor male under the age of 9 years, is not liable for death at his hand (Tur). It appears to me that she is similarly not forbidden to her husband. And therefore the Rabbi, author of the Turim code wrote many laws defining when people are liable for death or not.  The modern day repercussions of these laws (when we no longer administer capital punishment) is that they define which relations cause a woman to become forbidden to her husband, and see further. A female less than 3 years old, her intercourse is not considered as intercourse, and her virginity returns (Hagahot Yevamot).  Even if the years were intercalated (e.g she had intercourse at 37 months old in a leap year) her virginity returns (words of the Rav, based on Yerushalmi Ketuboth chapter 1). 
Women who rub up on each other is forbidden, from it being like that of the forbidden sexual actions of the Egyptians (cf. Lev. 18:3), upon which we were warned.  And it is appropriate to strike them with disciplinary flogging since they have committed a prohibited action.  And there is for a man to be careful about his wife's activities in this regard and to hold back  women who are known to be involved in this from coming into see his wife or for her to visit them.

Siman 21

A person must stay very far from women. He is forbidden to signal with his hands or his feet, or to hint with his eyes, to one of the arayos. He is forbidden to be playful with her, to be frivolous in front of her, or to look upon her beauty. Even to smell the perfume upon her is forbidden. He is forbidden to gaze at women doing laundry. He is forbidden to gaze at the colorful garments of a woman whom he recognizes, even if she is not wearing them, lest he come to have [forbidden] thoughts about her. If one encounters a woman in the marketplace, he is forbidden to walk behind her, but rather [must] run so that she is beside or behind him. One may not pass by the door of a promiscuous woman [or: a prostitute], even four cubits [around 6–8 ft or 2–2.5 m] distant. If one gazes even at the little finger of a woman with the intent to have pleasure from it, it is as though he gazed at her shameful place. It is forbidden to listen to the voice of an erva or to look at her hair. If one intentionally does one of these things, we give him lashes of rebellion. These things are also forbidden in the case of ordinary Biblical prohibitions.
Jewish women may not go with uncovered head in the marketplace, whether married or not.
It is permissible to gaze at an unmarried woman to determine if she is attractive, in order [to decide whether] to marry her, whether she is a virgin or not, and moreover it is fitting to do so. But he may not look at her in a promiscuous way, and about this it is said (Job 31:1): "I made a covenant with my eyes, and how can I look upon a virgin?"
It is permitted for a man to look at his wife, even if she is menstrually impure and is an erva to him. Even though he has pleasure in looking at her, he will not come to sin, since she is permissible after a time. But he may not be playful or frivolous with her.
It is forbidden to be served by a woman at all, whether she is an adult or a minor, whether a slave or free, lest he come to have forbidden thoughts. What service were they speaking of? Washing his face, hands, and feet, even to pour water so he can wash his face, hands, and feet, even if she does not touch him; or making his bed in front of him; or pouring a drink. Rem"a: Some say that eating with her with a bowl is also forbidden with every erva, as with his menstrually impure wife. There are those who are lenient in all of this, that they only prohibited affectionate things with one's menstrually impure wife. Some say that all this is forbidden only when they are alone, but in a place like a bathhouse where many people are found, one may be washed by an idolatrous slave woman, and this is the custom. And some say that anything not done in a affectionate manner (בדרך חבה), where his intent is only for Heaven's sake, is permitted. Thus the custom is to be lenient in these things. Some say that one should not do affectionate things even with his wife, such as to inspect her head for lice, in front of others.)
One may not inquire after a woman's welfare at all, even through an intermediary, and it is forbidden to send regards to her even through her husband. But it is permissible to ask her husband about her welfare.
To hug or kiss one of the arayos whom people do not normally lust after, such as his adult sister or his aunt or similar, even though he derives no pleasure at all, is very reprehensible, forbidden, and the act of a fool. This is because there are no relatives for [the purposes of] licentiousness at all, whether adult or minor, except the father to his daughter and the mother to her son. How is this? A father is permitted to hug his daughter, kiss her, and sleep next to her with flesh touching, and so too a mother with her son, as long as they are minors. When they grow up, so that the son is an adult, and the daughter is an adult until "her breasts are formed and her hair grows" (Ezekiel 16:7), they must sleep clothed. If the daughter is embarrassed to stand before her father naked, or she is betrothed, and likewise if the mother is embarrassed to stand before her son naked – even if they are minors, when they reach the point of being embarrassed, they may not sleep together except clothed.

Siman 22

It is forbidden to be secluded with a person with whom sexual relations are forbidden, whether elderly or young. This action leads to uncovering of nakedness. This law does not apply to a mother with her son, a father with his daughter, and a husband with his menstruant wife. A groom whose wife became niddah before consummation is forbidden to be secluded with her.  Instead, she sleeps among the women and he sleeps among the men.  But if he consummated the marriage and then she became [menstrually] impure, he is permitted to be secluded with her (see Yoreh Deah chapter 192).
After the episode of Amnon and Tamar, David and his court forbade seclusion with an unmarried woman. Even if she is not forbidden as an "ervah" (person with whom sexual relations are forbidden), it is still considered as seclusion with a forbidden sexual partner.  Shammai and Hillel forbade seclusion with idol-worshippers (non-Jews). Therefore, anyone who is in seclusion with a woman with whom seclusion is forbidden, whether Israelite or idol-worshipper, [the court] administers lashes of rebellion (makat mardut - Rabbinically sanctioned lashes) to both, the man and the woman, and the punishment is publicized.  Note: [We administer lashes] only if it is known that he secluded with her, but her testimony alone is not sufficient [to convict him] (Rivash chapter 265).  Even a single witness is not believed (Maharik root 189). Nevertheless, when the court has reason to believe that there was a transgression, it is necessary to separate them (Rivash ibid.). However, with a married woman, even though it is forbidden to be secluded with her, if one did so, they do not administer lashes so as not to spread rumors that she had relations (with him), which would lead to rumors that her children are mamzerim (the products of a sexually forbidden union).
If his wife is with him, it is permitted to be secluded with any woman with whom seclusion is [usually] forbidden, since his wife guards him. But an Israelite woman may not seclude with an idol-worshipping male even if his wife is with him. 
We do not give over a Jewish child to an idol worshiper to teach him a book or a craft.  
One woman may not be in seclusion even with many men, unless the wife of one of the men is present.  And similarly, one man may not be in seclusion even with many women.  Note: And there are those who say that a woman may seclude herself with two "good men" [of fit morals] when in-town.  And men are to be considered as good men, generally.  But if they are "steeped" [in sexual immorality], it's forbidden to be secluded even with ten of them. And all this [applies] when in-town.  However, in the field, or during the night even in-town, three men are required to be there, even if they are "good men". And there are those who permit one man with many women, if his business is not [primarily] involved with women.
If there were many women with many men, we're not concerned about "yichud" [the prohibition of seclusion]. If the men were outside and the women inside, or the men inside and the women outside, and a woman separated to be among the men, or one man to be among the women, they are forbidden due to "yichud".
Even a man whose business and job is [primarily] with women is forbidden from secluding himself with the women. What should he do? He should do his business with them while his wife is present, or he should switch to another job.
We are not worried to be secluded with a woman whose husband is in-town, since the fear of her husband is upon her.  But if he was "familiar with her", such as if she grew up with him or is his relative, or her husband adjured her not to be in seclusion with him, then he may not be secluded with her, even though her husband is in-town.
A house whose door is open to the public domain, there is no concern for seclusion there with an "ervah" (person with whom sexual relations are forbidden). 
It is permitted to seclude with two women bound for levirate marriage; or two co-wives; or a woman with her mother-in-law; or a woman with the daughter of her husband; or a woman with the daughter of her mother-in-law, because they are antagonistic to (lit. hate) one another and will not cover-up for one another. Similarly [it is permitted to be secluded] with a woman who has with her a young female child who [is old enough to] understand the nature of intercourse but [is young enough that she] will not offer herself for intercourse, the adult woman will not engage in promiscuity in front of the child because she will reveal her secret. 
A girl younger than 3 years old, or a boy younger than 9 years old, it is permitted to be secluded with them, for [the Sages] only forbade seclusion only with a woman or man fit for [legally accountable] intercourse. 
One who is androgynous may not seclude with women. But if one does seclude, they are not lashed because their status is doubtful. A man is permitted to seclude with one who is androgynous or a <i>tumtum</i> 
Our Sages instituted that women should talk to one another in the toilet, so that a man will not enter there and be in seclusion with them. Note: And some say that this applied only in ancient times when the toilets were in the fields, but nowadays that toilets are in the city, there is no concern (Hagahot Maimoni, Hilchot Issurei Biah chapter 22).
A woman should not walk in the market with her son behind her, for fear that someone will grab her son, and when she goes after her son to return him, the kidnappers will abuse her. 
We do not appoint a man -- even a reliable and worthy man -- to be a watchman in a courtyard in which there are women, even if he stands outside, for there is no trustee for arayot (i.e. even pious men may become ensnared. C.f. GR"A who quotes Yerushalmi Ketuboth chapter 1). 
A man should not appoint a guardian for his house, so that he does not lead his wife to stray into transgression. 
It is forbidden for a Torah scholar to dwell in a courtyard in which there is a widow, even if he is not secluded with her, because of aspersion, unless his wife is with him. 
A widow is forbidden to raise a dog, because of aspersion.
A woman should not purchase male [Canaanite] slaves, even minors, because of aspersion.
An unmarried man should not teach children, for when the mothers come to school to pick up their children, he will arouse the women. Similarly, a woman should not teach small children because their fathers come on account of the children and they will be secluded with her.  The [married] teacher does not need to have his wife stay with him in school; it is sufficient that she stay at home and he teaches in his place. 

Siman 23

It is prohibited to spill seed needlessly and this sin is more severe than all Torah transgressions. For this reason a man should not thresh inside and sprinkle [his semen] outside [of a woman], and he should not marry a girl who is unable to have children.
Those who 'commit adultery' with their hand and thereby cause semen to be spilled it is not enough that this is a great prohibition, but one who does so should sit in excommunication and about them it is said "Their hands are full of blood" and it is as if they have killed a person. 
It is forbidden for a man intentionally make himself have an erection or to cause himself to think about sex. Rather if he thinks about sex he should remove himself from vain things and go to the words of Torah which is like a beloved doe and a graceful deer. Therefore it is forbidden for someone to sleep on their back with his face up, rather he should lean to the side so that he doesn't come to have an erection. And he shouldn't look at a beast or a wild animal or bird when the male and females are copulating. But it is permitted for those who bring animals to mate to 'put the applicator in the tube' because that is their work and it won't cause them to have sexual thoughts.  
It is forbidden for a man who is not married to touch his private parts so that he doesn't come to have a sexual thought. And he may not even touch anywhere under his belly button lest he have a sexual thought. And when he urinates he should not hold his member and urinate. But if he is married this is permitted. And whether married or unmarried he shouldn't put his hand on his member at all except when he must relieve himself (see Orach Chaim 3).
A woman who has some sort of closure in her womb and therefore when her husband has relations with her he sprinkles outside, this is prohibited (but it is permitted to have relations with a minor or an aylonit since this is the way of the land) (Tosafot and the Mordecai ch. 1 Yevamot, and Nimukei Yosef on the chapter [entitled] Haba al Yevamto).
It is prohibited to ride on a beast without a saddle. Hagah: In the Talmud in the chapter [entitled] Kol Hayad, it seems that it is forbidden to wear pants unless they are made like thigh holds for this will bring him to spill his seed. And even though we could reject this proof  and say that this refers only to those days when they had terumah and we had to be concerned about defiling the body, in any case since the Rosh cited this in his rulings, it seems that this is still prohibited today. And that which they were accustomed to permit this in the bathhouse it is possible to say that for a short time this is permitted, this is what seems to be true to me. Furthermore, in the Talmud they forbade one to wash with his father or brother or mother's husband or sister's husband. But now they are accustomed to allow this since they cover their genitals in the bathhouse, we need not be concerned about sexual thoughts (Agudah). 
Among the early pietists and great scholars was one that took pride in never having looked at the place where he had been circumcised, and one that took pride in never having contemplated on his wife's figure, as his mind would turn away from vain things to true matters which grasp the hearts of the holy ones.

Siman 24

We do not suspect Jewish men of lying with another man or with beasts. Therefore, we do not prohibit them from being alone with them, and if one wants to distance themselves from men or beasts, it is a praiseworthy thing. For the great sages (of old) used to keep beasts at a distance in order that they would not be alone with them. But in these generations because such corrupt people exist one should (therefore) try not be alone with a man.

Siman 25

It is appropriate for a person to accustom himself in extra holiness, and in pure thought, and in correct thinking, in order to be saved from stumbling into [doing] a forbidden sexual act. And he should be careful from being alone because this is a great causer [of sinning.] And this is the way he should behave to distance from entertainment and from intoxication, and from the words of suitors (explanation, the words of entertainment and desire). And he should not settle without a wife, because this custom causes great purity. Greater than all of this, they said, "One should turn himself and his thoughts to words of Torah and widen his knowledge in wisdom, for forbidden sexual thoughts only grow stronger in a heart devoid of wisdom.
A man should not act with levity with his wife, nor should he degrade his speech with nonsense, even between him and her.  The verse says, "He tells man what his speech is" (Amos 4:13) and the Sages comment, "Even light conversation between a man and his wife will be brought to judgement in the future."  He should not speak with her during intercourse, nor before it, lest he direct his thoughts to another woman.  If he does speak with her and proceed immediately to intercourse, about him the verse says, "He tells man what his speech is".  He may speak about matters pertinent to the intercourse, to increase his desire, or if there was strife between them and he needed to appeal to her and appease her, he may speak with her to appeal to her.  <i>Rem"a: He may do with his wife whatever he wishes.  He may have intercourse whenever he wishes, he may kiss any part of her body that he desires, he may have vaginal [typical] or anal [atypical] intercourse, or stimulate himself with other parts of her  body, so long as he does not ejaculate outside the vagina (Tur).  Some authorities are lenient and say that he may even ejaculate during anal intercourse, if it is occasional and not his habit (Tur).  Even though all of this is permissible, anyone who wishes to sanctify himself [by abstaining] from the permitted is called holy.</i>  He should not have frequent intercourse so that he is always with her, for this is extremely detrimental and it is the way of boors; it is meritorious to minimize intercourse, only keeping to the minimum required by marital obligations.  Even when fulfilling marital obligations he should not focus on his pleasure, it should instead be as on paying back an obligation, for he is obligated in marital duties, and to fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying, and to have children who study Torah and perform mitzvot for the people of Israel.  He may not have intercourse without her consent, and if she is not interested he should appease her until she is interested.  He should be very private during intercourse, having no people of any kind around, even a child, unless it is a baby who cannot speak.
One should not have relations in beginning of the night nor at the end, but in the middle.
It is forbidden to have relations in the marketplace, or in the streets, or in gardens or orchards, only in a dwelling place, so that it not look like prostitution and people would accustom themselves to prostitution. One who has sex with his wife in these places, they lash him with lashes of rebellion.
A man may not have sexual relations by candlelight and even if the light is darkened by a cloak.  If it was Shabbat and he had no other house and the light was lit, he should not have sex at all.  And similarly, he should not have sex during the day, for this is brazenness.  <i>See Orach Chayyim, 240:11 and 315:1</i>
It is forbidden to have relations during a famine, unless the family does not have enough children already.
A guest should not have intercourse until he reaches his home.
A man should not have intercourse with his wife if he hates her during the intercourse.  Similarly, if he has resolved to divorce her, even though he does not hate her, he should not have intercourse with her.
He should not have intercourse with her if he or she is intoxicated.
A man should not have intercourse with his wife and think about another woman, even if the other woman is also his wife.  <i>Rem"a: For more of these laws see (Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 240).</i>

Siman 26

A woman is not considered to be married except by way of betrothal in which the kosher betrothal was done appropriately. However, if he were to lie with her by way of harlotry, without the name of betrothal, it is nothing (towards her status as being a married woman). Even if he lies with her with the intent of marriage, mutually agreed between him and her, she is not considered as his wife and even if she dedicated herself only for him, rather the opposite is true and he must be forced (by Beis Din) to send her away from his home. Rem"a: For certainly she would be considered an embarrassment for immersion in a mikveh and he will lie with her in ritual impurity (niddah); however, if she dedicates herself exclusively for him as his wife and she immerses for him, there are those who would say that this is allowed and she would be a Pilegesh as described in the Torah and there are those who say that this is forbidden and they should both get whiplashes from the Torah as they have transgressed the precept "don't be a harlot." A Kuti who marries a Kutis and even a Mumar who marries a Mumerres in their (non-Torah) customs and they convert (or want to follow Halacha) afterwards, we are not at all concerned that they had an appropriate betrothal and he is permitted to send her out her without a Get, even though he remained together with her many years, this relationship is not considered anything but simple harlotry (Rivash 6 and Terumat HaDeshen, Part I 209), see Halachah 149:6.
If he brings a wife to the Huppah without appropriate betrothal, they are not married, but some say that they are doubtfully betrothed.
A betrothed woman is considered as a man's wife in that if another lies with her, they will be guilty of adultery and she would need a divorce in order to marry another man.
The woman is betrothed in 3 ways; with money, a document or with intimate relations, as learned from the Torah, but our sages prohibited betrothal by having relations because of impropriety, and if they transgressed this and he betrothed her with relations, he receives rabbinically decreed whiplashes and she is still betrothed. Even if he betrothed her with money or with a document and they did not arrange the marriage agreement beforehand or he betrothed her in the market place, he receives rabbinically decreed whiplashes and she is still betrothed. Rem"a: There are those who say that we don't give whiplashes if he betrothed her with money or a document, even in the market and without any arrangement and in my life, I never saw someone given whiplashes for becoming betrothed without arrangement. 

Siman 27

With money, how is the woman betrothed?, he gives her, in front of 2 witnesses a 'Pruta' or something worth 'the value of a pruta' and says, "Harei At Mekudeshet Li BaZeh" (With this, you are betrothed to me). [Rama: and there are those who say that he should add to this "according to the daat (religion) of Moses and Israel," and it is customary, a-priori, to betroth her with a ring, and there is a reason for this from the Tikunei Zohar (that the ring needs to be round with no breaks, like the letter "Samach" ed.)] And this is the same law if he said to her, "Harei you are... 'engaged to me,' or 'you are to me for a wife,'..." and the same for any language that have the essence of certain language of betrothal in that region and ONLY if she clearly understands that this is language of betrothal and if he spoke of marriage with her beforehand about the business of marriage and he gave her the gift (Pruta or Sheva-Pruta), then even in silence (and in front of two witnesses), she is betrothed. And if he is he is still involved in the same subject (of marriage), and of course, if he uses a certain language of betrothal, rather she does not (completely) understand his exact words, they are still betrothed. [Rama: Some say that the subject about which they are speaking is not necessarily marriage itself, rather they are speaking of subjects related to the subject of marriage and not about betrothal directly, rather they are speaking about the needs of the couple's relationship. And other say that it is not this subject about which they he is speaking with her, rather all the discussion before (he gives her the pruta) that apply in this matter.]
If he says to her "Harei... you are my wife (ishti)," "you are my one and only (zakukati)," "you are my property," "you are my betrothed," "you are mine," "you are in my domain," or "Harei, you are my acquisition." (in all these cases) she is betrothed. [Rama: If she understands his meaning or beforehand, they were speaking about marriage details, but the man is not believed (without her consent) because these are not certain languages of betrothal.]
If he says to her, "You are hereby unique to me," "designated to me," "my helpmate", "my counterpart", "my rib",  "my closed one," "my treasure chest," "my duplication (soulmate)." (in these cases) she is doubtfully betrothed <small>[Rama: Thus is the law, even if he says "You are hereby my espoused one [<i>harufati</i>]" But, if he says to her, "You are hereby my married one [<i>nessuati</i>]," there are those who say that this is nothing (not even a doubtful betrothal)]</small> as long he were to speak with her beforehand about dealings of engagement or marriage. However, if he did not speak with her about marriage dealings beforehand, we are not concerned about any of these phrases having an effect of marriage. [Rama: Someone who says to a woman "I give you this with love and affection," we are concerned that they may be betrothed since perhaps he said that he gives her this (gift) that it should be for 'love and affection' between them and it would be as if he used the language "you are specially chosen (Meuedet) for me" or "the only one for me." There are those who say that these utterances do not count if he does not speak with her about marital matters before hand. In any case, if she says that she accepted the gift in the name of betrothal, this is also a doubtful betrothal and even if he gave it to her in silence and said nothing and she and he both testify that their intention was to be engaged to each other, then they are betrothed; and in a place where they do not consider this as betrothal, even if he retracts afterwards (what he said or did) and said to her (the proper language of) "Harei At Mekudeshet Li," (Harei, you are betrothed to me), and he would need to take back the money (or gift) from her and give it again in the name of betrothal.]
If he says to her "Harei, you are betrothed" but does not say "Li" (to me), she is not betrothed [Rama: and this is the law, but there are strict poskim who would say that this is a kosher betrothal] and if he was speaking with her about the business of marriage, then she is betrothed. If he betrothed one woman first with a complete betrothal and said to another woman in front of her that she should be betrothed, but did not say "to me," then it is her hands that are proof and we are concerned that she is betrothed.
Some (poskim) would say that if at the time he gives her the money (or gift with the value of a pruta) he says to her, "I give this to you for the sake of betrothal," it is as if he said (the words) "to me." [Rama: and he would need to say this to her in a language that would prove his intention, for example, he would say "Thus they (or, we) are betrothed," or "Thus, they (we) shall be betrothed." However, if he says only "they are betrothed," this is nothing.
He says to her, "Hareini, I am your man (Ishecha)," "Hareini, I am your husband (Ba'alech)," or "Your betrothed;" these are nothing, even they were speaking initially about the business of betrothal since it is written, "Since (Ki) He will take..." and not "That (She'Yikach) he will take (through his declaration) for himself." [Rama: Similarly, if he gives the money to a man (her father) and says to him, "Harei, you are my father in-law," and did not say, "your daughter is betrothed to me," here there is also nothing.
If she gives money to him and she says, "Hareini, I am betrothed to you," she is not betrothed.
He gave her the money and she made the declaration (of betrothal); if he was already speaking about the business of betrothal beforehand, this is certainly a betrothal (since she declared her intent with words while he made it clear with his action), but if not (he did not speak about betrothal beforehand), this is a questionable betrothal (Saffek). However, if after her declaration, he answers "Yes," at the moment of his giving (and her declaration) then this is a certain betrothal, even if they were not discussing the business of betrothal beforehand.
If she gives a Dinar (a significantly valued coin, much more than a pruta) and she says to him, "This Dinar is for you a present by which I will be betrothed to you," and he accepts it; and he says back to her, "Harei, you are betrothed to me with the pleasure you received from my accepting this gift from you," if he is an important man, they are betrothed since the enjoyment she received (is worth more than a sheva pruta) is directly from him, and with this pleasure, she is accepting it like money from him; however, this transaction needs to be studied by a Chacham as to his status (as an 'important man') if he were not important, (their betrothal would be invalid, and) they would not need a Get (for her to be free). [Rama: And there are strict opinions whereby even if she did not initially say, "that I gave you and I will be betrothed to you," only that she gave him this gift stam (without words) and he declared "You are betrothed to me etc." then they are betrothed.
The minimum amount of money that can be used for a valid betrothal is the weight of half a barely's worth of pure silver (at the current exchange rate).

Siman 28

One who marries a woman [with money that was acquired] by robbery, or theft, or force: if the original owners have despaired [of recovering the money] and it is known that he acquired the object through their despair, then she is married.  If not, she is not married.  Rem"a: If he marries her with [with money that was acquired] by robbery or theft from a non-Jew, she is married, since he only has to return it because of the import of sanctifying God's name. If he marries her after [the original owner's] despair alone, she is married rabbinically. 
If he stole from the woman or robbed her or deceived her, he returns to her and betroths her with what was stolen, robbed or deceived from her, and he says to her, "Thus, you are betrothed to me with this". If there was not, prior [to this] an arrangement [to be married] between them, and she takes it and is silent, they are not betrothed. But if they had an arrangement [to be married] beforehand, Rem"a: She was appeased to marry him, even though that they did not arrange the giving of the dowry (Haghot Alfasi,  Kiddushin Chapter 1) or even if there was no arrangement between them, and when he says to her: "Be betrothed unto me with this" and he put it in her hand, and she says, "yes", they are betrothed. Rem"a: And it would be necessary to pay her what was stolen from her (Ran, Kiddushin Chapter 1). But if it were after he put it into her hand,  and he said "Be betrothed unto me with this", and even if she were to say "yes", they are not betrothed, even if they had an arrangement beforehand. Rem"a: And she is not believed to say that she received it before, in the name of betrothal (So too the Ra"n in the name of the Rashba, and the Beit Yosef brings him).    
Similarly, if he returned an outstanding debt that he had with her, and he said, "Take this coin that I owe you and become betrothed to me with it" before he gave it to her, and she received it in silence, if they were engaged to be married, she is betrothed.  If they were not engaged, she is not betrothed unless she said, "agreed."  If after he gave it to her he said, "you are betrothed to me through it," even if she agrees, she is not betrothed even though they were engaged.  Rem"a: All of this is if he said to her, "take this coin that I owe you," but if he said, "take this coin" without further comment, and then he said, "become betrothed to me through it," even though he owed it to her, and the time for repayment had arrived, she is betrothed, and she may not say, "I received it as repayment."  If he said to her, "take this coin that I owe you" and then he said, "I did not give it as repayment, but as betrothal," some authorities say that she is betrothed even if they were not engaged.  If he asked her to lend him money with collateral, and she gave him the money, and when he gave her the collateral he said, "become betrothed to me through it," and she received it silently, this is a case of doubtful betrothal.
If he gave her an item to watch and said, "Take this item into your possession to safeguard," and then he [changed his mind and] said, "You are hereby married   (mekudeshet, acquisition stage of marriage) to me with this item," if he made the marriage declaration before she took the item, and then she took the item, even though she remained silent, she is thereby married.

Rama: Some authorities say that this applies specifically when she took it in her hand, but if he tossed her the marital item, even into her lap, her silence in this case is worthless, for she never acquiesced to be married to him (Tur in the name of Ramah - R. Meir Halevi). 

Mechaber: If after she took the item for safeguarding he said, "You are hereby married to me with this item," and she remained silent, this is nothing (she is not married). But if she said "Yes," she is married.
If he says to her: 'betroth yourself to me through this object', and she says to him: 'behold, this is not worth a perutah', and he answers: 'betroth yourself to me through the four zuzim that are inside it' - this [is the case of a woman] consecrated [even though there is]  doubt. Rem"a: And this is the law if he didn't say again: 'betroth yourself to me', if he only said to her:  'behold, what's inside it is worth a perutah' she is doubtfully betrothed (Hagahot Alfasi, Kidushin chapter 100). A woman that grabbed coins from a man, and he asked that she give them back, and she didn't want to [give them back], and [because of this] he said: 'behold you are betrothed to me through them, and she kept quiet and kept the coins - this is not [a case of] consecration, this is [a case of] keeping quiet after receiving coins, and it is nothing [of legal consequence] (Teshuvat Maharam Padua, siman 24)
If he left collateral in her hand or if he lent her an object and said to her: become betrothed to me through the collateral or lent object in her hand, and it was found that it was stolen or lost, if it still has the value of a perutah she is engaged to him but if not she is not engaged.  This is only true if she did not know the value of the collateral and she wants to get engaged with it whether it is worth a lot or a little, but if she does know its worth and it was found to have been stolen or lost, even though it has the value of a perutah she is not engaged [Tur: because she only wanted to get engaged with the value of the collateral]. 
If he had loaned to her, even with a writ, and he says to her: "You are betrothed to me with the loan that you owe me," she is not betrothed, even if the monies remain with her and she had not spent them. Rem"a: Even if he had returned the writ to her, and it is worth a perutah (Tur in the name of Rambam). Some are stringent in this regard (Ra"n on the second chapter of Kiddushin; Magid Mishneh on chapter 5 [of Mishneh Torah, Laws of Marriage]).

The same applies if she owes him wages for work he did for her, even if the time to collect the loan or wages has arrived.
If he said to her: "Become betrothed to me with this promissory note" and gave it to her, we appraise the paper. If it is worth a perutah, she is betrothed. If not, her betrothal is in doubt.
If he loaned her 200 zuz now, and says to her: "You are betrothed to me with the benefit of the time I gave given to you through this loan, that you will have X days before I claim [the debt] from you on such-and-such date," she is betrothed, but one may not do so, for this is akin to [charging] interest.
If he had loaned her, and he says to her: "You are betrothed to me with the benefit of my forgiving the loan," or if he says to her, "You are betrothed to me with my extension of your [repayment] period," she is betrothed, but it is forbidden to do so because of [the prohibition against charging] interest. Some say that she is not betrothed. Rem"a: We show concern for both opinions, and thus if another man betrothed her, she needs a get from each (Kol Bo in the name of Rama"h, cited by Tur). If she owed others, and one came and gave a perutah to the creditor to extend her time, and thereby betrothed her, she is betrothed (Tosafot, Mordechai, and Ra"n at the beginning of Kiddushin).
If [a man] gave [his fiancee] a loan as a collateral, even a collateral during the loan, they are married because of the loan, if she returns her collateral or if collateral that already belonged to her (Rav Yitzchok quotes the Rama), they are married. 
There are those that say that even if she did not return the collateral [loan], she is married. 
If he held collateral on debt owed to him by others, and he married a woman with the collateral, she is married; for the lender has [partial] acquisition rights in the body of the collateral.

Rama: some say that this applies only with collateral given not at the time of the loan (Tur in the name of the Rosh). This only applies with collateral from an Israelite, but with collateral from an idol-worshipper she is not married (Mordechai, beginning of Kiddushin). [Even with collateral from a non-Jew, if the lender sold it to another, and the buyer of the collateral used it to marry a woman, she is married (Mahariv, chapter 138). 
If the debt was in the hands of others, he should say to her: you are married to me on the debt that I have in this one's hand, on the condition of three things [listed later], we are married.
There are those who say that she is not married. 
But if not, they say that it depends on three things: if she is in monetary debt, if she can be provided with the money as required, both written and transmitted, she is not married, but with a doubt.  
If she owes him from a loan, and he gave her a perutah[-worth] and said to her, "Marry me through the [worth of the] loan and the perutah," the kiddushin is effected.
If he says to her, "Marry me for the worth of the work I will do for you," and he did it, she is not married. Some say she is married. Rama: If he was contracted for the work, that a professional does acquire [a wife] through the betterment of utensils (Tur in the name of the R'Y). And the utensil remains with him, and he marries her through its worth, everyone agrees she is married, for it is like a loan [she owes] that has a collateral [that he has of hers] (Rabbeinu Yerucham 22). If he gives a perutah for the needs of the work, and he marries her with it, the marriage is good according to everyone, for it is like a loan and a perutah (Tur). If he does work for a different person and a perutah is owed to him, then it is like a loan in the hands of others (explanation of the Mordechai according to the Rabbi, as it is written in the beginning of A"N Umeyad Sheasa Hasachir etc).
If one made kiddushin (proposed marriage) with a loan, or one who has relations without planning it to be for the sake of marriage yet in front of witnesses which saw him alone with her, the woman needs a get (divorce) in both cases, before she may marry another man, out of doubt that maybe she is married. Hagah: the same law applies to the case where one made kiddushin with money valuing less than a "perutah" and then had relations, as well as any other case like this. 
One who enters his fellow's house and takes a vessel, a piece of food or something like this and uses it to betroth a woman, and then the homeowner comes, even if he says to him: Why didn't you give her this thing that is better than the thing you gave her, she is not betrothed, for he said this only so that the other wouldn't be embarrassed. And since he betrothed her using his friend's property without his friend's acknowledgment, behold he has stolen and she is not betrothed. 
But if he betrothed her with something that the homeowner doesn't really care about, like a date or a nut, behold she is doubtfully  betrothed.
Hagah: A guest who is sitting with a homeowner [dining], and he takes his portion [of food] and uses it to betroth [her], behold she is betrothed [Hagahot Alfasi]. 
If he had some merchandise shared with his friend and he divided it without his friend's consent, and he betrothed her with his share, since it requires a court's appraisal [to divide assets] she is not betrothed, for this one cannot take what he wants [from the joint property] and leave the other what he wants.
Hagah: And even if he gives her all of the merchandise that is in his possession and an extra perutah she is not betrothed for she only agreed to be betrothed with everything (Hagahot Maymoniyot, ch. 5, Ishut, in the name of the Ramban, the Rashba, and so too wrote the Ran). 
And if it is something where everything is of equal value and doesn't require an appraisal, behold she is betrothed.

One who borrows an object from his friend and let him know that he wanted to use it to betroth a woman, she is betrothed.
And if not, she is doubtfully betrothed.
Hagah: And the same is true with regard to one who rents a vessel or other object from his friend and uses it for betrothal (Torat Haadam, siman 210). 
If he borrowed a vessel from a woman who is already married, and he betrothed with it, we must be concerned that the betrothal is valid, even though everything acquired by a wife is acquired by her husband and he didn't borrow it from the husband (Rashba, in the name of the Rama and the respons of the Ramban, siman 144). 
One who gives his fellow a gift on condition that he returns it, and the one who received it goes and uses it to betroth a woman, behold she is betrothed. 
One who betrothes with something that is totally Rabbinically forbidden from which to benefit, which has no essence in the Torah, she is betrothed.  If it is is with biblically forbidden Chametz at a time [when it is] rabbinically forbidden, or with rabbinic Chametz at a biblically forbidden time, it is a doubt whether she is betrothed.  If it is totally biblically forbidden, such as biblical Chametz at a biblically [forbidden] time, she is not betrothed.  Rema: A community that decreed and made an agreement among themselves that whoever betrothes without ten [i.e., a minyan] or similarly [that the betrothal is not valid], we are sensitive to the betrothal and she needs a Get.  Even though the community stipulated explicitly that it is not a betrothal and his money [with which he betrothed her] is ownerless, even so we must be stringent on a practical basis (Maharik 84).  A woman who vowed against benefiting from a specific man or against anything that is given to her not in the presence of specific individuals, and a man transgresses and betrothes her, she is not betrothed, because it is as though he betrothed her with something that is forbidden from which to benefit.  This is specifically when he betrothes her with money, but if he betrothes with a contract, it is a valid betrothal (Rashba 602 and 603).
If he transgressed and sold items that are forbidden for benefit, and betrothed with their proceeds, she is betrothed. And if he sold them to a Jew, and the purchaser did not know that they were forbidden for benefit, and the seller took their proceeds and betrothed with their proceeds, she is doubtfully betrothed. These rules apply to items that are forbidden from benefit other than idols, for if he sold one of them and betrothed with its proceeds, she is not betrothed.
A first-born [animal], in the current era, if its owners betrothed using it, she is doubtfully betrothed.

Siman 29

The one who says to a woman: behold you are betrothed to me with this dinar on condition that you will return them to me, she is not betrothed. Ram''a: But the woman that gives a gift to one on condition to return it to her after thirty days, in order that he will betroth her with it within thirty days, and he gave it to her within thirty days for kiddushin, she is betrothed. There are those who say that if he gave her a gift on condition to return it and he said to her: With the enjoyment that you are enjoying [from the gift] while [saying] behold you are betrothed to me, it is kiddushin.

If she said to him, "Give a dinar to so-and-so, and I will be betrothed to him (to so-and-so), and he gave [the dinar] to that man, and that man betrothed her and said to her, "You are hereby married to me by dint of the benefit accrued to you from my acceptance [of the dinar] at your behest, she is betrothed. 
If she said to him: Here is a portion for you and I will be betrothed to you [with it], it is explained in Siman 27 (Saif 9).
If he said to her: Here is for you a Dinar of mine and be betrothed [with it] to so-and-so, and that someone had made him an emissary, or if he hadn't made him an emissary and that someone said to her: Be betrothed to me with the portion that so-and-so gave to you, behold she is betrothed.
If he said to her: be betrothed with [this] dinar, and he gave her condition [which is] until he will [be able to] give the dinar, she is not betrothed. Ram"a: All the more so if he gave her a document instead of a dinar, as this is not betrothal (the Rem"a is saying this in the name of the Rashba); He says to her, you are betrothed with this dinar and you will earn it through the fact that I am giving you this condition now, behold she is betrothed.
One who says to a woman:"Behold I acquire you with a hundred dinars", and [after saying that] he gives her even just one dinar, behold she is acquired from when she had taken the dinar and he pays to her the remainder [later], It is as if he says: "Behold I acquire you with this dinar on condition that I will give you two hundred  zuz, she is acquired for him from now [the time she accepts that dinar]. 
One who says to a woman: Become betrothed to me with this Dinar so that I will give you a portion, and she says: in order that you give me two hundred, and he went to his house and she went to her house and they did not reach an agreement between them, and afterwards they claimed each other, and became betrothed, and he gave her a Dinar, if the man claimed the woman, they must act according to the words of the woman and he gives her two hundred; but if the woman claimed the man, they act according to the words of the man, and he only gives her a [single] portion.
One who says to a woman: Become betrothed to me with this cup if it was full of water, behold she is betrothed by it and its contents, for they join together to be equal to a perutah. And if it was full of wine, behold she is betrothed by it and not by its contents, and if it was full of oil, behold she is betrothed by its contents and not by it; therefore, if there was not [enough] oil to equal a perutah, behold she is betrothed in doubt; and if there was [enough] oil to equal a perutah, she is certainly betrothed. And there are those who disagree and say, in [the case of] water, by it and not by its contents; and in [the case of] wine, by its contents and not by it; and in [the case of] oil or fish brine, by it and by its contents.
If he had various vessels or various foods, or any other thing, and she said "give me some of these," and he said "if I give to you, you'll be betrothed to me," if she said "yes," and he gave her, she is hereby betrothed. But if she said to him "give me of them," or "toss to me," or words whose effect is "don't play with me with these things, but just give them to me," and he gave her, she is not betrothed. Rem"a: And if he said to her at the time that he was giving to her, "you are hereby betrothed to me," and she accepted, she's betrothed (Tur, in the name of the Ro"sh). And if she accepted silently, but went back and said "give me," or "toss," or the like, she is not betrothed (so is implied in the words of the Ro"sh). And all of this is when she started by saying "give me some," but if he started by saying "if I give you, you'll be betrothed to me," and she said to him in playful speech "give," and she accepted from him, it is a doubtful betrothal (reasoning of the Ra"n). And similarly, if he was drinking wine, and she said to him "give me one cup," and he said to her "if I give you, you are hereby betrothed to me through it," and she said "give me to drink" (or "give"), and he gave her to drink, she is not betrothed, since the words seem to only be "just give me to drink, and don't play with me about something else." And if he said at the time that he was giving it to her "you are hereby betrothed to me," and she accepted, she is betrothed.

Siman 30

One who betroths a woman with money or a contract doesn't need to give the betrothing-object into her hand, rather, since she wants him to throw her the betrothing-object and he throws it, whether into her hand or into her lap or into her courtyard or into her field, she is betrothed. 
If she was standing on property owned by the husband, he has to put the kiddushin (money or writ) into her hand or her lap. 

Note: If the husband lent her an area in his courtyard, the law is the as with [handing over a writ of] divorce. Vide infra chapter 139 se'if 11).
If she was standing in property belonging to the two of them, and he tossed her the kiddushin [money or writ] with her knowledge, but it did not land in her hand or lap, she is married doubtfully.  Even is she told him, "Set my kiddushin in this place," and that place belonged to both, this is a doubtful kiddushin (marriage). 
If she was standing in an alley (meaning a path belonging to an individual) or in the sides of public property, and he threw them [the kiddushin] into her surrounding 4 cubits, she is married.  But if they remained in his surrounding 4 cubits, she is not married.  Even if she entered into those 4 cubits, because he preceded her there and already [re]acquired the [kiddushin] items and they belong to him. 
If they were standing in a public domain or in a domain that did not belong to either of them, and he tossed her the kiddushin, if it is closer to him, she is not betrothed. If it was closer to her, she is betrothed.  If equidistant, or there was doubt as to whether it was closer to him or closer to her, and the kiddushin money was then lost before it arrived in her hands, she is doubtfully betrothed.  How do we define closer to him or closer to her? Items which he can guard and she cannot guard are deemed as closer to him. If she can guard them and he cannot, it is closer to her. If both can guard the items or neither can guard them, this is defined as half and half. 
If he tossed the kiddushin money to her, even into her lap, but she did not pick it up, and remained silent, there is an authority who says that the action is negligible because she did not previously agree to become betrothed to him. 
If he said to her: Be betrothed to me with this Dinar, and she picked it up and threw it into the sea before him, or into the air or any [place where it would be] lost, she is not betrothed. And it is not necessary to mention if she threw it before him to a place [where it would] not be lost, for this proves that she does not desire betrothal [with him]. And see below Siman 43 Saif 1.
If he said to her, be betrothed to me by a portion, and she said: Give it to my father, or to your father, or to so-and-so, and he gave it to them, even if he said to her: Be betrothed to me by the portion that I gave to them, she is not betrothed. But if she said: They they may accept it for me, she is betrothed, even if he did not respond and say: Be betrothed to me by the portion that I gave to them.
[If he said:] Be betrothed to my by a portion, and she said: Leave it on the rock, she is not betrothed. And if it was her rock, she is betrothed. And there are those who say [this applies] specifically if she identified the rock for him, as [is the case if] she said to him: Put it on such and such a rock or on my rock, but if she said simply: On the rock, and he put it on her [rock], she is not betrothed (Tur in the name of the Ramah). If the rock belonged to them both, behold she is doubtfully betrothed.  Hagah: And the Rosh (Beit Yosef in his name) and the Tosafot (Tur in their name) explain that all this pertains if he after gave it into her lap in silence, even in this case if she first said: Put in on a rock, she is not betrothed, and on her rock etc.
[If he said:] Be betrothed to me by this loaf of bread, and she said to him: Give it to such and such a poor person, even if the poor person was next to her, she is not betrothed. And this also pertains [to the case in which] he afterwards put it in her lap (Tur).
[If he said:] Be betrothed to me by this loaf of bread, and she said to him: Give it to this dog, if it was her dog, behold she is betrothed. And if not, she is not betrothed. And if it was running after her to bite her, behold she is doubtfully betrothed. Hagah: And this also applies similarly if he afterwards put it in her lap (Tur in the name of the Tosafot). If she first said: Give the loaf of bread to the dog, or put a Dinar on the rock, and I will be betrothed to you, there are those who say the ruling is as if she said: Give a Dinar to so-and-so (Tur in the name of Yesh Omrim), and as was explained above Siman 29 Saif 2, and one should be stringent in the matter (Tur).

Siman 31

Kiddushin (the initial "acquisition" part of marriage) may not be performed with less than the equivalent of a perutah.  Despite this, if he acquired a wife with an unspecified object, he does not need to first assay it to determine that it is worth a perutah, rather if is indeed worth a perutah, she is acquired. Even if he tells her, "Marry me with this item worth 50 zuz," and they did not first assay it, if it is afterward found to be worth 50 zuz, she is acquired. 
There are those who say that if he betrothed her with something for which there are no experts able to appraise its value and sometimes people make large mistakes [in its appraisal] such as precious stones and pearls, and he said to her: Become betrothed to me with this stone worth fifty zuz", it needs to be appraised, for she cannot be assured [as to its value]. And there are those who say that even if he betrothed her with a stone and didn't say that it was worth fifty zuz, that it must be appraised.
This is why the custom is to betroth with a ring in which there is no stone.
Hagah: And if he betrothed her with a ring in which there was a stone, or with a regular ring and it turned out to be copper, even though it is not customary to use this for betrothal, we must be concerned that she is betrothed (Bet Yosef citing a responsa of R. Shimon bar Tzemah, and Mordecai, first chapter of Kiddushin). 
And even if witnesses under the huppah say that it was gold and it turns out that it was copper, even though according to the law it would seem that she shouldn't be betrothed, even in this case we should rule stringently when it comes to acting (Responsa of Maimonides, end of Laws of Women). And in any case, we have the custom to ask the witnesses under the huppah if the ring is worth a perutah, so that the bride would know that she is betrothed only with something worth a perutah (Orhot Hayyim). We also have the custom to cover the face of modest brides, and they are not so cautious about what they are betrothed with (explained in a responsum of the Rashba).
If he betrothed her with food or a vessel or something like this that is worth less than a perutah, she is doubtfully betrothed, lest this thing is worth a perutah somewhere else.
And there are those who say that if he betrothed her with a cooked dish or a vegetable that cannot last or something of this nature, if it was not worth a perutah in that place, she isn't betrothed at all, for this thing cannot go somewhere else before it loses its value and won't be worth a perutah. 
That which we said that she is betrothed based on the doubt that perhaps this thing is worth a *perutah* [small coin] somewhere else [means that] she requires a *get* [bill of divorce] to permit her to the world. And if he wants to keep her, she needs another betrothal transaction. And if he betrothed her after a full betrothal [by another man], the first should divorce, and the second should marry, but the secound should not divorce, while the first marries.
Rem"a: And this is only when the second one did not come upon her before the divorce, but if he did come upon her, she is thereby forbidden to the first one (Mordechai, first chapter of Kiddushin). And just as she is forbidden to the husband, so she is forbidden to the one who had relations. And see later, Siman 46, Se'if 5. And there are those who say that if she bore a child from the second, and the first had not divorced, the child is kosher.
One who says to a woman, "Become betrothed to me with this date. Become betrothed to me with this one. Become betrothed to me with this one," if one of them has in it the value of a *perutah* [small coin], she is thereby betrothed. And if not, she is only betrothed doubtfully, just in case a single date is worth a *perutah* somewhere else. And if he said to her, "Become betrothed to me with this, and with this, and with this," they are all joined, so that if all of them [together] have in them the value of a *perutah*, she is betrothed, and if not, she is only betrothed doubtfully. If she was eating one at a time, if the last one had in it the value of a *perutah*, she is betrothed, and if not, she is only doubtfully betrothed, as those dates that she ate were like a loan, and one who betrothed with a loan - she is not betrothed, and it turns out that only the final date is a betrothal transaction.
If he said to her, "Become betrothed to me with these," and she ate them one at a time, the ones that she ate also are joined to [constitute] the value of a *perutah* [small coin], since he had finished all of his words before he fave her anything, so therefore, as soon as he gave her the first one, it reached her hand in the status of a betrothal transaction, and she was eating her own. And it's the same rule if he said "with this and with this," and he had finished all of his words before she accepted them, they all join together, even if she at one at a time. And there is one who disagrees with this.
If he said to her, "Let half of you become betrothed to me with half a *perutah* [small coin], and have of you with half a *perutah*," or he said to her "half of you with a *perutah*, and half of you with a *perutah*," or "half of you with a *perutah* today, and half of you with a *perutah* tomorrow," or "your two halves with a *perutah*," or if he said to his friend "your two daughters for my two sons with a *perutah*," or "your daughter is betrothed to me and your cow is sold to me with a *perutah*," or "your daughter is betrothed to me and your land is sold to me with a *perutah*," she is thereby doubtfully betrothed.
One who says to a woman, "Become betrothed to half of me," she is thereby betrothed. What is this similar to? To one who says to her, "Be my wife - you and another [woman]," since it comes out that she only has half a man. But if he said, "Half of you is betrothed to me," she is not betrothed, as one woman is not available for two. And similarly, one who says, "You are hereby betrothed to me and to this [man]," she is not betrothed.
If he got betrothed to her with less than the worth of a p'rutah, even if he sent her 'sivlonot'(explained as presents, for it is a term of burden and weight, and 'weight' can be found as a term for present, such as "and he carried presents" (Genesis 43, 34) afterwards, they do not suspect that he sent those 'sivlonot' for the purpose of betrothal. But if he got betrothed to her with less than the worth of a p'rutah, and afterwards he had intercourse with her, unspecified, in the presence of witnesses, she will need a divorce, since it is certain that he had intercourse for the purpose of betrothal.  gloss: The same law applies with a child who got betrothed and then grew up with her. She will need a divorce, because he certainly had intercourse when he became grown up for the purpose of betrothal (TUR, section 43 and responsa of the ROSH, rule 35). And only in this [type] of case, because every person knows that the betrothal of a child or with less than the worth of a p'rutah is nothing, and so he had intercourse for the purpose of betrothal. But in a situation where there is room for a mistake, a new betrothal is needed (Responsa Maimoni, end of Nashim), as it is explained in this section, article 4:

Siman 32

With a document how [is she engaged]? He writes to her on a paper or on a pottery shard even though it is not worth a Perutah "Behold you are engaged to me" and he gives it to her in front of witnesses.  And he must write it for the woman he is getting engaged to like with a Get.  If he didn't write it for her name, she is not engaged to him.  He can only write it by her will, but if he wrote it against her will, she is questionably engaged. 
Even if the document is invalid to use for engagement they evaluate the paper, if it was worth a perutah she is engaged but if not she is questionably engaged. 
If she were a minor or a young girl [between 12 and 12.5 years old] and she is getting engaged through her father with a document her writes "your daughter is betrothed to me". 
There are those who say that he must write the names of the man and the woman in the document of engagement the way he must write them in a Get.  [Rema: If he wrote it on something attached to the ground or on something from which benefit is forbidden there are those who say it is invalid (Maggid Misheh Chapter 3 of Ishut), and there are those who permit it (Rashba 703). He does not have to write the time in the document of engagement (Rabeinu Yerucham).  If he wrote it in his hand and there are no witnesses on it she is questionably engaged (Nimukei Yosef the Chapter of Four Brothers).  If he gave her a document and said, on the condition that the paper remains mine she is not engaged (Ran First Chapter of Kiddushin). 

Siman 33

With sex, how? He said to her before two witnesses: "Behold you are married to me with this sex," and he secludes himself with her before two witnesses, behold she is betrothed (even though she is bold.) Either he has sex with her in the normative fashion or he has sex with her in the non-normative fashion. And her status is only as someone who is engaged, not like a married woman. Ram"a: There are those who say that it is precisely when he has sex with her in the house of his father-in-law, but if he brought her into his own house and had sex with her, or betrothed her already and had sex with her, she is considered like a married woman. There are those who say that a single man who has sex with a single woman before witnesses, we are considered lest he intends [this act] for the sake of marriage, and the presumption is that a man does not have promiscuous sex. But if he is already presumed towards promiscuity, or that he has another wife, we are not concerned. There are those who are lenient in this matter.
The one who marries a woman with sex, his intention [is fulfilled] upon finishing the sexual act. Therefore, if before he finished she received kiddushin from another, she is married to the second [person]. But if he was stimulated in her, and leaves immediately, or when he said before that his intention to acquire upon being stimulated, he acquires immediately.

In later times it became simply a canopy which was erected out of four sticks and a piece of cloth. There is still debate as to the legal consequences of a <i>Ḥuppah</i>. One view is that the <i>Ḥuppah</i> represents the groom’s home and this fulfills the need for the bride to be brought to the groom’s home for <i>Nissuin</i>. Another view is that the <i>Ḥuppah</i> embraces a private meeting for the consummation of the marriage proper.

If the man did not make the blessing of betrothal at the time of the betrothal he should not say it<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>.</i> at the time of the marriage ceremony. <small>[Note: There are those who say that one makes this blessing at the time of the marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">(ceremony).</i> (Mordechai, Chapter 1, <i>Ketubot</i>), and thus it is customary (even if he had long since betrothed the woman) he should pronounce the blessing of betrothal under the <i>Ḥuppah</i>. And there are those who say that he should again betroth her under the <i>Ḥuppah</i>, in order that the betrothal should take place near the time of the blessing (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet #82; see below #36) and if the blessing of betrothal had already been pronounced at the time of the first betrothal there are those who say that one repeats the blessing under the <i>Ḥuppah</i> without mentioning the name of God because of the onlookers (<i>Ibid</i>., “concerning the matter of betrothal through an agent” and so it appears to me correct.)]</small>
The blessing of betrothal requires ten to exist â priori.

<b>the Laws of Agency For Betrothal</b> • 15 Paragraphs<br>A man may appoint an agent to betroth for him a woman, whether it is any woman or a specific woman, and the agent should say to her, “Behold you are betrothed to Ploni.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbanic equivalent of John Doe. It is used to indicate that a specific man must be designated. Its usage changes the general to the specific.</i> However if it is possible for him to betroth her in person it is forbidden to betroth her through an agent, unless he knows her, lest afterward he find in her something reprehensible and she becomes reprehensible to him. In any case even though he knows her, it is a <i>mitzvah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A commandment, precept or religious duty. The term is derived from the Hebrew “to command or to ordain.” In common usage it has taken on the meaning of a good deed or a meritorious act as distinct from a commandment.</i> that he should betroth her in person if possible.
The agent<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">(automatically).</i> becomes a witness, therefore if he appointed two agents to betroth for him a woman no other witnesses are necessary: To what does this refer? When there is no denial of money, as for example he betrothes her with a <i>Shetar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Formal legal document or deed, derived from the Akkadian <i>sataru</i>, meaning writing. In the presence of two competent witnesses, the bridegroom hands over to the bride a deed in which is written, besides the names of the parties and the other particulars required for <i>Kidushin</i> by <i>Shetar</i>, “Behold you are consecrated unto me with this deed according to the law of Moses and of Israel.” Delivery to the bride and her acceptance constitute a legal marriage.</i> or even with money and she acknowledges that she received it from him, but if she says that she did not receive it for the sake of betrothal, but instead for the sake of a deposit. However, if there is a denial of money, and she does say that she did not receive money from them (or a writ worth the equivalent of a <i>perutah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One of the Jewish coin denominations mentioned in Jewish sources.

The relation between <i>Perutah</i> and silver coinage is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Kidushin</i> 2a,12a).</i> (<i>Magid</i> <i>Mishnah</i>, Chapter 3) behold this is a doubtful betrothal.
It is not necessary that witnesses be present when the man appoints an agent to betroth him a woman, only that the agent and the sender acknowledge this (this is not considered acknowledgement unless he acknowledges in the presence of witnesses as is the rule for an admission) (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet, paragraph 193). However,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">(in the case of).</i> an agent of a woman, where she appoints an agent to accept betrothal, it is necessary that there be witnesses and there are those who say that also when a man appoints an agent you need witnesses. <small>[Note: There are those who say even if a woman appoints an agent without witnesses we must be stringent<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the betrothal is valid.</i> (Tur in the name of R.

The exact origin is unknown. In Mishnaic times it was a relatively simple document but later the document was expanded. The important features are the date, the place, the names of the parties, the signatures of the witnesses and the phrases which express separation. One of the most essential parts of the <i>Get</i> is the expression, “Thou art permitted to any man.”</i> (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet, Chapter 83). And if there are no witnesses to the matter and the sender denies that he appointed him as an agent there are those who say this is a doubtful betrothal (R. Mordechai Ben Hillel, <i>Halachot</i>, Chapter “<i>Haish</i> <i>Mekadesh</i>”) and there are those who say that she is not betrothed at all (R. Eliezer B. Joel Halevi and R. Judah Mintz) and this appears to be correct.]</small>
There is one authority who says that even if he did not appoint an agent explicitly, merely revealed his opinion that he desired a specific woman, and told him to make the preliminary arrangements and the arranger of preliminary arrangements went and betrothed her for him without being appointed as the agent, behold she is betrothed.
There is one authority who says that if the father told his son that he was willing to betroth her for him, and the son remained silent, and the father went and betrothed her for him, behold she is betrothed.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">(For the reason).</i> Due to his being ashamed in front of the father he remained silent and in effect appointed him an agent to betroth her for him. However in a similar case if it were another person<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., not the father.</i> then the betrothal is doubtful.
All are fit to be an agent for betrothal except the deaf-mute,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In Jewish legislation deaf and dumb persons are frequently classed with minors and insane people and are considered unable to enter into some transactions requiring responsibility and will.

Mordechai Ben Hillel, Chapter “<i>Hamekabel</i>” in the name of some anonymous Rabbis) if he transmits to him the betrothal money or object that the owner transmitted to him, but if the owner did not transmit to him the betrothal money but only commanded him to betroth with any money he might want, he cannot appoint an agent. And there are those who say that in all cases the first agent cannot appoint a second agent (<i>Hagahot</i> <i>Mordechai</i>, Chapter <i>Haish</i> <i>Mekadesh</i>). If he sends a document through a non-Jew to an Israelite friend who is in another place and appoints him to be an agent to betroth him a woman there are those who say that the law is like in <i>Gittin</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Name of a treatise of the Mishnah, elaborated in the Palestinian and Babylonian Gemaras.

(Thus it is written in <i>Bet</i> <i>Yosef</i>.)]</small>
If one says to an agent betroth me to a woman in a specific place and he betrothes her in another place, she is not betrothed. And likewise in all instances concerning a change; for if he said betroth me unconditionally and he was betrothed to her conditionally or if he said to him betroth her conditionally and he betrothed her unconditionally or the condition is changed, she is not betrothed.
If he should say to him<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the agent.</i> “betroth her to me and behold she is in such and such a place” and he betrothes her in a different place she is betrothed, because he does not insist<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">(that it be the named place).</i> he merely points out to him the place.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the place where she may be found.</i>
If one appoints an agent to betroth for him a specific woman and the agent goes and betrothes her for himself, behold this is deceitful, and what is done is done<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., valid.</i> if he did not betroth her with the sender’s money. Even if he<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">the agent.</i> said to her first, “I was sent by Ploni to betroth you to him” (and at the hour of betrothal he said to her “you are betrothed unto me” behold she is betrothed to the agent) (Tur) provided that the woman heard and completely understood before she accepted the betrothal money or object<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the king, etc.</i> when he said “behold you are betrothed unto me,” because otherwise she accepted the betrothal according to what was said at the beginning, i.e., to betroth her to Ploni. However, if the agent erred and said, “you are betrothed unto me” there is nothing to fear as <i>hekdesh</i> made by mistake is not considered <i>hekdesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Originally the term applied to property dedicated to the needs of the Temple. After the destruction of the Temple the term was principally used to signify the dedication of property for a charitable purpose or for the fulfillment of some other mitzvah.</i> There are those who are strict and require a bill of divorce.
If the woman, herself, did not want to be betrothed to the sender and was betrothed to the agent himself, there is no deceit.
If one says to his agent, go and betroth unto me a woman and the agent dies and it is not known if he betrothed a woman to him or did not betroth, behold he is to be presumed betrothed and it is to be presumed that the agent carried out his job.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: his agentness.</i> Since he does not know which woman he is betrothed to, behold he is forbidden to all women that have relatives, which are in the class of illicit relationships, for example: a woman who has a daughter or mother or a sister or anyone like them. For if you say he may marry this one, perhaps her mother was betrothed to him by his agent or her sister or her daughter. But it is permissible<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">(to marry).</i> a woman who does not have relatives; (or) for example if she has a female relative as for example a mother or a sister, etc. anyone like them and this relative was a married woman when he appointed the agent, even though she was divorced before the death of the agent, behold he is permitted to her. And we do not say that perhaps the agent betrothed him to her relative after she was divorced because she was not fit<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">(to be betrothed).</i> when the agent was appointed, and a man does not appoint an agent to betroth for him a woman unless she is able to be betrothed at the time of the appointment of agency. <small>[Note: And thus if her relatives<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., relatives of a certain woman.</i> came and said we were not betrothed and proceed to get married he is permitted to this woman for behold certainly the relatives were not betrothed (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi, Chapter <i>Hamekabel</i>, R. Isaac Ben Sheshet, Chapter 82). There are those who say that similarly it is a law if one commands<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the agent.</i> to betroth a certain woman and the agent dies he is immediately forbidden to her female relatives, for the reason that it is a presumption that the agent completed his mission (Tosaphot, Chapter <i>Hamekabel</i>) and there are those who differ with this.]</small>
If one appoints an agent to betroth him to a specific woman and the agent departs and betrothes her for him, and the sender himself betrothes her mother or her daughter or her sister and it is not known which of them was betrothed first, both of them need a bill of divorce and are forbidden to him.
If the agent is appointed and his agency is cancelled before the betrothal, behold it<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the betrothal.</i> is null; however if it is not known whether his agency was cancelled before or after the betrothal, behold she is doubtfully betrothed.
(A priori the agent’s status)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">(This is an addition to the text).</i> cannot be cancelled except in the presence of the agent himself, however if it is cancelled but not before him, it is still a valid cancellation.
If the agent is not confirmed by witnesses and he says, “I betrothed you for myself” and she says, “to the first.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the sender.</i> And if the second said to the woman you are betrothed to me and she says, “I am not betrothed to you,” then he is forbidden to all her relatives, but she is permitted to his relatives. If she says, “I was betrothed to the first” and he says, “I did not betroth you,” or if she says, “I don’t know,” she is presumed to be betrothed to the second. If, however, the agent is confirmed by witnesses and he<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the agent.</i> says, “I betrothed her to myself,” and she says, “to the first,” it is presumed that she is betrothed to the first (even so, the second is forbidden to her relatives) (<i>Magid</i> <i>Mishnah</i> in the name of R. Aharan). If she says, “I don’t know,” then both of them give bills of divorce and if they consent one may give a bill of divorce and the other marries. [Note: There are those who differ and say that even if the agency is confirmed,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">by witnesses.</i> if the agent says that he withdrew from his agency, she is not betrothed to the first and similarly if the agency is not confirmed and the sender says that he appointed the agent, he is forbidden to her female relatives. (Tur in the name of R. Asher Ben Yechiel). However if afterwards the agent says, “I thought that I betrothed her for myself, but later I remembered that I betrothed her to my sender,” we are to rely on the first opinion (of this paragraph) (<i>Hagahot</i> <i>Mordechai</i> in the name of the <i>Tshuvouth</i> of R. Meir). An agent that said, “I betrothed you to the sender,” and she says, “you did not betroth me to the sender,” then the sender is forbidden to her relatives on the words of the agent.

<b>All the Laws of Agency Pertaining to the Woman</b> • 12 Paragraphs<br>The woman is permitted to appoint an agent to accept her betrothal but it is preferred that she be betrothed in person if possible. However there is no prohibition like there is for men. The man says to the agent, “behold the specific woman that sent you is betrothed to me,” and the agent says, “I betroth her to you.” And if he says, “yes,” that is enough. Even if he was silent, if they had been engaged in this matter<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., marriage.</i> and he gave to the agent<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">money or an object.</i> and did not expound or did not say a thing, that is enough. If she is betrothed with a document, he may only write it with the knowledge of the agent. There are those who say he may only write it with her knowledge.
In all matters of betrothal the law regulating the relationship of the man to her agent is the same as with the woman herself.
If she says to the agent, “accept the betrothal in a specific place,” and he accepts it in another place, or in any matter that is changed from her charge to the agent, she is not betrothed.
If she says to him<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the agent.</i> behold he is in a specific place and he accepts in a different place, she is betrothed, for she only meant to tell the agent where he was.
There are those who say that the agent of betrothal is not able to appoint another agent since words cannot be given to another agent (see above number 35 paragraph 6 where it is explained).
One that is betrothed by means of an agent does not betroth her again at the time of the wedding ceremony, so that no discredit is cast upon the first betrothal, as some may say that the betrothal by the agent had no validity whatever (above. the end Chapter 34). If she cancels the agent’s power before he accepts the betrothal behold it is null and she is not betrothed. If it is not known whether she cancelled the agent’s power before or after she accepted the betrothal behold this is a doubtful betrothal.
If betrothal is accepted by her agent from one and she by herself accepts betrothal from another and it is not known if the betrothal which her agent accepted was before hers or if hers was first; she is forbidden to both of them and she needs a bill of divorce from them both. If they agree one may give a bill of divorce and one may marry (and betroth her with another betrothal) (Rabbenu Yerucham, Chapter 22). To what does this refer: non-relatives. However if the agent betrothed her to the father and she betrothed herself to the son or brother, both of them must give a bill of divorce and she is forbidden to both of them.
A woman may be appointed an agent for another woman to accept betrothal, even though she may become her rival,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., co-wife, a man could have two wives.</i> in the event that he betrothes both of them. There are those who say that even if she says to her “accept it for me,” and she does not respond “yes” but remains silent and accepts without specification then, for her<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the other woman.</i> also she accepts.
A woman, that is an agent, to accept betrothal for another woman, when a man extends the betrothal and says to her, “you too” or “and thus you” both of them are betrothed. However if he did not say “to you” rather “and you” behold the one that accepts the betrothal is doubtfully betrothed. Perhaps his only intention was to see what was in her heart as if he said to her, “and what do you say in the matter?” and she accepted the betrothal since he was still asking to see what was in her heart.
There is one authority who says that the father may not become an agent to betroth his adult daughter--and there are those who disagree with him.
If one accepts betrothal for his adult daughter and was not appointed as an agent, there are those who say she needs a bill of divorce because of doubt.
A woman cannot appoint an agent to accept betrothal from the agent of her husband (but if she does, it produces a doubtful betrothal) (<i>Bet</i> <i>Yosef</i>) (See below Chapter 141, paragraph 1, section on bill of divorce).

<b>All the Laws Concerning Betrothal of a Minor</b> • 27 Paragraphs<br>The father may betroth his daughter without her consent, all the time she is a minor. Likewise when she is a <i>na’arah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>op</i>. <i>cit</i>., note 36.</i> the father has control over her and the betrothal money belongs to him. Likewise he is entitled to her finds, to the production of her hands, and to her wedding contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketubah</i> in Hebrew. A document recording the financial obligations which the husband undertakes toward his wife in respect of, and consequent to, their obligations, which are imposed upon him by law. The main component is the amount determined by law as the minimum that the wife is entitled to receive from her husband or his estate on dissolution of the marriage. The liability of payment is pentateuchal. Exodus 22:15-16 but the halakhah is that the <i>Ketubah</i> is rabbinical law.</i> If she be widowed or divorced from the betrothal, he is entitled to everything until she comes of age. Therefore the father accepts the betrothal money, etc. of his daughter from the day she is born until she comes of age. Even if she was a deaf-mute or insane and the father betrothed her, behold she is a fully married woman. If she were three years old and one day she may be betrothed by means of <i>Bi’ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If a man in the presence of two competent witnesses, says to a woman. “Behold you are consecrated to me with this act of sexual intercourse according to the law of Moses and of Israel,” and in their presence the groom takes the bride into a private place for the purpose of <i>Kidushin</i>, she will upon completion of the act be betrothed.</i> with the consent of her father. If she is younger than this, if her father hands her over for intercourse, she is not betrothed. <small>[Note: There are those who say that there is no binding betrothal with a non-viable infant,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew <i>Nephel</i>. The term refers to an infant which has not survived a minimum of thirty days after birth. This concept developed so that all children could be considered to have had a full nine month gestation period.</i> if his father accepted for her a betrothal and the one who betrothes her later betrothes her sister, she needs a bill of divorce.]</small> (<i>Or Zarua</i>)
When the daughter comes of age her father has no control over her, and behold she is like all other women that are not betrothed except by their own will. (If women are able to testify that she is of age, see below Chapter 164 paragraph 11 and Chapter 155 paragraph 15.)
If she was married by her father and if she were to be widowed or divorced during her father’s lifetime, behold she has control over herself, even though she is still a minor since she was married, her father no longer has control. However if she were betrothed and were to be widowed or divorced a few times before she came of age, control returns to her father.
If she were to be betrothed, before she came of age without permission of her father, it is not a valid betrothal.
If her father were to betroth her in the morning and she betrothed herself in the evening and both of them did it on the day that completed the six months of the days of her <i>na’aruth</i> and they examine and find her to be of age then she is considered to be adult and the betrothal of her father is not valid. There are those who say that<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That this is so.</i> even if she does not contradict him and say that the signs of maturity were there in the morning. However, there are those who say that this applies only if she contradicts him, but if she does not contradict him she needs a bill of divorce from both of them.
If during the six months of <i>na’aruth</i> she is betrothed by her father without her knowledge and she betrothed herself without her father’s knowledge and she is found showing signs of maturity<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., puberty.</i> behold it<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the validity of the betrothal.</i> is doubtful and she needs a bill of divorce from both of them.
Just as the father is able to make a betrothal for her by himself, so too is he able to arrange a betrothal for her by means of his agent or by herself, that he would say to her go out and accept your betrothal. (Note: he is required to say this to her before witnesses because an agent who accepts the betrothal requires witnesses. (The <i>Pesakim</i> of R. Israel B. Petachian Isserlein, paragraph 50) as was explained above, Chapter 35 paragraph 3. And if it is visible to all that he is preparing her for the marriage ceremony and to accept betrothal it is as if he had spoken before witnesses (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet, #479) and there is no distinction between a <i>na’arah</i> and a minor (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi, first Chapter of <i>Kidushin</i>) and this is the correct view. However, some disagree and say that a minor is not able to accept betrothal, rather her father by himself must accept for her (R. Isaac Alfasi and Mordecai b. Hillel in the name of R. Meir).<br>In order to remove himself from the controversy<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">So that the validity of his acts should not be questioned.</i> the father should hold the hand of the minor at the exact moment she accepts the betrothal or stand next to her when she accepts so that it is as if he accepts by himself (Kol Bo and in <i>T’rumat Hadeshen</i>, #43). And it is more preferable than his accepting it alone, for beheld there are those who say it is forbidden to betroth a minor daughter as will soon be explained. And when one does (same place as above in <i>T’rumat</i> <i>Hadeshen</i>) betroth a minor he says to her “Behold you are betrothed to me” (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi in first Chapter in <i>Kidushin</i>) and if he said “your daughter is betrothed to me” this is betrothal for behold she stands in place of her father even though he gives her<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the daughter.</i> the betrothal (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet, paragraph 479).<br>If he betrothes her with a document, he writes in the document, “your daughter is betrothed to me” and at the moment that he gives it to her he says “behold you are betrothed to me” (<i>Ibid</i>. R. Nissim B. Reuben). And if he uses different words even so she is betrothed. And when they send the minor daughters to another place and the father is not with them, when they accept their betrothal since he<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">the father.</i> has prepared her to enter marriage and betrothal it is as if he is holding her hand at the moment she accepts <small>[<i>Pesakim</i> of R. Israel B. Petachiak Isserlain #33).]</small>
It is a <i>mitzvah</i> that one should not betroth his daughter while she is a minor, rather until she has grown and can say “I want so and so” <small>[Note: There are those who say that it is customary in this time to betroth our minor daughters since we are in exile and there is not always sufficient money for the dowry and also we are few in number and we are not always able to find a worthy match (Tosaphot) and thus is the practice]</small>.
The father that gave permission to his agent to betroth his daughter and then goes out and betrothes her to another, if the agent betrothed her to a different one, which ever of them came first, this is betrothal. But if it is not known which one was first she is forbidden to both of them and she needs a bill of divorce from both of them.
If you appoint another agent and do not cancel the agency of the first explicitly, and each of them goes out and betrothes, she needs a bill of divorce from both of them.
A minor or a <i>na’arah</i> that betrothes herself without the knowledge of her father or marries herself, this has no validity at all and even a <i>mi’un</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">When a minor daughter who has no father is married by her mother or brother it is not fully valid. She may renounce the marriage upon reaching majority. The process of renunciation is called <i>mi’un</i>.</i> is not needed. This is the case even if the father originally made the match and even if the father explicitly consented after the betrothal. There are those who say that if the father consented when he heard, there is a betrothal from the exact moment of hearing even if he did not make the match. Even if he did not consent immediately upon hearing but rather was quiet and did not object and afterward was satisfied, “the end of the matter proves the beginning” and there is betrothal from the moment of hearing even if the money was spent before hearing. <small>[Note: There are those who say that if the money is spent before<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">(his hearing).</i> there is no betrothal, Mordecai Chapter <i>Haish</i> <i>Mekadesh</i> in the name of R.

However if she objected or her father objected before he consented there is no betrothal even if the father consents afterwards. [Note: There are those who say that if the father heard and was silent and did not object immediately it is as if he had consented, but if the father did not hear or if he went away on a trip and the daughter grew and she was quiet and did not object, then the betrothal grew with her and she needs a bill of divorce (R. Isaac Ben Sheshet Chapter 479). And there are those who say that he must have intercourse with her after she has grown<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Reached the age of maturity.</i> (R. Solomon Ben Adret Chapter 1 #1219). There are those who are strict according to the first opinion.
A minor who betrothes herself to one whom the father had expressed his desire to have her betroth, we assume that he is satisfied.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">(ex post facto).</i>
She<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">(If).</i> became betrothed with her father’s consent, yet was married without his consent, whether her father is present or whether he<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">(at this time).</i> was away, they are not married. (Thus) if she dies he<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the husband.</i> does not become her heir, he is not allowed to defile himself<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., mourn her death.</i> on her behalf. (And there are those who say that this same ruling applies if the father dies before she is wed and<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">(afterwards).</i> thus she is wed. This is the meaning in Mordechai, Chapter 2 of <i>Kidushin</i>, citing some rabbis).
A minor whose father went to a distant land, and<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">(then).</i> whose brothers and mother marry her off--this is valid betrothal, and requires <i>mi’un</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If she desires to terminate the union.</i> And so when her father returns<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">(and approves the betrothal).</i> no other betrothal is required. Yet there are those who claim that it is not considered a valid betrothal and she does not need even <i>mi’un</i>. In any case, we do not have to prohibit her to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">(in the future).</i> on the grounds that she could be considered as one who is a single woman living like a harlot with him, since she was with him in a situation akin to betrothal and marriage. <small>[Note: Even if the father comes and objects, we should not prohibit her to him, and his intercourse with her is not considered fornication. Yet he<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> can keep her with him until she comes of age, and then her betrothal will be completed. However, in the case when the father betrothes her to another before she comes of age, she requires a bill of divorce from both men (Yizhak ben Sheshet, Chapter 193). And there it is written that she requires a bill of divorce from the second<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., fiancee.</i> but Isserless ruled that she requires<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">(a bill of divorce).</i> from them both. It is proper to rule strictly in accord with the first opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., that it is a valid betrothal.</i> There are those who rule even more strictly to say that in every case where her father is in a distant land, even if a minor betrothes herself we are concerned that if he were to find out, he would be satisfied, it being then a doubtful betrothal (Mordechai, Chapter <i>Haish</i> <i>Mekadesh</i>). There was a case of a man who divorced his wife and arranged with her that she should take care of his daughters--to feed them, to raise them, and to marry them off, and that is what she did. But along came the father and objected to the marriage of his minor daughters, and they ruled that if he ordered to have them raised and married off, whatever she did is post facto valid and that he has no right to object, as long as he expressed his will in the presence of witnesses, since an agent who accepts betrothal on someone’s behalf requires witnesses, as it is explained above in Chapter 35, Sec. 3. However, if he empowers her to marry them off when they come of age, and she married them off in their minority, her deeds are null and void and he can object because she deviated from what he requested of her. (Yizhak ben Sheshet, Chapter 493)]</small>.
If one betrothes an unspecified daughter, or<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">(another).</i> says to him: “one of your daughters is betrothed unto me,” the grown daughter is not included, even if she gave him<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> permission to accept her betrothal<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., on her behalf</i> and that the money would belong to him, but only if she designated him as an agent to accept betrothals, in an unspecified way and did not specify “from Ploni.” But if she did specify Ploni, she too is doubtfully betrothed, and the rest of the grown daughters are not included.
If he who has two daughters, even if they are both minors, and he arranges a match for one of them with an individual, and then after a while accepts from him a betrothal,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">(betrothal money).</i> and<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">(that individual).</i> said: “Your daughter, unspecified, is betrothed unto me,” even if both were busying themselves with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">talking about same girl.</i> they<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., both daughters.</i> are forbidden to him, and they require a bill of divorce from him. <small>[Note: And even if he corrected himself within a very short time<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in a very brief length of time, the time it takes to say “hello Rabbi.”</i> and specified “your daughter named so and so,” is of no help. (Mordechai, Beginning of <i>Kidushin</i>, citing R. Eliezer B. Joel Halevi). And in all cases like this, where there is betrothal which cannot lead to consummation of the marriage, we compel him to divorce. (R. Solomon ben Adret, p. 236).]</small> He who betrothes his daughter in an unspecified way--the grown one is not included.
He who has two sets of daughters from two wives, and all of them are within his jurisdiction to betroth, and he said to the betrother at the time of the betrothal:<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., ceremony.</i> “I have betrothed unto you my eldest daughter, yet I do not know<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">(I don’t remember).</i> if it is the older of the eldest set, or the elder of the younger set, or, whether it is the youngest of the eldest set, who is older than the oldest of the youngest set!”--they are all permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">(to be chosen).</i> except for the oldest of the eldest set.
Similarly, if he<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> says to him: “I betrothed unto you my young daughter, yet I do not know if it was the youngest of the younger set or the youngest of the eldest set, or the oldest of the younger set, who is younger than the youngest of the older set!” they are all permissible except for the youngest of the younger set.
If one has five sons and they appoint their father as an agent to betroth for them<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">(a woman).</i> and the father of the sons says to one who has five daughters “One of your daughters is betrothed to one of my sons,” and the father accepts the betrothal,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., betrothal money.</i> each one requires a bill of divorce from each brother. If one brother dies, all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the daughters.</i> require four bills of divorce and <i>Halizah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">When the <i>levin</i> does not marry the <i>yevamah</i> (see note 30) the ceremony of <i>Ḥalizah</i> takes place, whereby the woman becomes released from the levirate tie and free to marry someone else. The ceremony is described in and originates from Deut. 25:7-10. The <i>Ḥalizah</i> ceremony is designed to shame the <i>levin</i> for not building up his brother’s house. The ceremony is completely described in <i>Halchot Yevamot</i>. (See article in the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i> vol. 13.)</i> from one of them.
The father who said, “I betrothed my daughter and I do not know to whom,” she is forbidden to all until he<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> says: “It has become known to me to whom I betrothed my daughter!” even if he does not find out until she has come of age. <small>[There are those who say that if the groom stood before him at first, and the father did not recognize him but afterward said that he<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> did recognize him he is not believed. (<i>Bet</i> <i>Yosef</i> in the name of the Tosephot.)]</small>
If one came and said (before the father) (Rabenu Nissim and Rabenu Yeruham) “I betrothed her,” he is believed and she is permitted to him, since the father says “I don’t know” and when he marries her he need not betroth her.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">(again).</i> However if the father contradicts him there are those who say that he<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the suitor.</i> is not believed, even to require in her behalf a bill of divorce.
If two men come and each one of them says “I betrothed her” both of them give a bill of divorce. However if they want, one may give a bill of divorce and one may marry (and he needs a betrothal when he marries her inasmuch as she is divorced from another) (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi and R. Solomon Ben Adret).
If one came and married her and afterwards another came and said “I betrothed her” he is not believed so as to forbid her to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the first man.</i> And there are those who say that even if he did not actually marry her but rather they only gave her license to marry, it is the same as marrying her.
A woman<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">(In the case where a …).</i> says “I betrothed myself and I do not know to whom” and a man came and said “I betrothed you” he is believed.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">(sufficiently to).</i> Give her a bill of divorce, to make her available to all, but not<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">(enough).</i> to marry her,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">(â priori).</i> but if he married her, we do not take her from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">(ex post facto).</i> <small>[If there is one witness that he betrothed her, he is â priori permitted to marry (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi, Chapter <i>Haomer</i>)]</small>.
The father that said, concerning his daughter while she was yet a minor or a <i>na’rah</i>, “I betrothed her and I divorced her,” he is believed, to make her unfit to<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">(to marry into).</i> the priesthood,<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">A priest may not marry a divorced woman.</i> only if he said “I divorced her” at the same time he mentioned “I betrothed her,” but where she is presumed to be a man’s wife according to his own mouth, he is not believed if he says after a while “I divorced her.”
If after she came of age he said “I betrothed her and I divorced her while she was a minor,” he is not believed.
A father that said that he betrothed his daughter, and afterward betrothed her to another, and he said the first betrothal was done in the presence of witnesses disqualified by the Torah, and had no validity whatever, then he is believed. (It appears to me that only if he said this within a very brief time<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>op</i>. <i>cit</i>., note 81.</i> is he believed, as was explained close by in paragraph 25.)

Siman 38

<b>One who Betroths Conditionally and All the Laws Concerning Conditions</b> • 39 Paragraphs<br>One who betroths conditionally--if the conditions are fulfilled she is betrothed, and if not she is not betrothed, whether the condition shall be from the man or from the woman.
Every condition has to meet four requirements and they are:<br>a) that it have a double formulation<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Both the positive and negative side of the stipulation must be stated.</i><br>b) that the affirmative clause be before the negative clause<br>c) that the conditional should be expressed before the actual action is expressed<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">“if” must precede the stipulation.</i><br>d) that the conditions be a thing possible to fulfill and if the condition is lacking one element, behold the condition is null and void, as if there had been no condition at all, rather she will become betrothed immediately as if he had not stipulated at all. (If he mentioned a negative before a positive, and then repeated the negative after the positive, there exists a condition, as if he had mentioned a positive before a negative.) (Rabbi Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi Chapter <i>Mi Sheaḥzo</i>)
Anyone who says “from now” or “<i>al menath</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">lit. “on condition.”</i> need not double his condition and<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">(he need not).</i> put the condition before the act. However, he must conditionalize something that is possible to fulfill. There are those who disagree and say that even if he said “from now” or <i>al</i> <i>menath</i> all four elements in the condition are still needed. <small>[Note: There are those who say that even if he does not express all the laws of conditions<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he does not apply specifically all four elements required for a condition.</i> but simply said that he makes a condition like the condition of the Gadites and the Reubenites,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">This term is used to describe the process whereby both alternatived to any condition are stated. The biblical passages Numbers 32:20-23, 29-30 provide the origins for the term.</i> behold this is a complete condition. (<i>Hagahot Maimon</i> Chapter 6)]</small>
And one says further that these four elements are not required in a condition. Except, in an instance where the consequences are stringent, but not where the consequences are lenient. [Note: And there are those who say further, that even though there are all four elements in the matter, we also require that the condition should refer to one matter and the act to another, but if all refers to one matter it is not a valid condition. (R. Asher Ben Yechiel and Tur) And we have to consider his words in a stringent sense,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">(for example).</i> if he makes a condition with her that she should eat pork or anything else prohibited by the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.</i> this is called “possible to fulfill” (Tur). But if he makes a condition with her that she should have sex with one prohibited to her, it is called impossible to fulfill, for afterwards he would not be reconciled to what happened with her (<i>ibid</i>). But if he makes a condition with her that Ploni should give him his property, or he should marry off his daughter to his son, this is called possible to fulfill since she could give Ploni much money until he becomes reconciled to the matter. (this is also <i>ibid</i>) (See below section 143, paragraph 12)
If he stipulated at the time of betrothal that she will not receive sustenance and clothing his condition stands; he does not owe them to her. However if he stipulated that he is not obligated to marital duties<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., sex.</i> his stipulations are void and he is obligated to do this to her. <small>[Note: Because anyone who makes a condition over and against what is written in the Torah and it does not involve money his condition is void (his opinion).]</small> And there are those who say that all that which our Rabbis ordained is similar to that written in the Torah. (<i>Hagahot Maimon</i>, beginning of <i>Hakotev</i>).
If he gave her a <i>Prutah</i> and said to her “Be betrothed to me with this on the condition that I will give you a <i>maneh</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Originally the shekel was a unit of weight for means of payment in gold and silver. In the third millenium BCE one finds this unit of weight in Babylonia. Sixty Babylonian shekels were a <i>maneh</i>. When this system of coinage was introduced into Israel the <i>maneh</i> generally consisted of only 50 shekels. The shekel as a unit of weight for gold is first mentioned in Jewish sources in Genesis 24:22 and Joshua 7:21. In Genesis 23:16 one finds mention of the shekel as a unit of weight for silver.</i> When the condition is fulfilled the betrothal will take effect retroactively even if he did not say “from now.” For anyone who says <i>al</i> <i>menath</i> it is as if he had said “from now.” Yet if she accepts betrothal from another before the conditions are fulfilled and afterwards the conditions were fulfilled, the betrothal of the second man is void. But if he said to her “on the condition that I will give to you a <i>maneh</i> within 30 days,” if he gave it to her within the thirty days behold it is a betrothal retroactively; if he did not give it within thirty days she is not betrothed, and if she accepts betrothal from another man during the thirty days she is betrothed but she is not betrothed<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., this is a pending situation.</i> until thirty days. When the thirty days are completed if the conditions of the first man are not fulfilled the betrothal of the first man is cancelled and the betrothal of the latter is complete and she does not require a bill of divorce from the former. If the former fulfills his condition she does not require a bill of divorce from the latter.
If he did not say to her <i>al</i> <i>menath</i> but rather he said “if I give you a <i>maneh</i> within thirty days you will be betrothed to me by this <i>Prutah</i>,” the betrothal takes effect only from the time that he gave it<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the shekels.</i> to her; therefore if another betrothed her before the condition is fulfilled she is betrothed to the second (see below the end of paragraph 9 nearby).
He who says to a woman “Behold you are betrothed to me on the condition that my father approves;” if the father approves she is betrothed, if he does not approve or is silent or died before he could hear the matter she is not betrothed.
“On the condition that my father will not protest,” if he hears and protests she is not betrothed. If he does not protest or dies behold she is betrothed (see close to here end of paragraph 10), if the son dies and afterward the father hears,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">of the proposed betrothal.</i> we instruct the father that he should say “I do not approve,” in order that there will be no betrothal and that she will not be subjected to the position of <i>Yibbum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the marriage between a widow whose husband died without offspring (the <i>yevamah</i>) and the brother of the deceased (the <i>yavam</i> or <i>levir</i>) which is prescribed in Deuteronomy 25:5-6.</i> There are those who say that one who says “on condition that he<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> approves” has the same ruling as one who says that he will not protest. There is one that says that the ruling is the same as one who says: “on condition that he be silent.”
If he said on condition that he<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the father.</i> will say yes, even though he said at the beginning “I don’t approve,” as long as he reconsidered and said, “yes,” the condition is fulfilled (therefore there is always doubt until the death of the father). And he who says on the condition that he is silent, if he is silent at the time of hearing she is betrothed even if he reconsidered and protested. <small>[Note: However, if he was not in his house when he heard and when he came to his house he protested, it is a valid objection, since the reason he was silent at first was because he was not in his house (this is the implied meaning in R. Isaac Ben Sheshet Chapters 14 and 153).]</small><br>If he protests at the time of hearing, even if he reconsiders and becomes reconciled to it she is not betrothed. If the father dies so that he never heard she is betrothed, and if he said on the condition that he<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., my father.</i> will not protest, as long as he protests the condition is cancelled, and even if he accepted at the time of hearing. <small>[There are those who say that if he says yes one time he is not again able to protest (Tur).]</small>
If the son dies we instruct the father that he should protest in order that she not be bound to the <i>Yibbum</i>.
If he said to her “be betrothed to me by a <i>Prutah</i> on condition that I will work with you like a laborer,” or “I will speak<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">(on your behalf)</i> to the government,” if there are witnesses that he worked with her like a laborer, or he spoke<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">(on her behalf).</i> to the government she is certainly betrothed, but if there are no witnesses she is betrothed out of doubt.
If he did not give her anything and said to her “Be betrothed unto me” in lieu of the payment that I will work with you as a laborer, or I will speak about you to the government,<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">(there is a value accrued by his speaking on her behalf).</i> she is not betrothed because a hiring extends from the beginning until the end of the work,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Payment is not due before the work is completed, in the meantime it assumes the character of a loan and one cannot use a loan to betroth.</i> and thus one has a case of betrothing through a loan.
On condition that I have a <i>maneh</i>, if it is known by testimony of witnesses that he has a <i>maneh</i> she is certainly betrothed; if it is not known<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">(by testimony of witnesses).</i> she is betrothed due to the doubt, even if he says<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">(later).</i> I do not have the money.
“On condition that I have a <i>maneh</i> on deposit with Ploni,” if it is known through witnesses that he has a <i>maneh</i> on deposit with Ploni she is betrothed certainly, but if it is not known, she is betrothed due to the doubt even if the same Ploni says “he has nothing on deposit with me.”
“On condition that Ploni will say that I have a <i>maneh</i> deposited with him” if he said he has it deposited with me she is betrothed. If he did not say “he has it on deposit with me” she is not betrothed.
On condition that I have a <i>maneh</i> in a specific place, if he has it in that same place behold she is betrothed. If he does not have it in that same place that he said behold she is doubtfully betrothed. Because perhaps he has it in that same place but he intends to harm her.
“On condition that I show you a <i>maneh</i>, she is not betrothed until he shows her the <i>maneh</i> of his. Even if he shows her a <i>maneh</i> that he has from dealing with others she is not betrothed. <small>[Note: There are those who say that even if his portion of the profit comes to a <i>maneh</i> she is not betrothed for they still have not divided the profit. (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi Chapter <i>Haomer</i>.) If he shows her a <i>maneh</i> of his own, and it is collateral to a creditor, she is betrothed. (Rabbi Yerucham in the name of R. Meir Ha Levi). If he did not have it at the time of betrothal, and earned it afterward and then showed it to her there are those who say she is betrothed (Tur). But if he said to her “on condition that I have it,” in this case everyone agrees that she is not betrothed. (<i>Sefar</i> <i>Ha</i> <i>Trumah</i>.) And we do not fear it lest he shows her it afterward, so that it would be a doubtful betrothal (Tur). If he said to her on condition that he will bring her two hundred Zuz, the ruling is the same as “on condition that I show you a <i>maneh</i>,” and it must be of his own (R. Solomon Ben Adret <i>ṁitshuvah</i>, cited in <i>Bet</i> <i>Yosef</i>).]</small>
On condition that I have a <i>bet</i> <i>khor</i> <i>of</i> <i>land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">A piece of land large enough to plant a <i>khor</i> of grain.</i> if there are witnesses that he has, behold she is betrothed, and if not, then she is betrothed out of doubt, lest he has it and says “I do not” in order to harm her.
“Behold you are betrothed to me with this,” on condition that I have a <i>bet khor of land</i> in a specific place.” If he has in that same place she is betrothed with certainty; if not she is betrothed out of doubt, lest he have it there and he intends to harm her.
“On condition that I show you a <i>bet khor of land</i>” she is betrothed but he must show it to her. And if he showed<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">(the land).</i> rented from others or he took it as a share cropper she is not betrothed. <small>[Note: But if he has land from which he pays taxes behold she is betrothed--For behold it is still his land, but provided that he has a <i>bet khor of land</i> which he does not pay taxes because “on condition that he have a <i>bet khor of land</i>,” means that it should be entirely his. (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi Chapter <i>Haomer</i>.)]</small>
If he has a <i>bet khor of land</i> and there are ravines ten fists deep or boulders ten fists high; or gullies full of water, they are like boulders.

And a cistern filled with water, even though it is not sowable it is measured with it.
A <i>bet khor of land</i> that he mentioned, must be in one place (boulders and ditches do not separate the land even though they are not measured with it) (R. Nissim B. Reuben Gerondi Chapter <i>Haomer</i> in the name of R. Solomon Ben Adret). However if it<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the land.</i> is in two or three completely different places they do not combine.

Asher Ben Yechiel and Rabbi Yerucham) and even if the money<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., dowry.</i> has been spent, it is a valid betrothal retroactively when the second condition is fulfilled.
In betrothal, where the condition is to his advantage, for example: on condition that she has no blemishes or that she is not under vows, he can cancel it.

Siman 39

One who betroths a woman on the condition that there are no vows upon her, and it is found [that she has] on her one of these three vows which it is the nature of men to be particular about: that she will not eat meat, or that she will not drink wine, or that she will not adorn herself with kind of colors, she is not betrothed. And she does not need a get (Tur). And that is the ruling for vows between him and her, which are included in the category of vows that it is the nature of men to be particular about. If it is found [that she has] on her a vow other than these, even though he says: I am particular even about this, behold she is betrothed. And if he said to her: On the condition that there is no vow at all upon you, even if it was found that she vowed not to eat carobs, she is not betrothed. And there is an opinion that they fear lest she goes to a wise man and he permits her and therefor she is forbidden to be married without a get.
If she had active vows (lit. vows on her) and she went to a <i> Chacham </i> and annulled them, she is engaged [assuming the man previously made a condition that she couldn't have any vows] and even if she is an important women. What are we talking about? When the <i> Chacham </i> annulled them before they informed the husband [of the vows]. But if they informed the husband before he annulled them, immediately the <i> Kiddushin </i> is reneged. And there is one [opinion] that says: if she is an important women, if the <i> Chacham </i> annulled them before they informed the husband, she is doubtfully engaged. And if he engaged her on condition that she does not have any [active] vows, and had relations with her without intention [for marriage], see above <i> Siman </i> 38 <i> Se'if </i> 35.
One who engages a woman on condition that she doesn't have any blemishes, and [later] they find on her one of the blemishes that disqualify women [from conditions like this], she is not engaged. If a blemish other than one of these blemishes is found on her, even if he says, "I even care about this [blemish]!", she is [still] engaged.
And what are blemishes in women which invalidate? Any blemish that would invalidate a kohen [to do service in the Temple] invalidates for women, and there are more for women: If she is malodorous, if she is sweaty, if her mouth smells (Rama: And even if her nose smells. Mordechai in the name of R"M), and a thick voice, or one breast is bigger than the other by a handsbreadth, or a her breasts are a handsbreadth apart from each other, or a dog bite that left a scar (Explanation: The wound healed and the skin crusted over and all that remained was the impression of the wound), or a mole on the forehead, even if it is very tiny, and even if it does not have hair [growing] from it. This mole is how women have more [blemish possibilities] than the kohen. And [this case only means] if it exists under the covering of her head, which sometimes can be seen and sometimes cannot be seen. But if it can always be seen, behold he saw it and was fine, and if it can never be seen, it is not a blemish. Rama: But if there's a bath house in the city, even blemishes that are hidden are not nullified [i.e. they matter]. This case applies when it is normal for girls to go to the bath house openly, but places where girls only go to bath houses at night and secretly [i.e. they do not regularly leave their house], even open blemishes are nullified [i.e. do not matter for marriage]. Epilepsy, if it happens at set times, that is considered a hidden blemish. If it happens randomly, that is considered an open blemish. And see later Siman 118 more about the laws of blemishes. Some say that epilepsy and bad breath do not have a distinction whether there is a bath house in the city or not (Rabbi Yerucham Netiv 23).
He who betroths a plain woman, and we find on her one of the blemishes that disqualifies a woman, or he finds on her one from the promises that is the way of people to be punctilious on themselves, behold this is betrothal from doubt. 
If he marries her on condition that she has no blemishes, and [it turns out] she does have blemishes but she goes to a doctor and he heals her, the marriage is not effected. But if the woman makes a condition "On condition that he does not have blemishes" and he does have blemishes but he went to a doctor and he heals him, that marriage is effected, for it is not a mark on a man that he had a blemish that was already healed, and women do not care about that.
If he marries her on the condition that she does not have any blemishes, and they find blemishes on her and a doctor heals them, that is a marriage retroactively.

Siman 40

If one said to a woman: You are sanctified to me with this penny after thirty days, then even if the money was used up before the end of the thirty days she is indeed sanctified after thirty days; and if he went back on his statement within the thirty days, or she went back on hers, she is not sanctified.  Note: and there are those who say that if he sanctified her with a document and does not have it after the thirty days, but it was torn or lost within the thirty, then she is not sanctified (the R'aN, chapter "The one who says.").  One who sanctifies a woman over thirty days, she is always sanctifed.  (ibid)
If a second man came and sanctified her within the thirty days, then she is always sanctified to the second one, since at the time that the second one sanctified her she was not sanctified, so that the sanctification of the second one affected her and she became a married woman, and when the thirty days passed so that the sanctification of the first man arrived, it found her a married woman already, and the first one was in the position of one who sanctifies an already-married woman, and his sanctification does not affect her.  But if the second one should die or divorce her within the thirty days, the first one's sanctification comes back into effect (Tur according to 'some say'), and therefore she needs a divorce document from the first one [before accepting the sanctification of the second]; but some disagree (Tur according to the Rosh).
One who says to a woman, "You are hereby betrothed to me with this coin, from now and for after thirty days," and someone else came and betrothed her within thirty days, she is doubtfully betrothed to both of them. Therefore, they both give her a bill of divorce, whether within the thirty days or after the thirty days.
He said to her: behold, you are betrothed to me from now and for third days after, and another came and said: behold, you are betrothed to me from now and for twenty days after, and another came and said: behold, you are betrothed to me from now and for ten days after, even if a hundred [men came] in this order, the kiddushin of all of them are incumbent on her and she needs a get from each one of them, because she is doubtfully betrothed to all of them.
The one who says to his wife: behold you are betrothed to me by this prutah after I will convert [to Judaism], after you will convert [to Judaism], after I am freed, after you are freed, after your husband dies, after your sister dies, she is not [considered] betrothed, because he is not able to betroth her now.
The one who says to a childless widow [awaiting levirate marriage]: behold you are betrothed to me by this prutah after [the other man] releases you of your levirate [status], behold she is doubtfully betrothed.
The one who gives two prutahs to a woman, and he said to her: behold you are betrothed to me with one [prutah], and with one [prutah] after when I will divorce you, behold she is betroths, and when he divorces her, she will be betrothed. But if he gave a prutah to a married woman and he said to her: behold, you are betrothed after you divorce [him], or if he gave a prutah to his wife and he said to her: behold, you are betrothed to me after I divorce you, it is not anything.
The one who says to his friend: if your wife gives birth, [if it is] a girl she will be betrothed to me, it is not anything; and for the Rambam and a few of the commentators, if she was the pregnant wife of his friend and he recognized the fetus, the daughter is betrothed, and he needs to go back and betroth her from her father after she is born, because when oneenters into kiddushin they do not have a defect.

Siman 41

A man can betroth a number of women at once, as long as there is the value of a *perutah* for each one. And one of them can accept the betrothal on behalf of all of them, with their approval.
One who betroths two women at once, both of whom he is forbidden to betroth because of ervah (forbidden relationships), they are not betrothed. How so? As in the case of one who betrothed a woman and her daughter, or two sisters at once, who said: Behold you are both betrothed to me, they are not betrothed and neither one of them needs a get. But if he only betrothed one, and did not specify which, as [is the case if] he said to the father: One of your daughters is betrothed to me, and the father accepted the betrothal, or if two or three sisters made one of themselves an emissary for her counterpart to accept her betrothal, and he gave it into her hand and said to her: One of you is betrothed to me, they all require a get from him, and it is forbidden for him to have relations with any of them, lest she is the sister of his wife.
If he betrothed many women at once, and there were among them two sisters (or) a woman and her daughter, if he said: Whoever among you is appropriate for relations [with me] is betrothed to me, they are all betrothed to him except for the two sisters or the woman and her daughter or the like. And if he said: You are all betrothed to me, those of no relation [to each other] are betrothed and sisters are not betrothed; and there are those who say that even those of no relation [to each other] are not betrothed, therefore those of no relation [to each other] are betrothed from doubt. And if he said: One of you is betrothed to me, all of them, whether of no relation or sisters, and betrothed from doubt.
If there was among the women he betrothed a maidservant or a Cutite, or one who is a forbidden relation to him such as the wife of [another] man or his daughter or his sister or the like, and he said: Whichever of you is appropriate for relations [with me] is betrothed to me, the rest of the women and betrothed. And if he said: You are all betrothed to me, the rest of the women are betrothed from doubt.

Siman 42

A woman can only become engaged by her will.  One who engages a woman against her will, she is not engaged.  But a man who they forced until her engaged against his will she is engaged, but there are those who say she is not engaged and therefore it is in doubt.  [Rema: If she originally said engage me and he threw engagement money into her arms and said to her: Behold you are betrothed to me, and she shook out her clothing while he was saying so to throw the money from her and said that she did not intend to get engaged and was only joking, even so she is engaged (Moharam, end of Sefer Nashim).  They do not go after in the topic of engagement proofs that she did not intend to become engaged.  If he took a woman's hand by force against her will and gave her engagement money and she does not throw the money away she is engaged, even though at the beginning it was by force and he gave it to her without saying anything, since at the beginning they were talking about engagement.  If he owed her money and she told him, Give me my money: and when he gave them to her he said: Behold you are betrothed to me" and she threw the money away she is not engaged.  
One who marries without witnesses, even with one witness, is not married. And even if the two of them agree in the matter. And even if he married her in front of one witness and then married her in front of another witness, this one not in front of this one, she's not married. Rama: And some are stringent if he marries in front of one witness (Tur in the name of the Sma"g) if the two of them agree; but if one contradicts the witness, don't worry (so did the Rashba"tz explain according to the Sma"g). And in a situation of anchoring [she'll be an "agunah"] and pressure, [you can] rely on the lenient opinion. And there is no difference whether the witness says she was married in front of him alone, or if he says she was married in front of two and he alone saw, and the others say they didn't see (Beit Yosef, and similarly it's implied in the Responsa of the Rashb"a). And similarly if he marries in front of two, and one of them is a relative, it's as if he marries in front of one witness. And see later on Siman 47:3.
It  is necessary for the betrothing man and the betrothed woman to see the witnesses, but if those two [witnesses] saw them through a window, and they could see, but were not visible to him or to her, she does not require a *get* [bill of divorce] from him.
Rem"a: And even if they witnesses heard her saying that she was accepting the betrothal, she can say, "I know that there is no betrothal without witnesses, and I intended to play with him" (Riva"sh - Siman 266). And [this is true] only if she said that she only intended to play, but if she denies that she accepted at all, and the witnesses testify that she accepted, she can no longer say, "I intended to play," and it is a betrothal (Mahara"m Padawa - Siman 32).
Marriage in front of witnesses, even if he didn't say, "You are witness", the marriage is effected. Rama: Even if witnesses were specified, others can see the act and testify (Rivash Siman 479). The witnesses need to see the actual giving to her hand or her property. But if they didn't see the actual giving to her hand, even though they heard him say, "Marry me with this certain object," and after ward she walks out with it under her hand, it is not a marriage until they see the actual giving (Responsa Rashba Siman 680). One cannot go after guesses and logical proofs in this regard. One who marries through a hole in the wall, such as she stretching her hand through a hole and someone comes along and puts into it [an object for] marriage, and the hole is narrow, and it is impossible to see the moment of marriage, and she says she didn't hear that she was being married, she is believed since she could have said [a better claim] that it wasn't her hand but it was someone else's (Rashba 1179), as long as there aren't witnesses which prove her wrong. Any testimony that cannot be examined in a court of law is not considered testimony for marriage [either] (Inferred from the Mordecha at the beginning of laws of money). Therefore, even if witnesses say outside of a court of law that she is married, the court of law can respond to them saying "She is NOT married." And so too the opposite case (Responsa Rashba brought by the Bet Yosef). Marriage witnesses do not need to be scrutinized and inspected if there is no reason to suspect trickery (Rashba 1209). If they find it wrotten in the document, "A certain man married a certain woman" and witnesses signed it, when the document no longer available, the marriage is not suspected (Hagahot Mordechai to Kiddushin). And it is not like those who are stringent about the matter (Makarik Shoresh 74).
Someone who marries using witnesses who are invalid on a Torah level, there is no marriage. But witnesses who are invalid on a rabbinical level, or the witnesses are invalid according to the Torah on a doubtful level, if he wants to enter [into marriage] he should go back and marry with kosher witnesses. If she does not want to enter, he needs to give a divorce document for the doubt. Even if the woman denies and says, "I was not wedded," we force him to give a divorce document. So is the law with all marriages of dount, if she wants to enter he goes back and marries definitively, and if she does not want to enter she needs a divorce document from him because of doubt. And if another comes and marries her, she is now married to the second on a doubtful level, and she needs a divorce document from both of them, or the first one must divorce and she can marry the second. But to divorce the second and marry the first, no. Rama: Someone who is suspected of sexual impropriety (arayot), even if there is no witnesses of the sexual act, but it is just a suspicion (Tosafot and the Rosh), he is invalid for testimony for woman's issues, whether for marriage or divorce (Rambam). Someone who marries using witnesses who are invalid on a Torah level because of their wickedness, such as in front of rapists or other wicked people, some say the marriage is suspected to have taken effectm for perhaps they repented (R"Y Mintz Siman 11, and so in Orchot Chaim in the name of Rashi). And some are lenient (Bet Yosef, and Maharam Padawa Siman 37). However, those who are forced to convert through fear [of reprisal], and they cannot get out of it, but in hiding keep the commandments, they are kosher witnesses (Rivash Siman 11). Some say that that which we say that one who marries using those who are invalid witnesses on a rabbinical level are suspected to have effected the marriage, this is for a Torah-level marriage, but a rabbinical marriage, and the witnesses are invalid on a rabbincal level, the marriage is not suspected as haven taken effect at all (Bet Yosef in the name of the Harashbetz in a Responsa).

Siman 43

If a minor who betrothed or married, his actions are null, for the Rabbis did not decree marriage for a minor. And it is forbidden to marry him a woman while he is yet a minor. 

Rama: Nevertheless, if he already married her, he does not need to divorce her, and she is permitted to remain as is until he reaches the age of majority (Mordechai, beginning of chapter haBa Al Yevimto, and it is implied likewise in Asheri chapter haIsh Mekadesh).

Mechaber: Even if he sent her marital gifts (sivlonot) after he attained majority, it is still null and void, for we are not concerned that he sent the gifts as an act of kiddushin (betrothal). However, if there are witnesses that he secluded with her after attaining majority, she needs a get (divorce), for we presume that he had intercourse for the sake of actualizing kiddushin.  If he maintained her [as his wife] after attaining majority (and after seclusion, as per Chelkat Mechokek), her ketuba contract is valid and he does not need to write her a new ketuba. This applies only to the basic 100 or 200 [zuz] (for widow or virgin respectively) but she does not have rights to the additional monies written into the ketuba.

Rama:If he did not write her a ketuba when he was a minor, when he attains majority he writes only 100 zuz into the ketuba, for at that time she is not a virgin (Hagahot Alfasi, beginning of chapter Mi sheHaya Nasui).
One who engages an orphaned minor, or a minor released from her father's domain, when she can perform <i> miyun </i> and all her laws will be explained in <i> Siman </i> 154. Rem"a: And see later on <i> Siman </i> 169 who is believed regarding a male and female minor if they [later] grew up. If it was doubtful if they were minors or not, it is a doubtful <i> Kiddushin </i>. <i> Beit Din </i> is able to stop from marrying the minor, just like her mother and her brothers have this right, and they are able to put conditions [on the marriage] that if she does <i> miyun </i>, she will lose all that is hers. But they don't have the right to marry off the minor (<i> Nimukei Yosef Perek Cherech </i>). And see later beginning of <i> Siman </i> 155.

Siman 44

A deaf male or female is not legally capable of marriage by Biblical law, whether they married another deaf person, or a deaf man who married a cognitively normal (lit. clever) woman, or a deaf woman who married a cognitively normal man.  But our sages decreed for them marriage.  Therefore, if a normal person betrothes the normal wife of a deaf man, she is fully betrothed to the second (i.e. normal) man, and he gives a get, and she is permitted to her deaf husband.
Mentally incompetent men and women cannot become betrothed, neither at a Torah level nor a rabbinical level, whether with another person like them or a competent person.  Rem"a: This only applies to a genuinely incompetent person, but if his thoughts are rational, even if he is extremely unintelligent, or is he has periods of incompetence and periods of rationality, and we cannot determine the periods during which he can think, we must be concerned for his betrothal.
A drunk person who betrothed, his betrothal is valid even if he was very drunk. But if he reached the drunkenness of Lot (who had no recall of incest with his daughters), his betrothal is invalid. They need to carefully investigate this matter (i.e. to assess the degree of drunkenness very carefully). 
If a castrated man betrothed a woman, whether his castration was the result of natural causes or human intervention, or a woman who will never reach puberty accepted betrothal, the betrothal is valid.  Some authorities say that if it is known with certainty that the woman will never reach puberty, she is not betrothed.
A person of ambiguous gender or an androgynous person who betrothed a woman, or received betrothal from a man, are considered to be doubtfully betrothed and require a writ of divorce to remove the doubt.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that an androgynous is definitively male.
One who attempts kiddushin (marriage) with any one of the women who are prohibited to him, did not do anything, because kiddushin does not take effect with them.  The exception is the Niddah (woman who is menstruating), for one who effects kiddushin with a Niddah causes her to become fully married to him.  However, it is not appropriate to do this.
If a man betrothed a woman who was forbidden to him on a rabbinic level, or from a non-capital negative prohibition or a prohibition that stems from a positive commandment, she is genuinely betrothed to him, except for a woman who must perform levirate marriage who betrothed a stranger, for she is only doubtfully betrothed.
One who betrothed a non-Jewess or maid-servant has done nothing, for they are not eligible for betrothal.  Similarly, a non-Jew or slave that betrothed a Jewess has done nothing.
If a Jewish apostate betrothed [a Jewish woman] his betrothal is completely valid, and she requires a writ of divorce.  Even if he had children after he left Judaism, if one of those children were to betroth a Jewess, the betrothal is valid.  This is only true if he had children with a Jewess, even if she is an apostate.  If, however, he had children with a non-Jewess, the children are considered non-Jews, even if the father is a Jew who is not an apostate.  Rem"a: If a Jewess apostate had a child with a non-Jew, that child's betrothal is valid.
If a Samaritan betrothed [a Jewish woman], she requires a writ of divorce form him.
If a man who is a half-slave and half-freeman who betrothed a Jewess, it is a case of doubtful betrothal.
If a [Jew] who betrothed a woman who is half-maidservant and half-freed, she requires a writ of divorce.  If before he gave her the writ of divorce she was freed, and then another man betrothed her, she is betrothed to both of them, and she requires a writ of divorce from both of them, or the first one may divorce her and she may marry the second.  If they die, the brothers of one of them should perform halitza, and the brothers of the other should either perform halitza or levirate marriage.

Siman 45

In a place where the custom is [for the groom] to send gifts to an arusa (a woman who has received kiddushin, the first stage of marriage) after she has received kiddusin, and witnesses came forth who saw gifts given to her, we are concerned that she may have been married, and she therefore needs a get (divorce) because of this doubt.

Rama: Even though most people in the city only send gifts before kiddushin, and even though the gifts were not sent in front of witnesses (Tur, and Ran writes similarly in the last chapter of Kiddushin).

Mechaber: In a place where everyone sends gifts before kiddushin, and then the marriage takes place...

Rama: although occasionally some send even after kiddushin, since no one takes issue with this (ibid. in Ran)

Mechaber: ... [and the witnesses] saw gifts, we do not worry [about possible marriage]. Rashi explained that the doubt regarding gifts was that the gifts themselves may have constituted the kiddushin money.

Rama: And therefore even if there are witnesses that she has not been previously married, we would worry [according to Rashi] that the gifts were kiddushin money.  It is appropriate to be concerned for both interpretations, and to rule stringently (Tur).  This is the rule if the gifts were sent without explanation.  However if he said explicitly that the gifts were pre-wedding presents, we do not need to be concerned with Rashi's explanation (Ran, Kiddushin chapter 2). And certainly if  he said that he merely sent a gift (unrelated to marriage), and even if he said that the groom had sent a gift to the bride-to-be (Maharik, root 171).  And these concerns are only an issue when  he (the groom) had made shiduchin (engagement contract, prior to kiddushin), but if there was no shiduchin, we do not worry about these possibilities (of gifts indicating actual marriage) (Responsa Rashba, part 1, number 1,123).  In situations where we are concerned, even if both parties said that there was no intention of marriage (Ran and Maharik root 28), and swore to this effect, they are not believed (Terumat haDeshen, chapter 207).  Some authorities say that all gifts sent immediately after shidduchin, or one or two days afterward, there is no concern for these at all.  Even if he [the groom] sent additional gifts after this, since he also sent her gifts immediately after the shidduchin we see that his intention was to send gifts and perform kiddushin only afterward and we do not worry about the gifts (Maharik root 171). The concern regarding gifts is only to require a get (divorce) a priori, but if she already married (another man), she does not need to leave the second man and we take the lenient approach in this case of doubt (ibid).  Some authorities say that if he sent her gifts without witnesses, we do not worry about the opinion of Rashi that the gifts are the actual kiddushin money, and even according to the opinion that where marriage took place with one witness we are concerned about possible valid kiddushin, in the case of gifts there is no concern (Maharik roots 28, 101, and 171). Some authorities are stringent where he sent gifts with witnesses even if they did not witness the transfer of the gifts to the woman (Terumat haDeshen chapter 207). Some authorities limit the concern to cases where the bride accepted the gifts directly, but in places where it is customary that the brides do not accept the gifts directly except via an intermediary, there is no concern of gifts indicating marriage (Maharik root 171).  Some authorities do not differentiate whether the groom sent her gifts (through an intermediary) or gave them to her directly, and this is the primary interpretation (Responsa Rosh 180 and 189), as opposed to one who is stringent and rules that where the groom gave the gifts directly we always are concerned for possible marriage (Responsa Rav Maharash). Some say that in situations where we might be concerned that he would have transgressed by sending gifts had it been his intention to accomplish kiddushin with the gifts, as in a case where he sent the gifts on the Sabbath (Maharik root 171), or there is a decree enforced by cherem (social excommunication) forbidding marriage except in the presence of 10 men (Beit Yosef in the name of Ritva), then we are not concerned that the gifts may have constituted the actual wedding money.  If the groom did not send gifts himself, but the father of the groom sent gifts (Rivash chapter 479), then we do not worry about the opinion of Rashi that the gifts constituted the actual wedding money, even if the messenger stated, "The groom has sent you [these gifts]."  All of the preceding applies only where we know certainly that gifts were sent, but if there is only a rumor of gifts being sent, we do not worry about possible marriage (Piskei Maharai chapter 226).
Nowadays, they have the custom in all the kingdoms of Israel and in Egypt and Armenia not to suspect that the exchange of gifts [between bride and groom after engagement causes them to be married], other than Constantine that does. Rama: If it was customary in a city [to suspect that the gifts caused marriage], and [then] it ceased, we go after [what the custom is] now (Rvash Siman 5). If it was not customary in a city, such as  the case of a new city, we judge it 50/50 (Ran Chapter 2 of Kiddushin). Some say that there is what to be stringent even in a place where everyone sends gifts and then proposes later, unless there is a reason to permit it in a particular case (Terumat Hadeshen Siman 207, and in his rulings Siman 74). It seems to me that if the groom said he only sent the gifts as plain gifts, nobody should suspect of it [that it caused the marriage to take effect]. And it happens all the time, that sometimes the marriage arrangement doesn't go through, and the gifts are returned, and the custom is not to require a divorce document [on the suspicion the marriage took place through the gifts], and this occurs in places today where everyone exchanges gifts and then proposes later, and the groom never said he sent it for the sake of marriage.
We do suspect [that marriage has taken effect] with regards to a ketubah. Meaning, if he writes a ketubah for her, even though it had not reached her hand, if it is customary for some people of the city to marry and after that write a ketubah, we suspect perhaps he caused the marriage to take effect. [This applies] even though there is no regular scribe [which would be a reason why ketubot are written later], and we would not say perhaps the scribe was appointed for him and wrote it. And if it is customary for people of the city to write the ketubah before the marriage, we do not suspect the marriage [took effect when he wrote the ketubah in this instance].

Siman 46

The commandment of release from a levirate marriage is done with three Jewish judges, who must not be related to each other nor to the brother-in-law or widow. Rem"a: And even two men who are married to two sisters should not be together [in the group of three judges]. But for one of them to be the second of three [judges] is valid.  And [the judges] may even be common people, as long as they know how to read to the brother-in-law and the widow. And if she was released before unknowledgeable people who do not know how to read [to them], the release is valid. 
And similarly if two come and say, "We saw something like an engagement celebration," "We heard a rumor," "We heard from  a certain man who heard from a different man that a certain woman was married in front of two other men, and then those witnesses went to some other country (- or they died),", behold, that is a rumor that gives her the assumption of being married. Rama: Some say that the voice is only [considered credible] when it is two [witnesses] who hear from two [witnesses], but not if it is one [who hears it] from two (Tur in the name of the Rosh, and the Ran, and the Maggid Mishneh in the name of the Rashba). We do not suspect rumors unless it is upheld in a court of law, and the court investigates the matter, and they hear there is substance to the rumor, as has been explained, but so long as it is not upheld in court, it is not [credible], unless it is a place where there is a strong assumption she was married, then we do not need the upholding through the court (Maharik shoresh 87). And the court should go [even in that case] and examine the rumor, in order to clarify if there is substance (Bet Yosef in the name of the Tashbetz and the Rashba).
What are the circumstances? When there was no excuse.  But if there was an explanation and they heard the explanation at the same time as the rumor of betrothal, she is not presumed to be betrothed.  What is the nature of the excuse? Where witnesses said that the [rumored] betrothal was conditional; or doubtful, for instance they said that he tossed her kiddushin, possibly closer to him, possibly closer to her, or where there is room for doubt as to whether the kiddushin was worth a perutah, or he (the groom) was a minor; then she is not presumed to be betrothed, rather we ask her [what happened] and rely on her word, since there is no definitive proof and no strong rumor.
If a rumor spread about a woman that she had been betrothed to so-and-so, and after a few days they gave her explanation (lit. excuse), if the explanation seems reasonable, we rely on it and there is no presumption that she was betrothed. If no [explanation was forthcoming], since the explanation was not heard at the time that we heard of her [possible] betrothal, we do not worry about an explanation [coming later].Rama: If it later became clear that the rumor was false, for instance where the purported marriage witnesses in front of whom the marriage was said to have taken place, came forth and said, "It never occurred," the court nullifies the rumor (Tur in the name of Ramah). Some authorities say that nowadays we do not nullify rumors of possible marriage (Beit Yosef as supported by Rambam, and as likewise apparent in Rif, and Ran wrote similarly in chapter haMekadesh).  If he (the groom) sent gifts (sivlonot) in a manner that we would not usually view this as indicating prior marriage (as described above in Siman 45), even though a rumor had spread - based on the gifts - that she had been betrothed, we are not concerned about this rumor because it is common to use the terminology kiddushin (betrothal) when talking about sivlonot (gifts) (So implied in Responsa Rosh rule 35). In any situation where we do not need to do so, we should not rule stringently with respect to rumors, so as not to support the hand of evil people who spread rumors about the daughters of Israel to anchor them (prevent their marriage) or to extort money from them (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashba).
If a rumor spread that she was married to s0-and-so, and another man came forth and betrothed her in front of court, we examine the circumstances of the rumored betrothal. If definite eyewitnesses testified that she is betrothed to the first man, the second betrothal is null. If not, the first man whose betrothal was imputed by rumor grants her divorce, and the second man marries her, since his betrothal was definite. If the second man divorced her, the first man may not marry her lest people will say that he remarried his ex-wife from betrothal after she had subsequently betrothed another (which is forbidden explicitly in Deuteronomy 24:4). If the second man brought her under the chupa (i.e. completed the marriage) before she was divorced from the first man, she is forever forbidden to him (the second man), even after divorce from the first man (See supra chapter 31 se'if 4).
If a rumor spread that she was betrothed to so-and-so, and another rumor similarly spread that she was betrothed to another, one man divorces and one man marries, whether the first or the second. 
If a rumor goes out that she was married to a certain man and then divorced him, we do not suspect she was prohibited to other men because of her [supposed] marriage, nor do we prohibit her [to marry] a kohen because of her rumored divorce.
A rumor spread after nisuin (complete marriage), or even after erusin (betrothal), saying that she had previously been betrothed, is not to be heeded. Rama: Even if the rumor [of prior betrothal] had spread previously but had not been validated in court until after this betrothal, we do not investigate the rumor to validate it (Beit Yosef in the name of Ramban). Nevertheless, if she admits afterward that she had been betrothed to the first (rumored) man, she is forbidden to her husband (as implied by Responsa Rosh rule 35), since the rumor had spread prior to the second betrothal (R. Nathan gave a praiseworthy reason to differentiate between our case and the case where she said "I am impure" etc.). And see infra end of siman 48.

Siman 47

Two claim: We saw her get married (kiddushin). And two claim: We didn't see her get married (kiddushin). She is married, even of all of them live with her in a courtyard, "we didn't see" is not evidence, for it is possible she got married privately.
Two that claim: She got married. And two that claim: She did not get married. It is no different than the case where he throws her her betrothal amount, and two claim: It is closer to him [and therefore she does not acquire it], and two claim: It was closer to her [and she does acquire it]. It is no different than the case where two claim that she never was in a doubtfully legal marriage. She is not married [in any of these cases]. If she goes and get's married [to someone else], she is [told] to leave [him]. If she marries one of her witnesses, and she says, "It is clear to me that I was not married [to the first guy]," she is not [told] to leave [him].
One witness says married and the other witness says not married. If one says that he was never in doubt of the marriage ceremony, they are married from the beginning. And if she throws the wedding away one says come close to him the other says come close to her then they are not married and if they are married then they don't divorce. This is continued on section 42 part 2. 
If she herself says, "I am now consecrated" and then immediately afterwards (in a short period of time  called "toch zman dibur") she says, "I am single" , she is believed. If she then gives an explanation for saying she was married , for example, so that unreliable people would not make advances towards her, etc. and she had real basis for saying so, she is believed. But if she does not give an explanation, or she gives an explanation but her words have no basis, she is not believed. And if she is consecrated to another, it is considered to be a marriage in doubt. Therefore, if her husband gives her a get (a dicorce), she is forbidden to him and to everyone else, until her first husband comes. According to the Ramah, the case above is true if she makes a general statement, "I am consecrated". But if she says, "I am consecrated to so and so", she is not believed when she says, "I am single", because she halachikly belongs to her husband and she cannot expropriate herself from him.

Siman 48

One says to a woman: I married you. And she says: I you did not marry me. It is prohibited for him to come close to her and she is allowed to come close to him.
[She says:] You married me, and he says: I did not marry you. He is allowed in coming close to her and she is prohibited in coming close to him.
I married you, and she says: you did not marry [me], rather [you married] my daughter. He is prohibited in coming close to the mother, and the mother is allowed in coming close to him; and he is allowed in coming close to the daughter, and the daughter is allowed in coming close to him.
[One says:] I married your daughter. And she (the mother) says: you did not marry [her],  rather you married me. He is prohibited in coming close to the daughter, and the daughter is allowed in coming close to him; and he is allowed in coming close to the mother, and the mother is prohibited regarding coming close to him.
All of these that claim marriage, are like the claim of a one who claims that there are witnesses there [at the scene of something], and they (judges) went to them (the witnesses) and to the state afterwards or they (the witnesses) died. But, if they rejoice that they were married [and there were not] two witnesses, there is not marriage here.
Any time that a woman says to a man, "you married me" and he says, "I did not marry you," we ask him to write for her a bill of divorce.
Rem"a: And at this point he is forbidden to her relatives, since he gave her a bill of divorce.  However, if he said, "I married you" and she says, "you did not marry me" and we coerce him to give her a bill of divorce because we are concerned that other men will not marry her [because of a concern that she is a married woman], [in such an instance,] the woman is not forbidden to his relatives because of the bill of divorce (source: Commentary of Mordechai on Masechet Kidushin)
Someone who says: Before I married my wife, I married her sister in front of "so and so," and they have since moved to another town, I never gave her a divorce, and she is now married. He is not believed to prohibit her from living with her husband, as long as witnesses are not brought (to prove otherwise). And even if she says: It is true that he married me, she is still not believed to prohibit herself from her husband, even if witnesses are brought that he married her. If his wife's sister was married in front of him, she is not prohibited from her husband, for this is prohibited with his wife, since it is says: he married her sister first, then he is prohibited from both family members. 

Siman 49

If a man is mekadesh (that is, betroths) one of five women, and he writes and delivers to her a ketuba (that is, a marriage document guaranteeing a certain amount of money to the women should the husband die or divorce her), and he does not know which one [of the five women] he married, and each [woman] says, "I am the one," he is forbidden to marry the relatives of all of them [as if each one is the "true" wife] and he gives a get (that is, a bill of divorce) to each one of them and he gives the ketuba money (that is, money given to a divorcee by the husband) between all of them and leaves [i.e., he leaves it up to the women to decide who was the "true" wife and, therefore, who has rights to the ketuba money].  If he was mekadesh her through engaging in sexual relations, the Sages punished him and he must give the ketuba money to each of the women.
Someone who marries a woman, and retracts immediately, and says that the money is a gift, even saying so in the same breath, his retraction is meaningless, and he thus requires a bill of divorce.
Anyone who is not an expert in the make-up of divorces and marriages should not deal with them to teach (about them, because it is easy to err and to permit an erva [that is, a forbidden woman] and cause an increase in mamzerim [that is, children born from illicit relationships] in Israel.

Siman 50

One who betroths a woman, whether she reneges or he reneges or he dies or she dies or he divorces her, the betrothal money is never returned. Even if he betroths her with a thousand dinar, this is completely a present that is not returned. 
And if this was a mistaken betrothal, the money is restored. 
And also if she refuses.
And also if the betrothal was conditional and the condition was not fulfilled. 
And also if the betrothal was doubtful.
And all of this is true only from betrothal, but if from marriage, the betrothal money returns (Maharil. siman 61).
One who betroths his sister, the money is considered a gift. For everyone knows that betrothal doesn't work with forbidden relations, and this was not a mistake. Rather he gave her the money as a gift.
If one sends weddings gifts to [his betrothed at] his father-in-law's home, whether many or few, whether he had eaten a betrothal banquet there or not, whether he or she died, or if the man broke it off, the gifts must all be returned, with the exception of food and drink. Similarly, money and small vessels that he sent her to use in her father's home: if she used them and they wore out or were lost, they are not repaid. However, if they are extant, it all goes back, and he may collect them through the court, for it is well known that he sent them only ornamentally. Rem"a: Some say that even food, beverages, and small things are not returned only if the groom had eaten there. In that case, even what is still extant is not returned. But if he had not eaten there, it is all returned (Tur, op. cit.).

If she broke it off, everything is returned. Even food and drink she must give him at its low price - that is, if the price of the food and drink was six, she pays four. If the local custom was that every man makes a banquet and feeds his friends, or distributes monies to beadles, cantors, and others like them, and he did as everyone does, whereupon she broke it off, she must repay it all, for she caused him to lose money. This is only if he has witnesses to his expenses. Rem"a: Some say that all of this applies to what he sent after betrothal, but prior to betrothal, but after engagement, everything is refunded (Nimukei Yosef to ch. "Mi She-meit" and Ritva). Some disagree (Beit Yosef, citing Rashba).
If one arranges a match between his daughter and his friend, and he sent him clothing and jewelry, and then the engagement was broken, and the groom or his father-in-law broke it off, he must return what had been send. This is because just as the gifts that he sent her revert, so to what she sent him reverts, for we presume that she had in mind that everything she sent him was considering that she would bring her under the wedding canopy. 
Reuven engaged his daughter to Shimon with a solemnizing acquisition and with an oath, and deposited contracts with a third party. Then the sister of the engaged sister became an apostate. Shimon may break it off, and he is absolved of the solemnizing acquisition, oath, and contractual obligations (Rem"a: that is, the mutually agreed-upon sanctions). If the third party returned the contract to the engaged woman, he has accomplished nothing. The same applies if the engaged woman became deranged - the engaged man may break it off. Similarly, if the engaged man behaved despicably, the engaged woman may break it off and be absolved of the solemnizing acquisition, oath, and contractual obligation. If the third party returned the contract to the engaged man, he has accomplished nothing. Rem"a: Some say that all of this applies prior to betrothal, but after betrothal, "his field was flooded" [i.e., caveat emptor] (Mahari"k no. 101). See Yoreh De'ah 228:43 and 232:16.
When one wishes to make assurances for a marriage promise, one should make them in a manner that they are not asmakhta (based on unlikely future events). That is, one makes a document from this [party] that he owes his friend a maneh, and afterwards he obligates himself a maneh (making a condition with the father of the bride) that if the marriage promise is fulfilled and he enters into the marriage canopy with this woman to whom he is promised, the debt is forgiven, and afterwards they make a document that his friend is obligated a maneh to the other, and make a condition with him that if he brings his daughter into the marriage canopy with the man to whom she is promised, the debt will be forgiven, and they place these two documents in the hand of a third.
Rema: Some say that any fines one makes regarding marriage promises are unproblematic from the perspective of asmakhta (Tosafot ch. What is neshekh and the Rosh, Nedarim ch. 4). And similarly, the widespread custom is to collect fines that one makes regarding marriage promises, as will be explained in Hoshen Mishpat 207. This is only if they already wrote fine documents, but if they have only accepted an obligation to write documents, and before they wrote them one of the parties backs out, and refuses in front of witnesses to write the documents, he has permission to do so (Responsa of the Rosh 34), as will be explained in Hoshen Mishpat 39 and 243. Some say that someone who commits that his daughter (ibid., 43) or daughter of his daughter (Rashba 771), or a female relative should be married to so-and-so, and afterwards the girl doesn't wish [to go through with the marriage], that the one who comitted is exempt from the fine, because this is called "duress" even though he didn't make [the commitment] on condition, as long as there is no deception in the case. And see below the end of 77. And likewise other kinds of duress, e.g., the one who made the commitment died, the inheritors need not follow through, and are exempt from the fine. They are exempt from the fine only regarding a general commitment, but if he had committed himself with a document, his inheritors are obligated to pay, and duress is not a legally-admissible factor, see below 51 (there it will be found). Two parties who made wedding promises between them, and they used to live in one city, and they agreed to fines between them, and afterwards one of them left the city and the second wanted to pursue him to get engaged, if [the first] doesn't want [to follow through], he is exempt from the fine (Rivash 177 and Responsum of the Ramban 278). And see Hoshen Mishpat 12(:9) if the transgressor wishes to pay the fine, whether he is obligated to establish the matter through acceptance of ownership.
If he gives collateral to a fellow as a promise that he will not back out of an arranged marriage, he needs to say thus: If I back out, you are awarded such-and-such amount of money from the worth of this item. Rama: Two that swear to marry this one to that one, and one transgresses [the agreement], or [if the case is] that only one swore, all is explained in Yoreh Deah Siman 236. The laws of marriage arrangements, see Choshen Mishpat end of Siman 87, and the end of Siman 185 and Siman 264.

Siman 51

If a man and woman were involved in discussing a marriage proposal and he said to her:  "How much will you earn for me, such and such?" Then she responded and said to him: "And how much will you give me, or (she says) write for me such and such an amount."  And there is no difference between a first or second marriage.  (This is deduced from Maimonides and such is written in the Rivas"h Chapter 345): And likewise if a father is making the arrangement for his son or daughter : "How much are you giving to your son, such and such an amount; and how much are you giving to your daughter, such and such an amount

Siman 52

One who lists monies for his son-in-law and -- the father -- went to another country or has none: [the daughter] can tell [her] husband, "I did not list the money for myself. Either marry me without dowry or release me with a bill [of divorce]." However, if she listed [money] for herself and cannot afford [it, then] she sits [without <i>nisu'in</i>] until she will afford what she listed or die. About what are these words said? An adult. [In the case] of a minor, however, who listed [money] for herself, we force him to give a bill [of divorce], or he shall marry without dowry. Comment: And all this is [in the case] that the woman cannot afford what he father listed; if, however, she can afford [it], she's required to give what her father listed, and cannot say "marry or release" (the Fezzite's comments [to] chapter [Shenei] Dayyanei Gezerot, and Maimonidean responsum [at] the end of laws of sexuality). And all this is not taught unless [the situation is one] before he <i>nisu'in</i>-married her; after he <i>nisu'in</i>-married her, her certainly cannot betray his wife because they are not giving him what they listed for him: he is, rather, responsible for everything a man is responsible to his wife for (Mordechai comments [to] chapter Shenei Dayyanei Gezerot). One who listed [money] to give his daughter and thereafter says that he gave [it] to his daughter -- that doesn't help: rather, he must give [it] to the couple (Maharil chapter 136). See also above, chapter 2, that one should not be argumentative about dowry even though they listed it for him.

A father who promised something to his daughter, his daughter has not acquired the gift until her husband marries her. And so too with a son, he doesn't acquire until he marries her, for all that promise [wedding presents to their children do so] with the intent that they should be married.
Therefore, one who promises money to his son-in-law or his son, and he dies before he marries her, and she becomes liable for levirate marriage, the father can say to the levir: I wanted to give the gift to your brother, but I don't want to give it to you.
And even if the first was an am haaretz and the second a sage, and even if the daughter wants him. 
There are those who say that one who promised something to his daughter, for example like one who says during <i>kiddushin</i>, I will give to my daughter, the daughter has acquired it so that if she becomes a <i>yivamah</i>, he [the father] cannot say: I wanted to give the gift to your brother because he promised to his daughter, and the <i>kiddushin</i> is not reduced, through its strength, she does <i>yibum</i> with his brother. 
One who determines to give a certain sum of money to his [future] son-in-law at the time of betrothal, and gave him the money before the marriage was finalized, and his daughter died with a son, the money should be returned to the father, for anyone who sets aside money does so with the understanding that it is on the condition of marriage.  Some authorities say that this is true if he designates the sum for his son-in-law, but if he gives it to his daughter with comment for her marriage without specifying a particular man, she acquired it as a gift.  Once she is betrothed, even if the betrothal is rendered irrelevant when the finacee died, the father cannot back out.  Rem"a: One who promised funds to marry off an orphan, and the orphan then dies, see (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 253).  One who designates money for his son-in-law or daughter, and then they marry, and then the daughter dies before he gave the money, some authorities say that the husband earned his claim to the money and the father must give him the entire sum that he promised.  Rabbeinu Tam explained that the husband has not earned them, and we will not seize the money from the father because of this doubt so long as the son-in-law has not received it at all, even if a third party received it with both of their authority.  Some authorities say that id a third party received the money, [the son-in-law] has earned his right to it.  Also, if there is a guarantor [the son-in-law gets the money].  But without these measures, even if the father drew up a contract and considered it a loan to himself and she had his children, the husband has not earned the funds, and we will not seize them from the father.  [Still,] if the son-in-law takes it we will not remove it from him, for he can say, "I am certain that the first view is correct."  All of this is true only if the son-in-law never received the money while the daughter was alive, but if he did receive it one time, even if he then returned it to the father, [the son-in-law] has earned rights to all of it.  (So it appears from the language of the edict) Rebbeinu Tam and the French Sages also declared that even if the father already gave the dowry, if the wife or husband die during the first year without viable offspring, the full sum returns to the father or his heirs.  Some authorities also say that even in the second year half the dowry should be returned to the father, and that is the standard practice in these countries that follow the proclamations of the communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz.  Only the extant portion is returned; any amount that was spent or lost is exempted, provided that he did not waste it after her death on burial expenditures.  Some authorities say that if the son-in-law wishes to sell property during the [first] two years, the [prospective] heirs may object for this reason.  See more of these laws later on (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 118)

Siman 54

One who ordered that [his executor] give his daughter some sum of money for her sustenance, to purchase land, whether he is on his death bed or he is well, and he then died, and the money is with a third party, and the daughter says, "Give the money to my husband who may then with it as he wishes."  If the daughter is an adult, and she is married, she has full authority to do as she likes.  If she is still betrothed, the third party should follow his instructions.  If she is still a child, even if she is marries, we so not listen to her and the third party must follow the father's orders.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that the third party must have been explicitly delegated for this purpose, see (Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 292).

This is the customary “ḥupah” nowadays. See below, Chapter 62 paragraph 9, and Chapter 60.
(In the case of) one who betrothes a woman, and says the wedding blessings, but does not have “yiḥud” with her in his house (immediately) - she is still betrothed, for the wedding blessings (in and of themselves) do not make marriage, only entrance into the “ḥupah”.

Siman 56

One who gets engaged to a woman and then waits a couple years and then tries to claim his marriage rights and finds the woman still as a girl(between 12 and 12.5), we give her 12 months from from the day of the fiance's claim to sustain herself(monetarily) and to tend to what she needs to tend to. Afterward, she can get married. If he claims her after puberty, we give her 12 months from the onset of her puberty process. And if he marries her on the day of her puberty process, we give her 12 months from the day of the wedding as that is the day of the puberty processing. If he marries her after she goes through puberty, if she has already gone through 12 months since then and afterwards, she is married, we only give her 30 days from the day of the husband's claim to her. And so too one one who gets engaged to a non-virgin, we give her 30 days from the time of her being claimed. 
Just as we give time to the woman from when the man claims her to financially sustain herself, so too we give time to the man  from when the woman claims him. How much time do we give him? The same as we give her. If it's 12 months (for her), then it's 12 months. If it's 30 days, then it's 30 days. 
If the prescribed time for either the man or the woman [to marry] arrives , he must provide for her food even though he did not yet marry her.  If some uncontrollable circumstances prevent him from [marrying], such as his or her illness, or she menstruated, or the time coincided with a Sunday when he is unable to wed, he is not obligated to provide her food.  Rem"a: This is true only if the illness began during the allotted time period.  If, however, the time came and he did not marry her, and then he fell ill, he must provide for her food even it is now uncontrollable circumstances.
Someone who betroths his minor daughter, and her fiancee wants to complete the marriage, both the daughter or her father can prevent her from marrying until she becomes an adult (age); if she wants to enter marriage, she may enter, but it is inappropriate to do so. "Rem"a": If she and her fiancee want to marry, and her father dies, her relatives may not protest (their marriage), even though she is sickly and he wants to get married quickly in order to be able to inherit her (if she dies) (Mordekhai, Perek HaIsh Mekadesh)

Siman 57

The husband precedes all others in the inheritance of his wife. At what point do his rights commence? When she leaves the domain of her father, even though she has not yet entered the chupah (i.e. she has not completed the final stage of marriage), since she is then under the authority of her husband, he inherits her. How? A woman who was engaged (i.e. completed the first stage of marriage) and her father handed her over to the husband or the agents of the husband, or the father's agents handed her over to the husband or his agents, and she then passed away on the way before entering chupah, even though the dowry is still in her father's house, the husband inherits her. 

Note: see supra end of chapter 53, and infra 118. And some authorities disagree if the dowry has not yet reached her hands (Tur in the name of Rabbenu Tam).      

Similarly, if the father or his agents went with the husband, and the husband entered a courtyard and secluded himself with her for the purposes of nisuin, and she then sided, the husband inherits her.  But if the father accompanied the husband to take her to the husband's house, or the father's agents accompanied the husband or his agents, even if she and the husband entered a courtyard to sleep on the way as travelers sleep together in a single inn, since the father or his agents are with her, and the husband did not yet seclude with her for purposes of nisuin, if she then died, the father inherits her, even if the dowry is already in the house of her husband. The law is similar with an adult woman or an orphan or a widow, and she traveled from her father's house to her husband's house, and she was not accompanied by her husband or his agents, and she died on the way, the husband does not inherit her.    

Note: Some authorities say that if the courtyard belongs to the husband or to the two of them, the usual seclusion is viewed as being for purposes of nisuin (Ran chapter Na'arah). But in her courtyard or a courtyard not belonging to either of them, the usual seclusion is viewed as being for purposes of sleeping (Magid Mishna in the name of Rashba and Ramban).

Siman 58

The Sages commanded that one must give a small part of his property to his daughter, and this is call "parnasa" (that is, livelihood).  One who marries off his daughter without any stipulations, he may not give her anything less than [simple] clothing that is given to the wife of a poor Israelite.  When does this apply?  When the father [himself] is poor.  However, if he is wealthy, then it is ideal that he gives to her according to his wealth.
If [the father] stipulates with the groomsman to marry her naked [that is, without the father providing her with clothing], [the groomsman] may not say: "When she comes into my house, I will clothe her."  Rather, he must clothe her while she is still living in her father's house.

Siman 59

When the eldest son in the house marries, he acquires the house. And if another son marries first and his father does not marry off the eldest son until after him, and the father does not leave anything in the house, it is his [the married son's] alone. But if one leaves even one jug, he does not acquire the house. Some say that if he does not marry a virgin, the father may remain in the house to live in it (Tur). 
If he combines a house and vessels of the house, even if one vessel that is his remains in house, or had a treasure or anything like that, he acquires the vessels of the house, but not the house itself.
If he designated for him (his son) a house and attic, the son acquires the house but not the attic. Similarly if he designated a house and portico, he acquires the house but not the portico.
If there were two houses, one interior to the other, he acquires only the house in which the marriage took place.

Siman 60

When a man marries a woman, it is the custom that his friends and acquaintances send him money to help defray the cost of the wedding feast, and these funds are called shushvinut (groomsmen's gifts). These gifts are not complete gifts, for this [friend] did not send if except [with the understanding that] if he were to marry a woman, this [groom] would likewise send him money as [the friend] had sent. Therefore if he [the friend] marries a woman and he [the original groom] did not return groomsmen's gifts, the friend may make a claim in court and collect the funds. There are a number of distinctions, and since nowadays it is not customary to make these claims, I decided not to elaborate on these laws.

Siman 61

Once a man enters the <i>chuppah </i> with his fiancee, even though he has not been with her, she is his wife in all regards. And he evaluates the main value of the <i>ketubah</i> [the marriage contract] and the extra [value] in case she is widowed or divorced. What case are we talking about? When she is able to have relations. But if while was in <i> niddah</i>, [ritually impure], she entered the <i> chuppah</i>, and he secluded himself with her, she is not his wife, rather in all matters she is like a fiancee, since she was in <i> niddah</i>. 
There are those who say that specifically regarding whether she can collect the additional value [of the <i>ketubah </i>], then she is still a fiancee. But for everything else, she is still considered married. Rem"a: see earlier, the beginning of siman 55, what is called a <i>chuppah </i>, and they need to write a <i>ketubah </i> before the <i>chuppah </i>, so that she is fit for marital relations (Rambam Perek 10, Ishut). 
And one opinion says that a <i>chuppah </i> where she is a <i>niddah </i> is still a <i>chuppah </i> even though she is not fitting for marital relations. This is the same law if he [the husband] did not write the <i>ketubah </i>. Nevertheless, initially, it should be written beforehand. 
A woman who is sick with a deathly illness, even though she entered with the bed under the <i>chuppah </i> so that her husband would inherit her, it is not considered a <i>chuppah </i> since she is not fitting for relations, so her husband does not inherit her (Responsa of the R"SH, rule 54). 
She entered the <i>chuppah </i> and he did not make the bridegroom blessing, it is a complete <i>chuppah </i> sine blessings do not prevent and he can eventually make the blessing (Tur Siman 62). Initially, he should bless her before he secludes himself with her (this is implicit in the R"SH's responsa). See earlier siman 55.Nowadays, we customarily recite the blessing under the <i>chuppah </i> before he secludes himself with her. 
It is customary that the bride and the groom fast the day of the <i>chuppah </i> (see Orach Chaim siman 573).
If he mistakenly engaged her, and he had the marriage ceremony with her, and afterwards it was found out that the engagement was a mistake, even though he returned and engaged her, he does not need to make a second <i>sheva brachot </i>, it is enough with the first blessings. 
There are those who say to make a <i>chuppah </i> under the sky as a good sign that their children will be like the stars of the heaven. 



It is proper not to marry with nisuin (chupa, the completion of the marriage ceremony) until the women is ritually purified [from menstruant status).  

Note: Nowadays the custom is not to check, and we do not wait until purification.  Nevertheless it is appropriate to notify the groom that she is nidda (menstrually impure; Mordechai chapter Af Al Pi, in the name of R"I).  

Siman 62

One needs to make the blessing of the bridegroom in the groom's house before the marriage ceremony, and there are six blessings. And if there is wine there, bring in a cup of wine and make the blessing on the wine first, and then make all the blessings [lit: arrange all of them] on the cup [of wine], and that makes seven blessings; and if there is no wine to be found, bless on beer. 
A man should marry many women at once, on one day, [in order to] say the groom's blessing for all of them at once. But to make her happy, he needs to be happy with each one the happiness that is fitting to her. If she is a virgin, seven days, and if she is not a virgin, three days. And one happiness should not be mixed with another. Rem"a: and one cannot make a <i>chuppah </i> for two sisters at once. (SM"K in the name of Sefer Chasidim) And there are those who say that even with two unrelated women one should be careful to not make a [<i>chuppah </i> for both of them] at once because of jealousy, maybe they will be honored more than her friend. (Mordechai first chapter of Moed Katan); and we are not careful for this. Just the opposite, [we] intend to make <i>chuppot </i> of poor people with <i>chuppot </i> of the rich, because of <i>Mitzvah</i> (Hagot Maimone in the name of the Ri MiPriz)
If there are two grooms together, we make the blessing of grooms (Birkat Chatanim) once, for both of them. Rama: And even if the groom were not together, but his mind was on both of them, as we will explain in Yoreh Deah Siman 265 regarding circumcision. And some say not to make the blessing for two grooms together, because of the evil eye (Hagaot Maimoni Chapter 10 of Ishut). And similarly we have the practice to make a separate chuppah (wedding canopy) for each one and to make the blessing for each one; but after the meal we make the blessing for many grooms together, if they ate together.
We only recite the blessing "birkat chatanim" (blessing of the grooms) with 10 free adults, and the groom can be part of the quorom, regardless of whether they say them at the time of the marriage or when they same them after the blessing of the food (Birkat HaMazon); but when we don't say it after Birkat HaMazon, rather the blessing "Asher Bara" ("that created"), we don't need 10 [men]. Nonetheless we at least need 3 (The Ran in the first chapter of Ketubot).
We recite the blessing of Birkat Chatanim (blessing of grooms) in the grooms house after the blessing of the food (Birkat haMazon), at every meal that we eat there, and slaves and minors do not recite this blessing.
For how long do we recite this blessing? If he was a widower who married a widow, we recite it only on the first day. If a bachelor married a widow, or a widower married a virgin, we recite the blessing all seven days of the party. Rama: And these seven days begin immediately after the seven blessings that were recited at first.
This blessing that they add in the groom's house is the last blessing of the seven blessings, which is the blessing "Who created." Hagah: And there are those who say that even "Who created" is not recited all seven [days] unless they are inviting others, but if he eats with members of his household they do not recite it (Ran in the name of Ramban) and this is the custom. What is this regarding? When the guests are the ones who stood at the marriage ceremony and heard the blessings; but if the guests were others, who did not hear the marriage blessings at the time of the marriage, they recite the seven blessings for them after the grace after meals, in the manner that they recite the blessings at the time of the marriage, and that is if there are ten, and the groom counts as one of the number. And there are those who say that even if they were there at the time of the chuppah and heard the blessings, if they did not eat there until now, they are called new faces and they recite the seven blessings for them after the grace after meals, and this [is the] custom [that] spread. Hagah: And there are those who say that if there were new faces there, even if they are not eating there, they recite the blessings for them day and night (the Ran first chapter of Ketubot).
Some say that only people who increased for them are called "new faces." And some say that Shabbat and Yom Tov one and two are "new faces" at the meals of the night and morning, but not the third meal, and so did the custom spread. Rama: And now the practice in these countries is to recite the 7 blessings at the third meal, and it's possible it's because usually "new faces" come; and some say for the reason that we usually sermonize, and the sermon is like "new faces."
Some say not to recite the six blessings on the cup of the blessing of sustenance, rather bring a different cup and recite the six blessings and then go back and take the cup of the blessing of sustenance and say over it, "who creates the fruit of the vine." And some say you don't need [to do this], rather on the cup of the sustenance blessing recite seven blessings, and so did the custom spread. Ram"a: And in these countries we practice like the first opinion. And some say even for "who created" alone we require two cups (Old Customs). And the engagement blessing and groom blessing we say it on two cups, even one who gets married at the time of the wedding canopy. And we have the practice to pause between them with reading of the marriage contract (so did the Tosfot and Asheir"i write).
Some say that if the groom leaves his wedding canopy, even if his bride is with him, and they go to eat in another house, we don't say the groom blessing there; and these words are when his intention is to return afterwards to his wedding canopy, but if he goes entirely to another house and the whole group is with him, and he makes that house the main [one], there too it's called "wedding canopy" and we recite the groom blessing. And similarly sometimes when the groom and bride go to different city, you need to recite the groom blessing there, if it's within seven [days] Rama: and he does not have intention to return (Beit Yosef)
People who took part of the wedding ceremony and [then] split into groups, even if they ate in houses that were not facing the area that the groom ate, they all make the blessings of grooms. This is obviously true when a waiter is shared between them, but even when they do not share a waiter, since when they who are in the houses started to eat while they were considered part of the wedding ceremony, they are all considered united in terms of making the blessing of grooms, since they are eating at a meal established for the ceremony.
Waiters, who eat after the wedding meal, some say that they do not make the 7 blessings, and some say they do make the blessings, and the mind inclines toward that.
One who feasts (eats) in a house of grooms, from the time that the wedding feast perpetration begins and up to thirty days after the wedding, he should bless (in the invitation for the blessing after the meal) "let us praise that joy is in his home whose bounty we have partaken". If ten (men) are present, " let us praise God that joy is in his home" etc, and they shall reply: Let us praise God that joy" etc. similarly, in the feast after the wedding, because of the wedding, up to twelve months one should bless: " that joy is in his home"; Nowadays all joy is granted and we do not say  "that joy is in his home" except in the seven days of banquette. And in every place (of joy) even in the case of a widower wedding a widow we say: that joy is in his home in three days that he has joy with her.

Siman 63

It is permissible to have intercourse with a virgin on Shabbat.  When one has intercourse with a virgin, once he performs the commanded sexual act he should immediately seperate, even if she is a child who is not old enough to menstruate, and she has not mentruated.  Nevertheless, that particular sexual act may be completely normally with a 'living member'  Even if she inspected and did not find any blood, she is deemed impure, for perhaps a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed was seen but it was covered by semen.  She must find herself totally clean and inspect for seven days.  She should not start inspecting until the fifth day after intercourse, like any other woman who had intercourse and then menstruated.  [Her husband] must interact with her like any other menstruant, as far as the rules of distance are concerned, except that in the case of a genuine menstruant he may not sleep in her bed even is she is not in the bed, and in the case of the bride he may sleep in her bed after she has risen from it, even on the sheets that the blood is on.  Rem"a: See (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 193).
Some authorities say that after he finds the hymen [blood] he should recite the following blessing: Blessed are you HaSHem, the King of the World, who watered the nut in the Garden of Eden, [the rose of the valley, a foreigner shall not rule in the sealed wellspring. Therefore the beloved morning star has been guarded in purity, as a law that shall not be forsaken.  Blessed is the One who chooses the offspring of Abraham].  Rem"a: Other authorities say that we do not recite this blessing without a cup of wine.

Siman 64

One who marries a virgin should celebrate with her for seven days, during which time he should not do any work or buy and sell in the marketplace. Rather he should eat, drink, and be happy with her. This applies whether he we previously married or not. (Rema: A bridegroom is forbidden from doing work, and is forbidden from going to the marketplace alone [Ran, chapter kama d'ktiv and pirkei rav Eliezer]). 
One who marries a previously married woman is required to celebrate with her for three days, whether he was previously married or not. There are some who say that a man who was never married previously who marries a previously married woman needs to celebrate with her for seven days. (Rema: And the woman is able to absolve the requirement for her joy, Rabeinu Yeruchum, 22).
There are some who forbid marrying on erev shabbat or Sunday. It is a stringency put in place to prevent a violation of shabbat during the wedding feast. There are those who are lenient regarding this practice. The minhag is to marry women on erev shabbat, as long as the bridegroom prepares for the wedding feast for three days before the wedding. A place that does not have a beit din except on Monday and Thursday, a virgin should marry on Wednesday so that if there is a claim on her [someone claims she is still married], they can go to the beit din. The minhag of the wise ones was that one who was marrying a previously married woman should marry her on Thursday so that he could celebrate with her for three days - Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and return to work on Sunday. (Rema: There is a custom to only marry at the beginning of the month when the moon is getting fuller, Ran end of chapter arba mitot. See also yoreh deah siman 179)
If the bridegroom doesn't want to make a feast, but the bride does want to make a feast, compel the bridegroom to make a feast according to his honor and her honor.
Do not bring a virgin to the chupah on shabbat because it is by the chupah that [the bridegroom] merits her and her handiwork, and this is like making an acquisition on shabbat. A widow isn't aquired with a chupah. Only with by yichud shel biah (privacy for the amount of time necessary to have sex) does [the bridegroom] merit her and her handiwork. Therefore, [the bridegroom] needs to be alone with her before shabbat, so that there is not an acquisition on shabbat. (Rema: see also Orach Haim, siman 339).
Do not marry a woman on hol hamoed [the intermediate days of a holiday], neither a virgin, nor a previously married woman, nor a yibum [woman who is getting married via levirite marriage]. However, a man can remarry his ex-wife if they had done nisuin, but not if they had [only] done erusin.

Siman 65

There is a commandment to delight a groom and bride and dance before them and tell them they are beautiful and kind. Even if they aren't pretty. Rem"a: We see rabbi Yehuda the son of allay was dancing before the bride and nullifying the words of the torah to enter the bride to the canopy.
It is forbidden to gaze at the bride. Rem"a: However it is permitted to gaze at her jewelry or head covering).
One needs to place ashes on the head of the bridegroom in the place where the tefillin sit in memory of the mourning of Jerusalem. As it says (Isiah 61:3) "To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, To give unto them a garland for ashes". Rem"a: There are place where is it customary to break a glass after the sheva brachot [the blessing that make up erusin], and this is the tradition in our lands that the bridegroom breaks the utensil on which the blessings of erusin were said. Every place goes according to its traditions. There is also a tradition to fast. See also (siman 61). For the law of throwing food before the bride and bridegroom, see (Shulchan aruch, Orach Chayyim, 171). 
A dead body [a burial procession] and a bride [bridal procession] which meet each other, the burial procession is moved from before the bridal procession to give her the road.

Siman 66

It is forbidden [for the groom] to seclude himself with the bride before he has written her the ketubah, <i>Rem"a: There are some who are lenient and allow [being alone together] without a ketubah provided that they do not have sexual relations. (Ran, beginning of Tractate Ketubot).</i> and the groom pays the scribe's fee [for writing the ketubah]. Even if he wants to set aside her ketubah with money [i.e. the monetary payment that is stipulated in the ketubah], or with other goods [which have the value of the ketubah], we do not listen to him. Rather he needs to write a contract that obligates himself to pay her the monetary value of the ketubah, all his assets have a lien on them, or witness can witness and and they effect transfer directly from [the groom] that he is obligated [to pay] her 100 or 200 [the value stipulated by the ketubah]. <i>Rem"a: Some say that we only rely on witnesses in exigent circumstances. As soon as he is free to write [a ketubah], he is required to write one, all the more so we do not rely on [witnesses] preferably (Inferred from the language of the Tur, and what was written by the Maharik Shoresh 64, and the Mordechai at the beginning of Tractate Ketubot) And such is proper to disseminate. If he appoints a ketubah delivery guarantor for her, and he makes the condition that he [himself] should be exempt from [paying] her, this is forbidden, until he makes it a lien on himself, so that it should not be an easy thing for him to divorce her (Bet Yosef in the name of the Teshuvot HaRashba 2:58) And see Choshen Mishpat 60 if he can make a lien on himself for the ketubah from something that has yet to come into existence. And the witnesses should only sign the ketubah after the groom effects the transfer before them (Divrei HaRav). Some places are lenient about this (Mordechai, Tractate Gittin chapter 2). And so there should be signing witnesses for the ketubah read under the wedding canopy, even if they didn't hear it read; even though they didn't act well [by not hearing it read], we do not change the custom, as we don't cast aspersions on previous ketubahs (Or Zarua).</i>
If [the groom] is unable to write her [the bride] a ketubah, for example if it is shabbat, or he forgot to write her one, he can give her objects [which have value] in place of the ketubah, and accept responsibility if they are lost or stolen [the wife is not responsible for replacing them], and then it is acceptable for them to be together until he is able to write [a ketubah]. Rem"a: and then he must write one immediately (tur).
If [a husband] wrote [his wife] a ketubah and it became lost or destroyed, specifically if it was written: I accept [the payment of] my ketubah, [the husband] is required to write a new one because it is forbidden for a man to delay with his wife for a single hour without a ketubah. <i>Rem"a: If the militia overtakes a city, or [the people] were exiled from the city, and the women lost their ketubah [documents], new ketubahs are required even though the claim could be made that they may yet find their [old] ketubot afterwards ketubahs, or they will be returned. Nevertheless, once the ketubah is presumed lost [because of such a situation], another one is required. And if the sum for the ketubah is not known, if some [ketubahs] remain, we go according to [their sums]. And if not, we judge them according to the elders of the city, and according to custom, the wealthy according to his wealth, and the destitute according to his destitution (Bet Yosef in the name of the Responsa of the Geonim). And when the ketubah is lost and he came to write for her another ketubah, he needs to write for her a ketubah as large as the original. (Maharik Shoresh 116). And look later at siman 187, and in the place that they only divorce according to the will of the woman, he does not need to write a ketubah; if so, in our time in our lands, that they do not divorce the woman by force because of the ban of Rabbenu Gershom, and it is like what was explained later in siman 119, it was possible to be lenient in the writing of the ketubah but this is not the custom, and it should not be changed (this is his own opinion).</i> 
In the case of [a ketuba] that was lost, if the witnesses know the original date [of the lost ketuba], the original date is written [into the replacement ketuba]. If they do not know the original date, we use today's date. If she relinquished her financial rights to the ketuba, we only write today's date [into the replacement ketuba]. 
If [a wife] sells her ketubah to her husband, [the husband] needs to write her a new ketubah. However is she sells the ketubah to someone else, a new ketubah is not needed.
What is the amount of the ketuba? For a virgin it is 200 [zuz] and for a widow it is 100.  In both cases it refers to state (i.e. Israelite, and not Tyrian) silver coins. As a result, the ketubah of a virgin is equivalent to 37.5 dirhems of refined silver (Ottoman coins, 3.207 gm as per Wikipedia), and the ketuba of widow is one half that amount, which is 18.75 dirhems of refined silver.  Note: See Yoreh Deah chapter 294 and 305 for the value of a dirhem coin. This is the opinion of some authorities who hold that the ketuba of a woman is in Rabbinic zuz (Rif, Rambam, Ran, and Ram), that 200 [zuz] of a virgin equal 6.25 sela. There is an authority who calculates the ketuba of a virgin as 10 gold zuz, and that of a widow as 5 gold zuz (Maharil in the name of Agudah). But according to the opinion of some authorities, the 200 of a virgin and 100 of a widow are denominated in Bibilical zuz, which is eightfold greater, and they write that the text of the ketuba therefore states, "...that you deserve by Biblical law" (Rabbenu Tam). Other authorities opine that we write, "...that you deserve" (Hagahot Maimoni, Hilchot Ishut chapter 10). The custom is that for a virgin we write, "...that you deserve by Biblical law, " but not for a widow.  These rules apply where there is no [local] custom, but were there is a local custom as to  the collection of the ketuba, we follow the local custom, as will be explained infra.
If he wishes to add to this amount [for the Ketubah] he may do so.  The additions are sometimes judged similarly to the primary Ketubah, and sometimes judges differently, as will be explained later.  Rem"a: He does not need to explicitly state which is the primary Ketubah and which is the addition; he can combine it all into one total if he so wishes.  Some authorities disagree ,and they hold that he must write the Ketubah according to the local practice independently, and then separately include the additions, and this is our practice.  If all the members of some family are in the practice of including additions, he need not write each one individually.  A Ketubah that includes the phrase, "and this dowry that is given to her of 100 dinar and he has added on his own such and such amount" does not include the primary Ketubah, and he must pay this amount independently, unless the formulation is, "and I will give her the price of her virginity, 1000 silver zuz," because this includes the primary Ketubah.
There is one who says that there is no need for the act of acquisition at the time of the wedding, insofar as it is given to her (the bride). And there are those who disagree.
Anyone who reduces the amount of the Ketubah has rendered his acts of intercourse licentious.  This is true not only if she wrote [after the betrothal], "[I will consider it as if] I have received the Ketubah, or some part of it, from you," (which is effective according to a minority of authorities) but even if they stipulated at the time of the betrothal that she would not receive a Ketubah, or that the amount would be reduced, even though his condition if cancelled and she receives her full Ketubah, still this renders his intercourse licentious, since she believes that she does not have a Ketubah she is not committed [to the marriage.]
If some families customarily write their marriage contract amounts for more than the amounts set by the Sages, don't object to them, not only that, but even if one member of that family didn't write a marriage contract for their wife, the courts enforce collection of their customarily written amount.  Therefore, a woman who lost her marriage contract should examine her relatives' marriage contracts to see what amount her family normally would write for her. and even if it was written "what is fit for me", "Rem"a" she still collects the amount customary in her family (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ra"n as is written in the name of Tosafot). And if the customary contract amounts in women from his family exceed the customary contract amount in her family, the amount is raised accordingly and not lowered.
If one married a woman without specific conditions, he should write the Ketubah according to common practice.  Similarly, if she designated funds for the wedding, she should give according to the local practice.  Rem"a: Whatever a woman brings [into the marriage] for her husband, whether it is currency or textiles, if he assumes responsibility for these items they are called a 'dowry' in every context, and they can only be collected with the Ketubah.  Other items, however, are not treated similarly to the Ketubah, as is explained later.  In some places the groom may add to the Ketubah and write [an amount] greater than that which he received.  In such cases we follow local practice.  The standard rule is that the level of responsibility assumed over the dowry is that of 'iron sheep property' (i.e., the husband must return the principal in full), but if he wishes to leave the property rights with his wife and to not assume responsibility for it, he may do so.  See (beginning of Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 93 and Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 100 for more on this subject).  When the father is alove and marries off his daughter, we write, "this is the dowry that has been bestowed with her from her father's house"; if the father is not alive, we write, "from the house of marriage." Sill, if they change it, it is not an issue.  In the Ketubah of a divorcee we write, "divorce" so that we know that she is a divorcee and may not marry a Kohen.  When the time comes for her to collect the Ketubah, we collect whatever amount is customary in that place.  Rem"a: If she says that [her husband] added more than the standard practice, she must provide proof for her claim.  If, however, she produces a Ketubah contract that has not been properly verified, or if one of the signatories is not qualified to testify, even though she shows us the pre-marital contract that committed him to adding to the Ketubah, she is only entitled to collect according to the standard practice.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 100:30).   In all these matters and those similar to them, the primary determinant is the local practice, and on that basis we form our judgement, provided that the practice is poplar throughout the region.  Rem"a: Nevertheless, if he wishes to create a condition with his wife that [obligates him] in less than the standard practice, he may do so, provided that he does not go below the amount that was prescribed by the Sages.  It seems to me that it is necessary for him to set the condition at the time of engagement.  If, however, they engage without specifying, and they obligated themselves in [the usual] financial penalties, he must write [the Ketubah] according the standard practice and he has no right to change it.  In some places the local practice is to write every Ketubah identically, even if she brings nothing into the marriage, and if he wishes, he may add something, and if he wishes to reduce the amount, she must write to him, "I have already received such-and-such amount from my Ketubah."  This is the practice in our countries.
If he marries a woman from a different place, planning for her to live with him where he is from, one follows the customs of his place:
In a place where only valid witnesses sign a ketuba, a person who does not know how to read should not sign. Rem"a: And therefore an uneducated man who comes to get a divorce, and says afterwards that he did not understand what was written in the wedding stipulations [BETTER TRANSLATION NEEDED?] or the ketuba is not believe, because of course the witnesses [to the ketuba] would not have signed unless they had first verbally told him [what was written in the ketuba] (responsum of the Rashb"a chapter 629)

Siman 67

A virgin that was widowed, divorced, or was released from a Levirite marriage during the time of engagement, and was [subsequently] married, her ketubah is worth 200 [shekel] and she has the claim of virgins.
If a woman was widowed, divorced, or released from a Levirite marriage after being married, for example after she has gone to the chuppah, she is assumed to be a non-virgin woman and her [ketubah] is 100 and she does not have the claim of virgins, even if she has witnesses that she was never alone with the first [husband]
A convert, a woman taken captive, and a maidservant that was redeemed, converted, or freed: if she is less than three-years-old and a day, their ketubah is [worth] 200 [shekel] and they have claim of virgins; from 3-years-old and a day and above, their ketubah is 100 [shekel] and they do not have the claim of virgins.
A female child less than three-years-old and one day that was taken as a wife, even if an adult had relations with her, her ketubah is 200 [zuz]; a child less than 9-years-old and a day that had relations with an adult woman, her ketubah is worth 200 [zuz], but only if he did not break her hymen, but if he broke her hymen, she gets only 100 [zuz]
5 One wounded by [for example] a piece of wood [and therefore physically missing her hymen], her ketuba is a mana. And [this is the case] even if he did not recognize this and cohabitated with her assuming that she was an intact virgin. But if he cohabitated with her assuming that she was a virgin, and she was found to be sexually experienced, she gets not even one mana.
6 A virgin who is old or blind: her ketuba is 200; and similarly an <i> aylonit </i> [who does not develop secondary sexual characteristics], her ketuba is 200.
7 For the mentally incompetent woman they [the Rabbis] established no form of marriage at all. 
8 For the deaf-mute woman, even though they allotted her Rabbinic-level marriage, they did not allot her a ketubah, or food stipend, or any of the stipulations of the ketubah,  and if one moved in with a deaf-mute woman and she developed [speech], or a mentally incompetent woman and she recovered, she gets a ketubah and all ketubah stipuations, and her ketubah [is worth] a mana.
He raised up a deaf person or a simpleton [in marriage], and he wrote her [a ketuba worth] 100 mana, her ketuba stands in case she damages his property.
A deaf person or a simpleton that are raised up, even though the deaf person gained hearing or the simple person gained knowledge, there is no wifehood upon them, all of them. [If ] they wanted to stand [for marriage] after their recovery, they get a ketuba, and their ketuba is [worth] a mana. And if [there was] a court that officiated [the marriage of] the deaf person and they wrote her a ketuba [previously] on his property, she takes all that the court wrote for her [in the original ketuba], but the simpleton, there is no court [needed] for nullification of it (the original ketuba).
A minor, even from nine years and up, that his father marries off, [his wife] has no <i> Ketubah </i>; but if he had relations with her after he matured, she has no main part of the <i> Ketubah </i>, [which is] 200 [Zuz] for a virgin, and a <i> Maneh </i> for a widow; but the additional part that he writes her while a minor, she doesn't have, even if <i> Beis Din </i> married her. And even the main part [of the <i> Ketubah </i>] she can't collect by the power of the <i> Ketubah </i> document, but only by condition of <i> Beis Din </i>. Therefore, she can only collect from his current property (lit. sons of the free) and not from [property with] a lien that he sold since he was a minor. And so is the law with a convert that converted with his wife, and the only difference [between this case and the one above] is that in this one, her <i> Ketubah </i> is only a <i> Maneh </i> according to the Rambam.

Siman 68

Any virgin whose Ketubah is 200 [zuz] is subject to "the claim of virginity."  Any [virgin] whose Ketubah is 100 [zuz], or if she was not ordained to receive a Ketubah, is not subject to "the claim of virginity."  Any man who secludes himself with his betrothed before marriage is not granted "the claim of virginity."
If the practice of the locale was to appoint witnesses to examine [the bride and groom], so that they don't employ a practice of trickery, and it happened that they did not appoint witnesses, then he cannot lodge a claim about [her] virginity. 
Two signs distinguish a virgin [from a  non virgin]: first, she bleeds after her initial sexual intercourse; and second, it requires pressure to penetrate her during the first sexual intercourse.  A claim regarding [the absence of] blood is valid for both a young or older [virgin], but a claim that her [vaginal] passage was open is not valid for the older.
[In a case where] he claims and says, "I did not find her [to be] a virgin," and she says, "He did not [yet] have sexual relations with me and I am still a virgin," [then] we check her (over the opening of a barrel of wine (Tur)) or he secludes himself with her in front of witnesses and goes back and has intercourse.
If a man makes the 'claim of [the absence of] blood'; if she is from the Dorkati family (Rem"a: that is, "the cut off generation," the family of barren women, because of her the generation produces no children) she retains her former status.  If she is not, we inspect her for perhaps some grave illness caused her to have desiccated limbs, or perhaps she was malnourished.  We bring her to the bathhouse and salve her and provide her with food and drink before she has intercourse a second time, and then we see of she produces blood.  If she is not ill or famished, or the like, this is a legitimate claim....
If he claims to have found an "open door" [i.e. he questions her virginity], we say to him, "Perhaps you entered at an angle, or you were not sufficiently patient, and you therefore could not feel the pressure."  If he says, "That is not the case, I found an open door!" this is a legitimate claim if she has not yet reached full maturity.  Some authorities say that even if she is not yet fully matures he cannot claim to found an 'open door' if he found blood.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that only a [previously] married man can make the claim of an 'open door', but not a bachelor.  On the contrary, we flog [a bachelor] for making the claim; since he was not previously married he is not an expert in this matter.
When they said that his claim about the virginity is a [valid] claim, if he is a priest, she is forbidden to him, and if she is the wife of an Israelite, she is permitted to him, unless her father accepted for her a betrothal at less than three years and one day of age. gloss: And some say that that, that she is forbidden when she is a wife of an Israelite is only when she does not explain herself, but if she says, 'I was raped', she is believed (Tur). And some say as well, that [it is] only when she is mature in front of us, but when she is still a child, she is not forbidden (Bet Yosef in the name of RaShi, and so it seems from the words of the Ran). And see later section 178, article 3:
Even in cases where they said the he has a legitimate claim against her virginity, she only loses the primary Ketubah; she is still given the additional amount, unless we know with a clear proof that she had previously had intercourse [before she was betrothed], or if she admits that she had intercourse before she was betrothed, and she tricked him.  Therefore, he can make her take an oath while holding a sacred article, like anyone who must take an oath before collecting a  sum, and then she may collect the additional amount.  She should issue a generic edict of excommunication against anyone who made a false claim against her.  
When he claims he did not find her a virgin, if she says I am one who has been injured by a tree', she is believed, and her marriage document returns to a maneh (100). And he should announce plainly that a man did not have intercourse with her. And if she says, 'from the time that you rendered me betrothed, I was raped', behold she is believed and her marriage document is 200, as she was. And if he claims, 'perhaps before I rendered you betrothed, you were raped, or maybe after I rendered you betrothed, you had intercourse willingly, he announces plainly against anyone who claims falsely in order to make him liable of [paying] money. Whoever makes a claim about virginity and his claim is a [valid] claim, if he wants to keep her afterwards, he writes her a marriage document of a maneh (Tur)
Until when does he have a claim of virginity, if she is concealed (with him), immediately: if she was not concealed, even after 30 days:

Siman 69

When a man marries a woman, he is obligated to her in ten things, and he merits [is owed] from her in four things, even if it is not written.
These are the ten: her food, her clothing, her regular sexual relations, the core of her Ketubah, her healing, to redeem her if she is captured, her burial, that she be sustained from his possessions and live in his house after his death the whole time she is a widow, that her children be sustained after his death until they are engaged, that her sons from him inherit her ketubah more than their portion of inheritance that is with their siblings.
These are the four: the work of her hands, what she finds, her fruits, and her inheritance. 
The work of her hands corresponds to her sustenance.  Therefore, if she says "I will not be sustained, and I will not produce" we listen to her.  Rema: See further in Section 80. There are those that say that every woman who says "I will not be sustained, and I will not produce", the enactment is nullified, and she can't rescind and say "I will be sustained, and I will produce." (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ran who writes in the name of the Ra'ah) and there are those who disagree (Rabenu Yerucham chapter 23, halacha 5).  And all who are not sustained are not obligated to be clothed, which is in the category of sustenance (there in the Ran).  But the husband who says "I will not sustain her, and I will not take the work of her hands" - we don't listen to.  But, he can say put out [sell] the work of your hands for your food, and what isn't covered I will pay (Ran Ketubot Chapter 7)
If she says, "I will not give you fruits, and I don't want you to redeem me if I'm taken captive" we don't listen to her, so that she shouldn't be mixed in with the Kutim [non-Jews].  Rema: and also with inheritance and burial, neither can say I will not be bury and I will not inherit, in any case [the obligation remains] to bury and inherit.  
If the husband makes a condition that he will not be obligated in one of the things that he is obligated in, or the wife makes a condition that he will not acquire one of the things that he acquires, the condition stands.  Except for three things where conditions are not effective: her regular sexual relations, the core of her Ketubah, and her inheritance.  
That which is said, that conditions are not effective to remove her inheritance - this is when he makes the condition after the marriage or before the engagement, but when he makes the condition with her while they are engaged, it is effective.  Rema: Look farther on in section 92.  Our Rabbis of blessed memory said: "There is no fitting woman except one who does the will of her husband." (Hagot Maimoni chapter 15 in the name of Tanna d'bei Eliyahu)

Siman 70

How is he obligated in her sustenance?  She eats and drinks from what he eats and drinks.  If all the members of her family are accustomed to large [portions?], then he has to provide her with such.  If they are not all accustomed to large [portions?], then he is not obligated to provide her with such when she eats with him.  Rema: but when she is not with him he has to provide for her in the way she is accustomed to in her father's house. 
A husband who wants to give his wife food that is fitting to her and she'll eat and drink on her own, he is allowed, but only if she eats with him on the Sabbath eve.  Rema: There are those that disagree and reason that he can not tell her to eat on her own unless she does so of her own free will. (Tur in the name of the Jerusalem Talmud, and in the name of the Rosh. And Bet Yosef in the name of the majority of poskim.) This seems fitting to me.
How much sustenance is allocated to the wife? Bread for two meals per day and appetizers to eat with the bread, oil for eating and lighting candles, and a little wine to drink, if it was the custom in that place for women to drink wine. 

Rama: If she was breastfeeding, we give her wine (Tur).

Mechaber: For the Sabbath [she receives] 3 meals and meat or fish. Additionally he gives her 1 ma'ah (1/6 of a Tyrian dinar) every week for her needs.

Rama: And we give her wood for cooking her food (Ran chapter Af Al Pi in Ketuboth).

Mechaber: With what case are we dealing? With a poor man in Israel. But if he was rich, [her allocation is] according to his wealth.

Rama: If she scrimped and had left over from the sustenance, it belongs to the husband (Tur).

Mechaber: If he was extremely poor and could not afford to give her even the bread she needs, we force him to divorce her.

Rama: The ketuba monies remain as his debt until he finds [the wherewithal] to pay (Tur in the name of Rambam).  Some authorities say we do not force him to divorce since he does have [the money to give] (Ri in the name of Rabbenu Tam).  He who has food for only one day must give it to his wife or to eat it along with her (Tur in the name of haRamah - R. Meir Halevi).  Some authorities say additionally that he must hire himself out as a worker and to feed his wife (Tur in the name of R. Eliyah and Moharam in the name of the Rabbis in France). If he had lands, the woman has the right to take her sustenance from the usufruct of the land or the capital value of the land itself, or he has to sell them (Responsa Rashba chapter 890).
A man who married a woman who later became cognitively impaired, he must feed her and cover her medical costs.

Rama: See infra chapter 119 se'if 6 where he (Mechaber) writes the opposite.
If someone left the country by sea and his wife comes to court to sue for sustenance [that her husband was supposed to provide], for the first three months from the day he left they do not provide the sustenance for her, for the assumption is that a man does not leave his house empty [and we assume he will come back]. <i> Rem"a: But if she [waited] silently for longer [than three months] and then sued after that, they do not provide for her retroactively [from after three months], rather from the day she sued, even if the court had waited too long to judge (Ran Perek Shnei Dayanei Gezeirot). Some say that if he had left her after fighting, and he wanted to make her an aguna [a chained woman unable to remarry until her husband gives her a get] they provide it for her immediately, for then he certainly left his house empty (Mordechai Reish Dayanei Gezeirot).</i> From that point on, even if she doesn't have a ketubah in her hand, they provide sustenance for her, but they do not give her so much that she will adorn herself. If he has property, the court will go down to his property and sell it for her sustenance, even if they had not heard that he died. They do not calculate with her how much work she did [to get payment for it], until her husband comes [back], if he finds she did work, that is his. And so if it never gets to court, but she goes and sells it herself for sustenance, the sale is upheld, and she does not need an announcement [of her husband's death] or to swear [to his death], unless her husband comes back and sues, or until she comes to collect her ketubah worth after his death, but they try to convince her to only sell as much as she needs for sustenance.  
Whoever became mentally incapable, or deaf, they stipulate jewels for his wife, and they support his wife from his assets. 
Whoever went to the State of the Sea, and he deposited vessels in the hands of one, or he lent them to him, they take out of the hands of the holder of the deposit, for the food of his wife. gloss: Even if the husband commanded that they should not give (so wrote R"Y in the response that is brought in the Mordechai in ch. Dayanei G'zerot). And if the holder of the deposit returned it to the husband, after the wife took the husband to court, he has to pay her (ibid in the Mordechai). And when they remove from the deposit holder, they only remove for six months, even if the deposit holder wants, they do not delay the money of the husband longer (ibid). And they do not remove his assets that are in the hands of others any time there are free assets (Bet Yosef in the name of a reponsa of the RaShBa); but from the hands of the lender they do not remove until the end of his loan comes about.  
If her husband left [on a voyage] and she borrowed to pay for food, [her husband] must pay back [the loan].  Rem"a: The lender may demand payment form the woman, who then demands payment from the husband.  If the woman is not present, he may demand payment from the husband.  Still, if the woman forgave her husband [the debt], the lender gets nothing.   If the court allotted food for her and ordered someone to provide for her and to collect from the husband's property, if the husband dies [the executor] has no claim against her.  If [the court] plainly stated that he should lend to her, if the husband then died or is unable to pay back, and she received an inheritance from some other source, she must pay back.   If someone voluntarily provided her food from his own pocket, the husband need not repay him and he has lost his money.  Rem"a: There is no difference whether it is her father or anyone else who provided the food.  Still, if [the providers of the food] owed money to the husband, we deduct the amount from his debt.  If her father voluntarily provided for his daughter and his son-in-law, [the son-in-law] is only required to repay the amount for his own food, and not that of his wife.  If she did not borrow, and she sold property and provided for herself, she has no claim against him and she keeps the profits of her handiwork.
If the husband said to his wife before he left, "You make keep [the profits] from your handiwork to pay for your food," and she is silent - she may not demand food from him.
If she came to court and the court allotted food [from her husband's property], and the court then sold some property and gave her the proceeds, or she sold property herself, and the husband then came and said, "I left her food," she must swear while holding a sacred object that he did not leave [food] for her.  If she made no claim and she sold no property, but she instead borrowed money or postponed [payment], until he came and said, "I left food for her."  If she then says, "You did not leave food. I borrowed from someone and provided for myself," he must swear that he did leave food, and he is then exempt, and the debt remains with her.  Rem"a: The husband is not, however, believed to say that he has already provided for her for the future.  If she sold movable property and she said, "I sold it to [pay for] food" and he brings a claim and says, "I left you your food," she must swear that he did not leave it.  Rem"a: If he claims that she should have spent the profits from her handiwork on food, if she borrowed without the assistance of the court, and she is sufficiently productive that her handiwork does produce enough for large expenditures, even though she does not produce enough for trifles, his claim is valid.  If, however, the court allotted food for her, [his claim is only valid] if her handiwork yields enough profit for every expenditure.
If she did not make a claim [for her sustenance], nor did she borrow, nor sell property, but instead struggled day and night and made enough profit to sustain herself, she gets [no restitution from her husband].  If she produced some excess profits, she retains all of it.
A woman who leaves her husband's home and lives in another home , if she came because of a bad rumor about her in her neighborhood or a similar reason, he must support her if she claims support, but if she doesn't claim support, she relinquishes her former rights to support.

"R"ema": This is also the law if she had a fight with her husband and she no longer lives with him because of his preventing her from doing so, and she borrowed support, he has to pay it back; but if she is preventing herself from doing so, he doesn't have to pay it back since a husband is only obligated to pay support for his wife when she is living with him (Mordekhai, Perek Sheini Laws of Decrees and the Beit Yosef also wrote this in the name of the Ritva) And this is specifically when the husband is in the same city, but if her husband isn't in the same city there is no difference if she goes to her father's home. And if because of housework, if she is ill it is obvious  he is obligated to pay, since a sick person can't do work; and if she isn't ill, he reduces her support according to how much he needs to pay someone else to do housework, but she doesn't lose (all) her support because of this, only the work her hands can produce if she is a skilled worker (all this is in the Beit Yosef chapter 77 in the name of the responsa of the Rashba) And in a place he is obligated to support her, even if her husband proclaims that no one should lend her money, and he is in the same city but didn't bring her to court, and someone lent her, he is obligated to pay it back, since this far is not done, and in a case where she can't support herself from her own handiwork. (Responsa of the Rashba chapter 492)

Siman 71

A man is obligated to provide sustenance to his sons and daughters until they are 6 years of age, even if they own property that came to them through their mother's father's house. From then and on, we provide for them as a decree of the sages until they are adults. If he does not want to, we denounce him and shame him and antagonize him [until he does]. If he [still] does not want to, we denounce him in public and say, "So-and-so is cruel and does not want to provide for his children! He is worse than a non-kosher bird that [at least] provides for its chicks!" But we do not force him to provide them sustenance. When does this ruling apply? When there is no economic estimation. But if the estimate shows that there is enough money for them to get charity, we remove it from him by force, for charity purposes, and we feed them until they become adults. Rama: This is specifically for feeding daughters [as well], but we do not force him [with regards to how much he gives] to marry off his daughters. Even though it is a mitzva to give his daughters off to those who are appropriate for them, nevertheless we do not force it, except what he prefers to give, as long as he marries them off (Hagahot Mordechai in Kiddushin, and so writes TA"V Netiv 22).
If one travels out of the country [by boat] and leaves his children behind, they [the court] sell his property for income until the children are six. From the age of six and on, they do not feed them from his property. <i> Rem"a: Some say that is specifically when they had not started to feed them after they turned six, but if they had [already] started to feed them, they can feed them off of the [proceeds from selling] his property, for he surely would be fine with that (Mordechai Perek Neara in the name of R"Y). Some say if he had been evaluated [according to what he could give], they feed them in any case [whether they started at six or not] through it being charity (so is inferred from the Tur).</i>
One who went insane, they provide for his sons and daughters from [selling] his property, even if they are more than six years of age, until they become adults.
A [man] who has premarital sex with a single woman and impregnates her, if he admits the child is his, he is obligated to provide food for it.

Siman 72

One who vows [neder] against his wife from getting benefit from him, or that she cannot have the taste of a certain type [of food], or she made that vow and he upholds it [and doesn't void it], see Yoreh Deah Siman 235:3.

Siman 73

How [is he obligated] for her clothing? He must give her clothes fit for the rainy months and for the sunny months, according to the lowest value that a woman would wear when her husband is in the same region.
And if in that particular place a woman would not go out to the market until she has a veil covering her whole body, he must give her a veil whose value is lowest among veils.
And a woman shouldn't accustom herself to go out a lot, for it is not becoming of a woman to sit in street corners [Tur].
And among the clothes that he must give her is included her household vessels, and the stool she sits on. And what are these household vessels: A bed with a spread, and a mat or a mat to sit on, and utensils for food such as a dish and a pot and a jug and a flask, a lamb, a cup, a bottle and other such things.  
The residence that he rents for her, must be a house measuring four by four cubits, with a courtyard outside of it, and a toilet room is not considered part of this measure.
And we make him give her adornments like colorful clothing to put around her head and forehead, and eyeshadow (black coloring) and rouge (cotton that is colored with safflower and they apply it to the face of the bride so that she looks read, Arukh), and other such things.
To what does this refer? To a poor Jew. But a rich person must provide her with all of these things in accord with his wealth. 
If he was cheap in providing for her, even a poor Jew, we force him to divorce her. And the ketubah will be a debt over his head until he grows wealthier (Tur). And see above siman 70, seif 3. 
His sons and daughters up until the age of six, he must provide them with clothing and vessels and a place to live. But he doesn't provide for them according to his wealth, rather according to their needs alone.
Anyone who by law who must provide for someone else, whether he (the provider) is alive or dead, he must provide clothing, and household utensils and living quarters. 
And anyone who has his property sold by the court for sustenance, they sell for clothing, for household utensils and for living quarters.
The rule with regard to a husband, when his wife claims clothing, vessels and rent money is as the rule with regard to claiming sustenance in general: If he says, I gave, and she says: He didn't give.
One who gave his wife's clothing as a pledge, she cannot take it from him without giving him anything. See below, siman 90. 

Siman 74

If he placed her under a vow not to adorn herself, and conditioned it on intercourse, saying, "Konam (a term similar to consecration indicating that an item is forbidden by vow) the pleasure of intercourse with you is forbidden to me if you adorn yourself," she should adorn herself immediately thereby interdicting intercourse, and he maintains the marriage for 7 days, and then divorces her, and must pay the ketubah.  Some authorities say that if he placed her under a vow not to adorn herself, poor wives (who may not have other sources of food) are maintained for one year, but more than one year he should either obtain annulment of the vow or divorce with payment of ketubah. With rich women, he should maintain them for 1 month, but more than this he should either obtain annulment of the vow or divorce with payment of ketubah. 
[If] she vowed to not wear jewelry, or she says, "A <i> Konam </i> vow upon me [that I can't have benefit from] your relations if I wear jewelry", and he heard and did not annul it, he must divorce her and give her [the value] of her <i> Ketubah </i>. And see further distinctions in these laws in <i> Yoreh Dei'ah Siman </i> 235
If the husband forbade the neighbors utensils on himself, or his utensils on his neighbors, so that they should not borrow them or he should not lend to them, or if he she said, "A <i> Konam </i> vow upon me [that I can't get benefit from] your relations if I borrow vessels from my neighbors or  lend them my vessels", and he heard and established [the vow], he must divorce her and give her [the value of] her <i> Ketubah </i>. And if he said, "A <i> Konam </i> vow upon me [that I can't get benefit from] your relations if you borrow vessels from them or you [lend] to them, [since] it is impossible that she will not borrow from them or [lend] to them, and behold she is forbidden to him immediately, and he must divorce her after seven days and give her [the value of] her <i> Ketuba </i>. And if she forbade the neighbors vessels on herself [through a vow] so that she would not borrow from them, or she forbade her husband's vessels on her so that she would not be able to borrow them, so that she should not increase their good, or she vowed to not weave nice clothing for his children, and he is not able to annul it because this is not a matter between him and her, and [therefore] she is forbidden from weaving and borrowing and lending vessels, she must be divorced without a <i> Ketuba </i>, because she has increased a bad reputation among his neighbors.
If she took a vow not to go to her father's house, and she made the vow dependent on sex, in that she said: Konam will be the sex that you have with me if I go to my father's house; For if she had not made it dependent on sex but rather had said: Konam is my father's house to me, he could not annul the vow, but since she made it dependent on sex he can annul.
And if he hears and he doesn't annul, he must divorce her immediately and give her the ketubah. And if he says: Konam the sex that you have with me if you go to your father's house, if the vow is for more than a month and he lives in the same town, or more than the time to the next festival and he lives in another town, he may uphold the vow for seven days and then he must divorce her and give her the ketubah.
If she vowed and said: Konam is enjoyment of sex with you if I go to a house of mourning or to a house of feasting, and he heard and did not interrupt, he must divorce her immediately and give her the ketubah.
If he vows saying I won't have any benefit from your service to me if you leave, after seven days he divorces her and pays her wedding contract payment. And if he claims: I returned to her because there are promiscuous people there, if that is established to be true there, then he is believed, and if not, he isn't believed
If he banned her from going to the bathhouse for one week in the city, or for two weeks in the villages; that she not wear shoes for three days in the villages, or for 24 hours in the city (Rem"a: he must release his vow or) divorce her and grant her dower.
If he made a condition for her that she should not go to the washhouse, in the cities, one week, and in the villages, two weeks; that she should not wear a shoe, in the village, three days, and in the cities, for a [24 hour] time. More than this (he should annul his condition or) he should remove her and give her the [value of her] marriage document. 
When someone says to his wife, "I do not want your father, your mother, your brother, or your sister to come to my house," they listen to him. It will be [the wife] who goes when an event happens to them. She will go to her father's house once a month and on every festival. They will not enter her house unless something happens to her like an illness or birth.
When she says, "I do not want your father, your mother, your brother, or your sister to come to my house, and I will not live in with them in the same courtyard since they are bad to me and torment me," they listen to her. [Rem'a: Only when it appears to the court that there is something to what she says, since they are bad to her they will cause strife between her and her husband. If this is not the case, they do not listen to her for the home is not hers, rather it belongs to the husband. The custom is to place a trustworthy man or woman among them, and she will live them until it becomes clear who causes the strife.]
When a man says, "I will not live on this block since the people are bad, there are robbers, or that there are gentiles in my neighborhood, and I am afraid of them," they listen to him, even though it is not known for robberies. Even if the lodging is hers, they take her from it.
If she says this, even if he says, "I am not afraid of them," they listen to her. [A man who hits his wife or she curses him, see the law further on in siman 145.]

Siman 75

There are three regions in the land of Israel distinguished one from the other for matters of marriage: Judea, the other side of the Jordan and the Galilee. And every settled area is its own land, for instance the land of Canaan, Egypt and Yemen which all have different languages (Muharam, siman 117). That if one is from one of these lands and he marries a woman from another land, we force her and she goes to his land, or she can be divorced without receiving her ketubah or the additional money, for he married her with this intent, even if he didn't make it explicit. But he cannot force her to go from a city to a smaller town or vice versa in the Galilee, even if he stipulated with her to go from the Galilee to Judea (Ran, ch. 2, dayane gezerot, and the same in all such cases). 
But if one marries a woman in one of the lands and he is from that land, he cannot force her to go with him to another land, but he can force her to go from one state to another state, or from one village to another village in the same land, but he can't force her to go from a state to a village or from a village to a state. 
Hagah: There are those who say that if both were from the same land and he married her elsewhere she can force him to go with him to her land, even from a village to a state or vice versa (Tur in the name of Rabbenu Tam). 
But if both were from the same land and he married her elsewhere neither can force the other to go from a state to a village or vice versa. But from one state to another or one village to another, the wife can force him to go with her to her place since they are equal (ibid).
If he lived with her in a city and he hadn't settled there and he went with her to her city by happenstance, and he didn't settle there, he can force her to go back (Ribash, siman 88). 
And there are those who say that if he can't make a living and provide for himself we force his wife to go with him where he wants (Terumat Hadeshen, siman 216).
And there are those who disagree (Bet Yosef, and also Ribash, siman 81).
One who is from one state and he has a wife there and he marries a woman from another state, she must go with him to his city, for he certainly married her in order for her to return to his home (Bet Yosef, in the name of the Rashbatz).
See below 154, seif 9, more on these laws.  
When he brings her from province to province or from village to village, he may not take her from nice lodgings to bad or from bad to good. Also, he may not bring her from a place that is mostly Jews to a place that is mostly non-Jews. In any case, he may take her out of a place that is mostly non-Jews to a place that is mostly Jews. [Rema: He is unable to take her from a place with a good government to a place with a bad government. Any place that he can take her from--this is after the marriage. If it is before the marriage, he is unable to take her and he needs to sustain her from her place unless it was stipulated beforehand. If it were stipulated beforehand, it is nothing [to take her]. How is this? If there are reasons for what he is doing, his wife must follow after him.
What is this talking about? When going from outside the land to outside the land, or from the land of Israel to the land of Israel. But from outside the land to the land of Israel, they force her to go up even if it is from a nice lodging to poor lodgings, even if it is to a place that has mostly Jews to a place that has mostly non-Jews. They do not take her from the land of Israel to outside the land even if it is from poor lodgings to nice lodgings and even if it is from a place that has mostly non-Jews to a place that has mostly Jews.
If he proposes to ascend to Eretz Yisrael and she does not want to, he must divorce her without her dower. Rem"a: But she keeps her milog assets, and takes extant tzon barzel assets; if they are no longer extant, then if he ruined them, he need not repay the tzon barzel assets, but must pay the milog assets. If they were stolen or lost, she has no claim on the milog assets, but he must repay the tzon barzel assets (Mordechai at the end of Ketubot, citing Maharam). Her forfeiture of the dower applies only as long ashe remains in Eretz Yisrael. However, if he returns to settle in the Diaspora after a a few years, he must pay the dower to her or her inheritors (ibid.).

If she proposes ascending [to Eretz Yisrael] and he does not want to, he must divorce her and give her dower. The same applies for anyplace in Eretz Yisrael to Jerusalem. Anyone may initiate ascent to Eretz Yisrael, and no one may compel departure; anyone may initiate ascent to Jerusalem, and no one may compel departure.


There is one who says, that which we compel to go up to the land of Israel, that's when it's possible without danger. Therefore, from the end of the West until Noe Amon we don't compel to go up, and from Noe Amon and upwards, we compel to go up by the way of the dry land, and also the way of the sea during the "days of sun" (summer), if there are no robbers.

Siman 76

How does one fulfill his conjugal obligation? Every man is obligated to perform his marital duties according to his strength and according to his profession.  Peddlers are obligated every night.
The laborers, if their work was in the city, twice a week; and if their work was in a different city, once a week. And there are those who say that if they were not sleeping the entire night in their homes, their period is eight days. The donkey drivers, once a week. The camel drivers, once every thirty days. The sailors, once every six months. Sages, their period is once a week. And the way of sages is to have sex from the night of Shabbat to the night of Shabbat.
In regard to what are we talking about, in regards to one whose body is healthy and is able to fulfill the fixed season, but one who is not healthy is only obligated according to what they estimate that he is able to fulfill.
Each person is obligated to visit his wife on the night of her dipping [into the mikvah], and at the time that he goes on the way.
A woman may forbid [delay] her husband from going for merchant but to a close place, so he won't avoid he period; and he won't leave but [unless] in her permission. And even if she gives him permission, he shouldn't be long, only a month out and a month in his house (Tur &amp; the Rosh) and also she can [has to] forbid him from going from short [close by] period jobs to long [far] period jobs, like a donkey driver wishing to become a camel driver, or camel driver to become a sailor. And scholars [Talmidey Hachamim] leaving for Talmud Torah (even) without their wives permission for two and three years. And [al]so a hiker who became a scholar, his wife can't forbid (him). And if she gives him permission, a scholar can go with however-much she gives him permission (Tur in the name the Ravad)
The woman who allows her husband to deny her sex, this is permitted. When does this apply?  [Only] when he has [already] fulfilled the commandment of propagation.  If he has not fulfilled it, he must have intercourse at each required time until he fulfills it.  
A man can marry many women, even 100, whether all at once or one after another, and his wife cannot prevent [it], as long as he can give the appropriate [amount of] food, clothing and "time" (marital relations) to each one; and he can't force them to live in one courtyard, rather each one for herself. And how much is her "time" (marital relations) - according to the number. How so? A worker who has two wives, this one has "time" once a week and this one has "time" once a week. If he has four wives, it comes out that the "time" of each one is once every two weeks; and similarly if he was a sailor and he has four wives, the "time" for each one of them would be once in two years. Therefore, the Rabbis commanded that a person shouldn't marry more than 4 wives, even if he has a lot of money, so that they get their "time" once a month.
In what case are these things said? In a place where they are accustomed to marry two and three women. But in a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman, he is not permitted to marry another woman in addition to his wife without her permission, and certainly if he stipulated in her Ketuba (marriage contract) that he would not marry another woman in addition to her. And see earlier Siman 1. 
If a man made an vow forbidding his wife to have intercourse with him, whether he made the oath without specifying, or if it was for a period of seven days or more, he must stay married to her for seven days, and then divorce her and give her her Ketubah.  [this is true] even if he is a merchant marine who is only obligated in conjugal duties every six months.
What is nature of this vow?  He said, "The pleasure of your intercourse is forbidden for me."  If, however, he said, "The pleasure of my intercourse is forbidden for you" or if he swears that he will not have intercourse with her, the oath is not valid. Rem"a: Still, if he took the vow with her permission, it is valid.  He may seclude himself with her even though he may not have intercourse  with her.
It is forbidden for a man to withhold conjugal duties from his wife.  If he did so with the intent of causing her pain he has transgressed the prohibition of "Do not reduce her conjugal obligation" (Ex. 21:10) .  If he is ill or weakened and he is unable to have intercourse, he waits six months until he becomes healthy, for this is longest period of conjugal duties.  After that period he must either get her permission or divorce her and pay the Ketubah.
If a woman took a vow of personal denial, or some matter that is pertinent to the relationship with her husband, such that he may annul it, and he said to her, "I will annul your vow on the condition that you tell such-and-such about the silly things we say about intercourse," or "on the condition that you turn over after intercourse to prevent pregnancy," or "on the condition that you act like a fool, for example, that you fill ten jugs of water and pour them into the refuse pile," or anything similar, he must divorce her immediately and pay the Ketubah.
If a man says, "I cannot lie with her unless we are both clothed," he must divorce her and pay the Ketubah.  This is even more true if he refuses to be intimate with her at all.  Rem"a: Similarly, if she says, "I cannot lie with him unless we are both clothed," she is divorced without receiving the Ketubah.

Siman 77

A man who rebels against his wife and says, "I will feed and support her, but will not have sexual relations with her because I hate her," we add the value of 36 barleycorns of silver to her ketuba (marriage contract) each week, and he remains without relations as long as she is willing to wait. Even though her ketuba amount continues to grow, he is still transgressing a negative commandment, as it says, "...he shall not withhold" (Exodus 21:10). If she so desires, court can force him to divorce her immediately and to give her the ketuba money.    Note: Some authorities say that if he wants to divorce her immediately and give her ketuba, we do not add on to the ketuba (so it appears in Rambam Hilchot Ishut chapter 14). It seems to me that in such a case he also does not transgress the negative commandment of "...he shall not withhold" (Exodus 21:10). 
A woman who refused to have sexual relations with her husband is called "rebellious"/moredet; she is asked why she rebelled. If she says: I despise him and cannot knowingly have sex with him--Rem"a: and specifically seeks a get without her dower--but if she says: he should give me a get and my dower, we suspect that she has her eyes on another, she has the status of a moredet who wishes to torment him (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Ran; Rashi's commentary on the Talmud)--if the husband wishes to divorce her, she does not receive her dower at all. She may take her extant worn clothes, whether they are among the assets that she brought [into the marriage] for her husband and he is responsible for them, or whether they are milog assets for which he is responsible; she takes nothing of her husband's. Even if she took the shoes on her feet or the kerchief on her head, she removes them and gives them to him. Anything he gave her as a gift, she returns. Some say that she does not even get the tzon barzel assets, except for whatever she seized. And some say that she does not even get the milog assets except for whatever she seized (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Ran in the name of Rashba). If she rebelled against her husband in order to torment him, and says: "I am tormenting him thus because he did such-and-such to me," or "because he cursed me," or "because he fought with me," or the like, we send her away from the court and tell her: "Know that if you continue your rebelliousness, you will lose even the 100 mana of your dower." Then they make proclamations about her every day in the synagogues and study halls for four weeks--Rem"a: some say that the proclamations need not be made every day, but only on Shabbat (Ran and Hagahot Maimuniyot, and it is also implied by Tur), and this seems to be the predominant opinion--saying: "This woman so-and-so rebelled against her husband." After the proclamation she is sent to the court a second time: "If you continue your rebellion, you will lose your dower." If she continued rebelling and did not return, she is advised that she will lose her dower, and will not have any dower at all. She is not granted a get until 12 months have passed, and she gets no alimony all 12 months--Rema: even if she is pregnant (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Rashba); yet what she produces belongs to her, though he gets usufruct (Tur).  If she dies before receiving the get, her husband inherits her--Rem"a and is obligated to redeem her [if she is captured] and bury her (Tur). After 12 months, her husband has no duties toward her, nor she to her husband. Since she caused the loss of her dower, she gets none of her prenuptial stipulations [for rights within the marriage], since he may divorce her without giving the dower, but retains her at his will (Divrei Harav, also implies by Maharin no. 20).  This is the routine prescribed if she rebelled in order to torment him.  Rem"a: After 12 months, it does not matter if she returns to him. Rather, she has lost her dower, and if he wishes to retain her, he must write another. However, within 12 months she may return to him and is entitled to her dower. If he dies within the 12 months, she gets her dower from his inheritors (Ran on Ketubot ch. 5). If he wishes to divorce her within the 12 months, he gives her the tzon barzel assets, her dower, and everything that he stipulated to give her (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Rashba). Some say that nowadays, since one may not marry two wives, we do not wait twelve months if he wishes to divorce her. If she does not want to divorce, we allow him to marry another woman (Mordechai at the end of Ketubot ch. 5, citing Raavan). Some disagree, stating that he must not be permitted to marry a second woman (ibid. in the glosses; Responsa Rashba no. 860; Maharik no. 63). This is the predominant position. This all applies to a married woman. A betrothed woman, however, who rebels against her husband and refuses to move into his home may be divorced against her will. Alternatively, he may marry another woman, and is given permission to do so (ibid.). It seems to me that this all applies within 12 months. After 12 months, if he wishes to divorce her, she must accept the get even against her will, or else he is permitted to marry another woman, for a woman does not have the power to chain him forever. This seems correct to be the correct ruling. Some say that even within 12 months, if he transgressed and married another woman due to [the first wife's] rebelliousness, we do not compel him to divorce [the second woman] (Maharik no. 29).  Even if she was a menstruant or ill, and thus unavailable for sexual relations--Rem"a: and there is no difference whether she began her rebellion before or after she took ill (Ran on Ketubot ch. 5; also implied by Mordechai citing Raavyah and by Hagahot Alfasi), but some disagree (idib., citing Maharam)--or even if her husband was a seaman with a six-month season, and even if he has another wife. Similarly, a betrothed woman whose time came to consummate that marriage, and she rebelled to torment him and did not consummate, is considered sexually rebellious. Some say that even a sister-in-law who does not wish to consummate levirate marriage in order to torment [the brother-in-law] is subject to this prescription.
This rebellious woman, when she is divorced after 12 months without her dower, she must return everything that belongs to the husband. However, if she seized assets that she brought into the marriage and her extant worn clothes, we do not confiscate them from her. Rem"a: She takes real estate tzon barzel assets (Tur).  Similarly, if anything that has been lost of her assets for which the husband is responsible, he need not repay her anything.  Rem"a: This all applies to tzon barzel assets. But milog assets are hers. She owns them and takes them (Tur). Some say that all this applies when she gives no rationale or excuse for why she claims to despise him. However, when she gives a rationale for her words, for example, she says that he acts improperly, wastes his money, or the like, then we rule in accordance with the enactment of the Geonim (Tur citing Maharam of Rotherburg). This is called "dina de-metivta": The husband must return everything that she brought him in her dowry, i.e., tzon barzel assets if they are extant and fit for their initial use; and certainly if they were stolen or lost the husband must pay for it all. Milog assets are hers if they or something that exists by virtue of them is extant, and she takes them. But if they are entirely gone, the husband need not repay (Dina De-mitivta; Tur citing Rif). However, she does not take anything he gave her or contracted to give her, and even if she seized it she must return it (Mordechai, Ketubot ch. 5). He is not compelled to divorce, nor is she compelled to remain with him (Tur citing Responsa Maharam). If he acted improperly, e.g., he betrothed her with lies and guile, we compel him to divorce (Rosh no. 35). Some further say that we impose excommunication (Tur, citing Maharam). If people coached her to rebel, or if she did so out of anger or strife, or to take his money, then even if she seized her own assets, we confiscate them from her and return them to her husband (Mordechai, Ketubot ch. 5). It makes no difference whether or not she seized them unless she claims to despise him but does not give a substantiated rationale, though if she gave a rationale and it is not deceitful the court may decide this at their discretion (Mahari Weil no. 20). They may administer an oath to ascertain the truth of her claim to despise him (ibid.), and this is the proper ruling. As long as he has not given her a get, he has no hold or claim on her, but she should nevertheless not give what is hers to others, and he may even protest, since if she dies he inherits her (ibid.). Even in a case where we compel him to divorce his rebellious wife, if she dies before he divorces her, he inherits her, for her inheritance is only released by divorce (Tur citing a Gaon). If her father seized some of the dowry she brought for her husband, it is as effective as if she had seized it herself (Mordechai on Ketubot ch. 5 citing Responsa Maharam; Hagahot citing Responsa Maharam). The clothing brought by the bride do not have the status of tzon barzel assets. Tzon barzel assets are only the appraised assets that the woman brings [into the marriage] for her husband (Tur citing Rosh).
A man and woman come before the court. He say: She rebelliously refuses sexual intercourse. And she says: Not so; he and I are together in the manner of the whole world. Similarly, if she claims that he rebelliously refuses sexual intercourse, and he says: Not so. She and I are together in the manner of the whole world: we first excommunicate the one who rebels and does not admit it in court. Afterward, if there was no admission, we say to them: seclude yourselves in the presence of witnesses. If they secluded themselves and remain with their claims, we ask the defendant and we make a compromise under the force of law.
If a betrothed woman does not wish to marry, claiming she despises him, her father is not obligated to give [the husband] what he had agreed to give him as her dowry.

Siman 78

How is she redeemed? If she is taken captive, he is obligated to redeem her, and is not permitted to say to her: Here is your divorce document and your ketubah, and redeem yourself. And even if he says: I will not redeem you and I will not take the fruits [produced by your property], we do not listen to him, but rather he is obligated to redeem her.
A husband is not obligated to redeem his wife for more than her value, rather [he redeems her] for what she is worth, like all captives. Rem"a: And some say that a wife is equated with his body, and he is able to redeem her with all that he has. (<i>Tur</i> and the <i>Rosh</i> in the name of the <i>Rimah</i> brought in the <i>Beit Yoseif</i>)
If the ransom was higher than her dower, and so he says: "I hereby divorce her, and here is her dower. She may go redeem herself," we do not heed him. Rather we compel him to redeem her, even if her ransom was up to ten times the value of her dower, and even if he only has enough to redeem her. When does this apply? The first time. But if he redeemed her and she was captured a second time, he may divorce her and give her dower to her, and she redeems herself. Rem"a: And regardless, he is not obligated to redeem her a second time (Beit Yosef).
If one's wife was captured while he is abroad, the court enters his property, sells it at auction, and redeems her as the husband redeems her. Rem"a: If he and his wife are both in captivity, see Yoreh De'ah no. 252.
If one banned his wife with a vow that causes him to be obligated to divorce her and pay her dower, and she is captured after he took the vow, he is not obligated to redeem her, for from the moment he vowed he became obligated to divorce her and pay her dower.
If a Kohen's wife is taken captive, even though she becomes forbidden to him, since before this time she was permitted he must redeem her and return her to her father's house.  Even if he is in another city [from her father], he must care for her until he returns her to her country, and [then] he divorces her and pays the full Ketubah.  If her husband is an Israelite, such that the captive woman is permitted to him, he takes her back as his wife as she was before, and if he wishes he may divorce her later and giver her her Ketubah.  Rem"a: A captive woman who is prohibited even to her Israelite husband, that is, in a case where we are concerned that she willingly submitted to intercourse, as is explained in (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 78:7) - her husband is not obligated to redeem her.
A woman who was [previously] prohibited to her husband by a negative precept in the Torah, who is then taken captive, poses no obligation for her husband to redeem her.  He instead gives her her Ketubah and she redeems herself.  Rem"a: He must repay any profits that he consumed from her property.
He is only obligated to redeem her [from captivity] in his lifetime. But his widow cannot be redeemed through his property. Even were she captured in his lifetime, but he died before he could redeem her, the inheritors are not obligated to redeem her, even the yibbum she is tied to. Rather, she should be redeemed on her own, or she can collect her ketubah and redeem herself. 

Siman 79

How is he required to pay for her healing? If she became ill, he must heal her (pay her medical costs), whether healing that has a determinate cost or an indeterminate cost.  But his widow is not healed from his estate except for healing which has no determinate cost, which is similar to food [payments].
If the heirs wish to specify a cost with the doctor, such that [her healing] will have a determinate cost and they will be relieved of payment, they are permitted to do so.
If a woman contracts a lasting disease, he is able to say to her that the <i> ketuba </i> can be assumed if she heals herself or the <i> ketuba </i> can be absolved and give her the <i> ketuba </i>, but this is not proper behavior because it is not <i> derech eretz </i>.

Siman 80

The product of her work belongs to her husband. How [does this work?] All according to local practice. In a place where they [the women] tend to weave, she weaves. ... to embroider, she embroiders. ... to spin wool or linen, she spins. And if the way of the women of the city wasn't to do any of these jobs, he can only compel her to spin the wool. If she pushed herself and made more than enough for herself, the excess [belongs] to her husband. Rem"a: And this is only when he gives her a *ma'ah* of silver each week, as was explained above, in Siman 70. And the woman can say, "I will take the *ma'ah* of silver, and I won't give the excess," but the husband cannot say this. (Tur in the name of the Rem"a, and the Ra"n wrote similarly [on] the chapter [of Talmud Ketubot called] "Even so," and the She'iltot wrote similarly [on] *Parashat Mishpatim*.)
If he had a lot of money, even if she had many maidservants, she may not sit idle without work, as idleness brings [one] to  immorality. But we do not compel her to do work all day long; rather, in accordance with the abundance of money, she reduces working.
One who imposes a vow on his wife that she will not do work, he [must] divorce her and pay her *ketubah* [marriage contract], as idleness brings one to immorality.
And so, every wife washes her husbands, face, hands, and feet for him, and pours him his cup, and makes his bed for him. And there are those who say that she is obligated to make all the beds in the house (The Maggid Mishneh on Chapter 21 and the Ra"n on the chapter [of Talmud Ketubot] called "Even though"). And she stands and serves before her husband, for example, giving him water or a vessel or taking it from him, and things like this, but she does not stand and serve before his father or before his so. And there are those  that say that this is only when they are not dependent on her husband's table (Beit Yoseif in the name of the Ra"n on the chapter [of Talmud Ketubot] called "Even though").
These labors, she does personally, and even if she has many maidservants, they do not do these labors for the husband - only his wife. And there is a disagreement regarding making the bed - see below in Sa'if 8.
There are labors that the woman does for her husband when they are paupers. These are they: she grinds, bakes, launders, cooks, breastfeeds her son, and puts straw before his animal but not before his cattle. Comment: [If] her son died, she is not obliged to breastfeed for pay and give him the pay. Likewise, his son from another wife -- she is not obliged to breastfeed him (Ran, chapter Af Al Pi).
[If] she brought [into the marriage] for him a single slavewoman or property suitable for acquiring, from it, a single slavewoman -- or if he had money sufficient to buy from it a single slavewoman -- she doesn't grind, nor bake, nor launder, nor place straw before his animal.
[If] she brought [into the marriage] for him two slavewomen, or property suitable for acquiring, from it, two slavewomen, or [if] he had two slavewomen or was fit to acquire two slavewomen, [then] she doesn't cook and doesn't breastfeed her son. Comment: [If] she brought in for him three slavewomen, or money, or [if] he has money [with which] he can acquire or hire [them], [then] she doesn't make the beds, except his bed (Ran in the name of "some explain"). Some say she doesn't make even his bed except by spreading sheets; and she organizes his bed for him, as that is a way of affection, and every woman shall do this even if she has a number of slavewomen (Tur).
[If] she says he is fit to purchase or hire a slavewoman and he says he's not fit [to], the burden of proof is upon her.
We do not obligate her in all these labors unless it is the way of his family and her family to do them.
All the time she is breastfeeding his son, we deduct for her from her handiwork; and we add wine and things that are good for milk to her sustenance. [If] they didn't add for her, she must eat of her own if she has (Tur).
If they allocated sustenance appropriate for her, but she desires to eat more or to eat different foods, one authority say that the husband cannot withhold this, for fear of harming the child, for the discomfort of her body takes precedence, but another authority says that he may withhold. 
If she gave birth to twins, we do not force her to breastfeed both, rather she feeds one, and the husband hires a wet nurse to feed the second.  Note: Some authorities say that she feeds both (Tur in the name of Rosh).
If she wanted to feed her friend's son along with her own son, the husband may prevent this.  Note: Even with regards to her son from another man the husband may prevent this.
Any woman who refuses to do her required work is forced to do these tasks. hagah: and he does not have to feed her (buy her food) until she does these things. Bet din will even sell the rights of her ketubah (which is a commodity and sell-able) in order to use the profits of the sale to hire a maid. some people say that we force her with a whip. All this applies if she said expressed that she wants to be supported while doing no tasks. But, if she said that she will forgo her support from her husband in exchange for not doing her tasks, she is allowed to do so. This is similar to what we said before in siman 69. Some say, that even if she says she will forgo her support for her work, she still needs to do household work. and for these types of chores we force her, even if she says she will give up her husband's support (food).
If a person claims that his wife is not doing ( her duties ?) and she claims that she is not abstaining from doing, then a woman or neighbors are places among them ( to determine the validity of the claim).
A woman who breaks dishes while working in her own house is exempt ( of fine/ retribution).
A man who made a condition with his wife that he would not be responsible for her sustenance and similarly she would not be required to hand over the fruits of her labor, if he subsequently desired to do so and agreed to be responsible for her sustenance (Rama: as a gift), he does not [automatically] receive the fruits of her labor.  Rama: A woman who was silent and did not claim her sustenance or [weekly allowance of] one ma'ah silver coin, we presume that she retains the rights to her [basic] labor along with any extra labor, and we do not say that she relinquished her rights to her labor (Ran chapter Af Al Pi). But that which is not sufficient for her (i.e. she did not earn enough to satisfy her needs), the husband is not required to pay, for she certainly relinquished her rights.  A woman who left her husband's house due to a squabble, and does not want to return to his house until he calls her back, she does not lose her sustenance, for she is embarrassed to return after she left without his permission and he does not show her [a kind] face, and if he were to come to her, she would not deny him anything. But if she does not want to return to him until he repays her loans (that she borrowed to purchase food), she thereby loses support, for she has a status of a rebellious wife, and every rebellious wife has some complaint (rather she should first return and then settle accounts). Every wife has rights to sustenance even if she does not have possession of her ketuba, and he is not believed with a claim that she relinquished her rights to him, except with clear proof. And even with respect to [unpaid] support in the past, if he does not argue [that he was not required to pay] we do not argue for him, and he must swear that she relinquished her rights [to sustenance] (All this is in Responsa Rashba, cited in Beit Yosef chapter 77).

Siman 81

If one sanctifies the product of his wife's hands, she (produces and) consumes, and the excess is non-holy. If he said to her, "Your hands shall be sanctified to their Maker," all of the product of her hands is sanctified.
And there are those who say that it is not sanctified, for she is able to say, "I won't be fed, and I won't produce" (the Ra"n in chapter "Even Though," and so is implied in the language of the Tur).
If a woman said, "My hands shall be sanctified to their Maker," or if she vowed that she would not benefit from the product of her hands, [her husband] is not forbidden from the product of her hands, because her hands are beholden to him. But he needs to annul [the vow] for her, just in case he divorces her, and she becomes forbidden to return to him.

Siman 82

If a woman vowed that she would not nurse her child, we compel her and she nurses the child until [the baby] is 24 months old, whether [the baby] is male or female.
If she says: "I am breastfeeding my child, but [the husband] does not want [her to breastfeed]," we listen to her. 
If she was so poor that she was required to breastfeed her child, and [her husband] was rich enough that he considered it  appropriate for his wife not to breastfeed: if she is willing, he hires a wet nurse or buys a maidservant, since she should be elevated [in status] with him and she should not bring him down [in status]. 
If she says: it's appropriate to hire or buy a maidservant, and he says: it is not appropriate, [the burden] is on her to bring proof.
When a woman is divorced, we do not compel her to breastfeed her child, unless she wants to, in which case [her husband] pays her hire [as a wet nurse] and she breastfeeds [the baby]; and if she does not want to, she gives him his child and he raises [the baby].   Which situations are we talking about? That she may [choose  to] not breastfeed it until it [is old enough that it] recognizes her, but if it recognizes her (Rem"a: and does not want to breastfeed from another), even if it is blind, we do not separate it [from her], because of danger to the infant, but rather we compel her and she breastfeeds it until it is 24 months old.   Rem"a: And he pays her the hire of breastfeeding. And some say that even another woman, if she breastfeeds a baby until it [is old enough that it] recognizes her, we compel her [to continue] and she nurses it for hire, because of danger to the infant. And some say that this situation where a divorcee is not obligated to breastfeed if [the baby] does not recognize her, this is when another wet nurse is brought in and is available for hire, but if [the husband] does not have one, he compels her and she breastfeeds [the baby]; but if [the wife] already hired herself out to others [as a wet nurse], and that infant recognizes her, we do not force that infant [to stop breastfeeding from her] on account of her own child, rather the court hires a different wet nurse for her child. 
A divorcee is not provided food, even if she is breastfeeding her child, but he gives her, in addition to her hire, things that the child will need, [such as] clothes and food and drinks and ointment and things like that, but a pregnant [divorcee] gets nothing. 
When the months are over and [the child] is weaned, if the divorcee wants her child to be with her, we do not separate it from her until it is six full years old, but we compel the father and he provides food while [the child] is with its mother; and after six years the father may say: "if [the child] is not with me I will not provide food." And the daughter is with her mother forever, even after six years.   How, if the father was wealthy enough to give tzedakah, we take from him against his will what is appropriate for her, and we feed her while she is with her mother; and even if the mother is married to another, the girl's father feeds her because of [the obligation of] tzedakah while her daughter is with her, until the father dies and she is fed after that from his possessions according to the stipulations of the marriage contract, while she is with her mother.   Rem"a: And specifically when it seems to the court that the daughter should be with her mother, but if seems to them that it would be better for her to stay in her father's house, the mother cannot compel [her daughter] to be with her. If the mother dies, the maternal grandmother cannot compel the children to be with her. 
If the mother did not want her children to be with her after they were weaned, whether male or female, that is her prerogative, and she may give them to their father, or send them to the [care of] the community if they do not have a father, and the community raises them, whether male or female. 

Siman 83

One who injures a married woman is obligated for time lost at work and for healing, to be paid to her husband. And [the compensation] for pain is hers.
And the [compensation] for embarrassment and damages, if it was in a revealed [part of her body] for instance he injured her face or neck, or hand or arms, a third is hers and two thirds goes to her husband. But if it was in a concealed [part] of her body, a third is her husband's and two thirds is hers. 
To her husband, he gives immediately. To the wife, land should be purchased and the husbands eats the produce.
She is not allowed to forgive payment, neither for his portion, nor hers. And if she does forgive, her forgiving is not valid. And in any case he can't demand her share without her permission.
To what does this refer? When others injure her. But if a husband injures his wife, he must pay her immediately all of the damages, all of the embarrassment and pain, and it is all hers, and the husband has no rights to the fruit.
And if she wants to give the money to others, she may. And the husband heals her as he heals all her wounds.
Hagah: If any man insulted her with words, even though one who insults with words is exempt, if they appeased her with money (on his own accord) if he insulted her in public, the husband receives two portions and she receives one. And if in private, she receives two portions and he receives one. [Tur]
One who damages his wife through intercourse is obligated for her damages.

Siman 84

That which a woman finds, belongs to her husband. 
And if she is doubtfully divorced, that which she finds belongs to her.

Siman 85

Her fruits: How so?
They enacted that he should eat the fruits of his wife's property in return for redeeming her, for they obligated him to redeem her.
And if he says: I don't want the fruits and I won't redeem her, they don't listen to him.
And the same is true if she says: I don't want this enactment, they don't listen to her.  
Iron sheep property: This is the dowry that she brought in to the marriage, clothes, or animals or slaves and he took responsibility for them (Tur). 
If they die, they die for him. And if they increase, they increase for him. And similarly if they decrease or are stolen, or lost, everything is to him.
And pluckable property: This is the property for which he has no responsibility (Tur).
If they die or increase or decrease or are stolen, or lost, everything is to her, for the husband has rights only to the fruit.
And if the husband is negligent with the pluckable property, and they were lost, he is exempt, for she is working with him and this is considered "negligence in the presence of the owners." 
Hagah: See above siman 17, p. 3, where I wrote the law of the woman's clothes, whether they are considered iron sheep property or pluckable property.
The field that the husband appointed for her ketubah, its rule is as iron sheep property (Responsa of the Rosh). And see below, siman 90, p. 16. 
There are those that say: that [regarding] the assets of a flock in iron, there is no requirement of a guarantee. Rather if thusly there was an appraisal of them in blood measures, or that a guarantee is received clearly. And there are those that say: that the since it is written in the ketuba (marriage contract), one is obligated in [the making of a] guarantee even though there is no appraisal on them and one is not obligated in their guarantee. And the first principle is:
A master that comes to discuss with [some]one about the property of his wife, needs authorization. And if there are fruits on the floor, because he has permission regarding the fruits that they are his, he discusses about the main parts, and he does not need the authorization of his wife, but if she does not know they are [on] the floor they are not his fruits.

Hagah: Actually to discuss, but to make a compromise, he needs permission (source: Rivash siman 496). He comes to speak about money from the hand of his wife. he does not need permission, alais that what fruits there are on the floor (source: Trumas hadeshen siman 312, and Ayin Hoshen Mishpat Siman 122)
The lending of a woman after a cow of her possession from a  "log", and the lending of her husband, it is not that these are the husbands', that the acquisition of fruits are not a material acquisition to him actually. (From Ayin B'Hoshen Ha'mishpat siman 346)
If a woman borrowed a cow, and then she got married and [then] died, the husband, even though he used it the whole time it was borrowed, is exempt, even if he was negligent, because he is considered like a buyer. And the woman is obligated to pay when she has money. And if she informed her husband that it was borrowed, then he takes her place.
If she acquired property after she was married, whether she acquired it through inheritance or it was given to her as a gift, or if they harmed her and gave her her portion for her shame and damage, it is called pluckable property, and behold it is like [property] that she brought in to him and he did not accept responsibility for them. But if she sold her ketubah or dowry, the husband does not have rights to the fruit of the money. And so if she gave a gift to another person before she was married, in order to withhold it from her husband, even though the gift is not [truly] a gift, the husband does not have rights to the fruits. And so if the husband gave a gift to his wife, whether land or moveable property, she acquired it, and the husband does not have rights to the fruits. However, she cannot sell what he gave her, nor give it to another, but it must remain in her possession, and if she dies he inherits it, and the fruits that issue to her from it their law is as for other pluckable property, and they may be sold and he may buy land with them and he has rights to the fruits.
What type of things do they refer to when is said, we do not eat the fruit of [benefit] from the present, like he [a husband] gives her [his wife] after the wedding? 
But if her fiancee gives her something in addition, because they are getting married, she will remember this gift like the rest of her property in her log, and will benefit. 
And if she is widowed or becomes foreign, not because of rebellion, she takes this present, regardless of the <i>ketubah</i>. 
One who sells land to his wife, if the maot with which she acquired the land from her husband were revealed and known to her husband, she acquired it, and the husband has rights to the fruits of that land. But if the maot were hidden, she did not acquire it, for the husband may say: I only sold it in order to show the maot she had hidden, and with those maot that were seen land may be bought and the husband has rights to the fruits. Hagah: And there is an opinion that if there is a viable argument that the maot are his, behold they are entirely his. (And this is implied by the Tur's language.)
If he says: They were hidden, and she says: They were not, the [burden] is on her to bring proof.
If one gives her a present on the condition that her husband does not have permission [to use it], the husband acquires it, and it [the present] becomes like the rest of <i>nikhsei millog</i> [property which the husband keeps upon the termination of the marriage], unless the giver stipulated about the present that it would be for so and so. For example, if he says to her: This money is given to you on condition that you use them to dress [yourself] or on condition that you do with it as you please without your husband's permission. Rem"a: If her father gave her a present and stipulated in one of these ways, and afterwards her father dies and she inherits him, the present is nullified and her husband keeps it like the rest of <i>nikhsei millog</i> (Responsa Ramban Siman 150)
If money or movable goods are found in the hands of a woman and she says they are a present given to me, and he says, they are her wages, so they are mine, she is believed, and she can buy the land with the money [she earned] but he [her husband] can eat the fruit.
He can accuse someone who claims it's a lie. 
And if she says: I was given this present on the condition that my husband cannot touch it, rather I should do what I want with it, the burden of proof is upon her.
Rem"a: there are those who say that she is not believed, specifically with hidden money, but with non-hidden money, she is believed when she says: they are mine (Rashi and Rosh siman 86). Specifically, when it was not lifted or given inside of the house (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashba), (siman 86). 
There are those who say that if they did not see the money in her hand, and she has a <i>migo</i> [hypothetical argument] saying that it is not hers or it was returned her, she is believed in any case (responsa Muharam siman 268), (CM siman 62). 
And if she says: you gave it to me as a present, she makes a <i>shevuat heset</i> [oath that is placed upon] that her husband gave it to her, so he cannot benefit from it. 

Nichsei Milog [i.e. property the wife received during marriage that is hers, or property of hers that isn't listed on the ketubah], the husband can eat its fruit [i.e. benefit from its produce], and if it is a thing that can't produce, he can sell it and buy something that can produce. If he says to her, "Such-and-such [parcel of land] can be bought through [the nichsei milog]," and she says, "I will only take such-and-such [parcel of the land] for it," they should take a parcel where there is much produce and little maintenance, whether or not it is as she wanted it. They should not buy a parcel that cannot regenerate. If [the nichsei milog that] falls to her is a parcel that cannot regenerate, even if none of the principle is left over, he does not need to sell it. For example, a goat for milk, a sheep for sheering [its wool], a date palm tree for its fruit, even though she only has [rights to] the produce [and not the object itself], he can have the produce until he consumes the principle itself [and ruins it that it can no longer produce]. And similarly if she brings to him a utensil [such as bed sheets] through the framework of nichsei milog, he can use it and wear it, cover [a bed], cover [a table], even to the point of using its principle [ruining it], and when he divorces her he is not obligated to pay back for the wearing out of the nichsei milog.
If slaves fell to her, even if they are old, he cannot sell them, because they show honor to her father's house. If olives and grapes fall to her, but not the actual land where the trees are at all, if they produce enough to [pay for] their care, he should not sell them, for they show honor to her father's house. If they do not [produce enough], they should be sold as wood, and they should buy land where he can benefit from the produce.
If produce that is still connected to the ground falls to her [in inheritance, but not the land itself], it belongs to the husband. Even if it reached the time to cut it, if he detaches it from the land, it is hers, and he sells it, and buys land and he can eat its produce. <i> Rem"a: This is not true, for all the produce collected by him is completely his! It's possible a mistake crept up in the books, and it was supposed to be "If they were detached from the ground [already], they are hers," and it's a different clause, and so the Rambam Ishut 22:24. </i> 
Slaves from nichsei milog [property she received in inheritance while married or not on the ketubah] and animals of nichsei milog, the husband is obligated in their sustenance and all their needs, and they produce for him, and he can benefit from them. The offspring of a maidservant from the milog belongs to the husband [slave-owner]. The offspring of the animals of the milog belong to the husband. If she is divorced, and the woman wants to give money to take back the offspring of the maidservant, we listen to her for it shows honor to her father's house.
If the husband desired to sell melog properties to another, who would purchase the fruits of the land for many years, and [the other] advances the monies, we do not listen to him (the husband). On the other hand, he can sell the fruit every year after he gathers them.  Similarly, if he sells the fruits [in advance] for many years, and does business with the monies [from the sale], this is acceptable. 
Rama: If a creditor makes a claim against the wife's dowry or her melog properties, see Choshen Mishpat chapter 97.
There is an authority who says that if the lands [of the melog properties] are distant, and he (the husband) sold the usufruct rights for many years, the sale is valid.
The husband may force some of the wife's manservants and maidservants to serve him the house of another wife, whether they melog servants or "iron flock" servants. But he may not take them to another city without his wife's permission.
Rama: He may not force them to serve the other wife in another house (Beit Yosef, and it is likewise implied in the language of the Rambam).  Some authorities that if she had ornaments which are inappropriate for her, the husband may give them to the other [wife], for she did not bring them to him so that they would waste away and be lost and no one would use them (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashbatz).

Siman 86

One may not accept an object to be guarded from a married woman [for it may be her husbands]. If he does accept it, he should return it to the woman. <i> Rem"a: If she says, "It is so-and-so's," she is believed (Tur). If a woman travels out of the country, and her husband comes and claims [the object] from the guarder of the object saying that his wife stole it from him, [the guarder] should not give it to him until the woman comes back or died, so it seems to me. </i> And if she says at her moment of death, "It is so-and-so's", if she is believed about him, it should be done with as she asks. If not, it should be given to her inheritors. <i> Rem"a: As well as if she dies without saying anything [about the object] (Tur). </i> Some say that if she lifts it up and puts it in the house, she is no [longer] believed to say that it is so-and-so's. <i> Rem"a: However, so long as she is alive, one should return it to the woman [if she gives it to someone, instead of her husband] (Tur). However, if he returned it to the husband, the guarder is exempt [from wrongdoing], even if she never lifted it up and put it in the house (Mordechai Perek Chezkat Habatim). </i>
A husband who borrowed from his wife and then divorced her, she has no claim against him. Rama: This is certainly the case if he did not divorce her (Rama's own opinion). Some authorities say that this ruling applies only if the [borrowed] monies were hidden at the time of the loan, but if they were not hidden and he borrowed from her, he has to repay her even after divorcing her (Tur). The law is similar if he grabbed them (the monies) from her, for since the money was not hidden, she is believed when she says they belong to me or to so-and-so (Opinion of the Rav). However, if she buys and sells (i.e. runs a business) inside the house or the husband trusts her with his property, she is not believed [that the money is hers] (Tur). See supra chapter 85 se'if 12.  If he borrowed with a loan document, she says the money was not hidden, and he says that the loan money had been hidden, she must bring proof that the money was not hidden, or he is exempt from paying (Nimukei Yosef chapter Chezkat haBatim in Bava Bathra). See Choshen Mishpat chapter 62, regarding a woman who had [loan or realty] documents in her name, what is their law. A woman who sold [movables] or handed over movables as collateral, if the buyer or the lender does not know that they belong to the husband he does not need to return [the items] to him (the husband), even if the husband wants to return the [purchase or loan] money and claims that she stole the items from him (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 22 Hilchot Ishut).  Some authorities say that if she buys and sells within the house the husband is believed and the [buyer or lender] must return the items to the husband even without repayment (Rabbenu Yerucham, path 23). It seems to me that this applies only to circumstances in which it is not typical for her to collateralize or sell without the permission of her husband, but if this is typical for her, what is done is done, and so it should be taught. See infra chapter 100.ame, what is their law. A woman who sold [movables] or handed over movables as collateral, if the buyer or the lender does not know that they belong to the husband he does not need to return [the items] to him (the husband), even if the husband wants to return the [purchase or loan] money and claims that she stole the items from him (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 22 Hilchot Ishut).  Some authorities say that if she buys and sells within the house the husband is believed and the [buyer or lender] must return the items to the husband even without repayment (Rabbenu Yerucham, path 23). It seems to me that this applies only to circumstances in which it is not typical for her to collateralize or sell without the permission of her husband, but if this is typical for her, what is done is done, and so it should be taught. See infra chapter 100.

Siman 87

A man does not have squatting rights in his wife's melog properties (a wife's property which is not listed in the ketuba; the husband has usufruct rights, yet is not responsible for the property. See siman 83:13) which he has used for the years of chazaka (if someone enjoys the usufruct of a property for 3 years without counterclaim from the original owner, he can claim that he purchased the land even if he is unable to produce the document of sale), even if she had previously made a condition that he would not receive the usufruct of her property. Similarly a woman does not have  squatting rights on her husband's lands when she has taken the usufruct for the chazaka years. 

Rama: Specifically with this type of squatting, but with damage rights, e.g. opening windows [in a house] (without counterclaim) and similar instances, the husband does develop damage rights, and the law is similar with respect to the woman on her husband's property (Rabbenu Yerucham in Meisharim, path 23, section 7). And see Choshen Mishpat chapter 149.
Someone who holds possession of a married woman's property does not accrue squatting rights (see above) unless he maintained possession for three years after the death of her husband. 
Rama: See Choshen Mishpat chapter 149.

Siman 88

A woman who goes out from under the hand of her husband, either by his death or by divorce, she takes all of her possessions without an oath, whether melog properties or "iron flock" properties (see Siman 85:2 for definition of these properties), even though she is not accountable for her <i> ketubah</i> because she is a widow (Tur) or by a promise, she does not enter accountability without a promise.   If she enters the numbers, even if there is not a lot to do between the original work, she recieves everything she entered, even if it is a little and does not seem to be worth anything. If he said it, he was citing it for her [he gives it to her]. Like it says in (siman 103, rule 1), if she is able to demand it on the life of her husband [she can hold him liable for it].  
[With respect to] "iron flock" properties, which are termed dowry, the law is that if declined in value, the husband is required to pay the loss in value, even though they are still usable for their original purpose. But the custom is that as long as they are still usable for their original purpose, even if they are extremely worn, she receives them back as is. If they are no longer usable for their original purpose, he is required to pay their value as assessed at the time of the marriage. If they increased in value, she does not take them except at the original value as assessed at the time of the marriage. In what circumstances? Where the custom is to write into the ketuba, "She brought to him such-and-such utensil at such-and-such price and such-and-such utensil at such-and-such price." But in locales where they do not itemize each utensil [in the dowry] separately, but lump them all together and write, "She brought him clothes and adornments with a total value of such-and-such," that total amount is considered as a debt upon him, and even if the items were new, we reassess them at their current value. If they (the total value of all the items) declined in value, the loss is his, and if they increased in value, the gain is his, and we do not worry about the original assessment at all.  
If she said, "I will take the actual utensil (from the dowry)," and he says, "I will give its value," we listen to her, as long as it is still utilized along the lines of its original work. We rule likewise with the offspring of [Canaanite] maidservants or animals of melog properties. Furthermore, if she brought in to the marriage two utensils or two maidservants as "iron flock" properties, and they were assessed a [combined] value of 1000 zuz, and increased in value [during the marriage] to 2000 zuz, she takes one of them (maidservant or animal) as repayment of her 1000 [zuz dowry], and the second, if she desires to pay its value and take it to demonstrate the praiseworthiness of her family (i.e. to show that their property rises in value), we listen to her.
If the woman does not want her tools, even though the husband has money, she may leave  her tools, as long as they still work.
If the heirs consecrated (to the Temple) the "iron flock" properties after the death of their father, or they spread them on his body in a manner which would forbid deriving any benefit from them, they (the heirs) must give its (the "iron flock" property) value to her (the widow).
If she had brought in [to the marriage] land such that when she leaves the marriage it has produce that is still not harvested, she takes it along with its fruit-even if the produce had already reached its harvesting period.  However, if the husband had separated [the produce from the land] prior to the divorce, the produce would belong to him even if the produce had not yet reached its harvesting period.
If a man paid expenses for his wife's melog properties and then divorced her, whether he spent a little but "ate" (i.e. took or harvested) much fruit (i.e. profit), or spent a lot but ate little fruit, even if he ate only one dried fig in honorable fashion, in the manner of a man in his house, or received 1 dinar profit even in non-honorable fashion, and even if he took as profit from his expenditures only one bundle of vines, what he spent he spent, and what he ate he ate.  If he spent, but received no profit, or ate less than the minimum amount (I believe this means less than a dinar), we assess how much the property increased in value, and ask him how much he spent. If the increase in value is greater than the expenditure, he takes an oath while holding a [sacred] object as to the amount of his expenditure, and takes back the expenses.  If the expenditure is greater than the increase in value, he receives only the increase in value, and with an oath.  The same law applies to someone whose wife received properties in a distant place and he spent money to bring them [home], and he bought with those properties lands, and ate from the fruit as much as the expenses or less. If he ate only from the equity, he swears how much he spent, and takes up to the value of the increase in value.   Rama: That which he is required to take an oath applies only when his wife does not contradict him, but if she contradicts him, he does not take an oath (Mordechai chapter haIsha sheNaflu).
They fell to her assets in another place, and followed them and took many expenses, and brought them, and divorced, they even took from them and took out, no food from praise that discussed in what took out and what he ate, since the fund he took, but swore many took out, and took until to praise, that put these coins worth here more than they were at original value.
With which circumstances are we dealing? When he divorces of his own desire. But if she rebelled, whether he utilized the usufruct or not, he swears how much he spent, and takes that amount. If the increase in value was greater than the expenses, he takes the expenses, and if the expenses were greater than the increase in value, he takes the increase in value.
A man who paid expenses for [the upkeep of] melog properties of his minor wife, and she subsequently annulled the marriage, we see how much he profited from the usufruct and how much he spent, and how much the property increased in value, and we assess like a sharecropper (who gives the owner a percentage of the crop), for he had permission to use the property. If he wants to take the increase in value in return for the expenses, we listen to him. If he spent only a little and "ate" (received) much usufruct, what he ate he ate (i.e. the produce received is his compensation). 
If one spends money on the non-dowry estates of his wife and then dies, there is an opinion that says that if it can be determined that he spent but did not consume [from those estates] his mourners [heirs] may collect what is determined that he spend. But if the amount he spent cannot be determined, the mourners [heirs] collect nothing.
A man who contracted sharecroppers for his wife's properties and then divorced her, if the husband himself is also sharecropping, when the husband exits, the sharecroppers also exit, for they came to the land only through the will of the husband. We assess [their labor, expenses,  and profit] and they have the weak hand. If the husband is not sharecropping, they came in order to work the land and we assess for them like a sharecropper. Rama: Some authorities say that this applies specifically when they knew that the land belonged to a woman, but if the sharecroppers did not know that the land belonged to a woman, they complete their sharecropping in all senses. (So implied by the language of Tur and similarly in Asheri).

Siman 89

If a woman died in the lifetime of her husband, he is required to bury her and to deal with all the needs of her burial, including the gravestone. Similarly, he must arrange a eulogy and hire professional weepers according to the custom of the state. If their custom is to mourn with flutes, he shall not make do with less than two flutes and professional weepers, even if he is among the poor of Israel.  If he was rich, it [burial arrangements] shall be according to his honor.  If her honor was greater than his, she must be buried according to her honor, for she rises [in honor] with him, but does not descend.
If he [the husband] did not want to bury her, and another arose and buried her, the court shall take payment from her husband and give it to the other.
If her husband was in a different country, court shall take payment from his property and sell [as needed to raise money, even] without public announcement, and bury her according to his wealth and honor, or according to her honor [whichever is greater].
A widow is not buried from the estate of her [late] husband, but the heirs of her ketubah (marriage contract) must attend to her burial. If she died before swearing the widow's oath [denying any prior collection of the ketubah monies], there is one [authority] who says that the husband's heirs must attend to her burial, but they [most other authories] did not agree with his opinion. 

Siman 90

A husband inherits his wife, both melog properties (dowry property in which the husband is permitted usufruct) and "iron flock" properties (dowry properties guaranteed 100% by the husband). With what circumstance are we dealing? with property in the direct possession of the wife, but not property which has not yet arrived in her possession, such as an inheritance designated for her, but she died before the grantor. [In the latter case] he does not stand in her stead to inherit.  Note: A writ of "half male" which is our current custom, that the father writes to his daughter to inherit 1/2 the share of male children, but if the daughter has no surviving descendants, the debt is canceled; and the daughter died in the lifetime of her father, with surviving descendants, and then the descendant died and subsequently the father died, the husband [of the daughter who died] inherits the rights of that writ, by way of the descendant who inherited his mother, and he [the husband] inherits his own descendants (Mahariv chapter 16). If the grantors of her inheritance wrote equity ownership of land [to be given to the woman] while they are still alive [but withholding the usufruct to themselves], and she would inherit the usufruct after [their] death, the husband inherits that land from her (Mordechai, beginning of chapter Yesh Nochalin in Bava Bathra).   But he takes the increase in value of what he inherits from her, for it increased in his hands. He does not inherit his wife's loans. For example, if her grantors died, and they had an outstanding loan in the hands of others when he married her, and she died before collecting those loans.  Note: But if her grantors of inheritance left property, even if the daughter did not take possession of that property in her life, and even if they were collateralized for the ketubah of a widow [i.e. of the grantor], that property is considered to be in the daughter's possession, and the [daughter's] husband inherits them (Mordechai, chapter Kol haNishbain).  Similarly, if she had an outstanding loan in the hands of others when he married her, and the woman died before collecting the loans, he does not inherit those loans. But if she loaned money from melog properties, and she died before collecting, in these the husband does collect.    Note:  All properties which a woman had, and to which her husband had no rights, and she loaned them to others, the husband does not inherit (Beit Yosef in the name of Responsa Rashba).
One who says: my estate will go to so-and-so and, after him, to my heirs; since we hold that the same law applies to the heirs of the heir, i.e. he had a daughter who died while he was yet alive, and that daughter has a son, then the son stands in his mother's place to inherit. But if the daughter has no heirs but her husband, then the husband does not inherit, [d'havye lei raui.] And if he said: my estate will go to so-and-so and, after him, from this moment to my heirs, then they become status quo, and the daughter's husband would inherit his wife.
One who marries a woman who is among the types of women where marriage will incur a sin [but not grevious enough to incur karet], then he inherits her if she dies, since their marriage was effective. This is also true for a woman who converts (Beit Yosef in the name of the Avi Ezri). Likewise, one who marries a minor who initiates miyun, even though the kiddushin is not complete, he still inherits her if she dies. But a [normal] man who marries a deaf-mute woman, even her hearing restores after their marriage, he does not inherit her if she dies. And a deaf-mute man who marries a [normal] woman, he inherits her if she dies, since she possesses knowledge and, according to her will, she married him, and  awarded to him her assets.
A minor who was engaged by her father's will bit married against her father's will, whether before him or not in his presence, even if the father said nothing, if she died, the husband does not receive her inheritance unless the father wanted the marriage. 
A woman who is divorced through a divorce that is in doubt [as to its legality], and then she dies, her husband cannot inherit her. Rama: But while she had not been divorced, even though he planned on divorcing her, he can inherit (Tur in the name of the Rosh). One who claims against his wife that she had blemishes and [his marriage] was a mistaken deal (as was explained earlier Siman 39), if she dies, he cannot inherit her (Teshuvat Maimoniot, end of Ishut, and Mordechai chapter Mi Shemet). A woman who was rebellious against her husband [and refused intimacy] and then died [and presumably he was to divorce her], her husband can inherit her (such is infered from the language of the Maggid Mishneh 22), and see earlier Siman 77. If he rebels against his wife [and refuses intimacy] or she against him, and does not act with her as they should in marriage, some say that if she dies, he does not inherit (Hagahot (Mordechai) Alfasi chapter Af Al Pi).
If a house fell on him and his wife, and it is not known which of them died first and he has no children with her, the heirs of the husband receive the main part of the Ketubah and the extra stipulations, and the woman's heirs receive the Melog (not in the Ketubah) property and they split the Tzon Barzel (in the ketubah) property. 
A woman who writes over all her property to another, whether a relative or not, before she gets married, even though if she is widowed or is divorce the gift would be void, her husband cannot benefit from the produce [of that property]. And if she dies (in his lifetime), he cannot inherit her, for she gave them away before she was married, and when she dies in her husband's lifetime, the buyer who received the gift, his gift becomes a complete acquisition. Not only that, but even if she gave away a small amount, or all of it, and she wrote to the receiver of the gift, "Acquire it from today for as long as I will choose," the acquisition of which is not complete unless she chooses, [even then] the husband cannot benefit from that gift's produce, and if she dies, he cannot inherit it.
Some say, that Dina smuggling specifically without writing to him a gift complete, a gift conclusive, a gift lifting; but if she wrote to him like this, completely bought.
A woman who sold part of her <i> Nichsei Milog </i> after marriage, even though that property came to her [possession] before she got engaged, her husband [can] take fruit [of this property] from the buyers all her life, but not the actual land. And if she dies in his lifetime, he [can] take the actual land from the buyers without payment. And there are those who say that even in her lifetime he [can] take the actual property from the buyers without payment (<i> Tur </i> and <i> Rosh </i>). And if the payment that she got from the buyers is still around, or they find money in her possession (lit. hand), and they are able to take them  (<i> Tur </i> in the name of the <i> Rosh </i>), they return it to the buyers, and he is not able to say: Maybe it [this money] is a found object. Rem"a: If she got widowed or divorced, her sale is [still] valid (<i> Tur </i> and most <i> Poskim </i>). And all the days of her life, if the husband wants to build or destroy on the land, the buyer is able to protest (<i> Nimukei Yosef Perek Chezkat HaBatim</i>). And there is no distinction between if she sold her property or she made them <i> Hekdesh </i> (<i> Terumas HeDeshen Siman 272 </i>)
And if the husband agrees, or if there are witnesses that she sold it with his permission, he cannot take it from the buyers, because she is like his agent, and if he wants he can take separated property which she sold without his knowledge. <i>HGH: If he saw that she sold it and did not protest to her, he does not lose his rights. (Rosh, responsa, ch. 40). If she ordered, when she was sick, giving away this or that article of clothing, and the husband agrees, if she gave it to the poor he cannot get it back, and if to the rich he can get it back (Mordechai end of </i>Hazahav and resp. of Moharam). See above ch. 86 if she sold movable property or used it as collateral for a loan.
What are we talking about? If she sold it after marriage, the husband can take it from the buyers, if it's inherited property known to the husband. But  if she inherited property without the husband's knowledge, ab initio she may not sell it, but if she sold it before the husband knew about it, the sale stands.  Similarly, a betrothed woman ab initio may not sell property inherited since her betrothal, but if she sold it prior to the marriage, the sale stands, <i>even property known to the intended husband</i>.
Properties that are not know to the husband, when they become known to him, they immediately become Melog properties. Similarly, produce that are discovered in her possession, immediately when they become known to him, they are Melog properties. Rama's Note: A woman who says about her inheritance that fell to her, that her father instructed her to to give a portion of it to third parties, if the properties are known to the husband, she is not believed. However, if the husband dies, she must fulfill her admission [to the third parties]. If the properties are not known [to the husband], she is believed (Bet Yosef, from responsa of Rashba).
A woman who sold or gave away her enumerated dowry property after marriage, whether to her husband or others, really hasn't.  <i>And some say that after she is divorced or widowed, the sale becomes valid (Nimukei Yosef ch. Hachovel).</i> Similarly, a husband who sold land which was his wife's property, whether regular or enumerated dowry property, really hasn't.  And some say that the husband himself can undermine the sale. <i>And even if he survives her, the husband inherits her ability to sell and can nullify the sale.</i>
A man is not allowed to sell chattel of Tzon Barzel properties, nor pledge them as security. If he sold or pledged them, what is done is done. Rama's Note: Some say that [in such a case] the sale is void. Woman's clothing that she brings [into the marriage] to him do not have the status of Tzon Barzel, only Melog properties, as was explained above, siman 77. And therefore, if he sold them or pledged them, it is unanimously held that it is void, and thus it appears to me. But some say, that if he said that he did what he did with her permission, he is believed with an oath. And similarly, if he said that he paid her the value [of the item] (Responsa of Rashba 536, 537). A Jew who collects real estate from a Cuthite (i.e., a non-Jew) in fulfillment of a loan, if the Cuthite has authority to redeem [the land], it has the status of chattel, and the woman does not have any power to contest it so that he cannot sell it; however, if the Jew took possession of it and the Cuthite cannot redeem it, then it has the status of real property, and it has the encumbrance of the wife's marriage contract on it just as any other real property (Terumat HaDeshen 339).
Movable property that he gave to her from his own property follows the same rules as dowry property [<i>tzon barzel</i>], which he may not sell ab initio, which also goes for movable property that she acquired, even if not directly to hand, and even if it has no potential for income.  And there is no distinction between daily and Shabbat/holiday clothing.  But he may sell gold and crystal utensils if he needs income from them.  And if relatives gave her clothing or jewelry, the husband may sell them for his own income.
They both sold part of the wife's inherited property (nichsei melug), whether it was bought from the husband first <i>and returned</i> and bought from the wife, or it was bought from the wife and returned and bought from the husband, their sale stands.  Similarly the wife who sold or gave inherited property to her husband, her sale or donation stand, and she cannot say about the inherited property: "I have made my husband happy."  But regarding other inheritance she may say so.  How does this work? The wife who sold or gave to her husband enumerated dowry property (tzon barzel), whether land or movable property, or a field that he set aside in her ketubah, or that he specified in in her ketubah, or a part of her field which she brought into the marriage for him, her husband has not actually acquired it. And even if they acquired it from the wife's hand, willingly, she may take it back at any time, because she neither gave nor sold it except for making peace in her home.  Therefore, the husband has no proof that he owns any of his wife's property, except for inherited property, unless she explicitly received the responsibility to. <i>HGH: Some say that specifically her sale or donation don't occur, but if she hands over to the husband all her her rights to the inheritances, as she can do with the money specified in her ketubah, the transfer is valid (Raavad and Rosh). And others argue (Ramban, Rashba, Rambam according to the Maggid Mishnah).</i>
A husband who sold his property, and afterward, his wife wrote to the buyer, "I have no issue or matter with you," and she agreed to his actions, even though [the buyer] bought it from him, it is voided [lit: ripped up], since she only wrote this so that she should not have a fight with her husband, and so she can say, "I wanted to make my husband feel good [but did not intend for the transaction to have legal significance]" And even if she wrote to [the buyer] that she will not be able to say [the excuse that] "I wanted to make my husband feel good," it is meaningless.  However, if he made a kinyan from the hand of the wife that there would be no encumbrance on this place, and [only] afterward the husband sold it to him, then the transaction is not voided. Similarly, if the husband sold [property], and he told his wife to write to the buyer, "I have no issue or matter with you," and she did not agree to his actions, and subsequently, the husband went and sold it to a different person—whether the same field or a different field—and after the husband sold it she did agree to his actions, and he made a kinyan that there would be no encumbrance on this field, she may not then contest [the transaction], because she is not able to say [that she only agreed to his actions because] "I wanted to make my husband feel good." Similarly, if she expressly accepted on herself the responsibility that if the creditor of her husband has [a debt] voided from him, she will pay him, then she is not able to claim [the reason I did this was merely that]  "I wanted to make my husband feel good." Rama's Note: Some say that if the wife accepted the money she is not able to say afterward "I wanted to make my husband feel good" (Nimukei Yosef, Chapter Chezkat; Mesharim Nasiv 23, part 4). A wife who admits that she owes money with her husband must pay it, and she is not able to say with respect to this, [I made the admission because] "I wanted to make my husband feel good," because we only say this with respect to properties that are sold (Bet Yosef, from Responsa of Ramban). A wife whose power was removed from her husband's property prior to the husband's kinyan, he may sell the properties afterward and they will not be voided, and there is no relevance to say, "I wanted to make my husband feel good" (Mordechai, beginning of Chapter HaKotev; Hagaot Maimoni ch. 23).
Dowry property that was lost or stolen and she forgave her husband [from any responsibility for them], and she made a gesture of acquisition for them with witnesses, she cannot say, "I dis so to placate my husband."  If, however, she gave him a gift from some movable property that was still from the extant dowry property, she has not [fully obligated herself] with an acquisition, because she can say, "I did so to placate my husband."
A woman whose husband said to her that she should do as she pleases with her clothing and jewelry, if she sold or gave them away, [her actions are]  cancelled.
If Reuven's wife possessed non-dowry land and he had an outstanding contractual debt to Shimon, and a a later date he and his wife became contractually indebted to Levi, and the wife then dies while her husband is still living, Levi has first right to collect from that non-dowry land. 

Siman 91

A woman who receives a debt document for her husband, and she goes and waives the debt, the waiving does not work, for his hand is like her hand. Rem"a: Therefore she is not believed as well to say "He redeemed [the debt]" (Nimukei Yosef Perek Hakotev). And the same is true for a loan, which she cannot forgive on his behalf (Bet Yosef in the name of the R"Y).
A husband's status with respect to his wife's property is that of a purchaser.  Therefore, if a man said to woman, "My property is yours and after you it should go to such-and-such" and he then marries her, he is like a purchaser, and the "after you" claimant has no potency in the presence of the husband, for we have concluded that [in a case where a person said] "my property is yours and after you it should go to such-and-such" and the first one then sold the property the second one only has a claim to the portion that remained with the first one.  This is true is he had made the statement to a single woman.  If however, a man said to a married woman, "My property is yours and after you it should go to such-and-such" and she then dies, the "after you" claimant acquires [the property] and not the husband.  Therefore, if a man says to a married woman, "My property is yours and after you it should go to such-and-such" and she then sold it, and then died, the property should stay with the purchaser.
If real property was collected on a woman's behalf as payment of a debt owed to her, and married, and then died and her husband inherited from her, even though land acquired through collections may always return to their original inheritors, in this case the land does not return, because the husband is considered a third-party acquirer, and it is if the land had been sold to another person.  And comparably, if they had claimed land from her for a debt she owed, and she then married, died, and her husband inherited, the land acquired through debt collection is not returned to him.
If she had taken out a loan on a verbal commitment and later married, it may not be collected from her husband, since a verbal loan is not enforceable against third parties.  

Note: nonetheless, if there are particular coins that were lent, he is obliged to pay them (R. Y' and the Mordochai). And if the lender came before she was married and wishes to protest against her marriage until she pay him back so that he should not lose what is his, the fair judgment is on his side, even if the due date had not yet come (Beit Yosef, quoting the Nimukei Yosef).  

But if she had taken out a loan with a written agreement, one may claim it against any assets she brought to the marriage. 

In a community that made rules subject to fines, and the woman violated such a rule, her husband is obliged to pay (Beit Yosef paragraph 70 in the name of ? paragraph 282).
If one sent bridal gifts to a woman to whom he had been introduced as a potential spouse, but she went and married a different man, and the first demanded the return of his bridal gifts, their rule is as if he had lent money under a written agreement. 

Note: If she took more than the amount she would be entitled to in her ketubah and then married, the husband is obliged to return the excess (from the R'iK, root 18).  And similar if she owed taxes and married, it is like the case of the sender of bridal gifts, because these are subject to a leniency because there is no way to produce written agreements about them, and so we treat them as if they were loans that did have written agreements (Maharam of Padua, section 95).  But tort damages and negotiated business debts and other things, he is not obliged to pay (Nimukei Yosef, the chapter "Some inherit").  A woman who arranged a marriage for her daughter to a man and committed to a dowry, and later herself married: the daughter's prospective husband may claim what the mother committed to from her husband against the assets she brought to the marriage, just as if it were a loan with a written agreement; even though at the time that she arranged her daughter's marriage she had not yet  engaged the vows of her ketubah, still since she eventually engage that vow, we consider her words even out of the order they happened, since what she did originally was justified. (Beit Yoseph quoting a responsum of the Rashba).  Some say since it is as if it was a written loan we collect from the husband out of the assets she brought to the marriage, that is, if she brought him real property or movable property and wrote a debt to her husband of the movable property against the value of the real property; but if she did not write about it, and only brought the movable property to the marriage, even one who had loaned her money with a written agreement may not collect it from her husband, as a debt-holder may not seize movables that are already subordinated (responsum of Nachmanides paragraph 56).  And it is logically reasonable.  And it is apparently a reasonable negogiation, since in propertly she brought to the marriage but that she doesn't hold title to, for example if she took more than her holding in the ketubah, he must in any case return it. And see Hoshen HaMishpat the end of section 96 (explained there).

Siman 92

If one wrote or said to his wife when they were still engaged, "I have no legal claim on your assets," and she sold or gave them, [the sale or claim] stands.    And he has no interest in the cash of the deal (Alfasi notes).  And as long as she had not sold or given [the assets], the husband enjoys the income of them, and if she dies he inherits from her.  And if he wrote that to her after they were married, he must buy it from him, and then her sale and her gift stand.  Note: and he needed defray it unless it was after they were engaged, but if it was before they were engaged he does not have to defray it. (R'an, the beginning of the chapter HaKotev, and Rashba, paragraph 960).
If she stipulates while still in erusin [engagement] that any propert that falls to her [in inheritance] once she gets married will not belong to him in law and practice, it takes effect. And some say it does not take effect. <i> Rem"a: If he removes himself from those properties, some say the property is not written into her ketubah at all (Mordechai Perek Hakotev in the name of the Ritzb"a); and even property that falls to her [in inheritance] afterwards is not included (Mahrik root 13), unless explicitly stated.</i>
If he says to her while she is still in erusin [engagement], "I will have no legal standing in your property," if they acquire it from his hand he has taken himself out of the body of the land and he only has the produce of the land ever. Some argue against that.
If he adds on a condition that he will have neither claim also on the produce, when he says to her: I have no claim regarding your possessions or produce, he cannot benefit from the produce while she is alive, but when they sell the fruits and buy  for themselves land [with the money], he can eat the fruit. Rem"a: and if she dies, he inherits it (Tur). And there are those who say that he does not force her to sell the produce, but if there were fruits leftover he can sell them and buys land [with the money], and eats the fruit [of the new land] (Tur in the name of the Rosh). 
If he went on to state the condition with her that he would not benefit from the increase of her assets or even of the increase of the increase, then they take the increase and real property with it, and then they take the increase of that property and buy a second property with that, and he may benefit from the increase of that one, that is, the increase of the increase of the increase.  And so on always, up to the point that he states the condition with her that he should not have the increase and not their increase forever, and then he has no aspect of the increase in her lifetime. 
He writes to her: I don't have any claim to your property or your produce's produce, but he did not mention the produce, there are those who say that he can eat the produce but not the produce's produce. There are those who say that he also cannot eat the produce. 
If he makes a condition with her that he will not inherit her, behold he does not inherit her, but he can eat the usufruct during her lifetime.  Similarly if he makes a condition that he will inherit part of her inheritance, or that if she dies without sons the property reverts to her father's house, all is valid.  What are we talking about? That he made the condition with her before their marriage, while she was betrothed, or written into her ketubah at the time of the betrothal, but if he made the condition with her after the marriage, the condition is null, and he will inherit her. <i>HGH: See above ch. 69. And it's only in the case of "I will not inherit her" written after marriage, that the agreement is null; in any case, if he obligates himself to pass the property he inherits from her on to her heirs, he must fulfill the obligation. (Ran beginning of Hakoteiv in the name of Ramban, and Rivash chs. 64 and 102).</i>
If he stated the condition with her after they were married that he should have no interest in her assets or in the increase of their increase forever in her lifetime or after her death, then he does not benefit from their increase at all; but if she dies he does inherit from her.  Note: if he separated himself from his wife's assets and he divorced her, and then he married her again without comment, he takes her back under the original conditions (Rashba paragraph 562).

Siman 93

The Ketuba is like a debt that is time bound, and it can only be collected after the death of the husband, or after divorce.  Rem"a: The same is true about the dowry (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 61:11)  If he included gifts, they are collected while he is alive.  Still, if the local practice is to inlcude gists as a honorific gesture, and to not collect them while he is alive, we follow the local practice (following the view of the Gaon, against the Rashb"a).  The father cannot stipulate anything about his daughter after she is married, but if he is marrying her off he can put conditions on her gifts to change from the convention, if he so desires.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Chosen Mishpat 97:24)
A woman who had a divorce of a dubious nature, whose husband died, is not sustained from his property, as we do not extract from the inheritor out of uncertainty. But while her husband is living, she is provided with sustenance until he divorces her conclusively.    
A widow is provided food from the property of the inheritors the entire time of her widowhood, even if it wasn't written in her marriage contract, and even if he commanded at the time of death, "Don't provide food from my property for my widow," we don't listen to him. And the inheritors are NOT able to pay off to her the marriage contract and remove her from the food, but she is provided food against their will as long as she doesn't claim her marriage contract, unless they explicitly stipulated that his widow will not be provided food from his property, or the custom in the place is such. Rama: And the [Jewish] Court is able to decree in their place that the orphans can remove her when they want (Beit Yosef and Riva"sh Siman 107).
When someone leave behinds a widow and a daughter, whether the daughter is hers or from a previous wife, and there isn't enough in the estate to provide for them both, the widow is supported and the daughter must beg. But some say that whether the estate is large or small, if there's a widow and a child, whether a son or a daughter, she is supported with the child, son or daughter, until the money runs out; and even if the daughter gets married and shares the estate with her husband, she [the widow] is still supported from them even after the death of the daughter. But if there is a widow and a son and a daughter, and the estate is small enough that they can't be supported until the daughter reaches majority age, then the son and daughter are sent away (?) and the widow alone is supported until she collects the worth of her Ketubah. Gloss: And in the case where the widow comes before the daughters, the widow is brought food until the point at ______
A widow who sues [the estate] for her Ketubah is no longer entitled to support from the estate, even if she was not paid. However, if she merely demanded it outside of Bet Din she does not lose [her right to support.] (Tur) Others say that she does not lose it even if she sues in Bet Din unless she sued by choice, but if she sued under pressure because they [the heirs] were not supporting her or because they tricked her [by saying] so-and-so wants to marry you and therefore she sued for the Ketubah (so that she could support herself or have a dowry for her remarriage) or or for similar reasons, she does not lose her right to support.   Rema: A woman who swears before the court as to her ketubah does not lose her right to support because swearing [as to the value] does not constitute a claim or suit.
A bedridden person who orders that his widow be supported from his property all the days of her widowhood, beyond the amount in her ketubah,  at least one source says, that his widow cannot lose her support through the execution of the ketubah in court, nor by other ways one loses support, and the fruit of her labor does not go to the orphans.
....
If she sold her ketubah payment right entirely, or was pauperized, or became a ward of someone else, whether she did these things before an expert court of before three dependable [witnesses], whether she did them during her husband's lifetime or she did them after her husband's death, she is not entitled to to board payments from his heirs.
She forgives her <i>ketubah</i> to her husband, she loses her [right to] food [he must feed her] after he dies, but while he is alive, she has food. There are those who say that even when he is alive, she loses her right to food. If so, if she forgives to the orphans, she loses [the right] to food (Ron chapter 4, like it says in the Beis Yoseif). 
What are the circumstances? When she sold, or collateralized or forgave the entire ketuba, both the basic amount and any additional amount. But if she retained a portion [for herself], she still receives sustenance support, even is she retained only the additional amount or a portion thereof. However, the heirs may pay off the amount that she retained, and will thereby be absolved of paying her sustenance. Any woman who sells or forgives her ketuba per se [without mentioning specific details] is considered to have sold or forgiven the additional amount along with the basic ketuba.
If she claimed [return of] her dowry and was reimbursed, she does not thereby lose sustenance support, because she still retains the basic ketuba, additional amounts listed in the ketuba, or a portion thereof.
If she claimed only the basic and additional amounts listed in the ketuba, even if her dowry was 100 maneh (1 maneh = 100 dinar = 25 mishnaic sela; and the heirs still need to repay the dowry), she loses sustenance support. Rama: Similarly if she claimed her ketuba per se (without additional qualifications), she loses her support, and we do not say that she did not claim the additional amounts (Tur).
There is one authority who writes that if the income from the deceased's estate are insufficient for her [the widow's] sustenance, her rights to sustenance support are limited to the amount of her ketuba. But they disagree with him, for she always receives sustenance until the estate has dwindled to the value of her ketuba, and she then receives this [remainder of the estate] as [payment of] her ketuba.  
A poor widow who stayed two years and did not demand alimony, or a rich [widow] who stayed for three years and did not demand [alimony], relinquished and has no alimony from previous years. And if she stayed less than this, even one day, she did not relinquish. And if she had in her hand a pawn during those years, or if she borrowed, she did not relinquish. 
A widow who claimed [past] sustenance support from the heirs; they say that they gave her the support, and she says that she did not take the support, as long as she has not remarried, the onus is upon the heirs (lit. orphans) to bring proof [that they paid], or she may take a "heset"oath (a lesser severity, Rabbinic-level oath) and take the support. Once she has remarried, the onus is upon her to bring proof, or the heir may swear a "heset" oath that he paid her. 
One who designated land for his wife when he was dying, with the purpose that she would be provided for from it.  If he said: Such and such piece of land will be your sustenance, behold he has increased her sustenance. And if it earns less than the sustenance due to her, she gets the rest from other funds, and if it earns more than what she deserves, she takes it all.  But if he said to her: Such and such piece of land will be for sustenance, and she was silent, she gets only the produce from that land. 
A woman who went abroad with her husband and she returned and said: My husband died. If she wants, she may receive sustenance, and if she wants she may take her ketubah. But if she said: My husband divorced me, she is not believed. And she is sustained from his property up to the value of her ketubah. 
A widow who doesn't have her ketubah documentation, she does not receive sustenance, for perhaps she forgave her ketubah or sold it or used it as a pledge.  But there are those who disagree. 
A widow is sustained, even though she didn't swear [that she didn't receive her ketubah]. But there are those who disagree. And the first reasoning, is the prominent one. 
A widow is not fed only [with money gained] from land that is free but not [from land] that has a lien on it. It is not necessary [to be said, that land with a lien is not used] if the husband sold or gifted the land in his lifetime. Rather even if the inheritors sold, put a lien or gifted the land after their father died, we do not remove [the land] to feed the widow or daughters. Specifically if the father gave [his land] in a regular transaction, but if he gave it via a "matnas schiv mera" they get food from it if there are no free properties.   If he sacralized his properties it is like a regular transaction.  She is not fed from movable objects. However if she grabed  from movable objects, even after his death, we do not take it away from her. And now that the "Gaonim" enacted that she collects her "kesuba" and the extras of the "kesuba" from movable objects, she is fed from movable objects, even if she doesn't grab [them]. However, if the movable objects were given to others even via a "matnas schiv mera", some say she is not fed from them.    
If he [her husband] had left movable property and she has not taken physical possession of it, the heirs take it and they must fund her board payments. And she may not prevent them, saying, "Let the movable property be deposited with the court and I will be fed from them, lest they be lost and I will not have food [payments]."  And even if he had specified explicitly that she should be fed from that movable property, she may not prevent them from selling it, and if they do sell it she may not claim in back from the hands of the third-party buyers, and she [then receives] board payments from the money coming from land that they hold. And there are those who disagree and say that she does not receive her board payment from that money.  Note: if he committed to her with kinyan about the board, then she may deduct [what she will be owed] for food from the subordinated [property].  And that is the case if he had explicitly specified board payments for after his death; but it is not so, even if he wrote about board payments in her ketubah, and they had bought [the property] from his own hand - he intended those board payments only during his lifetime (that is understood from the Maggid Mishneh, chapter 18 of 'Marriage,' and the Beit Yosef wrote similarly, quoting a responsum of the Rashba).
If he [died and] left many wives, even though he married them one after the other, they [are entitled to] receive board payments equally, as their is no rule of time precedence in board payments.
A widow who took possession of movable property in order to fund her board entitlement from them, whether she took possession during [her husband's] life or she took possession after his death, even if she took possession of a block of gold, they do not take it back from her, but rather the court writes about her what she took, and they allocate her board entitlement and they calculate about her, and she is fed from what she is holding until she dies or until has no more food, and then the heir takes the remainder.  Note: some say it is not considered taking possession unless she took it from a public area or from an alleyway, but not from the a place owned by the heir (The R'an, chapter 'A Widow Receives Board,' quoting Rashi).  And some disagree (that is understood from the words of the R'ivash, paragraph 384) but everyone agrees in the case of clear possession, that is if she took possession in one of the ways that ownership normally passes, but if she only took the keys of the rooms we don't consider that possession and we give it all to the heirs. And it is specifically if she has taken possession herself, but if she did so by the hand of an agent we do not credit her with possession (in the R'ivash, section 384 and section 107).
If she took more than is appropriate, she is claimed against in the court all at once, that is for thirty days worth of food, and alfter she finishes what she has in her possession she may come to sue for food, and she is sworn about all these matters.
A widow who came to the court to sue for her board payments: they sell [property from the estate] without prior announcement and give her board payments. And similarly she may sell by the order of an expert court, but also by the order of a [lower court of] three reliable [men] without prior announcement. And similarly if she sold it herself for equal value, her sale stands; but there are those who disagree with this.
A court of non-experts may only require her to sell, but she is not required to provide security or mortgage.
If she takes the land to herself as being worth a particular sum (out of her wedding contract), even if that is the right sum, that is meaningless - even if she declares it. If it becomes more valuable later, she has to return it to the heirs. Even if it doesn't become more valuable, if the heirs want to they can take it back.
And if a non-expert court was there, her transaction stands. And some say that even that is [like] nothing, unless an expert court was there.
A widow who sold, the obligation falls on the orphans; and nonetheless when she comes to collect her ketubah payment she may not claim back from the third-parties to whom she sold.
How much is to be sold for board payments? enough for six months  and not more. And the money stays in the possesion of the buyer, that it not all be given to her at once, but rather sufficient for thirty days' board, and so on every thirty days. And then she sells again for six months; and so she continues to sell indefinitely, until the remainder of the assets is equal to her ketubah payment entitlement, [at which point] she claims her ketubah payment from the remainder and goes away.  Note: some say that the widow who sells for six months refers specifically to real property, but in our times when board payments are funded out of movable property only one item at a time should be sold. (Tur, quoting the Baal HaAtur).
If they seize [property from unwilling heirs] in order to fund six months board, they may sell more, according to the discretion of the judges, so that she may have food.
When a court decrees maintenance to a widow that isn't covered by maintenance for the orphans, they give her enough to buy food for no less than thirty days. The same is true for a married woman, so she won't have to endure the shame of having her maintenance decreed in the court every day.

Siman 94

Just as she is fed from his property, his widow is given clothing and utensils and a place to live, or lives in the house where she lived during her husband's life. <i>HGH: And she does not have use of the whole house with the heirs, rather they just give her sufficient living space according to her honor within the house. (Ran ch. Naarah in the name of Rashba and Maggid Mishna ch 18). Some say they can give her a fitting living space in another house (so it appears in Mordechai ch. Hanosei and the aforementioned ch. Naarah). The widow may not then rent out this living space to others. (Resp. Rashba, and Ran ch. Hanosei).</i> And she may use the pillows and linens and male &amp; female slaves that she used during her husband's life, <i>when her husband was overseas (Ran ch. Naarah).</i>
If the living space falls down, the heirs are not obligated to rebuild it. If she says "Allow me to rebuild it from my own money," they don't listen to her; similarly they don't accept her inspection, and she may not spread it out, but she lives there as it is, or leaves.
And if it fell, even if the heirs rebuilt it, her right to it is gone.
Heirs who sold the living space of a widow, have done nothing (the sale has no effect).
If the house fell, or if the husband was only a renter, they give her living space according to her honor, also her food and clothing according to her honor.  And if the husband had great honor, they give her according to his honor.
If a widow says "I will not leave my father's house, support me there," the heirs can say "we will support you if you live with us, otherwise we will only give "כפי ברכת הבית" (taking into account what she is already getting by living in her father's house). However if she makes this claim because she is young and they are young, then they give her enough to support her alone [even though] she is in her father's house.

Some say that the latter is not a valid claim unless she is a stepmother, not their mother.
They are obliged to disburse to her money for her per-person tax and any other taxes on her, just as her husband disbursed for her, but they are not obligated in the costs of ransoming her [from captivity] nor in her medical costs for which she has a stipend, and not in her burial costs.

Siman 95

Since the heirs are obligated in the widow's sustenance, her handiwork is theirs. If the heirs tell her "take your handiwork for your sustenance", we do not listen to them. But if she says so, we listen to her.
If she was breastfeeding, she can say "I am not breastfeeding except for pay". And she can immediately claim [the money listed in] her writ [of marital obligation], even though she may not [re]marry within twenty-four months.
A widow does for the heirs all labors that a wife does for her husband except mixing the cup, making the bed, and washing face, hands, and feet.
Her discovery and the fruits of her properties are for herself.
If she begrudged herself and left over of her sustenance, and likewise if she left over of her [clothing?], [it] all is for the heirs.
When the widow comes to court to claim her food costs, we do not make calculations regarding her labor until the heirs arrive to claim her labor. If they find she has fruits of her labor they take it, and if not they depart on their way.  If the heirs are minors, court does calculate [the value of] her labor and allocates the value of her labor in the same manner that they allocate her food costs. 
A widow receiving her board payments from the orphans, to whom her husband left real property and she increased its value, some say that they are entitled to all of the increase and she is not even entitled to take compensation for her investment. And some say that she is herself entitled to the increase.  And some say that she is entitled to take compensation for her investment, but that her interest is subordinate. And if she is not receiving board payments from them, and her husband left her only such small assets that they are not sufficient for the ketubah payment she is owed, some say that if she said, "See what my husband left me, and I will improve its values for myself," and they were delinquent in collecting her ketubah payment, then even if the assets increased a thousand zuz the increase is all hers.  But if the assets just increased on their own, she takes her ketubah payment and the remainder goes to the heirs. And some say, that whether she said "See" or she did not say it, all increase in value belongs to the heirs, and she may not even collect her ketubah entitlement from it, but rather she takes compensation for her investment and her interest is subordinate. 

Note: And this is the key point, that the increase belongs entirely to the heirs, and she cannot collect her ketubah or her board from that increase (in the Mordochai, chapter "One who dies); and so, too, a widow who dwells a long time in her husband's house and receives board payments from them so long that the principle left to her by her husband is certainly exhausted, even though there is abundant increase that she brought about, she may not claim her ketubah payment from it (Tur and Maharin paragraph 176).  And some disagree, but whatever she claimed is deducted from the increased value and she is entitled to claim her ketubah payment against the principle and not against the increase (Maharil paragraph 86). And see above the Rema paragraph 100.

Siman 96

A widow may only collect her Ketubah, both the primary portion and any additions, with an oath [that she has not yet been paid].  Properties that she brought into the marriage (whether dowry or not), or properties that were specified in the Ketubah, in the event that the particular items that she brought into the marriage are still extant or if we know what items were purchased with the proceeds from those items, may be collected without an oath.  If the dowry properties are no longer extant and we cannot identify items that were purchased with the proceeds from them, and she now seeks reimbursement from his estate [for such properties] she may only collect with an oath.  The same applies if [her late husband] designated movable properties in the Ketubah - these are subject to the same determinations as the dowry properties.  If he designated land for her in the Ketubah, even if he only delineated one of its boundaries, she may collect it without an oath.  If she died before taking the oath, her heirs do not inherit her Ketubah, for [the general rule is that] a person does not bequeath money that can only be collected with an oath.  Rem"a:  See the details of this rule in (Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 108).  Some authorities say that though her heirs do not inherit her Ketubah, this is only true is she did not seize it.  If she did seize it, the heirs do inherit it because the properties are possessed.  Other authorities dispute this.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 108).  If the heirs say, "she took an oath," they must provide proof.  If they paid part of her Ketubah and produced a contractual debt on the remainder, her heirs inherit this debt even though she took no oath.   A widow that became mute and hinted before her death that she had not collected anything, this is sufficient to be considered an oath.  Rem"a: If a woman became mute and was subsequently widowed, her heirs may not collect her Ketubah because she is unable to take the oath.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 105:3). If however, she was divorced and then died, her heirs may take the oath, "that we were not commanded [*verify*]."  They may even collect form his heirs, if he died after her.
What oath does the widow swear? That the husband did not allot [anything] for her, and that she did not allot anything for herself from his possessions. And there is one that says, that she needs to swear that she did not forgive her marriage document and that she did not sell [it] to him: gloss: And if she swore plainly: that I did not benefit from my marriage document, it is sufficient (the Ran, ch. ha-sholeah). And they had a custom also to make her swear that she did not waste anything without the permission of the husband, and if her husband is mentally incapable, they say plainly: that she did not waste more than what is appropriate (Ma"Hariq  Root 19):
If the widow wants to collect her ketuba, but does not want to swear until her children grow up, for maybe they will exempt her from the oath, we do not listen to her. 
A widow who says: My husband gave me a gift in lieu of my collecting my marriage contract payment, if she is still in possession of the gift and she could have claimed she had nothing from her husband, she is believed since she could have easily lied.
A widow her sold or gave [property secured by her ketubah payment]: [her transaction] stands if she swore at the end, and [the amount she owes] is deleted from her ketubah payment.  And these words apply in [the case of] movable property; but in real property even if she did swear at the end her sale or gift does not stand, unless a court approved it, even a lay-people's court. And some say that the court must collect it for her.

Note: And some say that even in movable property [cases] her sale or gift is void, despite her having sworn at the end, because she did not swear at the beginning. And some say that the judge should decide according to his discretion (Mordochai, chapter "One who writes"), because where the judge concludes that she has not been seized by troubles, such as [her husband's] having died suddenly or such, it may be right to judge that her sale or gift stand (Rosh, rule 85).  And similarly if the receiver or buyer are well-established and it seems right to him to such this way. And all of this is when the woman retracted [her agreement to the transaction] after she swore, but if she has not retracted, her sale and gift stand ab initio (Maharik, root 18); and therefore a widow who did not swear against her ketubah, and marries bringing to her new marriage much wealth from her first husband, should still swear. And if she dies, her second husband inherits from her and is enriched by what she held (notes of the Mordochai on Ketubot). And see above paragraph 101.
A widow who forgave the debt of her [late] husband's debtor, it is not valid. 
At times, even a divorcee is required to swear [in order to collect her ketuba], even when the husband makes no claim, as when she renders the ketuba defective. For example, if her ketuba was for 1000 [zuz] and he said to her, "You already received your ketuba," and she says, "I received only 1 maneh (=100 zuz)," even if she has witnesses [who testify] how much she received, and even if she specified the exact amount received, even if only 1/2 perutah, she should not be paid [the remainder] except with an oath.
Similarly, if one witness testified that the ketuba had been paid [she may not collect except with an oath].
Similarly, if she is collecting [her lien] from (lit. preying on) purchasers [she needs to take an oath denying prior payment of the ketuba].  Rama: Similarly if he had two wives and divorced one, she needs to swear to the second wife (Beit Yosef in the name of Magid Mishne), as will be explained infra se'if 16.
And she can claim it not in front of him. This is if he is far away, but if he is nearby, so that the messenger can go and return within thirty days, he informs him, and if he [the husband] does not come, they make her swear and she can take it. And the woman pays the wages of the messenger and adds onto the <i>ketubah</i>.
All of these oaths, even though they are of Rabbinic origin, are undertaken while holding a [sacred] object. If she went ahead and grabbed the money but does not want to swear, we do not remove the money from her hands, nor do we reverse the oath (to have the husband swear that he had already paid, and then extract the money from her).
When she wants to swear [and collect her ketuba], if it is suspected that she may swear falsely, her litigant swears [that the ketuba was paid] and is absolved of paying. If he is also suspected, "there is neither oath nor payment".
When a lone witness testifies that the ketuba has been paid, the husband can scheme to force her into a Biblical oath. How? he pays off her ketuba a second time in front of the lone witness and another witness with him, and then claims the original payment, saying, "I gave it to you as a loan."  But he has to notify the lone witness of his intentions [in advance].
If she produced her ketuba document, with an amount of 1000 zuz [written in the document], he says, "It was totally paid off," and she says, "I was not paid anything, but you only owe me 500 [zuz] because there was a trust (amana - an amana documents a loan that never actually took place, and one party trusts the other not to use it for collection) between you and me, she may collect [500 zuz] without an oath. But if she says, "this ketuba document contains only 500 [zuz]," then she may not collect anything with this ketuba in which it is written 1000 [zuz]. Rama: But the husband must take a "heset" oath (Rabbinical oath), and he is absolved from paying (Rambam chapter 16, and written likewise in Beit Yosef).
She says, "I married as a virgin and my <i>ketubah</i> was 200 [<i>zuz</i>]" and the husband or the inheritors say, "No, you were a widow." If the <i>ketubah</i> was lost or they were in a place where they do not write a <i>ketubah</i>, if there were witnesses that they made [the wedding] for her as is customary to do for virgins, her <i>ketubah</i> is 200, even if one of the witnesses was a youth when he saw [the wedding] and is now grown, [so long as he has] another with him, it [the testimony] is good. If there were no witnesses, she only takes one <i>maneh</i> [a coin = 100 <i>zuz</i>] and the husband needs to take an oath. Some say a Torah level oath and some write a <i>heset</i> oath [a lesser severity, Rabbinic level oath]. Rem"a: And some say in a place where they do not write <i>ketubot</i>, [he takes a] <i>heset</i> oath. In a place where they do write [<i>ketubot</i>], but it was lost, [he takes a] Torah level oath, since anyone is able to pay and say, "I paid it." Therefore he admitted to part of it (Magid Mishneh Ch. 16). See later (100:6).
If a man married four woman (who were all married in separate instances)  and then dies, and the women come to collect their Ketubah, the first must swear to the second that she possesses none of the husbands assets, and the second in turn swears to the third, and the third to the fourth.  The fourth then swears to the orphans; even if they are adults, [the wives] cannot be compensated from them without an oath.
If all the ketubot [of the 4 wives above] were signed on the same day, if in a place where they also write the time, the earlier [ketubot] take precedence [in collection - because their lien is earlier]. If they do not write the time, then each lien takes effect simultaneously. 
One who married four women -- this one's ketubah [specifying a payment of] 100, this one's 200, this one's 300, and this one's 400 -- and all of then were signed the same day and then he died, and he did not have sufficient [assets in his estate to pay for] all the ketubah payments, how do they divide [the available assets]? They see whether, if the money is divided by the number of women, whether the result would equal the ketubah payment of the one owed the least. If it is less, they divide equally.  And if the money is more than that, they divide it such that the payment to the least is equal to her ketubah level, and then again they divide the remainder among the remaining [wives] in the same manner.
When the court or the heirs cause the widow to swear when she comes to collect her ketuba, the oath may only be administered outside the court.  [Why?] Because the courts used to avoid administering oaths for fear that she would not be exact (and would swear falsely - by a small amount), and an oath outside of court is not so stringent, for it takes place without the name of G_d, and without holding a sacred object, and only with a curse [should she swear falsely]. If the orphans wish her to take a vow (of abstinence - instead of an oath; vow = "neder"], she vows what they request, and they administer the vow in court and she collects her ketuba monies. The vow must forswear something that results in personal (fleshly) hardship, and must be lifelong. A vow is valid only if she has not yet remarried, but if she has already remarried, she may not collect with a vow, for her [second] husband may invalidate the vow.
A divorcee who presents for oath [to collect her ketuba], we administer the oath in court.
There is one opinion that nowadays we require a widow to take an oath in court, since on the matter regarding which we regularly require an oath from her, that we decree - under penalty of excommunication and a biblical oath - that she acknowledge what she has received of her dower, the punishment is not as great as (an oath). For at the moment she takes the oath, her oath becomes false. Rem"a: She must swear before three who are fit [to be judges]; if she swore before three who are relatives, she must take another oath (Beit Yosef, citing Responsa Rashba and Responsa Maharam at the end of Hafla'ah). She should preferably take the oath in the presence of the orphans, but if she swore away from their presence, or if the orphans do not want to be present for the oath, we accept her oath outside their presence (Rashba ibid.). If a widow swears about her dower, the orphans may later demand, under threat of excommunication, information from anyone who knows whether the widow pledged any of their property (Rivash no. 325).

Siman 97

If a man appoints his wife a shopkeeper or a guardian, he may make her swear even in a claim which is unsupported about two silvers. But if she does not do business and only is busy with housekeeping and working with dough, like all women, he is unable to make her swear in an unsupported claim.
A man who appoints his wife as a shopkeeper or a gaurdian, cannot make her swear until she claims her <i>ketubah</i>. And some say that he can make her swear any time he wants. If he designated land for her in the <i>ketubah</i>, even if she came to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, it is not called claiming her <i>ketubah</i> and he cannot make her swear (Mordechai Ch. Hakotev) because of the first reason.

Siman 98

If the husband exempted her from taking an oath [to collect her Ketubah] she may collect without an oath.  The nature of the exemption is dependent on the language he used when exempting her.  For example, if he wrote, "I have no vow or oath against you," he cannot force her take any oath, but he can force her heirs - if he divorced her and she died, the heirs must take the 'vow of heirs'. [Also] anyone who comes with her permission, such as a case in which she sold her Ketubah to others and she was divorced and subsequently died, and the purchasers claim the Ketubah, they must swear, for his command did not apply to them.  If she is still alive the purchasers cannot collect unless she swears that she was not repaid.  Rem"a: See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 105).  If he exempted his wife from swearing when he died, she may collect her Ketubah without swearing.  But if [the members of the court] see after this that she is destroying the property, she must swear. If there are witnesses that attest that she destroyed [the property] or gave it away, or if she admits to having done so, she must repay [the estate] and she is not believed to say that her husband ordered her to do so.  If [her husband] gave her the power to be believed as two witnesses, she is trusted.

We also require her heirs to take an oath, and anyone else who comes in her stead, if there is some defect in the Ketubah ot if there is a custodian.  This is true even if [her husband] gave her authority to appoint a custodian.
If he wrote, "I have no vow or oath against you or your inheritors or all those who come with your permission," he may not force any oath on her or her inheritors or those who come with her permission.  But his inheritors and those who come with his permission, such as buyers who acquired it from him, they can force an oath on her and her inheritors and those who come with her permission, such as if she were divorced or died.  But if she was widowed and died before taking the oath, neither her inheritors nor those who come with her permission may collect her Ketubah.
If he wrote for her, "I and my inheritors and those who come with my permission have no vow or oath against you or your inheritors or those who come with your permission," neither he nor his inheritors nor those who come with his permission may force an oath on her or her inheritors or those who come with her permission.  This is even if she or the inheritors of her Ketubah or the inheritors of the inheritors are damaged.  However, if she was made a guardian after the death of her husband, the exemption is not effective on this.  However, for a guardianship that began during the lifetime of the husband, it is effective, as she cannot be made to swear even by way of another oath.  There is one who says that even if he did not exempt her, the inheritors cannot force an oath on the guardianship that began during the lifetime of the husband.
Regarding that which she sold between death [of her husband] and burial, for the purpose of burial, we do not force an oath on her even by way of another oath that she must take.
If he wrote "without a vow, without an oath;" even if he wrote "from these assets," the inheritors may require an oath from her, unless he explicitly exempted her from the inheritors.
Even if he trusted her vis-a-vis his inheritors and his proxies, it is not effective to collect from purchasers without an oath. Rem"a: Some say that his exemption and the credibility that he extended to her are not even effective vis-a-vis his inheritors, even if he explicitly exempted her with regard to his inheritors (R. Hananel, R"i, Ro"sh). This is specifically when she is alive, but if she has died, or is unable to swear, she or her inheritors collect her dower without an oath (Rivash nos. 169 and 108). It seems to me that is is proper to rule accordingly.

Siman 99

A widow who comes to collect her ketuba money, we appraise all of her clothes, both weekday and Sabbath clothes, and subtract them from the ketuba. 

Rama: A chalutza (woman who underwent chalitza ceremony freeing her from the need to undergo levirate marriage) has the same rules as a widow (Beit Yosef in the name of Rivash chapter 302).

Mechaber: But [in the case of] a divorcee who was divorced by her husband by his choice, without any claim [of wrongdoing by the wife] we do not appraise the weekday clothes, although we do appraise holiday and Sabbath clothes.

Rama: They cannot force her to return the clothes in exchange for money (Beit Yosef in the name of Ritva), rather she takes them in exchange for their value (Responsa Rosh rule 80).
If one gives his wife a gift, even though he divorces her of his own volition, she is credited her gift. Rem"a: It seems that there is a mistake here, and it should properly be: even though he divorces her against her will, for example, if she was unfaithful to him, his gift nevertheless belongs to her. Similarly, a widow claims her gift as long is it is not clothing or jewelry that she uses to beautify herself. This is specifically if the husband made them [a gift] to her, but if others gave her jewelry at the time of the marriage, they intended it as a full-fledged gift, and they are considered like her milog assets (Beit Yosef citing Rivash no. 301).

Siman 100

The law of the Gemara is that the marriage contract--that is, the essence of the marriage contract and the additions--can only be collected from land.  By decree of the Geonim, they can be collected even from movable property.  This is also true for all of the conditions of the marriage, other than the document of the male sons [a document stating that a woman's sons from prior marriages will inherit from her current husband].  Therefore, therefore, if the inheritors collected money while in their father's debt, [the wife] may collect from them.  However, the inheritors may remove her [from the movable property] by giving her land (R' Alfas).  This applies only to free movable property [i.e. movable property in his possession], but if the husband sold them or gave them as a gift while healthy, she may not collect from them.
Rem"a:  There are those who say that this applies only if the husband gave them to others, but if he gave them to his inheritors as a gift while healthy, his wife may collect her marriage contract from them (Hagahot Maimoni 16, Mahara"i 96, Mahari"v 156), as anything he gave to the inheritors was given only as an inheritance, and his wife may collect her marriage contract from there (Mordekhai citing Mohara"m).  Someone who commanded that his belongings be given to another after his death, even though he gave the command while healthy, his wife may collect her marriage contract from there, for it is considered to be the gift of one who is deathly ill, from which a wife may collect her marriage contract (viz. Choshen HaMishpat 251, 252, and 257).
If the inheritors sold them after his death, she may collect from them.  Nowadays our custom is to write in all marriage contracts that she has a lien on all his property--land, movable objects, and movable objects acquired via land--which he has and will acquire.  Nonetheless, our custom is not to collect from movable property sold by the inheritors due to the decree of the market.  See Choshen Mishpat 113.  See below, 118, whether a wife is obligated to bury her husband before collecting the marriage contract.
Neither the main part nor the added part of her dower is collected from anything but the poorest quality land. They are not collected from the betterments made to the property after his death, regardless of whether the betterments were made by the inheritors or by the buyers who she comes to repossess. They are only collected from the possessions [of the late husband], not from potential assets. Rem"a: If a father willed a gift to be given to his son after two or three years, or willed that he not be given his portion of the inheritance for two or three years, the property is considered "potential," not "possessed," and the son's wife may not collect her dower from it (Mahar"i Weil no. 40). Some say that if Jacob dies while his son Reuben is alive, and he left a widow who is supported by his estate, Reuben's widow does not collect her dower from those assets, since they are subordinated to his father's widow upon Reuben's death (Mordechai). This is only if the inheritors have no right to clear the widow's alimony [with a lump sum payment], but if they can pay off the widow, Reuben's widow may collect from there (ibid.). Work wages that never reached his hands are called "potential" (Mordechai on Bava Batra). If an object of his was stolen, then he died, and the stolen object was then recovered, it is considered "possessed" (Responsa Maharam). 

A loan due to the husband is considered "possessed," and she may collect from it, even if the debtor is a Samaritan. Rem"a: All of this only applies to the main and added parts of her dower. But her dowry and other tzon barzel assets have the status of any debt (Magid Mishneh on ch. 16 and Beit Yosef in the name of Nimukei Yosef, Ran, and Rabbenu Yeruham).

Some say that nevertheless they are only collected from poor-quality land (Ran on Gittin).
If there is land with no attachments , she collects from it. If not, she collects from land that the husband sold or gave away, whether as a healthy gift of as a gift causa mortis. Even if she acquiesced to his sale or gift, it makes no difference, unless they effected a transaction with her beforehand. If he sold land to one person, and she did not acquiesce, and then he sold the same land to another, or different land, and she acquiesced and signed on it for him, she may not collect from it. From the first: some say she may collect, and some say she may not. Rem"a: see above 90:17.
If one was married to two women and sold his field, and the buyers first transacted with the first wife and then with him: the second wife may repossess it from the buyer, the first wife from the second wife, and the buyer from the first wife. This continues round and round until they reach a compromise.
If he denominates in the main and added parts of her dower an unspecified currency, she collects from the least valuable of currencies. How so? If he marries a woman in one place and divorces her elsewhere  - Rem"a: and the wife is there with him; however, if he sent her a get at the place where they wed, the place of their wedding is followed (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Rashba) - if the currency of the place where they wed was more valuable than the currency of the place they divorced, he gives her the currency of the place they divorced. If the currency of the place where they divorced was more valuable than the currency of the place they wed, he gives her the currency of the place they wed. This is specifically if the value of the money he makes available for her collection is two hundred and one hundred. But less than that, he may not. If he denominated in her dower contract a specific currency, whether in the main part or added part of the dower, she collects from that, as was written in the dower. Rem"a: Tzon barzel assets always follow the locale where they were subordinated, like any debt (Magid Mishneh ch. 16, Rashba). Where an extra third is added to what she gives him, as explained above in section 66, it has the status of tzon barzel assets and not of additional dower (Maharik no. 81).
A widow, if she does not have her dower contract, does not even collect the main part of her dower. Similarly, a divorcee, if the husband claims: "I paid it" or "She forgave it," she does not even collect the main part of her dower until she produces her dower contract. When does this apply? Where it is normal to write a dower contract, but where they do not normally write a dower contract and rather rely on court stipulation, she collects the main part of her dower even though she does not have her dower contract, whether she was widowed or divorced. Rem"a: If there are witnesses that her dower contract was lost or incinerated, even a place where they normally write a contract is akin to a place where they do not write a contract (Hagahot Alfasi on Ketubot). Some say that even where they normally write a dower contract she collects her dower without a contract, and they have no credibility to claim that they paid it off (Tur, citing R"i). This is not only for the main part of the dower, but even the part that it is customary to add in all places (Mordechai and Responsa Maymuni, end of Laws of Marriage). This seems to be the rationale of later authorities as well (Maharik nos. 18 and 114; Mahara"i no. 229). But in our countries it is not customary to collect without a dower contract, and according to all if there is no clear custom, even if she has her dower contract but it is not court-validated, she cannot collect anything (Mahara"i ibid, Mahar"i Weil no. 113, Mahari"k no. 18). However, if the widow seized it and she has a strong claim based on the fact that she could have denied the assets, she is believed when she says that he added to her dower (Mahar"i Weil no. 232). See above section 66. Some say that if she already married another, she no longer has credibility to collect without her dower contract (Mordechai). In any case where she has credibility, she must swear that she was not already paid. In cases where she has no credibility, if the husband is alive he must swear that he paid her [dower]. If he is not alive, the orphans are exempt [from paying her] even without an oath (Divrei Harav, also implied by Tur). If she has her dower contract but it was cut by a knife, she cannot collect, even if it was not cut both horizontally and vertically (Rivash no. 383).
If a woman comes to court and says, "My husband has died; permit me to remarry," and she does not mention her dower at all, we permit her to remarry, and we have her swear, and she is given her dower. If she comes and says, "My husband died; give me my dower," we do not even permit her to remarry.
If she came and said: "My husband died; permit me to remarry and give me my dower," we permit her to remarry and grant her the dower. But if she came and said: "My husband died; give me my dower and permit me to remarry," we permit her but do not grant her the dower. However, if she seized it, we do not take it away from her. One authority says that in either case we do not permit her, since she mentioned the dower.
In a place where they do not [customarily] write a dower contract, and they bring witnesses that he wrote her a dower contract, one authority says that this has the status of a place where they write a dower contract, and she cannot collect without it. But one authority says that she collects without a dower contract.
A woman who presents a marriage contract but does not have a bill of divorce with her and says to her husband, "You divorced me and I lost the bill of divorce.  Give me my marriage contract," and he says, "I did not divorce you," he is obligated to give her the essence of her marriage contract but does not give her the additions, until she brings proof that he divorced her or the bill of divorce is presented.  There are those who say that if she does not bring proof of the divorce, he does not give her even the essence of the marriage contract, because after she demands her marriage contract, she is not believes regarding the divorce, as was explained above, 17:2, and therefore she does not take her marriage contract (Tur), and this is the essence of the matter.
If her husband said to her, "This is how it was:  I divorced and gave her the entire marriage contract--the essence and the additions--and she wrote me a receipt and my receipt was lost," because he could have said, "I did not divorce her," and he would not be obligated to pay the additions, he is believed, and she is forced to take a Rabbinic oath and he gives her the essence, and he takes a Rabbinic oath regarding the additions.
If she presents a bill of divorce but does not have a marriage contract with it, if it is the custom of that place not to write a marriage contract, she collects the essence of the marriage contract with the bill of divorce that she has on hand.  If the custom is to write a marriage contract, she is not even entitled to the essence of the marriage contract until she presents a marriage contract, and her husband may take a Rabbinic oath against her claim and be exempted [from paying].
If she presented two bills of divorce and two marriage contracts, and the first marriage contract predates the first bill of divorce, and the second marriage contract predates the second bill of divorce, she collects two marriage contracts.
If she produced two dower contracts and one get, she only collects one dower. Which does she collect? If they are of equal value, the later one cancels the earlier one, and she can only repossess [properties sold] after the later date. If one of the two was for a larger sum than the other, and he did not stipulate to her "And I add such and such over the first one," if she wishes to collect from the first one, she may repossess from the earlier date, or she may collect the later one from the later date. If he stipulated to her "And I add such and such over the first one," she collects the earlier one from the earlier date, and the added value from the later date. When does this apply? When both are from [the time of] betrothal or both from marriage. However, if one was from betrothal and the second from marriage, she may only collect using the one from marriage.
With 2 divorces and one marriage contract, [the divorcee] only has one marriage contract; One who divorced his wife and returned nothing to her, according to the first marriage contract he should return to her:
If she produced a dower contract and a get after the death of the husband: if the get is dated earlier than the contract, she uses the get to collect the main part of the dower, if it is not usual to write a dower contract, (and with the dower contract) she may collect everything included in this dower, since she becomes entitled to it upon his death. If the dower contract is dated earlier than the get, she only collects one dower, since he remarried her under the terms of the first dower contract.

Siman 101

A widow, as long as the Ketuba is in her possession, [is able to] collect [the money due to her] forever, whether she is supported in her father's house or her [new] husband's house, and she is assured [this] even after she remarries. Even if seven years have passed, [the money] is not withheld [from her], so long as she does not render it defective, i.e. she collects some, or she uses it as collateral for a loan. And if the Ketuba is not in her possession, and she comes to collect with a claim to the court in a place where they do not write, [debts such as these into the public record] if she is supported in her father's house, (Rem''a: or she remarried (Mordechai, the end of Chapter 'HaNose')) she does not collect until the end of a twenty-five year period. But if she remains quiet for twenty-five years and does not make a claim, she forgives [the debt]. And if she makes a claim within twenty-five years [of her previous husband's death], the twenty-five year period [she must wait to collect the debt] is counted from the day she [initially] makes her claim. Additionally, her heirs need to make the claim within twenty-five years of her death, and if they remain silent longer than twenty-five years, they forgive [the debt]. (Rem''a: And any [woman] who remembers and says that the silence was not due to forgiveness [of the loan], it is as if she made a claim (Ran, Chapter 'HaNose')
Even if she is given food from her father's house, if the heirs honor her by sending her food themselves, her silence is not considered forgiving the debt, [for we suspect] that her silence was due to shame and not because she forgave it.
The dowry is never forgiven, even if she postponed [collection] for several years.
A divorcee never forgives the debt, even is she postponed [collecting] several years.

Siman 102

If a man died and his widow (Rem"a: or his divorcee) comes to collect her Ketubah, and there is a creditor on his property, if the date of one of them is earlier, and there is only enough land left to pay one of them, the one with the earlier date collects, and the other is deferred, whether it be the widow or the creditor.  Even if the one with the later date seized the property, the court reclaims it.  Rem"a: If the Ketubah is earlier she cannot say, "I will not collect the Ketubah now.  I would rather be sustained in my husband's house and collect the Ketubah later."  Instead, we give her the Ketubah immmediately, and the remainder goes to the creditor.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Chosen Mishpat 97). 
If the estate only contains movable property that are not subject to 'first rights', such as property that was not acquired in conjuction with land, they are given to the creditor, even if he is the later on, and the wife is deferred from collecting both the primary [Ketubah] and any excess obligation.  Nevertheless,  if she seized the property, even outside of the court, we do not reclaim it from her.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that we do reclaim it if she seized property.  This was the position of the Maharil and Mahari Veil.  There is not distinction in these matters between a loan that was recorded in a contract and a verbal loan that is well known.  In the case of an unknown verbal loan she can say, "perhaps he does not owe you."  All authorities agree that if she seized an object that her husband was watching for another person she must return it.  Some authorities say that we do not explicitly mention movable properties that are acquired through acquisition of land in the Ketubah, and this is the standard practice.  Even if was included, in the present time we are not concerned for it, as is explained earlier (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 100).
If the time of both is equal, or if he married and borrowed, and later acquired property, or he borrowed and married and then acquired, such that both of their liens took effect when he acquired, whether he left [in his estate] land or movable property, they are given to the creditor and the wife is deferred from collecting the primary [Ketubah] and any excess.  If the wife seized the land, if she did so in the court, such as the court collected it for her before they knew about the presence of the creditor, we do not reclaim it.  If she seized it on her own, however, even with a professional appraisal, we remove it from her.  If she seized movable property, even without the court, we do not remove it form her.  Rem"a: If a widow that comes to collect her Ketubah and the orphans demand that she provide a guarantor so that in the event that higher priority creditors are found she will return what she collected, we do not listen to them and she may collect without a guarantor.   
If [the estate] is large enough to pay both of them with land and currency, if the time [of their liens] is equal we give the currency to the creditor and the land to the wife (Rem"a: Even if she has a dowry with the Ketubah).  If she went forward and collected currency, some authorities say that we reclaim it from her and give it to the creditor.  (Rem"a: Nevertheless, if the creditor prefers land, we give him the land).  If the timing is not equal, the earlier claimant receives the currency.  If the later claimant seized the currency, some authorities say that we reclaim it form him.
<i>Nichsei tzon ubarzel</i> were written in the <i>ketubah</i>, and she claims that they were destroyed or the husband took them, her relationship to the <i>nichsei tzon ubarzel</i> is like any other lender, and she swears that she did not take them, nor did she give them away or forgive them, and she divides them with other lenders. Rem"a: If the lender collects the dowry of the woman that's substantial, see C"M siman 97 seif 26.
A guarantor to the women with respect to the basic ketuba monies or the additional ketuba monies, is not required to pay even if he made a "kinyan" (barter acquisition protocol, typically picking up a handkerchief or other utensil to show that he acquired the handkerchief in return for agreeing to possibly pay off the ketuba; he then returns the handkerchief).  This applies to an unrelated woman, but if he guaranteed his daughter-in-law's ketuba, he is required to pay if he made a kinyan.  If he was a "receiving" [guarantor] ("arev kablan"; there are different explanations, but Rashi Gittin 49b, loc cit b'Kablan in reference to a loan guarantor explains that the monies passed thru his hands on the way to the borrower, indicating a higher level of guarantee), that he told her, "Marry this man and I will give you [the ketuba]," then he mortgages himself even without making a kinyan, even to an unrelated woman.  Rama: Some authorities say that all guarantors may mortgage themselves with a kinyan (Tur in the name of Ra'avad), and to his daughter-in-law [he may mortgage himself] even without a kinyan (thus writes Tur according to the opinion of Ra'avad). Some say that a guarantor to the groom with respect to the dowry is like a guarantor to the woman with respect to the ketuba (i.e. is NOT required to pay; Mordechai, chapter Get Pashut, and Hagahot of Gittin). Others argue and say that a guarantor of a dowry is required to pay like other guarantors (R. Eliezer ben Samuel of Metz, and Ba'al haTeruma). However, as long as he has not yet married her, he [the guarantor] can repeal his guarantee (so writes Beit Yosef in Choshen Mishpat chapter 129). 
[In the case of] a guarantor to a woman with respect to her ketuba, [whose guarantee was made] in a manner that requires him to pay, and her husband divorced her and did not have property to pay the ketuba, the woman may not collect from the guarantor until the husband vows "al da'at rabim" (on the volition of the public; a non-reversible vow) to have no benefit from his wife, so that they may not conspire against the guarantor (i.e. the guarantor would pay the ketuba, and the husband would then remarry her, thereby cheating the guarantor out of the ketuba money).  And it is forbidden for anyone to advise the husband that he should divorce his wife so that she may collect the ketuba from the guarantor, and then remarry her, for maybe he will not actually vow to have no benefit from her.  Nevertheless, if his father guaranteed his daughter-in-law's ketuba for his son, and the son is a penurious Torah scholar, and his father is not supporting him, it is permitted to offer this advice. Rama: A guarantor to a woman with respect to her dowry, and he wrote in a document that whenever both of them (i.e. husband and wife) will claim the money from him that he will pay them, and the husband died, even so the woman may collect the amount guaranteed (lit. written) (Rivash, chapter 481).
Similarly, if he (the husband) consecrated all his belongings and then divorced his wife, she may not collect the ketuba [from the guarantor] until the husband vows to have not benefit from her. 
But from purchasers [of his land] she may extract payment of her ketuba (because her lien precedes their purchase) even without the husband vowing to abstain from her benefit, and if he so desires, he may remarry her. 

Siman 103

A widow, including one widowed while engaged as long as her fiance wrote her a ketuba, as well as a widow of a marriage, may sell her husband's posessions to raise the money for her ketuba without needing to go to a court or make an announcement, and it does not matter whether she is raising the full amount of the ketuba at one time or she is selling on three or four occasions to raise a small amount each time, she can sell without an expert court, but she does need a court of three regular trustworthy men who know how to appraise land. Rem"a: And this is specifically for the main part of the ketuba and any additions [written into the ketuba], but she cannot sell  without a court in order to raise money for [reclaiming] her dowry, because the dowry money is just like a regular debt [without the special status of a ketuba] (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ritv"a chapter 11, "almanah nizoneit"). If she "sells" to herself by exchanging equal amounts [NEEDS BETTER TRANSLATION] the sale is valid, but some disagree.
The orphans [children of a woman's deceased husband] must accept responsibility (i.e. title insurance) for the sale [by the wife of the husband's possessions to raise money for the ketuba], whether she sells them or a court sells them. Therefore, even if the court sold by accident, such as a case where the wife forgave to the orphans to the fulfillment of the ketuba (since the wife forgave the ketuba, she no longer should have a right to sell property to raise money to pay the ketuba), the orphans may not seize the assets from the buyer (responsum of the Ro"sh 63)
A divorcee can only sell through an expert court. Similarly, widow who has remarried may only sell through an expert court.
If the court sells property (to raise money for her ketuba) and gives it to her, she does not need to swear that she sold too cheaply... Rama: but she swears that her husband did not give her purses of coins for her support, and that she did not grab any of his belongings (Tur). Mechaber: ...but if she herself sold property (without the court), she must include in her oath that she did not sell too cheaply. 
A widow who assessed the property and took it herself (in direct payment of the ketuba, without selling it), her action is void, even if she announced a sale (and there were no takers), unless the property was assessed in a court (even) of non-scholars. Some say that it is not valid until the assessment took place in a court of experts. 
A widow whose ketuba was 200 zuz, and she sold land worth 100 zuz for 200 zuz, or she sold land worth 200 zuz for 100 zuz, her ketuba has been paid off.
If her ketubah was worth 100 and she sold land worth 1o1 for 100, her sale is annulled.  Even if she says: I will return the dinar to the inheritors. 
If her ketubah was four hundred zuz, and she sold to this one land the value of a maneh (100) for a maneh, and so to the second and so to the third. And then to the fourth she sold the equivalent of a maneh and a dinar for a dinar, only the sale to the fourth one is annulled.  

Siman 104

When a court sells property to collect the Ketubah for a widow they must first announce that they will do so.  They may announce it for 30 consecutive days, or for 60 days if they only announce it on Monday and Thursday.  They must announce both morning and night.  When they make the announcement they must define the field [to be sold] by it's boundaries and the value and estimation, and that they intend to sell it to collect for a woman's Ketubah.
If the court sold without first announcing the sale, even if they sold it for the proper price, it is considered as an error in a basic law, and they must redo the sale with [the required period of] announcement.
A court that announced as is proper and checked well and was exacting in the evaluation, even though they erred and sold [property] worth 100 <i>zuz</i> for 200 or 200 for 100, their sale is upheld.  However, if they did not check the evaluation, and they did not write a letter of review, which reflects the scrupulousness of the evaluation and announcement, and they erred and overvalued by one sixth or undervalued by one sixth, their sale is nullified.  [If they erred by] less than one sixth [of the actual value], their sale is upheld.  So too, if they sold real estate at a time when they did not need to announce it, and they erred and undervalued by one sixth or overvalued by one sixth, their sale is nullified, even though they announced it.  There are those who say that since they announced it, even if they erred by double [the actual value], the transaction is upheld (Tur citing the Ro"sh).  [If they erred by] less than one sixth, their sale is upheld and they need not return the over- or undercharge, even though they did not announce the sale.  What is the time when they are not required to announce?  At the time when they are selling real estate for burial or for food for the woman and the sons, or to give taxes, they do not require an announcement, for the matter is widely known.  So too if they lent money for these needs, when they sell property to repay the loans, they do not need to announce.
Similarly if a court sold items that do not require public notice [of sale to attract bidders] and erred by a sixth [or more, in evaluating the value] the sale is void. Less than a sixth, the sale is valid. These are the things which do not require public notice: Slaves, documents, and movable effects. Slaves lest they run away; documents and effects lest they be stolen. Therefore they are appraised in court and sold then and there, though if the marketplace is close to the city, the items are taken there to be sold. <i>In a place where public notice is never given, all items are treated [in all respects] as things for which notice is not given.</i> Tur
If they did err by a sixth, in which case the sale is void, they may uphold the sale by returning the <i>ona'ah</i> money (unilaterally). There are those who disagree.
A proxy [for the widow] who sold [the 'ketuba'] but made a mistake and/or was cheated, even for the most insignificant sum - the sale is null and void even if the proxy was appointed by the court. On the other hand, if the proxy misled the buyer, up to 20%, the sale is legally binding and the one who appointed the proxy is entitled to the difference. Note: Some say that a judge appointed by royal command who sells [the 'ketuba'] via a proxy is preferable to other court appointed proxies and is like a court that erred but whose sales are valid, and certainly if he/it sold [the 'ketuba'] him/itself (Ribash, section 179).

Siman 105

A woman is allowed to sell or give to others her marriage contract whether it is all of it or just part of it. The buyer or the receiver take her place that if she should become a widow or a divorcee they get to receive her marriage contract. But if she should die during the lifetime of her husband then they get nothing. If she sold it to her husband, the sale is a sale and there cannot be a delay unless he would write her another one that would be in the spirit of the marriage contract.
The woman who sells her ketubbah to others and her husband dies in her lifetime, if she died before she swore regarding her ketubbah, the one who bought it and the one who accepted it [do not receive] anything. Regarding what are we speaking? When she is widowed and she died, [in the case] when she was not able to pay [off the debt] from [being upon] the orphans except by oath. But if she was divorced and she died, the purchasers swear an oath that they have not left an order, and they take. And specifically when she died, but if she is alive, she needs to swear that it will be paid, and if she does not want to swear, the purchasers will lose [their money]. If she said that she will be paid after she sells [her ketubbah], she is believed, because if she had wanted to forgive [the debt]. But if she said that it will be paid before the sale, she is not believed.
The one who died and leaves children and a widow [behind], and the widow died before she swore [an oath] regarding the ketubbah, the first born takes two times [as much].
The one who sells her ketubbah, either to her husband or to others, she does not lose anything from the conditions of the ketubbah. But the one who forgives her ketubbah to her husband [so that he does not have to pay], she loses all of the conditions of the ketubbah. Ribash: And even her dowry is lost, if she is not visable. Mahariv: And there are those who say that her dowry is not lost except if she said so: All that is in the document is forgiven to you.
One who gives up her marriage contract does not need to effect a transaction and does not need witnesses, as long as her words can be relied upon, and they are not words of jest and jeering or words of astonishment, but rather have the proper mindset.
Rem"a:  For example, if he had been constantly quarreling with her and she gave up her marriage contract to him so that he might dwell with her in harmony, her absolution is nullified even though she did not claim that it was forced (Responsa of the Rashb"a #883).
One who sells a debt document to his fellow, and then he goes back and forgives the debt, it is forgiven.
And even the inheritor may forgive. 
Therefore, if she sells her ketubah and her husband dies and then she dies, her son can forgive the debt, and the sale will be invalid. 
And even if she has no inheritor except for this son, and it turns out that he has to pay her the ketubah, he can forgive it for himself in order to annul the sale and then he inherits the ketubah. 
If, in the life of his father, a man sold the ketuba of his mother, so that in the circumstance that his father died first, and then his mother died, and he would consequentially inherit his mother's ketuba, and the purchaser would stand in his place to collect the ketuba from the estate, and he made a condition that if his mother complained about the sale, that [the purchaser] would not remove her from her complaint; and she subsequently died without having complained about the sale; the son may not say, "I stand in the place of my mother, and just like she could have complained about the transaction, I can also complain about the transaction and hereby abrogate it," for he has definitely relinquished his own right to complain.

Siman 106

One who writes [in a document] all of his possessions to his children, whether they are male or whether they are female, whether he is healthy or his is on his death bed, and write to his wife land of any size, or a palm tree for its fruit, or fruit attached [to the ground] and they still need the ground [for nutrients], since he made her a partner among the children, and she was silent when he informed her and she did not protest, she has lost the main portion of her <i> ketuba </i> as well as the additional part [added by the husband] but not her dowry (Maggid Mishnah Chap. 6 of Z'chiya) and she cannot demand [lit. tear] these possessions at all. But property that comes to him after [he wrote this document], she may collect from them, even if they come from those very possessions [that he wrote in the document], for example, if one of the children died and he inherits [the property originally intended for that child]. 
If he wrote only movable properties to his wife [when he wrote all his assets to his children], or he retained some land for himself, her Ketubah still retains its force.  Based on the edict of the Geonim that the Ketubah may be collected from movable properties, even if he retained some movable properties [for himself], he Ketubah retains its force, for she can say, "I am collecting from the portion that he retained," and once she has an entree through his retained property, she can also raid the other properties.  Rem"a: If a man ordered that his sons be given such-such from his assets, or [if he did the same for] other people, and he gave this order in the presence of his wife, and she was silent, some authorities say that she must follow [his orders].  Other authorities dispute this.  According to all authorities, if she responded in the affirmative to some of his words, and she was silent about others, she has not forgiven the parts about which she was silent, and she must follow [only those orders] which she affirmed.  She cannot say that she only did so to placate him.  If she made a gesture of acquisition to fulfill his gift instructions, and she later say that she did not forgive her Ketubah - she only made the gesture because she already had possession and control over the assets, the law is with her and she may collect her Ketubah.

Siman 107

The one who writes all of his possessions to his wife, either healthy or sickly, even by word of mouth that they acquired from his hand, he only made her guardian of his inheritors, either because they were the inheritors of his sons from him or from a different wife or his brother or the rest of his inheritors. And if any of it remains, either land or merchandise, she acquires all that he wrote to her. Either this or that she does not lose her ketuba.
In regards to what are we speaking: regarding a married woman. But if he wrote all of his possessions to his betrothed wife, or to his divorced wife, even though that he didn't leave anything, his gift is fulfilled. And she loses her ketuba, except if a small amount of possessions remain.
Any woman who acquired all her husbands assets through a genuine gift has lost [her right to collect] her Ketubah, and it must be torn up.  Therefore, if a contractual debt existed against him from a time preceding this gift, ad all his assets were needed to pay off the debt, she is left with nothing and she may not collect her Ketubah before the debt, because we evaluate that with the pleasure that she received from the knowledge that [her husband] had written off all his assets to her she lost any claim she had to his assets from the Ketubah - both assets that he possessed at that moment and those that were sold or given away before then.  If, however, he took hold of assets after [he gave her this gift], she may collect her Ketubah from them.
Some authorities say that the [only case in which] she does not lose her Ketubah is if he excluded [some assets from the original gift], that is, if he wrote to her some amount of his assets, even if the amount is large, such as half or two-thirds.  If, however, he wrote all his assets to her and specified some excluded amount, event if the exculsion is large, she has lost [her right to collect] her Ketubah from his [currently held] assets, because the dignity afforded to her by writing "all his assets" causes her to forgive [his debt to her].
Some authorities say that if it is clear that he deliberately deceived her in order to cause her to lose out, she has not lost her Ketubah.
If a man had two wives and he wrote all his assets to both of them, neither of them acquires [the assets], and both are considered custodians.  If, however, he wrote, "half of my assets will go to this wife and half to that wife," the first wife acquires [the designated half], for he has excluded something, but the second wife does not acquire [her designated half].
If he wrote all his assets to his wife and to his son, his wife acquires half and the some does not acquire [his half]; the son is instead made a custodian.  Some authorities say that both are made custodians.  Rem"a: If he had a son and a wife, and he said, "Such and such from my assets are for my son and the remainder is for my wife," he certainly intended this to be a genuine gift.  If he was intended for both of them to become custodians he would not have given a portion to the son, as it is all rightly his.
If he wrote [his assets] to his wife and to some other person, the other person acquires his half and his wife is made a custodian for the remaining half.  In any cases where a contract can prove that he did not intend for custodianship, but instead [he intended] for it to be a genuine gift, it is considered a genuine gift.
If he said, "My wife will have lordship over all my assets," we do not consider this a proper expression for a gift; we rather consider it an expression of custodianship.  Rem"a: If someone wrote his assets to his wife and that his heirs would have the right to claim in her absence, we consider this to be a gift and not a custodianship.
If a man said, "Let this daughter of mine take fifty gold coins and this other daughter take fifty gold coins," and he has three daughters and one wife.  [When the question was raised], "what will happen to your wife" he responded, "the remainder will be for my wife."  We consider this to be a genuine gift as he followed the Torah's principles of inheritance for at least one of his heirs.  Rem"a:  If he ordered that his assets be given to charity, this is considered leaving a remainder.  Other authorities dispute this.

Siman 108

One who is deathly ill (or a healthy man who made a transaction on the command) who says, "My wife shall inherit as one of my sons," she inherits as one of the sons in addition to collecting the money granted to her in the marriage contract.  If sons were born to him after his command was issued, they join with those who were alive at the time of the command and the wife inherits amongst all of them together.  How so?  If he had three sons at the time of the command, and after some time two more were born to him, his wife inherits as one of the other five--that is, one sixth of the property--and takes only the items that belonged to him at the time of the command.  Regarding items that came into his possession after the time of the command, she has no portion in them, as one cannot bequeath that which is not in his possession.  Rem"a:  If there was doubt as to whether some property was in his possession at the time of the command or not, the burden of proof is on the wife, or she will not inherit from that property.
If there were many sons and their number was decreased, she inherits as one of the number of sons at the time of death.  And there is someone who doubts this.
If all the sons died, we see how many they were at the time of the command, and she inherits a portion fit for one of them, and the rest goes to his inheritors.  Rem"a:  One who writes that his daughter and son-in-law shall inherit a portion as one of his own sons, it shall be as though he wrote this for his wife, and they may only inherit from the property that he owned at the time of writing.  Our custom nowadays of writing a document of "half the males" for the daughters, where the daughters inherit from all of the property of the deceased as do the sons, exists because he writes an admission that the sons owe him some sum, and they may not be exempted from paying unless they give [of the inheritance] to the daughters as they would a son.  Through this method, he is able to transfer even that which is not yet in his possession, as long as it is either fit to come into his possession or it has been demonstrated that it will be his.  One who gives a gift to his wife or daughters, it is forbidden to engage in trickery afterward and bequeath to his sons or wife to remove from the recipient of the gift that which he deserves.

Siman 109

A man on his deathbed who said, "Give two hundred zuz to my wife as is appropriate for her," she takes them in addition to her ketuba [monies]. If he said, "She should take two hundred zuz for her ketuba," she does not receive both (the 200 zuz plus her ketuba) amounts, but she has the upper hand: If two hundred zuz is more than her ketuba, she receives the two hundred. If the ketuba is more, she takes the ketuba monies.
That which we said, when he says, "with her marriage contract," she has the upper hand, is when he didn't divide up his property. But if he divided up his property, we will explain his law in Siman 106.
If he simply said, "Give one hundred zuz to my wife," there are those who say that she has the advantage.  There is one who says that it shall be a gift aside from the [one hundred zuz granted to her in] the marriage contract.  If he said explicitly, "Give it to her as a gift," all agree that she takes it in addition to that which is granted to her in the marriage contract.
A person dying who instructed them to give clothes (begadim) to his wife she may take all her clothes, whether during the week or on Shabbat. 
Hagah: But there are those who say that if he gave her as a gift when he was dying, even the bracelets on her clothes are included. But if he wrote this to her when he married her, the bracelets are not included (Mahari, siman 144). 
And if he said, "garments" (malbushim) also overalls, shoulder pads, kerchiefs and scarves are included, that anything a person wears or uses to wrap oneself is called a malbush. 

Siman 110

They write "he breaks [from] a wife" even though she has no husband with her, and only that she is for sale (able to be married). And the husband gives a payment to the scribe. Hagah: And[/but] a talmud chacham (torah scholar), these are not his ways. [Rather, his ways are] to be precise [regarding the matters of] marriage, to be faithful afterwards [and] to say "I erred" and I wrote [a document] and I break [my marriage] with the woman after her [marriage] because he made a mistaken in [marrying] her. (This taste explains the Gemara (explaination) in [the] Chapter [about] divorce documents easily):
The finder breaks [the marriage] using the name of the woman,   that she is paid back from her ketuba. In [the] time that the woman rejoices that he gave her away [so she could find another] husband, he will return us to him. And if she does not rejoice, rather she says "From me he fell (I didn't consent to the divorce), they will not give them a husband or a wife (neither can get remarried)".

Siman 111

Among the stipulations of the writ [of marital obligations] is that his sons inherit [the amount listed in] their mother's writ and such dowry as she brought [into the marriage] as 'iron sheep property' [i.e. property she brought into the marriage which her husband can use and which he must pay her for at its original value on termination of the marriage]. Some say also the extra [amounts listed in the writ] are included [in their inheritance]. Thereafter, they divide the remainder evenly with their [other] brothers. How? [Suppose] he married a woman; [the money listed in] her writ and dowry is 1000; she gave birth to a son; and she died during [her husband's] lifetime. Thereafter he married another woman; [the amount listed in] her writ and dowry is 200; she gave birth to a son; and she [also] died during his lifetime. Then he died and left 2000. His son from the first [wife] inherits the 1000 [listed] in his mother's writ, his son from the second [wife] inherits the 200 listed in his mother's writ, and they evenly inherit the balance. It turns out that in the [wife]'s son possession is 1400 and in the second's son is 600.
In what [case] is the [foregoing] said? Where he left, beyond the [money for] the two writs, a dinar or more, so that they should divide the balance evenly. But if he did not leave an additional dinar, they divide the entire [amount] evenly. [This is] because, if these inherit [the amounts in] their mothers' writs and not a single dinar remains to divide among the heirs, then it turns out that this stipulation annuls the even division of inheritance among sons, which is [a rule] from the Torah.
If there is not [staked] here on a ketuba more than 2 dinar (units of money), even [if] it was fitting [because of] the lost inheritance from the father of their father, categorically this is not permitted, [since the amount,] it is not important [enough to be] permitted. Even if [the father of] their father died, giving her a [good] portion takes precedence, also it is not permitted here [to give only] a dinar in a time of death.
And there is a law to [those] who marry women often, from this one to this one to the daughter after, and everyone [of the wives] died in his lifetime, and and he [does not have] from [any of] them male children, if it was [the case that] there was more on [each] of the ketubas [than] a dinar, all [of the value from] this one [ketuba] and that one [ketuba] he (each son) inherits from the ketuba of his mother, and the remaining portion (for daughters) is identical.
If the orphans said, "We will increase the property of our father by a <i> Dinar </i>" so that they can get their mother's <i> Ketubah </i>, we don't listen to them, rather we evaluate the property in <i> Beis Din </i> how much they were worth at the time of the death of their father. Even if [the value of the property] increased or decreased after the death of their father before they come to split it, we only [ever] evaluate them like [their value] at the time of their father's death. And this is specifically when the property goes down in price, but if they find out that [one of the] fields is not his, the matter was revealed retroactively and there wasn't [actually] a more than a <i> Dinar </i> [for of the of the widow's children to gain a majority].
If there was a dinar or more over the amount in all of the ketubot, even if there is a debt document equivalent to the rest, he doesn't reduce that amount. Rather each one inherits his mother's ketubah. 
And there are those who say that even if the debt is greater than the remainder left over after the two ketubot, he should pay the debtor and remainder should be divided according to the two ketubot. 
One who married two women and one of them died while he was alive and the other after he died. If he had children with both of them, even though he did not leave more than two <i>ketubot</i>, if the second wife swore a widow's oath before she died, her children come first in inheriting her <i>ketubah</i> because they do not inherit her under this condition, rather they inherit from the Torah. Afterwards, the first [wife's] children inherit their mother's <i>ketubah</i> under this condition. If anything is leftover, they split it equally. If she died before swearing [the oath], the first [wife's] children only inherit their mother's <i>ketubah</i> and the rest is split equally. Definitely if they both died after his death, each one's children take their mothers' <i>ketubah</i> even if there will be nothing leftover since they are coming with a Torah [level] obligation. So too if one [wife] was divorced and one dies while he is alive and the other dies afterwards and he had children from both of them. The children of the dead [wife] take from the <i>ketubah</i> which comes from the right of the son's to inherit, even if there won't be a <i>dinar</i> [a coin] left over, since the obligation of a divorcee's <i>ketubah</i> is made supplemental to the other [<i>ketubah</i>]. Therefore, the children of the divorcee take first and afterwards the children of the dead.
If one [wife] died in his lifetime and one after his death, and she who died after his death had sworn regarding her marriage contract, and there is only enough property to pay for the first marriage contract, there can be no contract of the male sons [stating that the sons of the wife from a prior husband inherit from her current husband].  However, if there is more [property] than required for the first marriage contract, even by a dinar, they sons of the second mother will receiver their mother's marriage contract, and the extra will be taken by the sons of the first woman [from a prior husband] via the law of the contract of the male sons.
If one died during his lifetime and the second is still alive, their law is the same as if one died during his lifetime and one after his death.
If he were married to two women, and he had sons from them and died, and afterward the wives died, each [son] inherits the marriage contract of his mother via the Biblical [laws of] inheritance, and not via this condition [outlined above].  Therefore, we do not supervise it to check whether there is extra [property] or not. The inheritors of the first [wife] take precedence over the inheritors of the second.  If they did not take an oath, all sons divide equally and there is no inheritance of the marriage contract, for a widow does not receive her marriage contract until she takes an oath.
If one [wife] took an oath and one did not take an oath, the sons of the one who took an oath inherit first, and the remaining [property] is divided equally [amongst all the sons].
Anyone who inherits the marriage contract of his mother who died during the lifetime of his father, he may not collect from property on which a lien has been placed, but rather from free property, as with all inheritors.  (See below at the end of the section.)
There are those who say that specifically regarding real estate, that when there is enough land to pay for two marriage contracts, then we carry out the contract of the male sons.  But if there is no property other than movable property, we do not.  However, even if there is no extra [on top of the marriage contract] other than movable property, that is good enough.  There is someone who says that nowadays when we write in marriage contracts that movable property is given via transfer of real estate, the contract of the male sons can be collected from movable property, as a condition added on to the marriage contract is considered as the marriage contract itself.
A woman who sells her ketuba, whether to her husband or others, does not lose the "male sons" rights (an unwritten condition in the ketuba whereby her male sons inherit the value of her ketuba prior to any division of the husband's estate with sons from any other marriage; see Ketubot 53). However, if she relinquished rights in her ketuba to her husband, her sons also lose the "male sons" rights. Therefore, the sons do not inherit "male sons" properties unless their mother's original ketuba document is in their possession, but if they do not have the ketuba document, they have nothing, for perhaps their mother relinquished her rights. But if they are in a locale where the custom is not to write a ketuba, the sons do have "male sons" rights [even without a ketuba document]. 
One who commanded at his time of death that his sons would not inherit via the contract of the male sons, we do not listen to him.  Rem"a:  However, if he made such a condition at the time of marriage, the condition is upheld (Tur).  There are those who say that the contract of the male sons is not used nowadays, for the essence of that decree was that a man should bequeath to his daughter as he does to his sons, and nowadays we give more and more to the daughter (ibid.), and such is our custom in these countries.
If he gave all his property to others as a gift from his deathbed, since the gift of a dying man is not transferred until after death, the gift and the obligation of the conditions take effect together.  Therefore, her sons inherit the marriage contract of their mother who died in the lifetime of her husband.  If he gave the gift while healthy on condition that it would transferred after death, its laws are those of any gift given while healthy.

Siman 112

Among the [automatic] conditions of the ketuba is that daughters shall be fed from the estate of the father after his death, until they are engaged (with kiddushin) or until they reach the age of majority.    Note: [This rule holds] even if it was not explicitly written in the ketuba, or even if there is no ketuba, as in a place where ketubot are not written (Tur). Some say that even in a place where ketubot are written and they do not have the ketuba document, and even if the mother explicitly relinquished her financial rights in the ketuba, the daughters still receive food (Ra"avad to Hilchot Ishut Chapter 19).  Similarly, if the mother was divorced, even so the father is required to feed the daughters.  
A daughter who is being fed from the estate of her father after his death, the fruit of her labor and found items belong to her. 
If she was betrothed while still a minor, she loses her food support from her brothers, and the groom is liable for her sustenance. Rama: Some authorities say that she does not lose food support unless betrothed from the time of reaching maidenhood (between 12 and 12.5 years old) (so writes Magid Mishna chapter 19 in the name of Rabbenu Chananel and Rashba). Some authorities qualify the rule (of a minor losing food support) by applying it only when she betrothed herself, but if she was betrothed with the knowledge of her brothers, she does not lose food support (Tur in the name of Ramah).
A daughter was married, and either refused, or was divorced, or was widowed, even if she is a <i>yivama</i>. Since she returns to her fathers house and has not yet grown up [past the age of 12 1/2], she feeds from her father's possessions until she grows up or until she is engaged. Rem"a: And some say specifically [if she refused/was divorced/was widowed] from the engagement [does she feed from her father's possessions], but if [she refused/was divorced/was widowed] from marriage, she no longer has food [from her father] (Tur). And some say further that specifically in her father's life, since when her father died she was in his authority, but after her father dies, she loses the food immediately since she is engaged (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And this is the main [law].
If a man performed levirate marriage with his sister-in-law and she gave birth to a daughter, if the other brother's have no assets, the daughter is fed from her father's estate.  If, however, the brothers do have assets, or if the daughter was produced by a rabbinically forbidden union or as the product of rape, even if she was born after they married, or the daughter of his betrothed who was born while they were still betrothed and they subsequently wed, she is not supported after her father died, but during his lifetime he must sustain them like any other sons and daughters during the father's lifetime.
A daughter is supplied with food, clothing and shelter from her father's assets in the same manner that a widow is supplied.  [The court] sells [assets] for the daughters' food and clothing without first announcing the sale, in the same manner that assets are sold to feed and clothe a widow.  They differ only in that a wife is suppled in a manner that is dignified for her and her husband, and a daughter is given what she needs.  Daughters need not swear [in order to collect their sustenance].
Nowadays, when ketuba monies are collected even from movables, daughters also receive sustenance support from them. But they receive support only from free and clear chattels, but not from mortgaged chattels. For instance, if the father sold or gave - as a healthy person (i.e. as opposed to a deathbed grant), or if the sons after the death of their father sold or collateralized, or gave [movables to someone else], [the daughters] do not receive sustenance support from those items. 
Daughters may not be fed from funds against which there is a lien, even if they bought from him, even at the moment of acquisition, e.g. where she was divorced and she had daughters from that husband and he took her back, and they bought from him.  And some say, this is only when they bought from him at the moment of marriage, such that what they bought from him was under a condition in the ketubah, but if they bought from him after the marriage for the feeding of the daughters, they may be fed even from funds against which there is a lien.
If he decided [in agreement] with the wife that he would support the daughters even after they matured, they are supported from property subject to a lien. 
One who commanded at his time of death, "My daughters shall not be fed using my property," we do not listen to him.  If at the time of marriage he made the condition that they would not be fed using his property, it falls under the general rules of conditions relating to money, and is upheld.
One who dies and leaves behind sons and daughters, the sons inherit all of the property and they feed their sisters until they [the sisters] mature or are married.  Rem"a:  The sons are not obligated to diminish their payments for food, but if they want, they may give extra.  Nonetheless, if the court sees that the sons are destroying the money and are not paying attention to developing the community, the court is obligated to oversee the welfare of the daughters and separate their portion (Tur).  When does this apply?  When he left behind property that can be used to feed both the sons and the daughters together until the daughters mature, and this is what is called "plentiful property."  However, if there is less property than that, they take from it enough to feed the daughters until they mature, and they give the remainder to the sons.  If there is exactly enough to feed the daughters, they will be fed from it until they mature or marry, and the sons will beg at the doors.  Rem"a:  There are those who say that the sons are forbidden from selling even plentiful property, unless it is for the need of redeeming captives and the like.  However, regarding scant property, even in such a case it is forbidden [for the sons to sell it] (Mordechai).  If they transgressed and did sell, this will be explained below in paragraph fourteen.
In what are things said? when he left land. But when he did not leave anything other than chattel, if the chattel is minimal, these and these should be nourished [off it] together until they (the chattel) are depleted, because since they are only nourished because of an institute of the Gaonim, it is sufficient that they should be like sons, and not that the strength of their claim should be greater than sons. If he left chattel and land, and the land is minimal and through the chattel they would be maximal, the sons should inherit: gloss: however, in a place that they write in marriage document chattel on the back of land, it is [possible] to say that chattel is like land (Bet Yosef), and like it was explained earlier, section 111, article 14:
If the properties were plentiful at the time of the father's death, and subsequently diminished, the sons have already acquired the properties, and we still treat it as a plentiful estate. 
If the estate was small at the time of the father's death, and then increased to become plentiful, the sons inherit the estate as in the case of an estate that was plentiful from the start.  Rama: Some say that even if the case had already come before court and it ruled to treat the case as a small estate, since the properties have increased, they have changed to a case of plentiful properties, and even if they subsequently decreased in value, they have the law of a plentiful estate which had diminished [in which the sons inherit, as above] (Tur).  Mechaber: Even if they did not become plentiful, if the sons acted prior to judgment and sold a small estate, the sale is valid (Tur in the name of Rosh). Some say that this last rule applies only when they sold before the court placed the daughters in possession of the properties (Tur in the name of Rashi and Rosh).
If the estate was great and had a lien on it, or an obligation to feed the daughter of his wife or an obligation of enriching the estate for the benefit of his daughter, and when any one of these are paid the remainder is small, it is considered large.  But if the ketubah of the widow has shrunk, she has reduced it.  And the food for the widow, some say that we reduce it and some say that we do not.
If he left a widow and a daughter from her or from another wife, and the estate is insufficient to feed both of them, the widow receives sustenance support, and the daughter needs to beg (lit. ask on doorsteps). Some authorities disagree, as explained in chapter 93.
Sustenance support for the daughters takes precedence over the "male sons" clause in the ketuba (whereby male sons inherit their mother's ketuba in advance of splitting the estate with sons of a different wife).
If someone died, leaving adult (older than 12.5 years) and minor children, and there was no son, we do not say that the minor daughters receive sustenance from the estate until they reach the age of majority, and then split the remainder of the estate equally, rather they all split equally [from the outset].

Siman 113

Someone who died and was survived by a daughter, we estimate his frame of mind as to how much he would have set aside for her dowry and give it to her. How can we know his frame of mind? From his friends, acquaintances, business dealings, and honor.  Similarly if he married off a daughter in his lifetime, we estimate by her.  Note: If he was rich and became poor, or was always indulgent and changed his mind, we follow his most recent status (Tur).  If the court could not estimate his frame of mind, we grant her one tenth of his property for her dowry.  Note: Just like we give a dowry to the daughter from her father's estate, so do we give her support from the property of the mother (Nimukei Yosef, chapter Yesh Nochalin). Some argue (Maharil chapter 75).  Some say that even when the father is alive, he should not grant his daughter a dowry more than one tenth of his property (Ran chapter Metziat haIsha), but we do not act this way.
The tenth of his estate described above for the daughter's dowry is not from among the conditions of the ketuba. Therefore, even according to the decrees of earlier and later Sages, she takes [the tenth] only from real estate. She may collect from rental of the land... Rama: if the [male] orphans have not yet collected (Tur).  Mechaber: ... and from expected income. If the brothers wished to give her money instead of the one tenth share of the land itself, they may do so. Rama: It is only the collection that is limited to real estate, but when the estate is assessed to calculate the tenth, the entire estate is assessed, including movables, and then one tenth [of the entire estate] is collected from the real estate. And this applies only when giving her one tenth, but when we can estimate the volition of the father, we assess what we think he would have given both from movables and from real estate and we give these to her (all in the Tur). Some authorities say that even when we assess [the tenth] we assess only the real estate (so wrote Beit Yosef in the name of Magid Mishne explaining Rambam). If there were creditors, and the sons wished to pay them off with lands, and the daughters say that they should be paid off with movables so that the lands will remain in the hands of the [male] orphans, and the daughters will take their tenth from the orphans, the law sides with the sons (Mordechai chapter Metziat haIsha in the name of Responsa Moharam).  It seems to me that the same law applies with respect to the 1/2 male share (given to daughters) document that is customary among us, that the daughters do not collect from lands, and if there were creditors, the sons are permitted to pay them off with movables so that the lands will remain for the sons, and the daughters will have no share in them.  When we estimate the father's wishes, it is only to minimize below 10%, but not to increase above 10% (Tur in the name of Rosh).  Some authorities disagree and say that they may even increase over 10% (Tur in the name of Gaonim). Some say that even if the estate holdings are limited to the amount of dowry he gave to his first daughter, they give that entire amount to the second daughter (Tur in the name of Ra"avad). But it is appropriate to estimate his wishes according to the amount of money he left at the time of his death (Maharik root 78, e.g. as a percentage of the estate) so it appears to me.
A daughter with respect to the tenth [of the estate for her dowry] is as a creditor to the brothers. Therefore, she collects from medium quality land, without an oath [in which she would deny having previously received the land]. If the brothers died, she takes the lowest quality land from their sons with an oath, for she is collecting from orphans.  Nowadays that all people customarily marry off their daughters (i.e grant dowries) from movables, we assume that the father also planned to give likewise [from both real estate and movables; as explained by Taz here].
If he left many daughters, as each comes to get married, they give her one tenth of the property, and the next daughter receives one tenth of what the first daughter left, and the next receives one tenth of what the second daughter left. If they all came together, the [tentative] first takes 10%, the second takes 10% of the remainder from the first, and so on, even if there are 10 daughters. [All the tenths are then recombined] and they then share equally in the total.  Rama: Even though the tenth share in the estate is not collected until the daughter comes forward to get married, we nevertheless calculate tenths according to the size of the estate at the time of his death.  Similarly, if we are estimating how much he would have given for dowry, we make that estimate at the time of his death, but she does not collect until she marries (Magid Mishne chapter 20 in the name of Rashba and Responsa Ramban chapter 46).
Brothers who sold or mortgaged (as collateral for a loan) their father's land, the daughter may grab (i.e. extract in court) from the purchasers money for her dowry, with an oath, in the same manner that creditors may grab (i.e. enforce their prior liens) from purchasers.
If a man died and left a widow and a daughter, the daughter does not take one tenth of the property (for her dowry) because of the sustenance support of the widow. Even if the daughter died after her marriage, her husband does not inherit the [dowry] income that would have been appropriate to give her, for the property is legally in the possession of the widow for purposes of her sustenance.  Rama: In the same manner, dowry income of the daughters takes precedence over "male sons" ketuba inheritance (Ran chapter Metziat haIsha).
An orphan girl who is married off by her mother or brothers with her consent, and they gave her 100 or 50 zuz, when she matures she may extract an appropriately sustaining dowry from them.  Rem"a: Even if she said nothing for a long period after she reached maturity, she still may come afterwards and demand support. [This is true] even if the brothers providing her with food.  Even though she did not object at the time of marriage, [we do not say she forfeited the right to do so later] be cause she was only a child and was not eligible to object.  If the daughter married after she matured, whether she was a maiden to fully adult, and she did not demand her support, she has lost her claim to support, unless the brothers were providing her with food after her marriage (Rem"a: and she was aware of that at the time of the marriage).  If she did object at the time of the marriage, she may extract the appropriate sum for herself whenever she wishes.  If she matured while still living in her father's house, whether before or after his death (Rem"a: some authorities dispute this and hold that of he died after she was fully adult she receives no support), if the brothers designated some amount to provide her food, as she has no claim to food, and she was silent and did not demand a supporting dowry, she has forfeited her claim.  If she objected, she has not forfeited her claim.  If the brothers did not designate funds to provide her with food, and they did provide food in her adulthood, even though she did not object she has not forfeited her supporting dowry for as long as they are providing her food, for she can claim that [in recognition of the kindness of] feeding her while they were not obligated to do so, and she was not yet married, that she did not demand her support.  Rem"a: If someone ordered that his daughter be given a third of his property, and her brothers married her off and did not give it to  her, they must give it to her later.
If a man died and left two daughter and a son, and the first daughter [at her own initiative] took one tenth of the assets, and the second was not able to collect before the son died, such that now all the assets fall to the two of them, the second daughter may not take a tenth [before dividing the remaining assets].  Rather, they divide the estate equally and the first is entitled to her tenth.  Rem"a:  Some authorities dispute this and hold that the second daughter also takes a tenth before dividing [the estate]. 
[Our sages] did not decree dowry support for the daughter except with the existence of a son. But if he left only daughters, they divide the estate equally.  Even if the older daughters married in the lifetime of their father (and had received dowries), and the younger daughters say, "We also want to get married (receive dowries) from the property before division of the estate," we do not listen to them. But if the older daughters married after the death of their father from the middle (i.e. from the combined estate prior to division), the younger daughters also get married [from the combined estate] and then they split the estate. 
If one ordered at the time of his death, "my daughters will not be supported with a supporting dowry from may assets," we follow his instructions.  Rem"a: If, however, he stipulated at the time of marriage that his daughters will not be supported by his assets, we do not follow his instructions. 

Siman 114

If a man married a woman and agreed that he would feed her daughter for five years, he must provide food and drink for the first five years of the marriage, whether food prices are high or low.  If he did not feed her during those years, and food prices dropped - if he had withheld [the food] he must pay her according to the higher prices., but if she prevented him [from providing the food], he only pays her according to the lower prices.  If food prices rose, even if he had withheld the food, he only pays according to the lower prices. 
Even though he provides her with food, she keep her own handiwork.
If the mother exempts him from paying, her exemption counts for nothing.
If the husband died, the daughter may extract the payment for her food from liened properties like any other creditor.  This is only true if they has an agreement with a gesture of obligation, or with a contract, but if there was no gesture, this is a case of an unwritten arrangement, and she may not [collect] her food from liened properties.
If the daughter died her heirs do not receive her sustenance.  Rema: If the daughter was sick, it is as if she is married and he gives her sustenance as if she were healthy. 
If she was divorced during the time when he accepted upon himself the obligation to sustain the daughter, he must give her full sustenance in the place where her mother is, like one who sustains his wife by an agent, but he is not obligated to provide for her according to his honor nor according to her honor.  And there are those who disagree and hold that he must provide for her as if she was one of the members of his household (Tur, in the name of the Rosh). And this seems correct to me. And if he feeds her on his table, she is sustained with him like one who eats at his table. And in either case, he is not liable to pay for her medical care. 
The same is true for one who is obligated to provide sustenance for another person.  See the rules in Hoshen Mishpat siman 60. 
If she is married to another man, and he cuts a deal with her to sustain her daughter, one sustains her and one gives her full sustenance money. 
[if] the other also drove her out and they both owe her alimony, and each one says: I fill feed her and won't give money, it depends on her to choose which of them she wants to feed her. and if she's deaf that she has no understanding to choose, [they] feed her intermittently - this one a week [Sabbath] and this one a week [Sabbath]
[if] the daughter is married within the timespan, the husband owes her alimony and the two - each one - give her alimony.
[if he] wrote her: "I will feed your daughter as long as you're with me", and the mother died, he no longer has to feed her. and this way also if she got divorced (from him) even if he remarried her.
Anyone who obligated himself deliberately to provide sustenance [to his wife's children] beyond what is ordained by the court is not obligated to provide clothing, unless he specified, "I will feed and support."  Rem"a: If he wrote to someone that if he married the daughter of such-and-such, he will give him a certain amount for food support, he must give the money even if the daughter died, as he did not specify a time for food, and he did specify a certain amount for food.  If he had wished to take the full amount at once he would have been obligated to give it to him.  If, however, he wrote it to him and his wife, he does not bequeath his portion to his wife.

Siman 115

These go out without a ketubah: one who transgresses the religion of Moshe and the Jewish woman, and what is [one who transgresses] the religion of Moshe, one who fed her husband [produce] that was not tithed, or another one of all the prohibitions, or who had relations with him while niddah, and he was informed afterwards, as in the case of one who said: Wise so-and-so corrected for me this pile of produce or permitted this piece to me or ruled for me that this blood was pure, and she was found a liar. And precisely one who was contradicted by witnesses, as [in the case of] those who testified that at that time that she said so-and-so corrected for her that person was not in the city, and also there are witnesses that she told him that it was corrected and he ate it according to her word; but if there are no witnesses and she denies that she fed it to him, or she contradicts the wise person who says that he did not correct for her, and she says he [did] correct for her, she is believed. And specifically if she misled him and he ate according to her word, but if she [merely] intended to feed him something forbidden, she has not destroyed her ketubah.
If she was presumed to be niddah by her neighbors, because they saw her wearing her clothes of niddah, and she said to him: I am pure, and he had relations with her, she goes out without her ketubah.
A woman who fails to fulfill her own oath is divorced without her Ketubah.  Rem"a: Similarly, if she violates a promise or a ban.  But if she produces witnesses that he is also guilty of violating oaths, promises, and bans, she has not lost her Ketubah even if she is a transgressor.  A woman who leaves Judaism and then returns to it is not considered a transgressor, and she has not lost her Ketubah until she is warned.
What is Jewish religion? It is the custom of modest that the daughters of Israel have practiced. And these are the things that, if one did one of them, she transgressed the Jewish religion: She goes out to the market, or to an open alley, or in a courtyard through which many pass, and her head is uncovered, and she's not wearing a shawl like all the women, even though her hair is covered with a kerchief; or she spins in the market, and rose or something similar is in front of her face, on her forehead or her cheek, as the promiscuous gentile women do; or she is spinning in the market and shows her arms to people, and she is accustomed thusly (Rashba, #571); or she was flirting with the young men; or she was asking for sex in a loud voice from her husband until the neighbors hear her speaking about sexual matters; or she was cursing the father of her husband in front of her husband, and some say that's it's the same ruling if she cursed even the father of her husband to his face (and thus is seems from the interpretation of Rashi on the Gemara, which is brought by the Beit Yosef), and look below #154, it's the same ruling if she curses her husband to his face (Ramban #102); in every one of these [cases], she goes out without her divorce settlement, if there are witnesses that he warned her about it first and she transgressed his warning. And if there are no witnesses, she must swear that it's as her words. And if he wanted to keep her afterwards, we don't force him to send her away, nonetheless it's a commandment on him that he should send her away.   R. Moshe Isserles: And she cannot prevent him from divorcing her, and he can divorce her against her will, and this does not fall under the ban of Rabbeinu Gershom (Responsa of R. Moshe Isserles on the Hagahot Mordekhi of Yevamot, and the same is in Rashba #557). And [if] a woman exaggerated to her husband that her desire was to hire Samaritans to kill him if he did a certain thing, she is called "one who transgresses on religion" (Hegahot Maymoni, chapter 24). [If] a woman was accustomed to seclude  herself with Samaritans, she is called "one who transgresses on religion" (Trumat HaDeshen #242).
All of these do not receive the essential parts of the marriage contract, nor the addition parts of the marriage contract, nor any other additions, but they do take that which they brought in to the marriage, but only that which is still extant, whether it be property under that husband's control or property from which he merely reaps the benefits.  If the property was destroyed or stolen or lost, we do not take [its value in cash] from him.  This also applies to a wife who committed adultery or left due to suspicion--she has lost the essence of her marriage contract and the additions, and she takes back the extant property that she brought in.  This also applies to all those about whom we taught that they leave each other.
If there are no witnesses that she committed adultery, but rather she herself says she has committed adultery, we are not concerned about this matter to forbid her [from her husband], as perhaps she [merely] set her eyes upon another.  This is only if there is no reason to believe her, but if there is reason to believe her, she is trusted (Decisions of Mahara"i #222).  But she does lose her marriage contract--both the essence and the additions--and property which she brought into the marriage and is not longer extant.  If she goes back on her words and gives a reason that she would have lied in the first place, she is trusted (Glosses of Mordekhai to Kidushin).  If he had believed her and his thoughts are now reliant on her words, he is obligated to send her out, but we do not force him to send her out.  But if she were raped, she does not lose her marriage contract, whether she is the wife of an Israelite or the wife of a priest.  Rem"a:  See above, 178:9.  If one said about a woman that she committed adultery with him, he is believed about her as a single witness, for we split his testimony [and do not believe hims testimony about his own adultery] (Rashb"a #552).  If she admitted before an individual that she became impure, the suspect joins this individual to forbid her from her husband (Decisions of Mahara"i #222).  If she admitted before an individual that she committed adultery, and afterward says that it was a lie, and contradicts the witness who is testifying about her, she is permitted to her husband even if her husband believes the witness who is testifying about her, for we say that when she first admitted, she had [merely] set her eyes upon someone, and now she is going back on that (Mahari"k #82).  A woman who says to her husband that she committed adultery, even though she is not believed, if he divorces her, he may not bring her back, and even if he did bring her back, there is reason to worry (Mahara"m Padua #34).
One who saw his wife commit adultery, or one of his [the adulterer's] or her relatives told him, and he believes them or his judgment relies on their statement that he wife committed adultery, whether the speaker was a man or a woman, since his judgment relied on the truth of this matter, he is obligated to divorce her and is forbidden from having sex with her, and he pays her according to the marriage contract.  If she admitted that she committed adultery, she is divorced without receiving the marriage contract.  Therefore, he makes her swear while holding an object that she did not commit adultery, if her saw her himself, and afterward she collects the marriage contract.  But she can only be forced to swear by the testimony of another if she is already being forced to take a different oath.  Rem"a:  Many relatives together count as one witness (Glosses of Mordekhai on Yevamot).  See above, 178:9.  Some say that he cannot say that he believes the witness unless he believes him in other matters as well, but if he does not generally believe him, and only believes him in this matter, because she is already somewhat suspicious to him, she is not forbidden based on this [testimony] (Mahari"k #92).
One who says to his wife before witnesses, "Do not conceal yourself with so-and-so," and there are witnesses that she went in with him and waited with him long enough for impurity to occur, she is forbidden to her husband and is divorced without collecting her marriage contract.  He is forbidden from being alone with her, and we pressure him to remove her from his house.  This only applies when he spoke to her with the language of jealousy (Mahari"v section 8), in the way that we will explain later in section 178.
If he said to her while alone, "Do not conceal yourself with so-and-so," and he saw that she had concealed herself and had waited with him long enough to cause impurity, she is forbidden to him and he is obligated to divorce her and give her the marriage contract, and if she admitted that she concealed herself after he warned her, she is divorced and does not receive the marriage contract.  Therefore, she is made to swear on this [that she did not conceal herself] and afterward he gives her the marriage contract.
If he made his wife swear that she would not speak with a certain main, and she transgressed and spoke with him, she has transgressed the laws of a Jewish wife, and she loses her marriage contract if he had first warned her, "If you violate your oath you will lose your marriage contract."

Siman 116

One who marries one of those prohibited because of a negative prohibition, if he recognizes in her [that is she prohibited to him] she gets the principle [i.e. the base about of the ketubah] and the additional amounts and all that is promised to her; however she does not get food until after he dies, but during his lifetime she does get food, even if she borrowed and ate he is not obligated anything, Rem"a: and if he feeds her, her work product is his (Nemukei Yosef chapter There are those that are Permitted).  And if he does not recognize in her [that she is prohibited to him] she does not get the 100 or 200 but she does get the additional amounts.  And she does get any promises from the promises of the ketubah, and even food after death; and he is not obligated in her ransom, and even here he does not pay for the fruits he has eaten from her, and even if they are still extant by him.  And the property that she brought in to him [in the marriage], if they are extant, whether nikhsei melug (property that remains in her possession, but which the husband can use, throughout the marriage) or nikhsei tson barzel (lit. property of iron sheep, meaning property that husband possesses during the marriage but for which he guarantees their value in the ketubah), she takes them.  And anything that is lost or stolen or destroyed or worn out from nikhsei tson barzel, he does not have to pay [for it].  And anything that is lost or stolen from nikhsei melug, he has to pay [for it].
Those who are prohibited because of a positive commandment, even if he did not recognize in her [that she was prohibited], her law is like those prohibited because of negative commandment where he did recognize in her [that she was prohibited].
Ailonit [a woman who has not properly passed through puberty despite being an adult], if he recognizes in her [that she is an Ailonit], she is like all the women and she has both the ketubah and the promises of the ketubah, and so too the husband obtains in what he would obtain in other women.  And if he does not recognize in her [that she is an Ailonit], her law is like the law of a woman who is prohibited because of a negative prohibition that he has not recognized in her [that she is prohibited].
... A Shniya (a woman relative prohibited by rabbinic enactment which expanded the categories of relatives for which sexual unions are prohibited) whether he recognizes in her [that she is prohibited] or does not recognize in her [that she is prohibited], her law is like the law of a woman who is prohibited because of a negative prohibition that he has not recognized in her [that she is prohibited]; except for nikhsei melug and nikhsei tson barzel, [for which] her law is like the law of all women.
The woman who refuses to continue her marriage to her husband after she reaches maturity is not given the one hundred or two hundred [zuz, which are the primary Ketubah}, but she is given any additional amounts.  Her husband must provide her with food and redeem her if she is taken captive for as long as they are married.  He may consume the profits of her properties, though if he traveled abroad and she borrowed to provide her food or redeem herself, and she then refused to continue the marriage, he does not need to reimburse her even though he has consumed the profits of her properties.  This is true even of the profits are extant.
A minor who is divorced, her law is the same as an adult divorcee.

Siman 117

If a man marries a woman, she checked herself, and then had sexual relations, and afterward when she wiped herself and he [wiped himself] blood was found on the witness (Note: meaning the rag or cloth with which she checks herself) of hers or on his witness, and this occurred three consecutive times, she is forbidden to remain with her husband, and she is divorced without receiving ketuba monies, not the basic money nor the additional money, nor conditioned [moneys] from the conditions of the ketuba, for she is not capable of sexual relations. He divorces her and may never remarry her. What are the circumstances? When this occurs from the beginning of her marriage, and she saw blood with the first intercourse.  But if  this occurred afterward, then his field has been washed away (Note: meaning, from the verse, "why have your brave men been washed away," (Jeremiah 46:15), in other words, she has been damaged and lost by his bad luck). Therefore, if they had relations one time and did not find blood, and afterward she returned to seeing blood with every intercourse, he divorces her but must pay the entire ketuba, and may never remarry her.  Note: Some authorities say that if he does not wish to marry another, and desires to stay with this woman at the hands (in the company) of a chaperone for one year, and he will not go to her except with witnesses, he is not required to divorce her (Beit Yosef in the name of Response Ram, and likewise in Responsa Rashba chapter 860). And certainly if she committed adultery, such that she becomes disgusting to him, it is permitted (to stay with her) in this manner (ibid.).
A woman who was checked by other women, and they said that she is not fit for [relations with] a man, she has no ketubah nor the conditions of the ketubah. And if the husband argues this against her, he is not obligated in her sustenance all the time that she has not been checked.
One who marries a woman stamp (without an explicit understanding) and finds that she is held to vows that are explained in siman 39 she leaves (the marriage) without (receiving payment) for her kesuba. Neither the mandated nor the extra (payment).
Similarly, a woman who enters (marriage) stam (without an explicit understanding) and is found with a deformity that's considered a blemish for women that are explained in siman 39 and the husband was not aware of this deformity she leaves (the marriage) without (receiving payment) for her kesuba. Neither the mandated nor the extra (payment). 
If there is a bathhouse in the city and he has relatives there, he cannot say, "I did not know about these deformities [of my wife]," including even deformities in private areas, because he checked her through his relatives, and we may assume that he heard [about the deformities] and she found favor.  If there is no bathhouse, or he did not have relatives there, he may make a claim regarding deformities in private areas.  [Deformities] that appear at given times are considered as hidden deformities.  However, he may not claim about revealed deformities, as we may assume that he heard [about them] and was appeased.  One who frequently urinates in bed--there are those who say it is not a deformity (Beit Yosef citing the Rashb"a).  There are those who say that it is a blemish (Beit Yosef), and it seems to me that this is correct.  If he claimed that his wife is a leper, this is a deformity (Beit Yosef).
When do these words apply?  In place where the practice of the women is to walk in the marketplace with their faces uncovered.  But in a place where it is not the way of the girls to go to the marketplace at all, and if she were to go the bathhouse she would be ignored, he may even claim against her revealed deformities.  If there is is a bathhouse there and he has a female relative, he cannot claim, for it is certain that everyone sees her naked in the bathhouse.  If their practice is to hide themselves in the bathhouse, he may claim against her revealed deformities.  There are those who say that even if he does not have relatives in the city, he has friends who can check via their wives (Tur citing the Geonim).
How does the claim against deformities work?  If the deformities found upon her were certainly there before she was betrothed, such as an extra finger and the like, the burden is on the father [of the wife] to prove that the husband knew [about the deformity] and found favor in her or that we can assume that he knew.  If he does not bring proof, she may be divorced without payment of the marriage contract.
If she had deformities that could have come into being after the betrothal, if they were found after she was brought into the husband's house, the burden is on the husband to prove that they existed before the betrothal and that his transaction [the marriage] was a mistaken transaction.  If they were found on her while she was in her father's house, the burden is on the father to prove that they came into being after the betrothal, and it is [considered as though] the husband's field was swept away [after purchase].

Rem"a:  There are those who say that if father makes a claim of certainty, the burden of proof is on the husband (Magid Mishneh 25 citing the Rashb"a).  There are those who say that if the time had come for [the husband] to bring in [his wife to his house], even if he had not brought her it, it is considered as though she were in the domain of the husband (Rabbeinu Yerucham 23:5).
If the husband brought proof that the deformities existed in her since before the betrothal, or that she had admitted as such, and the father brought proof that [the husband] saw and was quiet and was appeased or that it can be assumed that he knew and was quiet, he [the husband] is obligated to pay her marriage contract.
If he had sex with his wife, waited a few days, and claimed that only just now did he notice a certain deformity, even if it were within the folds (meaning, for example, under the armpit or under the breasts and the like) or on the sole, we do not listen to him, for it is assumed that one does not drink from a cup unless he has checked it and knows and is appeased.

Rem"a:  If he waited with her for 30 days, he is not believed to say that he did not have sex with her (Mahari"k 105).
One who is informed that his wife is epileptic and wants to divorce her, but does not have the money to pay her marriage contract, we force her to accept a bill of divorce (and the decree of Rabbeinu Gershom is not applied here), and he gives that which he has as her marriage contract, and the remainder when he acquires it, and if she refuses to accept a bill of divorce, he withholds from her food, clothing, and sex.

Rem"a:  This only applies regarding a blemish as serious as this, for if it existed in a man he would be forced to divorce by Rabbinic law, and Rabbeinu Gershom did not decree that a woman would be preferable to a man (Responsa of the Ro"sh #42), but he cannot divorce her against her will because of other deformities, but nonetheless we do not force him to be with her, after she has become repugnant to him and he wants to divorce her and give her her marriage contract (Mahari"k 107).

Siman 118

A widow who has to divide the estate with the heirs of her late husband according to the guidelines of the takana (ordinance) of Tulitula (probably Toledo, Spain. Part of the ordinance limits a ketuba to no more than half of the late husband's estate, see Tur and also Chelkat Mechokek) we assess the value of the Sabbath clothing she is wearing, but not her weekday clothing.   Note:  The conditions of the remainder ordinance (another part of the takana above) apply only if she dies in the lifetime of her husband ; but if she dies while awaiting levirate marriage, the yavam (living brother) is not restricted by the remainder ordinance (Tur).
A man who divorced his wife as he neared death, even though he divorced her only so that she would not need to undergo levirate marriage, with respect to her ketubah the decree of Tulitula (Toledo) still applies as with [any] divorcee.  Note: But if he did not actually divorce her, as in a case where there was never a rumor of her divorce while he was still alive, but she was generally understood to be a widow, but after his death she produced a get (writ of divorce) and said, "I was divorced," she is not believed and needs to bring [additional] proof of divorce, for this get was certainly written only to allow her to escape from levirate marriage (Beit Yosef in the name of R. Yuda ben haRosh).
If she delayed dividing [the estate] with the orphans in accordance with the ordinance a little while, she did not lose her sustenance of that time, even though the orphans have the power to dismiss the widow['s claim] in half the property (Tur in the name of the Teshuvah of the Rosh).
A widow who pays a gentile debt from her husband's property not through the [Jewish] court so that they don't denigrate the property when his land goes up for sale, she did well.
A widow who goes to Beit Din with half of her assets from the dead person [her husband] already in her possession, and the dead man has lands that are mortgaged to another, even though the assets are free for the taking, she [the widow] takes possession of the mortgaged land, because of the tradition that was put into place by the decree, [which said that] everything is split in half.
If their is a matter that is not dealt with by a previous religious decree, the Halacha goes by the rule of the Torah. The Halacha is similar if their is a doubt about the meaning of the decree, about the inheritance of a woman and the proof that she brings, we do not give the inheritance of her husband to her if there is a doubt. (בֵּית יוֹסֵף in place of the תְּשׁוּבַת הָרַ''ן)
In any case that involves the collection of a woman's ketuvah [the money her husband gives her when he divorces her] that is in accordance with the laws of the Torah, the woman getting divorced gets half of the assets that she is entitled to seize by way of this decree [of ketuvah].
If the wife consigned to her husband or to another the rights to collect after her death one half of her dowry which her heirs had been entitled to inherit according to the decree of Toledo, the act is void. But if, effective immediately, she relinquished to her husband her rights in all of his debts that she is holding, her relinquishment is valid.  Rama: It is appropriate to follow the language of the decree, that if it implies that she may not relinquish her rights without the consent of the heir, or the grantor gave her the dowry with that condition (that she could not relinquish the rights unilaterally), she may not change the disposition of the monies. If she herself gave the dowry (from her own property), she can relinquish to the husband or to make a condition to give it to another howsoever she desires, as long as she does so before witness, or else the heirs inherit [the dowry] according to the usual custom (all this is explained in Beit Yosef in the name of Responsa Rosh and Rashbatz).  In locales where there is a decree that the heirs of the woman divide with the husband should she predecease him, they first pay off all debts owed by the husband. The husband is trusted to say how much he owes, with a "migo" argument that he could have denied and said that he left even less (Responsa Rosh rule 55).
A man who writes, at the time of their marriage, a debt document with a known amount, and he makes a condition that she can collect it whenever she desires, if she does collect it, land can be taken by him and he can eat the fruit(the byproduct of that land). And if she has a debt that she borrowed after she was married, he cannot collect on that. But if she took on a loan before she got married, he can collect on it. But if he only stands to collect from if she becomes widowed or divorced, the debtor cannot collect it from him. Rather, the Beit Din can sell the prospective benefit(the ability to decide to whom the money will go) to him or to another, but not to the husband, and this is not correct. Rather, the Beit Din should not sell this prospective benefit, not to him or others, because everything regarding her husband she forgave(remitted). For we do not trouble the court for nothing. 
If the husband gives her a gift, even if the debtor made a loan to her after she was married, he can collect it(the gift) from him. 
A document written as follows: Be for me witnesses and write and sign for me in any language that is beneficial, and give it to "Leah" my wife at such and such a place as a full gift, this counts for nothing. Since he did not write that he was giving it to her. And that which he said:  "give it," counts for nothing. 
the custom that the woman brings land [when she gets married as a dowry] to her [future] husband; a conditional document is written for her and it is a promissory note that she will have in her possession all the time that she wants. [In a situation where] there is no recollection of the land ownership document that she gave him, he does not have [legal ownership of that] land as inalienable assets [brought into the marriage as a dowry], rather its just like regular assets: 
If the husband says: she died first and then the son, and the inheritors say: No, rather the son died first, they must bring proof. 
One who stipulates in the ketubah that he will not marry another woman after his first wife, is not making a stipulation against that which is written in the Torah. 
A man who marries a woman who has stopped being able to give birth, and has taken an oath that he will not marry any other woman against [the first wife's will] they cannot release him from his oath except with her consent. 
If someone swore to give his friend half his earnings, and he will be unable to support his wife if he gives him half his earnings, even so he has to fulfill his oath. 
A woman who forgave her ketubah and her dowry to her husband, and then she claimed that she forgave under duress for he was threatening to divorce her or to marry another woman because she hadn't given birth, this is not a claim of duress to annul her having forgiven the debt. 
A widow who collected all of the property in her ketubah is not liable to bury her husband. Hagah: And even if all there is is enough money for the burial, she collects her ketubah and he is buried from charity funds (Responsa of the Rosh, 15, and Hagahot Maymoni, ch. 17, and Responsa of the Ramban siman 64, and Rashba, siman 1113).  But if the orphans seized the movable property, and used to bury him, they need not pay [it back to her] (Ribash, siman 104). 
A woman who makes a condition with her husband at the time of her marriage that if she should die without viable issue while married to him, 1/3 of her dowry should flow to her heirs, and then he divorced her and subsequently remarried her per se [without making any qualifications], he has remarried her with the same inheritance conditions.  Rama: The decree of the "Shu"m" communities (Speyer, Worms, and Mayence) which are accepted custom nowadays with respect to the dowries of grooms, as explained supra end of chapter 53, some authorities say that the decree was promulgated only with respect to dowry, but not with respect to inheritance received by the woman while married to him (Responsa Rosh rule 54), and similarly with respect to gifts given to the groom. At the time that the properties are returning as per the guidelines of the decree, some say that they return to the grantors of the dowry (Responsa Maimoni to Hilchot Ishut, and so implied in the language of the decree), and some say that the properties fall to the heirs (Responsa Maimoni #35), and this [latter rule] is the custom of our communities. There is no difference whether the father gives the dowry or others grant the dowry (Terumat haDeshen chapter 321). But with respect to women who bring in the dowry [from their own property], they did not make this decree (Mahariv 64). Every place there is a custom, we follow the custom. Even if they did not explicitly make the [customary] conditions at the time of the marriage, it is as if they did make the conditions, for all who marry, do so with the understanding that they will follow the local customs (Rama's own opinion, and so also in Responsa Rashba chapter 1307 and Responsa Maimoni end of Ishut #35). Even if he went to a place which does not follow the customs of the [Shu"m] communities, we follow the customs prevalent in the locale in which the marriage took place (Rivash chapter 105). If the son or daughter did not die a natural death but were murdered or became apostate, some say that in these circumstances the rule of grooms does not apply in these circumstances, and even if the father did not already give the dowry he must still do so (according to GR"A this is referring to the customs described in Even haEzer siman 53:3). But if there is no viable issue that the money needs to return according to the decree [of Shu"m] there is no difference whether they were murdered or died, but if they became apostate, the monies do not need to be returned. And it is appropriate to consider these matters well [when issuing a court ruling].

Siman 119

One may not marry a woman who he intends to divorce. However, if he indicates to her in advance that he's marrying her for a fixed period of time, he is permitted to. 
She may not live with him and serve him when he intends to divorce her.
One should not divorce his first wife unless he found something unseemly about her. hagah: Aside from this, the rabbis said: "if someone divorces his first wife, the alter cries tears upon him". This is specifically talking in their days (time of the talmud), when they frequently divorced a woman even against her will (this is when the alter cries). but if she consents it is permitted. You should try to not rush into divorcing your first wife, but the second wife, if you dislike her, you can divorce her. 
A woman who is evil in her opinions (i.e immodest and promiscuous) and is not modest like Jewish daughters are supposed to be, it is a positive commandment to divorce her.
A woman who was divorced as a result of immodesty and promiscuity, a kosher man should not seek to marry her.
He is allowed to divorce her without her knowledge. <small>Rem"a: And even if he cannot pay her <i>ketubah</i> or dowry, she cannot prevent it since this is a divorce. Rather she divorces and claims what he is obligated to her (Teshuvat HaRosh, and Rivash). And all this is the law, but Rabbeinu Gershom decreed that [a man] cannot divorce a woman without her knowledge if she has not violated religion as is explained (Siman 115). And even if he wants to give her the <i>ketubah</i>, he cannot divorce her nowadays without her knowledge (Smak Siman 184). Nowadays, if he violated and divorced her against her will, and she remarried, the man is not called a sinner (Kol Bo). If he divorced her with her knowledge, and the <i>get</i> was found to be invalid, he is able to divorce her afterwards against her will (ibid.). If she developed blemishes, see earlier Siman 117 whether he is able to forcibly divorce her, there are those who say that in the place of a mitzvah he is able to forcibly divorce his wife, or they permit him to marry two women (Moharam Padwa Siman 13). As was explained in Siman 1.</small> Therefore, a <i>ketana</i> [girl younger than 12], can be divorced even though her knowledge is incomplete even if her father received her engagement, which is from the Torah. Or if she is a deaf mute, and he married her when she was well, and she became deaf. But if she became mentally unstable, and she cannot guard herself he cannot divorce her until she is well, since he cannot abandon her. Therefore he puts her aside and marries another, and feeds her from her own [property]. And he is not obligated in food, clothing, or marital relations, and he is not obligated to heal her. <small>And some say that he is obligated to feed and heal her (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashba and the Tur in the name of the Rimah and the Ra'avad). And this was decided earlier  (70:4). And this is the main [law].</small> And he need not redeem her [from captivity]. And if he divorced her, she is divorced as long as she can guard her <i>get</i>. <small>And some say that even in retrospect, she is not divorced (And this is implied by the Mahariv Siman 52). But if she is sometimes mentally unstable and sometimes as in a dream, and he divorces her when she is as in a dream because it appeared that she would stay that way, he did not do what was proper (Piskei Mahari Siman 215). And see later (121:3)</small> And he takes her out of his house and is not obligated to care for her.
One who divorced his wife from the marriage cannot live with her in the [same] courtyard [because] maybe they will come to impropriety. And if he is a Kohen, she should not live with him in the [same] passageway. A small village has the same law as a passageway. Rem"a: And if she married someone else, even a Yisrael, she should not live with him in the [same] passageway (Tur). And all this is [talking about] a closed passageway. But in a more open passageway through which many people pass, they are permitted to dwell (Beit Yoseif in the name of the Ran who wrote it in the name of Tosaphot). If public property separates between their houses (Haghot Ashri Ketubot Ch. 2) even if they are the only Jews in the city, it is permitted (Terumat HaDeshen Siman 243). If he divorced her because she was forbidden to him, even if she did not [re]marry, he is forbidden to dwell with her, as though she married someone else (Or Zarua).
If she had a loan by him, she should appoint a messenger to claim it. Rem"a: specifically in such a case, but he is permitted to enter her house, even if she is married, since he does not live there and is not doing business with her (this is implicit in the Terumat HaDeshen Siman 243). And some are stringent (Beit Yoseif). It is permitted for a man to feed his divorced wife. It is a Mitzvah [to do so] more than [feeding] other poor people (Haghot Maimoni Asurei Beiah Ch. 21) as long as he has no business with her, and only feeds her through a messenger.
A divorced woman who comes with her divorced [husband] to judgement, they ostracize them or beat them with rebellious lashes.
If she was divorced from the engagement, she is permitted to claim judgement and to dwell with him. And if he was very comfortable with her, even [if she was divorced] from the engagement, it [=dwelling near her] is forbidden.
Who is forced away from whom? She is forced away from him. If it was her courtyard, he is forced away from her.

Siman 120

The get--it must be written by the husband or his agent. And even if his agent writes it, it must belong to the husband. Therefore they had the custom that when the husband is around, the scribe gives him the parchment and the ink. And there are those who say so too the quill and the other writing instruments (Hagahot Asheri, ch. 2, and Modercai, Laws of Gittin) as a gift before the writing.
And the husband pays the wages. And because of the enactment [for the protection] of agunot, the rabbis enacted that the woman should pay the scribe they transfer title to the husband. 
If he stole paper and wrote on it a get and gave it to her, it is valid, even before [its original owner] has despair. 
Hagah: But if he stole a get, for instance a scribe wrote a get and [the husband] stole it from him and didn't pay him back, and he used it to divorce her, she is not divorced [Bet Yosef]. 
They write a get for a man even if his wife is not with him, and that is if the witnesses who sign it recognize and know that this is so-and-so and his wife is so-and-so. And there are those who say that also the scribe needs to recognize them (Tur). And so it appears to me. And this recognition [can be based] on even one witness, and even on a woman and a near [relation]. Hagah: And he needs to recognize the names of the man and the woman and the name of their father, and [as long as] they have been established for thirty days in the city, one does not suspect them further. And the custom was to write the name of his father according to himself (Beit Yosef from the implication of the Rambam's language). And if there were in that place two whose names were the same and whose wives' names were the same, one may not divorce except in the presence of his fellow, lest he write a get and they bring it to the wife of his fellow and he divorces her. And in a time of danger, they write and give [the get] even if they don't recognize [him].
The scribe doesn't write, nor do the witnesses sign, until the husband says to them to write and sign. <i> Rem"a: And ideally, he tells the scribe before the witnesses (Seder Haget of R' A Margoliot). </i> And when the husband says it to them, they should write it themselves and not tell others to write and sign. Even if he says to the court, "Give a bill of divorce to my wife," they cannot tell a scribe to write and witnesses to sign. Even if he says to them, "Tell a scribe to write and witnesses to sign," a scribe cannot write and witnesses cannot sign until they hear it from his mouth. <i> Rem"a: If he transgressed and divorced her by way of [telling the court] "Tell a scribe to write..." it is a legally unclear divorce (Tur in the name of the Ramah and the Beit Yosef in the name of the Ran, and the Baal Haterumah and Semag and the Mordechai and the Kol Bo).</i>
Even if he wrote in his own handwriting to a scribe to write and witnesses to sign, they do not write or sign until they hear it from his mouth, whether he is mute or not, whether he is deaf but not mute or he is deaf and mute. Some allow someone who is mute to have it written and signed when he writes in his own handwriting, where he writes to the scribe "Write", and to the witnesses "Sign", so that his mind can be settled.
One who is mute, and they ask him if he wants them to write a bill of divorce for his wife, and he bows his head, that will be explained in the next siman.
If he says to ten people, "Write a bill of divorce for my wife," one can write it for all of them. If he says, "All of you write," one of them writes it as a representative of all of them.
If he says to ten people, "Write and sign and give a bill of divorce to my wife," one writes and two sign and one gives.
If he says, "All of you sign," or he assigns them, whether he assigns all of them or assigns some of them, and he says to them, "Sign it," it is as if he said to all of them to sign it, so all of them need to sign it. Two sign it first as the witnesses, and neither of them can be invalid [as witnesses on the bill of divorce], and the others [sign] as the condition. Therefore, if the rest of them are invalid, or one signs today and another signs tomorrow or after a few days, it is kosher, as long as each signs in front of the rest. Even if the rest sign after the giving of the bill of divorce, <i> Rem"a: and even after she remarries (Ran First Perek of Gittin), </i>, it is kosher. And if one of them dies before he signs it, the bill of divorce is void <i> Rem"a: And see further down coming up. </i>
If he says, "All of you sign as witnesses," they all must be kosher and they all must sign that day. Some say even if he says plainly, "All of you sign," the law is like he said it explicitly saying, "All of you sign as witnesses." <i> Rem"a: And it seems to me that we should be stringent like this opinion. </i>
The rabbis made an ordinance that if one says to many people to write a bill of divorce or to sign it or to bring a bill of divorce to his wife: If for writing, he should say to them, "Each one of you write a bill of divorce for my wife," and similarly for bringing it, "Each of of you bring it," And if it is for signingm he should say to them, "Every two of you sign this bill of divorce."

Siman 121

The husband must be of sound mind when he orders [the writ of divorce] to be written.  Therefore, if he was seized by melancholy when he gave the order we do not write it, even after he is well.  Similarly, a drunk person, if he reached the level of Lot's intoxication, and he said, "write it!" we do not write it.  If he did not reach [that level of intoxication], this is a case of doubt.
If he was well when he ordered the writing, and then he suffered [mental] illness, we do not write it while he is still ill.  If they did write and give it [to his wife] before he recovered, if his illness is readily treatable, the writ is disqualified.  If not, it is not a writ.  Rem"a: But after he recovers, we write it and give it, even if he protested during his illness and said that we should not give it. 
One who is occasionally SICK (meaning, healthy, as in "and you have healed me and enlivened me" in Isaiah 38:16)), and occasionally foolish when SICK, he is considered sharp-sighted for all his words.  And if under this condition he expels his wife, that expulsion is considered a valid  divorce. Even if he is SICK unknowingly, and not completely sane.  See above mark 119 verse 6.     
If a man on his deathbed commands [someone else] to write a divorce document, he must check that he will be sane at the time of writing and at the time of giving. Rem"a: And he does not need a checking like one who loses the ability to speak, but we just check him a little to make sure that he is sound of mind (Beit Yosef).
whomever is silent, and he was asked if he wants to write a bill of divorce to his wife, and, he bows his head to say yes, they check him with differing alternating words. [They ask him] once yes and twice no, once no and twice yes. If he shakes his head no at "no" and bows his head yes at "yes" they can write [the bill of divorce] and give it. Ramah: there are those who say that you check him with summer fruits and you ask him in the winter months: "should I harvest these fruits for you from the tree?" or the opposite. 
Specifically when he is silenced, or if he cannot speak but can hear that we rely on gesturing to end the marriage. However, one who is deaf: who cannot hear nor speak, and if he was able to hear and speak when they were married, or if they were married dues to levirate marriage, we do not end the marriage by gesture. However, if they were married when he was deaf and mute, even if she is able to hear and speak, the marriage can be ended through gesture.
A man close to death (As explained by Targum "on the side" (Isaiah 60:4), On <i>gisiseihen</i>, as if to say, on their chest, which means [a person] close to death who brings up liquid to his throat because of pain in the heart), is like he's alive and is able to divorce [his wife]. Rem"a: And some say specifically a man close to death who can still speak. But one who cannot speak, not. (Smag and Smak, and the Mordechai). Some are stringent.
If they cut two (the esophagus and trachea) or most of [each of] the two passages, or if he was torn or crucified, or a wild beast was eating him, and he signaled (lit. hinted) to say (lit. "and said"), "write a get for my wife," they write and deliver [the get] as long as he is still alive. The law is similar for someone who fell from the roof.
Rama: However, if he was unable to speak, they must check 3 times [to confirm his exact intentions] (so wrote the Ran).

Siman 122

If he said to the scribe and to the witnesses to write and sign and deliver a bill of divorce to his wife, and they wrote and signed and delivered it, and it is found to be invalid or it was written and lost, they may write a new bill of divorce.  If it was not lost, and they are unsure whether it is valid based on some stringencies regarding which they were accustomed to being stringent, they have fulfilled their mission and must return to the husband, who can then tell them to write and sign [a new bill of divorce].
Rem"a:  If the witnesses want to write a new [bill of divorce] and both would deliver it to her, they have permission and need not ask the husband (Responsa of Rashb"a cited in the Beit Yosef).
Therefore if the husband leaves the city, he should say that he gives them permission to write and sign anywhere from one to one hundred bills of divorce until one is valid both in its content and its signatures according to the Rabbi of the city beyond any doubt.
Rem"a:  And according to anyone who displays it (Seder Gitin).  But if the husband is in town, one must not rely on this and the husband may go back and command the witnesses and the scribe each time [the bill of divorce needs to be rewritten] (Beit Yosef citing Rabbeinu Tam).  Such is our custom, that [the husband] goes back and commands as he did originally, and also gives them the parchment and the ink if the scribe does not have any left over from that which he gave him originally (this is found in Seder Gitin).  Some say that that which we say, "The witnesses and scribe fulfilled their mission, [so the husband] must go back and command them again," only applies is it was already signed and invalidated.  If, however, it still has not been signed, they may write a new one and the husband need not command it (Beit Yosef citing the Rashba"tz), but the custom is to be stringent on all issues.
If he wrote for them, "Write [the bill of divorce], sign it, and give it to a messenger and he will take it to her," and they wrote it and gave it to a messenger and the bill of divorce was found to be invalid or nullified, they do not write a new bill of divorce until they confirm with the husband.  If they did not confirm with him and they wrote a new, valid bill of divorce and gave it to the messenger and he gave it to her, it is doubtful whether she is divorced.
Rem"a:  There are those who say that whenever the bill of divorce is found to be nullified or invalid they write a new bill of divorce, but if the messenger lost it, the law is as has been explained (Tur).  All this applies when he told them to write it and deliver it, but if he gave a bill of divorce to a messenger to bring it and it was found to be invalid, it is clear that they cannot write a new one without his permission (Beit Yosef citing Responsa of the Rashb"a, and also implied in Responsa of the Ramba"n #145).

Siman 123

Anyone is kosher as a scribe for a divorce document, except for five people: A non-Jew, a slave, a deaf-and-dumb person [who is presumed to be unable to have proper intent], an insane person, and a child. Even the woman herself, if her husband would ask her to write it, can write it and cause her husband to acquire it, and he would go and give it to her. Rama: And the husband ideally should not write the divorce document himself, and he should also not command the scribe on how it should be written, but he should rather say, plainly, to write (found in Kuntresim). Some say that there is what to be stringent that ideally a relative should also not write it, when another person is available (Makarik Shoresh 106). Ideally the scribe should write with his right hand. If he is left handed, he should write with his left (M"C B'Tikun Yashan).
A Jew that apostatizes, or violates Sabbaths in public, he is considered a gentile in all aspects. 
A divorce document written by one of these five people is not a divorce document, even though it is signed by kosher witnesses and by kosher [witnesses] it is given over to her. When does this apply? When the specific details are written in (toref). But if only the form text (tofes) is written, and a space is left for the toref, i.e. the place for the [name of] the man, woman, date, and [the line] "Behold you are permitted to anyone else," and an adult Jew of sound mind writes [those] with proper [intent], that is a kosher divorce document. Rama: Some say that even in this way is invalid on a rabbinical level (Tur in the name of R"Y).
It is permitted [even] ideally for a deaf-dumb person, an insane person, or a child to write the form text (tofes), as long as an adult of sound mind stands over him. But a gentile and a slave ideally cannot write the form text, even if a Jew stood over them.
One who writes a divorce document on the Sabbath or on Yom Kippur, accidentally (shogeg), and he gives it to her, she is indeed divorced. If he writes it and has it signed [by witnesses] purposely on that day [of the Sabbath or Yom Kippur] or on a festival, she is not divorced, for the witnesses are invalid on a biblical level. If he writes it purposely on a festival, and he gives it to her in front of kosher witnesses, indeed the divorce document is invalid. Rama: But if he writes it purposely on Yom Kippur or the Sabbath, indeed it is utterly invalid on a biblical level (so inferred the Bet Yosef). And one cannot divorce at night, and if one does divorce at night, some say the divorce document is invalidated (R"Y Mintz). And therefore, after the congregation prays the evening prayer, even if it is still largely day, one may not divorce (Terumat Hadeshen Sman 248). And see later the end of Siman 154 Se'if 88 and 89.

Siman 124

A divorce document that is written on something that it is prohibited to get benefit from is valid.  Rem"a: However, if it is something that requires being removed from the world and needs to be burned, and he wrote the divorce document on it, the document is nullified. (Ran Gittin)
Gets [bills of divorce] are written on objects which can be falsified [as long as] it is  given with those who witness its delivery.  For example, he writes it on paper which has been previously erased, and on animal hide, and on ceramic, and on leaves, and on the hand of a slave, and on the horn of a cow -- and he delivers to her the slave or the cow or other objects in the presence of witnesses.  But he should not cut off the slave's hand or the cow's horn and give it to her.  And if he wrote it [on the hand or horn] and cut it off [to deliver] to her, it is not a valid bill of divorce, because it is a requirement that the object is not cut between the time of writing and the time of giving it.   "Rem"a:" it can be written on any object which is separated from the ground, and there are those who say, only on an object which will endure.  But if he wrote it on the leaf of an onion or vegetables or similar items, it is invalid (Ran, Chapter 2).  The optimal way is to write it on parchment [from animal hide] which is prepared [in the same manner as] a Sefer Torah [Torah Scroll], Tefillin [Phylacteries], and Mezuzot [Doorway Scrolls] -- however it is not required that [the parchment] be processed specifically with the intent for use for a Get.  However [not using this type of parchment] does not prevent the Get's [validity], even if it is written on the type of paper called "paper" [i.e. paper from wood pulp], [it can be written with] any type of writing, and is kosher [valid].  Also, refer ahead to at the beginning of Siman 126.
It is good to cut the paper to the measure of the get, so that he will not need to cut it after writing, and if the scribe erred after he wrote a little bit of it and wants to start on that paper itself, he should first cut the little bit that he wrote. Hagah: If he wrote it on a large paper, and cut it after writing and before it was given, it is invalid. But if he cut a little from it, in order to beautify it, it is not called cutting (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And as long as he has not cut from it much more than the [space used in] writing the get, it is considered beautifying it (thus is implied in the case of a Torah scroll). But preferably they do all cutting from it before the writing, even the indentations they make in order to score it, and the other things, and he should do all the cut before the scoring, for the scoring is needed for writing (Seder Gittin). If he wrote it in a book, even though there are other matters in it, and gave it all to her, it is valid (Tur in the name of the Itur).
We don't write a divorce document on [something] attached, even if he gives to her the attached thing as it is, since we need "and he puts it in her hand" (Deuteronomy 24:1). And even if the witnesses signed after it was detached, and then he gives it to her, it's not a [valid] divorce document. And if he wrote it on a leaf that was planted in a flowerpot (explanation: like a half potter pot that you plant in it) that was holed, even though he gave her the entire flowerpot, it's invalid, lest it be cut off. But he [can] write it on the pottery of a flowerpot and give it to her, and provided there are witnesses of the exchange in front of us, since pottery is something that can be forged. Ram"a: The same law applies to a flowerpot that is not holed; and some say that when it's not holed we don't decree perhaps it will be cut off (you will find the two opinions explained in the Beit Yosef).
We do not write [a get] on plants that are still attached to the earth, even the "tofes" (the text of the document, other than the names, place, and date.  In modern Hebrew, tofes means a form). If he wrote the tofes while it was still attached, detached it, and then wrote the toref (the names, place, and date), the witnesses signed, and he gave her the get, it is valid.
If the get was tattooed on the hand of a [Canaanite] slave and she had possession of the slave (lit. goes out from under her hand), and the witnesses' names are likewise tattooed on the hand, she is divorced even though there were no witnesses to the delivery [of the slave with the tattooed get], for the text is not subject to counterfeiting. If we have previous knowledge that the slave belonged to the husband, yet the slave with the tattooed get is in her possession, and she says, "It was delivered to me before witnesses," she is doubtfully divorced, for maybe the slave just came to her of his own accord. For the "godrot" (explanation: anything which walks on paths and in markets, for it is reasonable to say that it came of its own accord) do not have a presumption of possession. Rama: This rule applies only in circumstances where there is no presumption of possession, but in circumstances that there is a presumption of possession (e.g. the slave was in her possession for 3 years, see Beit Shmuel) she is divorced (Beit Yosef). See further in Choshen Mishpat regarding the laws of presumption of possession. 
If the get was inscribed on a tablet, with signed witnesses, and it is in her possession, and she says that she gave it to him (her husband), and he handed it back to her, even if they (the court) are aware of a presumption that the tablet had belonged to her, she is divorced, for a woman may write her own get. 
If he etched the get on a plate of gold and told her, "Here is your get and your ketuba," she is divorced, and her ketuba money has been received up to the value of the [gold] plate.  Rama: But if he gave it to her per se (without qualification),the entire plate is hers by force of the giving of the get (i.e. the plate is considered as a piece of paper with a get, which has no value), and he also needs to pay the entire ketuba (so implied in the Gemara, and so wrote the Ran).
He should not give her the get until the writing and signatures have dried well, lest we consider it as writing which is liable to be counterfeited [and therefore invalid].

Siman 125

They only write the get with something whose mark lasts, like ink or red paint or Komos or Kankantom (explanation: types of pigment) and the like; but if one wrote it with something that does not last, like beverages or fruit juice or the like, it is not a [valid] get.
If he wrote [the bill of divorce] post facto on Avar, Shechor, or Shichur, it is valid.  (The meaning of Avar is lead, Shechor is an iron utensil used for writing, and Shichor is prepared coal.)  Rem"a:  There are those who say that lead is valid only when pieces of lead are mixed into water (Tur and Ro"sh), but if he wrote with lead itself, it is invalid, and one should be concerned about this.  Preferably, the practice is to write with good ink like that used for writing books [of the Bible] (Seder Gitin), and this should not be changed.  There are those who are even more stringent and say that the scribe must read each letter before he writes it, as with books [of the Bible] (ibid.).
We write it (the get) with gallnut liquid, as long as the parchment was not itself tanned with gallnut, for gallnut liquid is not legible on such [a parchment]. And if he did write [with gallnut liquid on gallnut tanned parchment] the get is not valid. We apply the same reasoning with other similar cases [of combinations of ink and parchment].
If the bill of divorce was inscribed on a board, stone, or metal tray, if the legs of the letters have been dug in, it is valid.  So too if he engraved the legs of the letters from behind the tray so that they protruded from the front of the tray.  However, if he dug into the letter until the legs appeared at different heights, or he hit the front of the tray until the letters protruded like on a gold coin, it is not a bill of divorce.  Rem"a:  Some say that preferably one should be stringent and not write with an iron quill, so that he should not come to emboss (Seder Gitin).  See below, clause 22.  It is not considered to be embossed unless the entire letter is formed that way, but if [he partially embosses a letter that] still needs to be fixed so that it may be a letter, it is valid (Terumat HaDeshen 228).
If he cut out of the leather the shape of the writing, it is valid. But if embossed the writing into the leather, it is invalid. Some authorities hold the opposite, and there is one authority who rules both cases valid.
If the practice was to be stringent regarding letters being surrounded by parchment [i.e., empty space], and there were letters stuck to one another, he must scratch between them to separate them.  Rem"a:  Some say that one should not separate letters that are touching (Seder Gitin), and this is our practice.  There are those who are lenient in pressing time (Responsa of the Ro"sh) who allow fixing before the witnesses sign (Mahara"m Padua), when the husband commands that it be fixed (Beit Yosef on the view of the Ro"sh).
If someone wants to thicken the letters, we protest against him.
If a drop of ink fell within the letter (Tur) and it is unrecognizable, he may not remove the ink and fix the letter, as that would be considered embossing.  There are those who are stringent even if the letter is recognizable (Mahari"k 98), and this is our practice.
If he wanted to form an open Mem [i.e., in a medial position], but his hand continued and he closed it [and it became a final Mem], he may not scratch away that which is stuck together, as that is considered engraving.  (See Orach Chaim 32.)
The custom is to etch lines [on the parchment]. However, one should avoid etching with lead for it colors, and the outcome will be text upon text.
Some have a custom to write it [the get] on 12 lines.
It is customary to make a 13th line and divide it in two, and on that line the witnesses sign one underneath the other.  Rama: and they also etch two small lines [for the witnesses]. He should etch the lines before he starts to write the get. He should etch from the sides, and the lines of the get should be equal, not one long and one short. If he did not etch lines at all, it is valid. Likewise, if he made more or less than 12 lines [it is valid] (this is all in Seder Gittin, also in Mordechai beginning of Tractate Gittin). Some say that we should not validate them (gets with atypical number of lines)  except where we are worried about "anchoring" (leaving the woman unable to remarry), that the agent arrived from a distant land and caravans are uncommon.  It seems to me that the same rule applies to etching lines. He must start the etched lines outside the text (Beit Yosef in the name of Kuntres and in Seder Gittin).  He should write the get on the flesh side of the parchment and not the skin side.  If he wrote it on the skin side, some invalidate the get (Maharil). It seems to me that if there is a fear of anchoring, we should not be stringent.  When the scribe writes, it is preferable that he should be careful not to touch (i.e. to write) the etching at the sides.  It is customary ex-ante to leave a space of 1/2 finger on the sides, and one whole finger on the top (Seder Gittin), and at the bottom space to grasp with the hand (Maharil) or more (Rama's own opinion).
It is customary to make the get such that its length... Rama: including the blank space at the bottom (Bet Yosef in the name of Kuntres)  Mechaber: ...is greater than its width. 
It was the custom that the letters should not go outside the guidelines on either the right or left side. (Rema: If they were written outside the guidelines, there are those who say even one letter will invalidate it, but in a time of need there are those who are lenient.)
There should be no erasure, and they should not write it on an erasure.  Rama: If a fly landed and dragged the ink, he should not erase the marks (Seder Gittin). He should not write on any hole over which the ink does not pass over (ibid.).
The text should not be twisted or contorted such that one letter can be confused with another and as a result the meaning will change.  Rama: If the feet of the heh and the kuf touch together, it is invalid even ex post facto (Terumat haDeshen chapter 236 and in his rulings chapter 45). However, if a minor can read the text, some authorities still validate when there is a concern for anchoring (putting her in limbo of not married, but not able to remarry) the woman (Maharik root 71).  At the outset it is forbidden to separate [the feet of the letters] with a knife, but he should write another get (ibid. root 98). But only where there is no concern for anchoring, but in times of oppression in which there is a concern for anchoring, he may fix the print (opinion of Rama), and see Orach Chaim chapter 32 how to correct. See chapter 126 se'if 48.  If he needs to fix letters that do not touch in places where they should touch, or they are short and need to be lengthened, he should fix them before he writes (at the end of the get) the words "k'dat Moshe v'Yisrael" (Hagahot Seder Gittin, a tradition from Mahariv, and so I also found written in the name of Maharam Meor Einayim); or he should at least fix the letters before the witnesses sign (Maharam Padua). He should be careful that everything that needs to touch does touch, and things that should not touch do not touch, just as in writing a scroll of Torah, tefillin, and mezzuzot (Seder Gittin, and so implied in Hagahot Mordechai Gittin). If letters that should be touching are not touching, such as the yud of the tzadi (facing rightward) or the yud of the aleph, and other similar letters, some authorities say that even if a young child who is neither wise nor stupid can still read it, is is nevertheless invalid even ex post facto (Terumat haDeshen and in his rulings chapter 43).  Some authorities say that where there is a concern for anchoring the woman, it is appropriate to validate in such a case.  If the error is in the "tofes" (form text of the get except for names, date, place) it is appropriate to be lenient even when there is no concern for anchoring (Beit Yosef). If he wrote the lamed and aleph of Yisrael together as a single letter (this is a common contraction), some say that it is valid if it was in the tofes of the get (Responsa Rosh), and where there is a concern for anchoring, it is appropriate to be lenient. If the anterior point of the yud on the aleph also touches in front, it is still valid (found written in the name of Mahari Maribor = R. Israel Isserlein, author of Terumat haDeshen). If the letters spread out because of wateriness of the ink that is called "Giplasen", so that it appears that the letter may be touching but it can be seen that they are not actually touching, it is valid (found written in the name of Mahari Bruna =Brno in the Czech Republic). 
If the text could be interpreted in two different ways, or the if writing was distorted or confused, or it is possible to read it in a different manner, it is invalid. 
The get must be readable to a young child, neither smart nor stupid, in the locale of its delivery. There is an authority who says that it must also be readable in the locale in which it was written.  Rama: [When checking readability] it is not necessary to cover around the sides of the letter in question, rather they show him the document as is, and if he can read it, it is kosher (found written in an old arrangement).  It is customary to mix (or pour) the lines, which is to extend the inferior extensions of the nun sofi and peh sofi from the upper line until the line below, or the head of the lamed from the line below into the line above. If he did not intermix the lines, some say that it is invalid, but to me it appears that if there is a concern for anchoring the woman, it is not appropriate to be stringent. He should be careful not to extend the head of a letter from a lower line into the inner space of a letter from the line above or vice versa (Ran chapter 2 of Gittin, in the name of "some say"), and if he did this and the shape of the letter has been changed, for example he extended the head of a lamed into the space of a dalet, and the dalet now looks like a heh, then it is invalid. (Opinion of the Rav (Rama) specifically in similar cases, and so implied in Hagahot Semak).
A get on which a letter or word has been erased, or written between the lines, if this is part of the tofes of the get, it is valid. But if it is part of the toref, it is not a get. And if he goes back and explains at the end of the get that a certain letter was written between the lines, or over an erased part, even if this is part of the toref of the get, it is valid, as is true for other documents. And the upholding of the get should be written before "as is the law of Moses and Israel." And now we have the custom of being strict and not upholding a get that had been erased. 
A get which is torn vertically and horizontally, which is how it is torn in court, is an abrogated get as is any other document [torn in similar manner]. But if it is torn in a manner different from the way it is torn in court, it is valid. If it had dissolved or rotted or become sieve-like, it is valid. If it was erased or smudged, but its shadow is still present, if it is readable, it is valid, but if is not readable, it is not a get. 
What are the circumstances? When the get is in her possession with signed witnesses, and there are no witnesses to the delivery of the get. However, if there are witnesses before whom the get was delivered and it was kosher at the time, the get is valid even if the toref (names, date, place, signatures, as opposed to the text) was written on an erasure or between the lines, or it was torn vertically and horizontally when it was given to her before the witnesses.  There is an authority when it was torn vertically and horizontally, Rama: and likewise when it was smudged to the point that it is not readable (so wrote the Magid Mishne).
There is one authority who says that one should be careful not to write the get with a pen made from a wing, but rather from a reed. See infra se'if 4.
If he embroidered or wove or made needlework in the shape of the letters of the get, some say that this is not considered writing (and the get would be invalid).

Siman 126

We write the bill [of divorce] in any script and in any language, whether it is a script of the nations or it is a script of Israel, like Occitan and the like. But if part of the bill was written in one language and part of it in another language, it is invalid. Comment: But some validate it (Raavad). It seems to me that even one who invalidates it admits that, if part of it is the holy language and part of it is Aramaic, it is valid, for they both were given at Sinai and they are relatives in language and are considered like one language. Therefore, we currently are accustomed to write a bill [of divorce] some words [in] the holy language and most of it [in] Aramaic. Or, also, since most of it is Aramaic and doesn't have [more] than [some] words [in] the holy language, this is not [considered] "part of it in another language" [so it is valid]. Or, also, [the one who says it is invalid if partially in one language and partially in another] says so specifically about the required individualization, but "you are hereby permitted to all men" or other words which we add to the individualization are not needed and are nothing but duplication of words, which we are accustomed to [l'chat'chila: needs translation]. These [arguments] are seemly to me, to establish the custom. And they have been accustomed to write it in Aramaic language and Assyrian script. Comment: And one should not validate it in another script; [however, one may do so] only in a case of boundness [of the wife to her absent husband if she has no bill of divorce] [and? or?] in a pressing case, such as [a bill of divorce] that was brought from a faraway place and there are no caravans found [to and from that place] (responsum of Rosh, rule 45). And see above, chapter 125 paragraph 16.
"<i>Bashelishi</i>", "<i>barevi'i</i>", [and] "<i>bachamishi</i>" [are written] plene with a yod. "<i>Basheni</i>" and "<i>bashishi</i>" [are written] defective.
The first day [of the week] he shall write "<i>Be'echad beshabbat</i>".
On Rosh Chodesh he shall write, "On the first day of such-and-such month."  Rem"a:  There are those who say that we write , "On day one" of the month (Mordechai), and because of this we withhold from giving the bill of divorce on Rosh Chodesh (this is written in Seder Gittin).  On the second, he writes, "On two [Shenei] days," "three [Sheloshah]," "four [Arba'ah]," all in the masculine form with a Hei at the end.  Rem"a:  He shall write, "days" through ten--"On two days," "On three days," etc. (Seder Gittin)--and from then on he shall write, "day eleven," "day twelve," etc (Mordechai).  If he wrote, "days," it is not invalidated post facto if it was already given, and all the more so at a pressing time (Beit Yosef).  If he wrote, "three," or, "eight," plene with a Vav (Seder R"I Mintz), or he did not write "On the second," but only "the second" (Seder Gittin), or he wrote acronyms, for example he could not write "twelve" and instead wrote Yud-Bet (Rav Metroni), it is valid.  So too [he shall write], "On one and twenty," "On two and twenty," "On three and twenty," and so all of them.
The calculation of the years he shall write in the feminine form:  "In the year five thousand and one [Achat] to the creation of the world," "two [Shetayim]," "three [Shalosh]," "four [Arba]," all without a Hei at the end.  So too [he shall write], "eleven [Achat Esreih]," "twelve [Sheteim Esreih]," until twenty.  From then on:  "twenty and one [VeAchat]," "twenty and two [VeShtayim]," "twenty and three [VeShalosh]," the smaller counting being in the feminine form, and so on forever.  Rem"a:  He shall write the years with the greatest value first, but for days he shall write the smallest value first (implied in the Tur and the Sedarim)--"one and twenty," "two and twenty," etc.  If he wrote the greater value first, or he did the opposite and wrote the smaller value first in the years, it is valid (Beit Yosef).  If he wrote in the masculine form in place of the feminine, for example he should have written, "five [Chameish]," but instead wrote, "five [Chamishah]," it is valid (Mahari"l).
If he writes a bill of divorce on the first day of the month of Iyyar, he should write, "On the thirtieth day of the month of Nissan which is the first of the month ["rosh chodesh"] of Iyyar. And similarly for the other first of months ["roshei chadashim"] which are two days. And on the second day of rosh chodesh he should write, "On the first of such-and-such month." For [the month's] counting is from the second day. <i> Rem"a: Some say that one should never give a bill of divorce on rosh chodesh (Seder HaGittin in the name of the Semak, and the Mordechai Perek Hamegaresh, and the Hagahot Maimoni, and the Kol Bo), and it is good for one to care for this if there is no possibility that a case of agunah will happen [from its delay].</i>
If it is a leap year [and he wants to have the bill of divorce written in the first month of Adar], he should write on the first Adar, "For the month of the first Adar," and on the second [Adar] he should write, "For the month of the second Adar." <i> Rem"a: If he writes on the first Adar just "Adar", it is kosher. But if he writes it [plainly] on the second, the bill of divorce is invalid (Bet Yosef in the name of the Rosh and the Ran). And the word "first" ["rishon"] should be written fully with a "vav" (M"Ch B'Tikkun). Nissan [should be written] fully [with a "yud"], Iyyar, with two "yuds" (Hakol Baseder).  If he wrote [Iyyar] with one "yud", it is invalid, unless it is a case of emergency ["shaat hadechak"] (Terumat Hadeshen Siman 233). Some prevent the giving of the bill of divorce in Iyyar [for this reason], except for an "shaat hadechak", and they write [Iyyar] with two "yuds". Sivan, fully with a "yud" (this is also in the Seder Gittin). Tammuz, fully with a "vav". Elul, fuly with a "vav". Tishrei, with one "yud". Marcheshvan, one "vav" (Divrei HaRav). Kislev, plene with a "yud" (Terumat Hadeshen Siman 233). And see below Se'if 23 and 24.</i>
Some versions of the writ of divorce read: It is that I so-and-so the son of so-and-so.  This is not precise, and it is proper to avoid writing the words 'It is that'.  Also, some versions read, "And in the places of my fathers' and a comparable expression for the woman, and these should also not be written.
He should not write the word, V'dein full rather missing the Yud, and he should not write V'Igeret with the Yud, rather without it. 
[The words in the text of the get] ditihevyin (that you shall be), and dititzbiyin (that you desire) are spelled with three consecutive yuds. It is customary to write them with a total of 5 yufs each - דִּיתִיהְוִייִין, דִּיתִיצְבִּייִין.  Rama: neither of these words should be split into two lines, and if he did split them by writing "di" on one line and the rest on the next line, some authorities invalidate. (Mahariv and Maharil, so quoted in their sedarim in their names).   
He should extend the Vav of the word D'Tirichin and the Vav of D'Shivukin and the second Vav if D'Vichadu so that they do not look like Yud's.  (Rema: They were accustomed to extend these Vav's more than the other Vav's a little but but they should not extend them more than necessary. 
He should write "teruchin" (divorce) and "shivukin" (leavetaking or release) without the initial yud (as a second letter). "Piturin" (absolution, freedom) is written full with two yuds.  Rama: Some say that piturin is also written without the first yud (Seder Gittin of Maharil, and in Semag), and this is the custom. Therefore it is necessary to lengthen the vav (so that it does not look like a yud) of piturin (Mordechai). It is customary to write in the beginning of the get the words shivukin, piturin, teruchin (in that order), and then piturin, shivukin, teruchin, and finally teruchin, shivukin, piturin; but if he changed the order, it does not invalidate the get.
L'meihach, without a Yud. 
He should be careful that the leg of the Hey in the word L'Meihach should be separated from its roof, and so too with all the Hey's he must be careful, but with this one he must be extra careful. 
He should not write "l'itnasva" but rather "l'hitnasva".  Rama: "ve'enash" is written without a yud (Mordechai). If he skipped the heh of "l'hitnasva" and wrote instead "litnasva" it is kosher (Rashba 1163).
In this way he must be careful in any language or writing that he writes that it should not have two meanings. 
"It shall not be erased [Yimcha]," with an Aleph.  Rem"a:  If he wrote it with a Hei and already delivered the bill of divorce, it is valid (Beit Yosef).  If he wrote "Yimchei" with a Yud, it is invalid, unless it was a time of pressing need and in a case involving a potential Agunah (M"K).
The last line should consist only of "kedat Moshe v'Yisrael" (according to the law of Moses and Israel), and should not contain the words "sefer teruchin", "get piturin", or "iggeret shivukin" (roughly all translate as a writ of divorce).  He should write it ("kedat Moshe v'Yisrael") in larger letters so that he does not end in the middle of the line, for there is a concern that the witnesses will sign in the remaining half line, which is not appropriate. Nevertheless, if he wrote more that the words "kedat Moshe v'Yisrael" on the last line, it does not become invalid.
If he wrote ViYisrael Aleph Lamed together, it is not invalidated by this. Specifically after the fact or in the case of an <i>agunah</i> [a chained woman], as was explained earlier (125:16).
Since we recognize the style of the word, it is not invalid just because he skipped one letter.
If he wrote on the fourth day [Wednesday], the twentieth day of the month of Shevat and skipped the word, of the week, and also Wednesday was the twenty-first day of Shevat and he wrote the twentieth the Get is valid. [There are those who disagree and say it is invalid in such a case]. 
If he did not extend the <i>vavs that we said or if he wrote the <i>yuds that we said he should not write, or if he did not write the extra <i>yuds, this is an invalid <i>get</i>, except for the two extra <i>yuds in <i>biditihiviyin viDititzbiyin</i>, which is only [done] customarily. And some say, that if he did not write, <i>biditihiviyin  rashaah</i> and only wrote <i>viAt Tihei Rashaah</i>, it is better (Ran Ch. haMigaresh and in the Itor). And some say that if the husband did not protest, it is valid.. There is one who says that protesting does not help unless he wrote it or the scribe wrote it [directly] from his mouth.</i></i></i></i>
Iyyar should be written with two yuds (see earlier in Seif 7)
Kisleiv is written without a Yud. 
If he needed to write on the twelfth and he wrote on the Yud-Bet [twelve in gematria] it is valid.
L'Minyan is written with one Yud. 
"That we count" the word monin is written without a vav.  Rama: if he wrote it full, with a vav, it need not be invalidated in times of great need (Rivash chapter 314). If it is customary to write it full, it should not be invalidated [in any case]. The same rule applies if he wrote, "according to the tally which we count [in the city...]" and any similar text. 
The text in the get "d'yatva al nehar ploni" (which 'sits' on such-and-such river) is written with one yud. Rama: If he wrote d'yatva as two words: di yatva, it is kosher (Beit Yosef).
In such-and-such city, which is also called such-and-such, is written in feminine form (i.e. d'mitkarya and not dimitkri). 
It was customary to write: "who stands (i.e. is present in) a certain place, before "and every name".  Remah: And there are those who say that one should write the names and nicknames before "who stands in a certain place", etc. (see Piskei Mahari, Rabbi Yisrael Isserlan, section 247), and this is the custom in our lands. And it is customary to write "So and so ben ("son of" in Hebrew) so and so", and not "so and so bar ("son of" in Aramaic) so and so"; and if one wrote "bar", the get is valid. (Maharik, Rabbi Joseph Colon ben Solomon Trabotto, section 26).
They had a custom to write: And anything I and my father have:
If he wrote: 'b'dela anis' (without force), instead of 'b'dla anisna' (without me being forced), it is not disqualified. And they write: 'anisna', full, with a  'yud' by the 'nun' (MhaRY"O):
They have a custom to write: ''patrit' (I free you) before 've-shavqit' (I release you); and they have a custom to write: 've-tarukhit' (you are sent away), with a 'vav' after the 'reish': 
'Yatikhi' (you), with three 'yud's. 'Leikhi' (to you) with two 'yud's: 
It was customary to write
 "Intiti" (my wife) is written "missing" without a yud after the aleph.
"In
"To marry", it is customary to write without any [of the Hebrew letter] Yud. And if one wrote a Yud after [the letter] Hei, it is valid. (Hagahot Maimoniot, Rabbi Meir ben Rabbi Yekutiel Hacohen from Rotenberg, chapter 4 and Mordechai in the name of "there are those who say" believe that lechatchila, from the outset, one should write it with a Yud)
"In your hands", with three [of the Hebrew letter] Yud.
"Bidaychi" (in your hands) is written with 3 yuds.
One must write: "And you are hereby permitted to all men". And lechatchila, from the outset it is good to be careful to write: "you are hereby [permitted to all men]" on one line; but if it was written in the get on two lines, it is valid to give it. (Mahari section 143)  
"Muteret" (permitted) is spelled full, with a vav
"Muteret" (permitted) is written complete, with a vav.
"Minai" (from me) it is customary to write it without a yud after the mem. If he wrote it full, with a yud after the mem, it is not invalid ex post facto (Beit Yosef in the name of Ran and Rashba).
It has been customary to write "teruchin shevukin piturin" (divorce, leave-taking, exemption or freedom).
In a get for a fiance one writes: "that you were my arusa (after kiddushin and before they were married)". And if one wrote: "that you were my wife", it is valid. And there are those who say it is the same for the opposite, if one writes to his wife: my arusa,  it is valid post factum. (Beit Yosef)
A shin (ש) and an ayin (ע) in which their yud portions (י) do not make contact with them (i.e., the body of the letter), and similarly the yud (י) on the upper portion of an aleph (א) or the back portion of a zadik (צ) that does not make contact with [the body of the letter], if a child can read them well, then even if they are in the blank part of the document, it is adequate to render it valid in circumstances of "chainedness" (i.e., inability to leave the marriage).
If the legs of the heh (ה) are attached to the roof of the letter, if a child that is neither exceptionally bright nor exceptionally dull can read them, then that is adequate to render it valid in circumstances of "chainedness" (i.e., inability to leave the marriage), even if it is in the blank part of the document. And you can separate it with a knife. See above sec. 125:16.
If [the get] is missing one word from the copy, it is not invalid on account of this. Rama: And certainly if it is merely missing a vav (ו) in the second instance of "v'cadu," "v'catav," "v'cad" (Bet Yosef citing Responsa of Rashba), since because the content has not been changed, it would not be invalid due to this deficiency (thus writes Responsa of Rosh). The same result occurs if there are extra words, so long as the content is not changed (Rivash s. 205). However, if the content has been changed, then it is invalid. Similarly, some opinions hold that if it is written "לִבְרִיאַת עָלְמָה" with a [final] heh (ה) [instead of the correct "לִבְרִיאַת עָלְמָא" ending with an aleph (א)], the get is invalid, because "עָלְמָה" has the meaning "a young woman" (Rad Cohen); but some opinions render it valid in cases of exigency (Binyamin Zev). 
One should not write, "with the cancellation of all forms of 'modai' (a modaa is an advance notice delivered elsewhere that the divorce proceedings are being forced, and should therefore be considered null and void)." Rama: see the text of the get infra chapter 154.

Siman 127

You need to write the time in your divorce certificate (this document is written when you when married not when you get divorced). If you have a divorce certificate without a time then you can't get married. If you get married then you don't undo it, even if you don't have children.
If it was dated early, or if it was written during the day and signed the night after, it is invalid, even if they were discussing that matter.  And there are those who say that if it is written during the day and signed the night after, in times of distress, it is valid.  Hagah: And an early-dated get, even though it is invalid, if another man betroths her, she needs a get from the second, and she may not return to the first (Piskei Mahari, siman 13, according to the Rambam, and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ran and the Rashba). 
If it was written during the day and they didn't have time to sign it until night, if they wrote in it before the signing: This get was written on such-and-such a day and the witnesses did not have a chance to sign it until night, and the witnesses sign after, it is valid. 
One who sends a get from place to place, even if he dates it early, for they write the time from the day on which it is written and it won't get there until later, this is valid, for it has a voice [people know about it]. 
A get which was not delivered on the day it was written, there is no remedy to validate it, except to send it through an agent. Hagah: However, we are accustomed to act stringently and to write another (thus it seems from the words of R. Peretz, cited in Orhot Hayyim). And a get that a woman has possession of, we assume that it was given to her on the day it was written, and she need not bring proof, unless something happened to it, such as it was cast away (Tur and Tosafot, and the Rosh). 
If he told two to write a get and to sign it and give it to his wife, and the matter was delayed for a day or two, or the get was found to be nullified and they had to write another get, when they write the time and place, they do not write the time that the husband told them to write it, nor the place. How so? If they were in Jerusalem when the husband told them, and it was Tishrei, and it was delayed until Nisan, and by then they were in Lod, they write the time from Nisan and [the place] Lod. 
A get on which he did not write the name of the day, rather [he wrote] in the first or second week of a certain month, or in a certain month, or in a certain year and did not mention the month, [or] even if he wrote in a certain week, it is valid. And so if he wrote on it: Today I divorced her, it is valid, for the meaning is this day on which the get was issued.
If he wrote the time in it, cut the time out of it, and then gave it to her, it is valid. And there are those who invalidate.
A get whose "time" is late (in the future), it's valid to divorce with it. And even if he gives it to her immediately, the divorce is not affected until after the time that's written in [the get]. And some invalidate a future get.
If the scribe skipped [the words]: "according to the creation of the world", it's valid.
If he skipped the "thousands" and the "hundreds", only that he wrote "such and such" specifically, it's valid. And even if he also skipped "the creation of the world."
If he skipped "five" and only wrote "thousands", it's valid.
If he wrote the general and the small detail, and skipped the middle detail, e.g. he wrote "Five-thousand and 17" and skipped the "three hundred," it's invalid. And if she [re]marries, she shouldn't leave. And there is someone who says that we require of her a valid get from her first husband, and she remains unde the second [husband].

Siman 128

(One is) required to mention in the get the name of the place that the witnesses are standing there at the time of the signing: according to the count that we count here in the place ploni; and if he altered and mentioned the name of a different place--it is invalid; and if she married, she should not be divorced. But as regards the place where the scribe stands at the time of writing, there is no concern. Therefore, if it was written in one place and signed in another, he should mention the name of the place in which it was signed. And some say that also regarding the place where the scribe stands there is to be strict, and it is required that the scribe and witnesses should stand in one place. 
[We] write the name of his city and the name of her city, and [we] do not write the name of the place of birth. And even though if he altered it it is not invalid, nevertheless it is better to not write [it], in order that they should not come to err and appear altered. And also [we] do not write the name of the domicile, because we are exiled and wandering and the place of our domicile is weak in our hands. But [we] do write the name of the place where the man stands: "haomed hayom b'masa plonis (who stands today in the city plonis)"--if he is found in the place of the signing; and if he is not found there, [we] do not write his place at all. And similarly with the woman; if she stands in the place of the signing of the get [we] write the place she stands: "haomedes hayom b'masa plonis (who stands today in the city plonis)"; and if not, [we] do not write her place at all. Gloss: And if he wrote the place of birth or domicile and did not alter, it is valid (Riva"sh Siman 314). And if he altered the place where they stand, some validate similar to the place of birth, because all matters that he is not required to write, even if he altered it, it is valid; and some invalidate (In the Beis Yosef he brought the two opinions), and in a needful situation there is [room to] be lenient. But if he altered the the place of domicile, it is invalid [according] to all the world (Chapter He who Sends) and even if she married, she should leave [the marriage]. And [we] write: "masa plonis (city plonis)" whether it is a large or small city; and he should not write "plonis masa (plonis the city)", rather: "masa plonis (city plonis)". And if he skipped the word "masa (city)", it is valid.
He should write: "v'chol shum d'is li u'l'asrai (and all names that are to me and to my city), and besides this, if there is to the city two names he should write: "masa plonis d'miskarya plonis (city plonis which is called plonis). Gloss: and he should not write a yud next to the mem (Seder Gittin). However, if he wrote a yud "d'miskaryah", it is valid (id.).  And we are not accustomed to write: "v'chol shum d'is li u'l'asrai", rather if there are two names to the city, [we] write: "masa plonis d'miskaryah plonis oh d'miskaryah plonis" (Piskei mahar"ai Siman 185), and that is (also) the law if there are to the river two names. And if they have one name in the place of writing and another name in the place of giving, their law is similar to the names of the husband (Rosh and Ran Chapter He who Sends), and see infra Siman 129. And if there is to the city two names; one called in the mouths of jews and one in the language of the Kutim, the name that the jews call it is principal and [we] write according to the inference of their language (piskei Mahar"ai Siman 142 and Mahar"ik Shoresh 106). And if the two language are similar to one another, and the name that the jews call is none but an abbreviation, for example a city that the Kutim call "haredish" and the jews: "redish", we do not write but the jewish name (id. in his rulings Siman 151); but otherwise [we] write both: the jewish name first (so it is implied at id.) and regarding the Kutim's name: "d'miskaryah".
It is not necessary to write the name of the river, but the custom is to write it.  If there are two or three rivers, all of them are written:  "...who dwells on such river and such river."  Rem"a:  If he did not write the name of the river at all, or it [the name of the river] was changed, it is valid.  And any river outside the boundaries of the city is not written at all, even if it uncertain.  Even post facto, if it was written, there are those who invalidate it.
If in the city there are hot springs, and he wrote, "who lives on the well water," it is valid.
If the city is on the river, one does write about wells or springs--only the river.  Rem"a:  There are those who disagree, and they believe that one should write all the landmarks of the city.  Such is the custom in those countries, which will be explained to you from the text of the document that I wrote at the end of section 154.
A city that has nothing but wells and ponds, these [the wells and ponds] should not be mentioned at all, as there should be no difference between documents written before they were dug and documents written after they were dug.  Rem"a:  Two rivers that empty into one another--if one loses its name close to the city [i.e. it fully merges into the other river], we only write the one [river].  If both rivers retain their names, we write both of them.  If there is doubt regarding the matter, we only write one.  Such is always done--it is preferable to create a doubt based on missing information than a doubt based on contradictory information.

Siman 129

They write the name of the man and the woman on the get (that is, the divorce document).  If one of them has two names, then they write the name by which they are usually called and is most well known, and they write: man so-and-so, and all names that he has, divorced woman so-and-so and all names that she has.  And, if [the scribe] wrote his or her surname, then [the get] is valid. Rem"a:  And all the more so if he only wrote the main name, it is valid, and therefore one need not be precise for all the nicknames.  And there are those that say not to write all the names that a person is called.  Rather, if he has two names, then a person should write: so-and-so that is called such-and-such (Rabbeinu Tam, and the Beit Yosef in the name of the Ramba"n and the Rashb"a), and such is the practice and one should not change this.  And even if [such] a get was written [i.e., without indicating the names], one should not divorce with it, even though it says: "every name [that this person has]" until [the scribe] writes both names (Kuntres).  If [the scribe] only wrote one name, even if it is a secondary name, and [the husband] divorced with it, it is valid (Tur).
If [the scribe] wrote the name that is not most well known, and he wrote: "[and] any other name that he has," [the get] is invalid. However, if both names are written explicitly in the get, there is no difference if one is written before the other.
If [the scribe] changed his or her name, or the name of his or her city, even if he wrote: "[and] any name that he has," or, "[and] any name that she has," it is not a valid get.
If [the husband] is in one place, and [the husband] sends the get to [be delivered in] another place, and in each of these places he has a different name, [the scribe] writes [in the get] the name [that the husband has] where the get is being delivered, and [the scribe] writes the name [that the husband has] in the location that [the get] is being written [also in the get, but with the prefix]: "who is [also] called..."; And if [the scribe] writes [in the get] the name [that the husband has] where the get is being delivered and then includes the name [that the husband has] in the location that [the get] is being written, with [the  following expression beforehand:] "And any [other] name [that he has]," [the get] is valid. Rem"a: However, if [the scribe] makes the name [that the husband has] in the location that [the get] is being written, the main [name], and [the scribe] writes the name [that the husband has] in the location that [the get] is being delivered [also in the get, but with the prefix]: "who is [also] called..."; or [with the expression:] "and any [other name that he has]," [the get] is invalid. (The Beit Yosef wrote that this is implied from the language of the Tur)
An apostate should not divorce with his secular (lit. idol-worshipping name) but rather with his Jewish name. If he wrote the secular name as the primary name, and then prefaced the Jewish name by the term "who is also called," the get is kosher.   Rama: It is preferable to write the Jewish name "and any name and surname which he has" (Semag, Semak, Kol Bo, and Terumat haDeshen chapter 235). If he wrote the secular name and added "and any name and surname which he has, " the get is invalid (Rivash, chapter 43, and Tur). If he had a nickname while still Jewish, we write the Jewish name and add "who is nicknamed so-and-so, and any name and surname he has" (Seder Gittin).
A stranger ( non Jew) who writes/uses his foreign name is kosher, even if he becomes a permanent resident. 
אִם כָּתַב: פְּלוֹנִי הֶחָכָם, אוֹ הָרַב, אוֹ הַנָּשִׂיא, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵין קוֹרִין אוֹתוֹ כֵּן וְגַם אֵינוֹ בַּר הָכִי, הַגֵּט כָּשֵׁר, כֵּיוָן שֶׁהִזְכִּיר שְׁמוֹ בְּפֵרוּשׁ  If he wrote: Ploni(anonymous) the sage, or the Rabbi, or the President, despite the fact that we don't call him that or he does not qualify for that title, the Get is kosher, since his name was stated explicitly. Gloss: But a priori, we don't write Rabbi or Sage, even if he, or his father is a Rabbi or Sage and are qualified as such. Rather, we wrote: So and so or the son of so and so(and then the order of the get). And, we don't write the holy son. Rather, we write if he is a Levite or Kohen-So and so, the son of so and so, the Kohen or Levite. And if he has a nickname, we write that down afterward. But, if he has two names, we write on one "as he is called," and we write afterward: Kohen or Levite. And if one did not write Kohen or Levite, there are those that say it is rendered invalid. Since they were accustomed to writing it, there are those though who permit. And it seems to them to rule leniently in an exceptional situation, but a priori, one should write it. And if there is a doubt if he is a Kohen or Levi, two gittin need to be written. We don't write on the get: So and so, son of(bar) so. Rather, we write: So and so, son of(ben) so and so. 
Now, they practice in all of their gets, they write: "and any name that I have or my father (has) or my town (has). But in our states, we don't practice like his. Rather, if he has two names, we write the names explicitly, as was explained. 
If the name of the father of the man or woman was not named, it is Kosher. Gloss: And all the moreso, if his name was mentioned but not his nickname. But a priori, we write also the nicknames of his father. And if the father and the son each have one nickname, ideally, we write each one. However, if they didn't write these until the end: So and so, the son of so who is also known as so and so, it is Kosher. But if only the son has a nickname, it should be written before the name of the father and if it was written afterward, it is invalid. Therefore, a convert, an illegitimate child(of unknown fatherhood), or a child taken from the street(with no known parents), we only write their names.   
[The name] "Joseph, son of Simon," which was changed and written as, "Joseph, son of Samuel" is invalid.  And there is one who says that if she already remarried [after having been divorced with the invalid document], she does not leave her current marriage.  Rem"a:  This applies only if he was also known by the second name, but otherwise, she leaves.  When writing a document for the son of an apostate, we write it for him using his father's name, even though he is called up to read from the Torah and signs documents himself using his grandfather's name.  He should not sign the document, "son of an apostate."
If one did not write the name of the man and woman in the document, it is invalid, and the sons [of the wife to a future husband] are born of a prohibited union.
One who is known by one name in the Galilee and one name in Judea, and he and is wife are in an area where he is only know by one of those names, whether it is one of the two aforementioned names or another name, he should preferably write all of his names, or write the name by which he is known there and write, "and all others" to include the names from the other places.  If he wrote nothing but the name by which he is known in the place where he and is wife are, it is valid.
If he wrote a name by which he is known elsewhere and wrote, "and all others," for the place of writing and delivering, it is nullified.
One who has two names writes, "Reuven who is called Shimon." If he wrote, "Reuven Shimon," some say it is invalid. Rem"a: But if he is called by two names at once or he is called up to the Torah like this, it is valid. If he is called one thing by Jews and called something else by Kuthites [non Jews who lived in Israel. Samaritans.], he writes, "'Jewish name' who is called 'Kuthite name'" (Magid Mishneh in the name of the Ramban Ch. 3). But if their [the two names] topics are pretty much one thing, he only writes, 'Jew name' as was explained (128:3)
One who has two names, and the second is derived from the first as a nickname, e.g. Yitzchak [has the nickname] "Chakin", Aharon [has the nickname] "Arnin," etc., he need not write the nickname at all, unless there is someone else named Yitzchak or Aharon.

Rem"a:  This also applies to Yaakov [with the nickname] "Yekl" (Piskei Mahara"i #105) and Perets [with the nickname] "Pertsin" (Beit Yosef).  It seems it also applies to Avraham [with the nickname] "Avralan," and those like it.  However, if he wants to write it, it does no harm.  However, any shortening of a name which is itself a name on its own, such as Elchanan [being shortened to] "Chanan," is written, as are others like it.
If the second name is derived from a Hebrew name, such as "Yehudah Leon," we write, "Yehudah, who is called Leon," and if it does not resemble the Hebrew name at all, he should write, "who is nicknamed."

Rem"a:  The explanation of his words is that "Leon" means lion, and Yehudah is called "the lion cub Yehudah" (Genesis 49:9).  According to this, one should write, "Yehudah, who is called Leib."  However, there are those who say that whenever both names are in Hebrew, we write, "who is called," and if one is in a foreign language, we write, "who is nicknamed" (Hagahot Maimoni 3, Sefer Mitsvot Katan, and Kol Bo).  There is no difference whether it [the foreign name] is derived from the [Hebrew] name or not, and therefore we write, "Yehudah, who is nicknamed Leib" and all the like, and such is the practice in these countries.  Any family name is not written at all, whether it is Hebrew or a foreign language (Seder Gittin), and such is the practice.  One who has a Hebrew name by which he is called to read from the Torah, and who also has a name in a foreign language, we treat the Hebrew name as the main one, and regarding the second one we write, "who is called."  The same applies to a woman--we treat the Hebrew name as the main one.  There are those who say that one who has two names, if he is typically called by both and nonetheless one of them takes more priority, we write, "So-and-so, who calls himself so-and.-so."  If he is not typically called by the second, we write, "who is called" (Seder Gittin).  Any nickname which is a disgrace to the divorcer, we do not write it in the bill of divorce (D"A).  Therefore, for an apostate who returned, we do not write, "and any other name by which he is known" (M"K).  Any nickname by which he is not known alone, but rather he is called by [that nickname] together with the main name, there is no need to write that nickname (T"H #235).  However, if the Cutheans call him by that nickname alone, even though Jews do not call him that, there are those who say that we do write, "and any other name," even though we do not write that in any other document, and so too regarding family names (ibid.).  It seems to me that one should not write that nickname at all, as is the practice regarding family names.
If the second name is in the vernacular, and it is all one [name; e.g. given name and surname], for example Chaim Biban"t, we write, "Chaim who is called Biban"t." All nicknames are written as "who is nicknamed [so-and-so]" whether it is in Hebrew or in the vernacular.  Rama: It has already been explained that it is not customary to do this.
Someone whose name was changed due to illness, even though people always address him with his original name, despite this the changed name is the primary name... Rama: even if it [the changed name] is in the vernacular and the original name is in Hebrew (in Seder Gittin)  Mechaber: ...and we write it [the changed name] first, and afterward, "who is called so-and-so," using the original name.  This is true only where they sometimes address him by the second (new) name, but if they never call him by the second name, he writes only the first (original) name.  There is an authority who requires two writs of divorce with two names (i.e. one divorce for each name). If he has a definitive name with which he is called to the Torah, and with which he signs his letters and contracts, that name is primary.  Rama: If he is called to the Torah with both (either of the) names, we write the second (new) name as primary, and identify the original name by "who is called," but a witness who has two names and is signing a document should use both names without [writing] "who is called."  Someone whose name was changed due to illness, and he has a new nickname because of the new name, they write [both] the new name and its nickname before the original name. If he also has a nickname attached to the original name, they write it at the end (Seder Gittin). If his name was changed twice, they write the third name first, then the second, and then the first, and each name is written with its associated nickname (Ibid.).
There is an authority who says that when giving two writs of divorce to a woman (e.g. due to doubts about the correct name), he should not give them both simultaneously, but rather one after the other.  Rama: We should avoid giving two gets except when there is great need. He should give the get which the Rabbi feels is more kosher first, along with all of his questions and his reading of the order of the get, and afterward he should give the second one, also with the order of the get, and he should state to those present at the time of the delivery the reason as to why he is giving two gets (in the Seder [Gittin] of Ri Minz), and the Rabbi should say to the husband that he should have in mind to divorce her with each get. But if he gave them both together in one ceremony, it is valid.  Mechaber: There is no custom to write "the Priest" or "the Levite" or any nickname, but rather "so-and-so the son of so-and-so and any other name and 'chanicha' (nickname or surname) which I or my father have" [without writing the actual nicknames or surname]. Rama:  It has already explained that in these locales, the custom is otherwise. 
In the divorce of a convert he writes "so-and-so the son of our father Abraham."
Someone whose name is Gershom and they wrote in the divorce Gershon, or vice versa, it is not valid.
If it is unknown whether his name is Eliyah or Eliyahu, he should write Eliyahu, but if he wrote Eliyah it is not invalid. Rama: If he signs his name or is called to the Torah by the name Eliyah, they write Eliyah, and similarly with other such names (from tradition, dating to R"A from Prague -- possibly R. Eliezer ben Isaac from Prague, late 12th and early 13th centuries).
The name Shmarya should not be written Shmaryahu with a vav at the end.
The name Mattitya should not be written Mattityahu with a vav.
The name Yonatan should not be written Yehonatan, unless it is known that he signs his name that way or is called that way to read from the Torah.
The name David is written without a yud (after the vav). Rama: Gedalyahu [is written Gedalyahu] unless he says that his name is definitely Gedalya ("found written").
The name Chizkiyah should be written without a yud in the beginning of the word (between the chet and the zayin) and without a vav at the end (i.e. not Chizkiyahu). unless it is known that his name is Chizkiyahu. Despite this, even [if his name is actually Chizkiyahu and] he wrote Chizkiyah, it is kosher, but not vice versa. 
The name Hillel, there is one who says that it should be written "malei" (full) with a yud.  Rama: Other like words should be written similarly [malei]; even though [grammatically] it should be written "chaaser" [lacking, without a yud], it does no harm if he writes it malei.
The name Shabtai, should be written without an aleph.
The name Binyamin should be written without the last yud [between the mem and the nun sofi].
The name Yerachmiel, even though it is not found in Scripture, nevertheless if he persistently called himself Yerachmiel and specifically enunciated the chirik (under the mem), it is written that way [with the yud after the mem].  Rama: Something which is found in Scripture sometimes written malei, and sometimes written chaaser, we follow the majority [of locations in Scripture] (Seder Gittin). Any nickname in the vernacular, for example in the language of Ashkenaz, and he can transliterate [for the letter "T"] either tav or tet, we write tet, for the tav can be enunicated loosely (i.e. "sav") and all similar [transliterations] (Terumat haDeshen chapter 231). Any word in which it is doubtful whether to write [the letter] chet or kaf, we write kaf (ibid.), for example Michel Ichel, for in nicknames the letter chet is enunciated the same as kaf. However, for a woman called Rechlein, we write only Rachel, for that is the primary name (Rechlein is a diminutive form; Mahariv chapter 200), and similar cases are handled in like manner.  If he dealt [with these spelling issues] otherwise, it is still valid ex post facto.
We do not divide the name of the man or the name of woman on to two lines, but it is possible to divide some names that bear such division similar to Chedor Laomer (although Scripture Genesis 14:1 has this as a single word, Talmud divides it). Rama: and similarly Imanu El. But if he wrote it as a single undivided word, he did not lose (Seder Gittin).
The name Yedidiah, if divided into two words is kosher.  Rama: As long as it is on one line.  Mechaber: Pedatzur and Aminadav - one word.
The custom with women's names, there is one authority who says that Beilah should be written with an aleph (feminine grammatical forms frequently end in ...ah"), and likewise any name that is not in the holy tongue (Hebrew). But if it is in Hebrew, it is written with a heh (at the end). For instance, Chomah the daughter of Abaye (in the Talmud) or Chovah, for the name is in Hebrew. But if it is not in Hebrew, it is written with an aleph at the end. The same is true for men's nicknames, any nickname which is in Hebrew is written with heh, and those that are not in Hebrew are written with an aleph.  Rama: nevertheless if he changed and wrote heh instead of aleph, it is valid. Any nickname which changes pronunciation depending on the locale, for example Leib, for there are some countries where it is pronounced lightly, as Leib, and in some countries they say Leiba or Leiva, and similarly with the nickname Volf (Wolf), which is pronounced that way in these (Rama's) countries, and in other places it is pronounced Volfa or Volvlein; or the nickname Mendel, that some say Mendeel, and similar names; and likewise with the reading of words, for example in some countries they read Gumfrecht as Gimfracht, or [some locales] interchange the letters vet or feh or vav, for example Zanvil (with a vet) or Zanvvil (with two vavs); Feibish or Veibish, that some countries speak in a looser tongue; [in all these cases] we follow the pronunciation of people in the country wherein the get is being delivered. But it is not necessary to be precise in these matters how the names and nicknames are written, for everyone wrote according to the pronunciation of their country. Therefore the order of divorces varies from country to country in this matter, and the main point as I wrote above is how it appears to me proper to rule. If the pronunciation of the countries is not known, one should not change from the words of the predecessors.  Despite this, if he changed the spelling of one of these items, it is still valid ex post facto, so it appears to me. 

Siman 130

One needs to sign [<i>get</i>] in front of two kosher witnesses, and they should sign one signature under the other (Mordechai Halachos Gitin), both under the last line of the get. But don't leave space that is two lines worth of space between the last line [of the get] and their signature. If they place it so [see statement above], the <i> get </i> is void (Tur). There are those who disagree, and say that it is still made kosher by the witnesses [those who see that the man gave the get] (Rambam). If the second witness signs first, and the first witness signs after, it is still kosher, even though from the beginning, there were two signatures, two lines away from the <i> get </i> (Gittin). Nevertheless, initially, you shouldn't do so.  If you say that initially, one should not sign the <i> get </i> if they have been related and now distanced, or if you were the matchmaker (Seder HaGet Bisheim Maharil).  It's good to praise the scribe, so the scribe will not come close to the man and his wife, but when this is impossible, you need not be stringent (Maharik 106). And none of the witnesses may be suspects of adultery. There are those that are stringent that he [the witness] cannot have a blemish, and he should not be related to the scribe, and none of the witnesses may be related to the Rabbi officiating the <i> get </i>, and it's also good to be suspicious of all this from the beginning.  Also, it is customary to take signers and the witnesses to see that the husband commanding the scribe to write [the <i> get </i>], so all this will be in the presence of one group of witnesses (Mordechai Halachos Gittin and in the Smag). And the witnesses shouldn't sign unless it is [they are signing] with the quill and ink of the husband, like the scribe, as was explained earlier in the beginning of the <i> siman </i>. 
He shall start at the beginning of a line: no blank space shall be left in the margin before their signature[s].
Between the text of the get (writ of divorce) and the signature of the witnesses there should be nothing written which is not relevant to the get.  And if there is something written there, such as "inquire as to her welfare," the get is invalid, for maybe the witnesses only signed on to the welfare inquiry [and not the get]. But if he wrote "and inquire as to her welfare," the get is valid, for the phrase is attached to the text above, and the witnesses signed on everything. 
If they signed at the top of the get (writ of divorce) or its side, the right or the left or the reverse side, it is invalid.
Even when the witnesses sign at the bottom [of the get], the signatures must be oriented such that the back of the signature (i.e. top of the letters) faces the text of the get. If the feet of the signature face the get, the get is invalid. 
[Regarding] all of these gets (writs of divorce) which we have labeled invalid, if there are witnesses to the handing over of the get [to the woman], the get is valid. 
If he left over some of the bill of divorce and wrote it on a second page, and the [signatures of] the witnesses are below at the end of the second page, it is valid.  This is true for a scroll, because it is recognizable that it was not split, and that the scribe intended to finish it on the second page.  However, if this is not recognizable, if it was delivered by witnesses, there is doubt whether she is divorced, as there may have been two bills of divorce and part was split from the end of the page and part was split from the beginning of another page.  Rem"a:  However, if there are witnesses that it was originally one bill of divorce, and it was delivered with witnesses, it is valid (Hagahot Maimoni 4).  If he joined two skins with glue, and wrote a bill of divorce on them, they are invalid due to doubt (A"Z).
If he wrote two divorce documents with two pages in one scroll, one near the other, and the witnesses go from beneath one to the other, in that the name of the witness is under the first and his father ['s name] is under the second, and so is the second witness beneath him, the one that the names of the witnesses are written beneath it is valid. And if he wrote "Reuven son of" under the first and "Yaakov [the] witness" under the second, the second is disqualified. And if he wrote "Reuven" under the first and "son of Yaakov [the] witness" under the second, the second is also valid. gloss: And if it was passed with witnesses next to the one that does not have witnesses, it is valid post factum, for it is not worse than if it did not have witnesses on it at all (Bet Yosef in the name of RaMbaM) and see later section 133: 
[In the case of] five [men] who wrote a single Get (divorce document) for their five wives: if they wrote it collectively, for example, they wrote "On day such-and-such of the week, so-and-so divorced so-and-so and so-and-so divorced so-and-so, and as well each one said to his wife 'This will be for you...' " and the entire formula of the Get, and two witnesses sign beneath, then it is a valid Get and it should be given to each [wife] with witnesses of the transfer [of the Get]. If there are no witnesses of the transfer, then whoever is in possession of the document is divorced.  However, if he wrote, ''On day such-and-such of the week so-and-so divorced so-and-so..." and he finished the Get and began the next Get underneath in the same scroll, and wrote "And on that day so-and-so divorced so-and-so..." and finished the secccond Get, and so on until he finished all of the Gittin (pl. of Get), and the witnesses [sign] underneath, then if this document was given to each [wife] with witnesses of the transfer, then they are all divorced.  If there are no transfer witnesses, and one of the women is in possession of this document, then if it is the one whose Get is last, such that the witnesses [signatures] are read along with it, then she is divorced. And if one of the others was in possession of this document, then she is doubtfully divorced. Comment [by the Rama]: All this is in a case where he wrote "And so-and-so [divorced] so-and-so". But if he wrote in the second, or in any other one, "So-and-so [divorced] so-and-so", then only the last one is valid (Tur).
If he wrote: We so and so and so and so have divorced our wives so and so and so and so, and completed the divorce document, even though it was given to every one of them with witness of the transfer of the divorce document, it is not a valid divorce document, because to women can not be divorced with one document, as it is said (in the Torah): "and he wrote for her" (Deut. 24) and not for her and her peer. (However,) if he repeated and specified them (i.e. the couples being divorced) in the divorce document, and (thus) wrote: so and so has divorced so and so and so and so has divorced so and so at this time, such a divorce document is valid.
When the witness signs he must write his name and his father's name, such as "Yosef son of Yaakov witness". If he wrote: "Yosef Witness", or "son of Yaakov witness" or "Yosef son of Yaakov" but did not write "witness" it is valid. ReM"A Note: some say that since it is sufficient if he wrote "Yosef witness", if so it is not necessary to write "son of Yaakov" and if he made a mistake or changed it, it [the signature] should not be invalidated. (Trumas HaDeshen Siman 228) as will be expounded upon in Siman 128 etc; and one should not rely on this except in times of dire need and in a situation of Iggun [a case of an abandoned wife, where we suspect that the women will be unable to obtain a divorce otherwise]. See Siman 128 [regarding] how a witness who has two names should sign. A witness need not include his nickname with his signature (sic, Siman 234) even in the best case scenario [meaning: as opposed to being preferable to include one's nickname, but if one didn't it would not invalidate the signature]. Also, one should not sign his name or his father's name with a title such as "Rabbi" or "Wise" [sephardic term for "Rabbi"] rather he should write only "so and so son of so and so witness" (Seder Gittin). Anyone about whom there is some doubt regarding how to write [his name properly], it is unfit to have him sign in the first place, as it is not fitting to get into such doubts in the from the start (author's own opinion); therefore, we do not have someone who's father is a sinner sign as a witness, as will be expounded upon in Siman 129, and likewise all other such situations. And in preferable circumstances we are careful with the witnesses signatures with everything which we are careful with in the writing of the bill of divorce, namely, proper writing and separate letters and alike. (Beit Yosef citing an anonymous composition).  
If the witness signed "Yosef" only and did not add "witness", it is invalid. Rama: And certainly if he wrote "the son of so-and-so" without adding "witness", it is invalid (Beit Yosef).
The witnesses must both sign in front of the other.  If each signed separately, it is invalid. Rama: Some authorities validate a get in which the first two witnesses signed in front of each other and the third witness signed separately (Tur in the name of Rabbenu Tam).
A get written in the script of one languages, whereas its witnesses sign in a different script, is valid, as long as the witnesses are familiar with the language of the writing and its script.
If one of the witnesses signed in one language and the second one signed in another language, it is valid.
The witnesses that sign a writ need to know how to read and how to sign.  If they do not know how to read, we read to them and they then sign, provided that they understand the content of the writ.  If they do not know how to sign, we mark the paper with saliva et al, such that the mark is temporary, and they trace the mark.  Rem"a: Some authorities forbid this practice a priori.  Instead we tear blank paper for them [into a stencil of their signatures] and they trace the stencil.
If a writ that signed by disqualified witnesses, even if one is disqualified and the other is acceptable, it is invalid.  Even if [qualified] witnesses are present at the delivery of the writ, [it is invalid] because it is internally forged.
It is best for the scribe to not sign as one of the witnesses, as some authorities disqualify this.
If a writ was produced under the auspices of a Samaritan court, and Samaritan witnesses are signatories on it, even if it was written by a Jew and delivered in the presence of Jewish witnesses, and the names of the Samaritan signatories are clearly identifiable as Samaritan (such that there is no concern that they might be [illegitimately] relied upon), it is still invalid.  If, however, a woman brought a writ that served for her divorce and she now wishes to remarry, and the signatories names appear Samaritan - if the names are never used by Jews at all, she may remarry, because they are certainly Jews, as the arrangers of the writ would not have mistakenly allowed people with these names to sign unless they were certain that they were Jews.  If the names are somewhat similar to Jewish names, we are concerned that arrangers of the writ may have mistaken them for Jews, though they are really Samaritans, and she may not remarry.
If a man gave his wife a writ privately, or even in the presence of one witness, it is not considered a writ.  This is the case if the  writ is in the scribes handwriting.  If the husband wrote the writ in his hand and one witness signed and he gave it to her, it is a invalid writ, and it disqualifies her from marrying a Kohen.
The witnesses on a writ should not take any more payment than their apparent opportunity cost.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that we stipulate with the witnesses that if they damage the writ they must pay for it, and with this proviso they may take a large fee, or perhaps [they may take a large fee to compensate for the fact that] the witnesses may not marry the woman who is divorced [with this writ] as is explained earlier (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 12), and this is our common practice.
Some authorities say that the ink on the writ must dry before the witnesses sign.

Siman 131

The writing of a get (writ of divorce) and the signature of the witnesses must be in the name of (for the sake of) the divorcing man and the woman being divorced. If it was not written with this knowledge, the get is invalid. For example, a scribe who wrote a get to teach or for practice, and the husband came and found that the sample get had been written with his name, and the woman's name was the same as his wife's name, and the city  was as his city; and he took the get and divorced his wife with the sample get, it is not a valid get. 
In addition, if he wrote to divorce his wife and changed his mind, and a resident of his city found him and told him, "My name is as your name, and my wife's name is as your wife's name," and he (the second man) took the get and divorced his wife, even though this get was originally written to effect a divorce, the get is not valid. 
Furthermore, a man who has two wives with identical names, and he wrote to divorce the elder, changed his mind, and used the get to divorce the younger woman, it is not a valid get, for even though it was written in the name of the divorcing man, it was not written for the purpose of divorcing the woman who received the divorce.
What is more, if he said to the scribe: Write, and I will divorce the one I wish [to divorce] with it, and the scribe wrote on this condition, and he divorced one of them with it, behold this is doubtful divorce. And that is the ruling if he said to him: Write, to whichever one goes out of the door first [and] I will divorce her with it.
A divorce document that he wrote not for its own sake(without intent), even if the scribe goes over it with intent, it is not a divorce document. And there are those who doubt this. 
אֲפִלּוּ נִכְתַּב לִשְׁמוֹ, אִם לֹא חָתְמוּ הָעֵדִים לִשְׁמוֹ, אִם נְתָנוֹ לָהּ בְּלֹא עֵדֵי מְסִירָה, אֵינוֹ גֵּט. וְאִם נְתָנוֹ לָהּ בְּעֵדֵי מְסִירָה, הֲרֵי זֶה פָּסוּל. וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁגַּם זֶה אֵינוֹ גֵּט:
Even if it were written in his name, if the witnesses did not sign in his name, if he gave it to her without witnesses of transfer, it is not a divorce document. And if he gave it to her with witnesses of transfer, behold it is unfit. And there are those that say it is not even a divorce document(as opposed to just being unfit).
Therefore, one needs to be cautious when the husband commands the scribe to write that he say before witnesses that they should sign the divorce document: "Write this divorce document in the name of so and so, my wife. And so too the scribe should vocalize when he begins to write that he is writing for such an such a person, the wife of so and so, in the name of so and so. Ramah-gloss: And he should say this before the signing witnesses of the document, and they should write it with consistency and not in intervals, in order that they write his and her name like it was from the beginning. However, after the fact, if he wrote in intervals, it is kosher. (an opinion on its own). There are those that say emending the parchment, outline of the quill and all the more so, tracing, all need to be done with intention. However, if he did all these without intention, it is not invalid. 
The two signatory witnesses should be there at the time in which he starts to write the divorce document, in order that they know it was written with intention and they identify the timing of the signing. 
When he says to the witnesses to sign the bill of divorce, he should say to them that they should sign in the name of his wife. And so too each one should say, orally, when he signs, that he is signing it in the name of so and so, the wife of so and so, with his(husband's) name. Rem''a: And if he started to sign a little of his name and he didn't orally say his(husband) and her name, and afterward he remembers and says it, there are those who permit such a situation.

Siman 132

Says to a scribe: write a divorce document for my fiancé for after the marriage is consummated then i will divorce her and give her a divorce document  since we are getting a divorce and this is binding. The document has the time written when it will be given, but if it has the time of when it was written then its not binding (and the divorce is not okay).
Command to write a divorce document to divorce his wife  with no intent to consummate it then there is no divorce document. If a he does yibum and then after yibum he divorces her then she has the status of a divorcee. 
2 whose names are the same and whose wives are the same. They make 2 divorce documents and they interfere with each other, giving to the other of them with a witness handing it over. If one of them is lost you don't give the divorce document and there is no divorce for any of them. If one gives his wife or both of them then the divorce is good for them. 
A divorce document is brought and dropped in a place with caravans and it is found. Or even a place without caravans and its found in a city that the divorce document is written then it is to be set aside until 2 people with the names the same as the ones on the document come. If they find it now and nobody had come by it since the time it was lost until the time it was found, or even if they don't find it now and there is a clear sign or a stamp is visible on the divorce document, or even if there is no sign to stamp visible rather its found in a vessel that the document was in and there are signs and stamps on the vessel and you know you didn't lend that vessel to another, or if its found in a connected to pocket or wallet to ring that holds feels and there is nobody you lent it to, or its found in a house with other vessels, FOR ALL OF THESE CASES ITS FINE (the document is usable and the marriage is fine). We are not dealing in a case with any of these. Rather if nobody knows if a man was near the document and there are no signs or stamps or signs visible and on a vessel there is a sign but not on the document, we are dealing with a case where they (the couple) didn't get the document because it was lost, even if witnesses testifies that after it's stored in its place it wasn't in the city it was addressed to. Then if they see a man pass there, even of if it isn't a frequented caravan and its not stored by two yosef ben shimons  (people with the same name). We are dealing with even if a gentile passed, rather if so a witness of the document says "forever there is no seal on another document with this mans name." Even there are no witness that comment that its in sealed in a designated place, for example the document is currently in his presence, these are all good cases. 

Siman 133

It is necessary that there are two valid witnesses at the time of the handing over of the divorce document, as it says <i>and he should hand to her the divorce document before the two of them together (Beit Yosef)</i>. And it is necessary to sign it with witnesses in an ideal situation, rather, after the fact, if there are only witnesses of the signing, and they handed it between them, [the document] is valid. And this is the case if there are witnesses of the handing over and there were not witnesses of the signing, [the document] is valid. There are those who say, that if it is known that he gave it to her without witnesses of the handing over, even though the witnesses signed it, [the document] is invalid. However, when they see it signed, it relies on that it was definitely handed over with witnesses of the handing over. <i> Gloss: See before at the beginning of siman 130 that one pair [of witnesses] take witnesses of the signing and of the handing over, or without two pairs. </i>
The signatures, too, need to be dry when the *get* [bill of divorce] is presented.
We normally present the *get* [bill of divorce] in the presence of a quorum of ten.

Siman 134

One needs to nullify all of his possessions before he gives a <i> get</i>. Because if he gives over his belongings in front of two people and says: the <i> get</i> that I want to give to my wife, know that I am forced to give, and therefore, I am saying that in front of you, it should be nullified, so it's nullified, although he did not take from his belongings. The Rama Comments that even though he gave it over in front of two witnesses at different times, only this one and not that one, alone they are kosher (Rivash Siman 232). Even if you say there is not a source for the rape. And even if the rape reported was a lie. And even if you say that it is possible after this, we do not say that this testimony was nullified, until proof is given that this report is nullified. And there is no need for an acquisition. 
Therefore, he needs to nullify before the writing of the bill of divorce any protest(of annulment) that he  has made, and he should say as such: behold I am nullifying any protest I informed on this bill of divorce. And so too I am nullifying any thing that will cause, when they are established, the nullification of the establishment of this bill of divorce. And so too I am testifying on myself that I did not inform any matter that will cause this bill of divorce to be nullified, and behold I am invalidating any witness or witnesses that will testify that I informed or said anything that will cause the bill of divorce to be nullified or that will weaken the power of the bill because of this protest or speech. Rem''a: And there are those that say it is enough if he says he is canceling any protest or protest of a protest until the end of all possible protests. And so too we practice, but it is better a priori to be cautious and to hold like the first position. 
They practiced to require a nullification of a protest that even the divorcer made on his own accord. Rem''a: However, if he forgets to nullifying, it is Kosher, since he divorced on his own accord. They practiced also to nullify a protest before he commands to write, before the giving. Despite the fact that there are those that say that even if he cancels the bill of divorce between the writing and the giving, it is not effective after nullification of the protest to divorce with that same bill. Therefore, we do not suggest to him to leave until he gives the bill of divorce. Even in this case, there are those who are stringent to nullify the protest even in the time of giving. 
If the husband takes an oath to give a bill of divorce, they need to make him renounce it beforehand, in order that it not look like he is being compelled. But if it was just a pledge he made, he can give it if he wants, because this is not similar to being compelled. Rem''a: and this is the ruling if he receives an acquisition to divorce. But if he accepts fines if he does not divorce, this is not called compulsion, since his bill of divorce was dependent on another thing and he will be able to give the fine and not divorce. And there are those that are stringent even in a case like that. And it's better to worry a priori and exempt him from the fine. But if he already divorced(her) because of this, and even did so from the strength of the oath he made to divorce, the bill of divorce is kosher, since, from the outset, they did not compel him by this. There are those that say that say that it is not called compulsion unless they compel the man himself, but if they compel someone else until his friend divorces, even a son for his father or vice versa, this is not called compulsion. There are those who are stringent in the case of a father and son. See later on in 152 for these laws. 
This, that is not considered a bill of divorce when he is forced, this is discussing a case when he declared a protest. But, if he did not declare a protest, if they forced him illegally, it is invalid. And legally, for example, if he is obligated to dismiss(divorce her)and he does not want to, and the Beit Din forces him until dismisses, this is a valid bill of divorce. And it is a commandment upon each Beit Din, at all times, to force the divorcer to nullify the protest. 
Someone who delivered a document ("moda'a") invalidating a get (writ of divorce) in advance (typically stating that he is being forced to grant a get against his will, and the get is therefore invalid), the court administers (Rabbinically sanctioned) lashes of "rebellion", for he has caused there to be bastards (mamzerim), for when the get arrives in her hands and she remarries, and after time witnesses arrive who testify that he [had previously] voided the get in their presence, or that he had delivered an invalidating document to them prior to his writing the get, the outcome is that her child from the second marriage is a bastard.  Rama: Even if he voided the moda'a at the time he gave the get (and the divorce is therefore valid), we nevertheless ostracize him out of concern that some people will know of the moda'a, but not know of its abrogation (Responsa Rosh rule 52, and similarly Beit Yosef in the name of Tosafot).
If a Jew forced him to divorce, not in accordance with the law, yet he said, "I want to [divorce]," and he even abrogated the moda'a or he never gave a moda'a, [the get is nevertheless] invalid. Even so, he invalidates her from [marrying into] the priesthood (because of the hint of being a divorced woman).
If non-Jews force him to divorce her, if he has to divorce her from the law, the divorce is invalid, but nevertheless, he has disqualified her from marrying a kohen. But if the law requires him to divorce her, there is not even the scent of a get in it, and she has not been disqualified from marrying a kohen.  And even if he received money for giving the get, we don't say that because of this he agreed [to give the get]. (Hagahot Alfasi, ch. hamegaresh). 
If a Jewish court pressured him by using non-Jews, and the non-Jews were beating him saying: Do what the Jews are telling you to do. He is treated as if he was forced by a Jewish court. 
A get about which a husband gave a notice of invalidation, and he then gave it to her, and then he annulled [the invalidation] of his own accord and then said to her: Be divorced with the get that I already gave you, he doesn't need to go back and take it from her. 

Siman 135

Witnesses give the divorce document in front of them (the couple)need to read it before giving it. Its goof to read it again after you give it. If you don't read it then just give it, and they are divorced. Ramah says so if they testify in that this was a proper ceremony of presenting the divorce document. In the quintessential case we follow the custom that a wise man presents the divorce document and reads it to them in the beginning and in the end with the witnesses. Afterward ask the scribe if the divorce document that he wrote and the names of the couple involved. After that ask one witness if he can sign his name and his friends name.
Read it and give it to the owner or the messenger (it being the divorce document). He enter to his house and gives it to her. If its not read, give it to her and throw in to water or fire. Behold now she is divorced. Since it is read at the beginning  there is no concern that is was switched. There is more, rather even the owner says: another document is read instead of the divorce document, it doesn't matter and behold she is divorced. And if the divorce document is handed and seen by him, any time is fine to deliver it.
Behold, [if] they didn't originally read the divorce document, and he gave it to her in front of them (the witnesses) and he threw it into a fire or the sea, even though the husband says, "It was a valid divorce document," behold this is a doubtful divorce. Ram"a: And even if she [re]marries, she goes out (Tosfot in the other version, and such does the Beit Yosef write in the name of the Rashb"a and R"i). But if the divorce document still comes out from under her hands, if she [re]marries, she does not go out, but she shouldn't [re]marry with this divorce document since they didn't read it immediately after the giving [of it] (so is it implied from Rabbeinu Yerucham mentioned earlier and not like the Beit Yosef); and some argue.
If he gave her a smooth [i.e. blank] paper and said, "This is your bill of divorce," if they did not test it with "nara" water to see if something had been written on it, or if they did test it and the writing appeared, there is doubt as to whether the woman is divorced.  If they tested it and no writing appeared, there is no concern of divorce.
If he threw a document into her courtyard between the barrels, in front of witnesses, and they searched and found a <i>mezuzah </i> or other document, we are not concerned for her, for that which they found is what he threw.  If they found two or three <i>mezuzot</i> or other documents, we are concerned that perhaps he threw a document of divorce and it was eaten by rodents, and there is doubt as to whether she is divorced.  When does this apply?  When they did not call out about it.  However, if after they called out that it was a bill of divorce the husband took it from their hands and threw it to her courtyard between the barrels, even if they only found but one <i>mezuzah</i> or document, there is doubt as to whether she is divorced.

Siman 136

One who divorces must say when he gives her the divorce document, "Behold, this is your divorce document", or something similar. If he puts it in her hand and says nothing, the divorce document is invalid. Rama: Ideally he should say to her "Behold this is your divorce document (and I am accepting your divorce document) (Mordechai in chapter Hamgaresh and Bet Yosef in the name of HaKuntres) and behold you are divorced from me, and behold you are permitted [to remarry] any other person (ibid and Tur), from now on (Bet Yosef in the name of the Y"A)." We have the custom that the husband folds the divorce document like a letter, and gives it to her, so that she can grasp the entirety of it in her hand when he gives it to her. The husband must understand what he is saying to her. And so, anything he says to her, they must explain to him wgat it means (all in the Seder Gittin).
When does this apply? When he had not discussed with her the process of her divorce document. But if he did discuss with her the process of her divorce document, and he takes the divorce document and puts it in her hand and says nothing, indeed that is a [valid] divorce document.
When he gives her the divorce document, he should say to her, "Behold you are divorced from me with this divorce document and permitted to [remarry] any other," or "Behold you are sent away from me." If his messenger gives it to her, he says, "Behold you are divorced from so-and-so with this divorce document, and behold you are permitted to [remarry] any other." If he says [instead], "I am not your spouse," or "I am not your husband," some say that is not a divorce, even if he discussed with her the process of the divorce, as it says (Deuteronomy 24:1, Deuteronomy 24:3) "And he sent her away", and not that he sent himself away. And some say that if he discussed the process of divorce with her, it is a divorce of doubtful [legality].
[If] he says to her, "Behold, you're on your own," that is a divorce. But if he says to her, "Behold, you are free," [it is as if] he said nothing.
It needs to be given to her through the framework of divorce, but if it was given to her through the framework of debt documents, she is not divorced, unless he says to her afterward, "Behold this is your divorce document," or he informed the witnesses so beforehand. Rama: And as long as the woman is informed that it is divorcing her, or the witnesses tell her afterward (so says Tosafot Perek haZorek).
If someone else in the city has the same name as him, and the wives have the same names, he cannot divorce her unless that other person is present Rama: Even if the divorce document goes out from one of their hands [straight to his wife, so there is no doubt who it is meant for], she is not divorced, until proof is brought that she was divorced while the other person was present, or the witnesses of the transfer are brought that she is indeed his wife (R"Y C"H). Some say that if the names of the divorcers are the same, even though the names of the wives are not, nevertheless they write in a sign of [the real divorcer, i.e. he has black hair], or his nickname (Seder Gittin), or that one is a kohen and the other is not a kohen (Piskei Mahari Siman 6). And so they have a custom to give the divorce document in public, so that if there are two people in the city whose names are the same, they will be present for the divorce documen (Chiddushei Agudah Perek Kol HaGet).
One may not divorce on the Sabbath. And if it is an emergency [lit. "the hour requires it"], such as a shechiv mera [a man on his death bed] who is being taken over by illness and wants to divorce her so that she would not be tied to a yibum [levirate marriage], if he has the get [bill of divorce] in his possession, he can cause her to acquire it [his possessions], and she will acquire the get inside it. And if it impossible [for this acquisition to occur] without [an official ] moving [of the possession it is in], for example the get is not sitting in possession, they can put it in his hand and it can be given to her. Rem"a: Some say that today, now that the Oral Torah is written, it is permitted to carry a get on the Sabbath (Mordechai the beginning of HaZorek, and the Smag), and he can give it to her in any fashion.

Siman 137

[If] he says to her, "Behold you are permitted to any man except for so-and-so," or "beside so-and-so", it is not a get [bill of divorce]. What should he do? He should take it from her, and give it to her again and say, "Behold you are permitted to any man." But if he says, "On condition..." ["al menat"] that is like any condition on a get [which is fine], whether he says, "On condition you do not marry him," or "on condition you not not become his spouse," or "on condition you do not become his." Rem"a: Some are stringent even when he says "al menat" (Ran in the name of Y"A, Rashba in the name of the Ramban_, and some are stringent [only] in an ideal case. And if she is suspected of cheating with a certain man, he should tell Bet Din and they will prevent them from marrying each other (Mordechai beginning of Hamegaresh).
If the man excluded from divorce using the terminology "chutz" or "ela" (meaning except for) was someone with whom betrothal would not be valid for her (e.g. a forbidden relative) then the bill of divorce is kosher. But if betrothal with him would be valid for her, even if doing so would violate a negative commandment, then the get is not valid.  The same applies if the get excludes a minor (that the get is invalid).  There is an authority who says that if the get excludes a minor she is doubtfully divorced (Tur in the name of Rabbenu Tam). 
If the man excluded is (i.e. she is permitted to everyone except) the husband of her sister, or he excluded someone who is not yet born, or he said to her, "except for extramarital relations,"... Rama: or except for anal intercourse (Tur)  Mechaber:  ...or to the exclusion of [remarriage with] a kiddushin document (as opposed to money) or [remarriage with] money (as opposed to a kiddushin document) or to the exclusion of the abrogation of your vows or to the exclusion of your inheritance, she is doubtfully divorced. 
If he wrote (lit. said to her), "You are hereby permitted to every man except for Reuven and Shimon," and then at the time he delivered the get he said, "You are hereby permitted to Reuven and Shimon," or he said, "You are hereby permitted to Reuven," or he said, "You are hereby permitted to Shimon," or he said "Even to Shimon;" she is doubtfully divorced. 
If he said to her, "Here is your get and you are hereby divorced from me today, but tomorrow you will be my wife," she is doubtfully divorced. 

Siman 138

If he says to her: pick your get (that is, a bill of divorce) up from the ground, it means nothing [i.e., the divorce is not valid].  And even if it sitting in his hand, and she is close to him and she picks it up from there, it is not a [valid] get, since he did not help her take it.  Even if his hand was closed with the get inside, and he opened his hand and she took it from there, that he did help her take it, even so it is not a get, since he did not bring his body near to her.  And if the get was buried under the belt on his waist and he pulled in his stomach and loosened it, and tilted himself to her and she took it, we call that legitimate "and he gave" [which is a requirement for a valid get, as it it written:] (Deuteronomy 24:1, 3).  However, if he pulled in his stomach but didn't tilt himself toward her, or if he tilted himself toward her but did not pull in his stomach, that is not considered [as if he is] giving [her the get].  And there are those that say that if it was attached on his hand or his hip and he bent his body to her or he tilted his hand until the get fell on its own and he said to her: "this is your get," then this is a [valid] get.
If he put the get (that is, a bill of divorce) in her hand and the string with which it is tied remains in his hand, if the string is strong enough that he can pull it away and bring it to him, then she is not divorced.  And if not, she is divorced.  And if the tie is strong [enough] that he would be able to pull it away and bring it to him had she not closed her hand, but since she closed her hand he is unable to pull it away and bring it to him, that is not [considered as] giving [her the get], and she is not divorced; and there are those that say that she is divorced.
Hegeh: And all of this is only dealing with the circumstance that she closed her hand against the wishes of the husband.  However, if the husband commanded her to close her hand, and even if he reached the get out to her and she took it from the other side, it seems to me that this is a [valid] get.
If he gave her the get while she was asleep, and then she awoke, and the get is in her hand, and he says to her "this is your get," he does not need to take it back from her hands and give it to her again.  However, if he did not say to her "this is your get," even if he told witnesses, "see the get that I am giving to my wife," it means nothing, since he gave it to her while she was sleeping.  And likewise, if it fell from her hand while she was sleeping, even if she went ahead and took it, it is not a [valid] get until he gives it to her again and tells her: "this is your get."
Hegeh: If he put her get in her courtyard at the time that she is sleeping, there are those that say that it is not a [valid] get.  But, [if he put it] in the hand of her messenger, according to everyone it is a [valid] get. (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ran and the Rashba)
If he said to witnesses: "see this get that I am giving to my wife," but he said to her at the time that he gives it to her: "take this shtar chov (that is, a note indicating that the holder owes money)," this is a [valid] get, even though he didn't say to her: "this is your get."  And there are those that say that this is only true if he told the witnesses not in front of her, but if he said it in front of her, and then at the time he gave it to her he said: "take this shtar chov," she questionably divorced.
But, if he did not say first: "see this get that I am giving to her," and he said to her: "take this shtar chov," he must say to her: "this is your get," but he does not need to take if from her and give it to her again.  And there are those that say that this applies when he says: "take this shtar chov." But if he said to her: "zechi (that is, merit [a phrase which has a connotation of credit as opposed to debit]) in this shtar chov," there is no way to fix [the situation] until he takes it from her and he gives it to her again and says: "this is your get." 

Siman 139

If he threw her the divorce document into her courtyard, whether it belonged to her or was lent or leased, she is divorced. Under what conditions? that she is standing in her courtyard and it is preserved to her knowledge; but if she is not standing there, even if it is preserved to her knowledge, she is not divorced.
If he placed [the bill of divorce] in her yard, and subsequently went there and told her "here is your *get* [bill of divorce]," there is one who wrote that even if the *get* is still there, she is not divorced until she picks it up from there, or until he picks it up from there and gives it to her to be divorced by it, since we require that she be near the yard at the time of the placement of the *get* into it, and at the time that he tells her "here is your *get*." And similarly, when her *get* and her yard come at once, we require her to stand at the side of the yard at the time of the placement. And there are those who disagree.
If he placed [the bill of divorce] in her yard without her intent, and she was not standing on the side of her yard, she is considered doubtfully divorced.
If she was standing on her roof, and he threw [the bill of divorce] to her - to the top of the roof, if it had a fence, as soon as [the bill of divorce] entered the airspace enclosed by the walls of the fence, or even if it had no fence, and [the bill of divorce] reached within three hand-breadths of the surface of the roof - she is divorced, even if [the bill of divorce] burned up before it landed. And that is when the *get* [bill of divorce] preceded the fire, so that [the *get*] was destined to land, had the fire not arrived after he threw it. But if the fire care first, [she is ] not [divorced],  as [the *get*] was not destined to land on her property.
And there is one who says that if [the bill of divorce] got erased or burned up before it arrived, even if it got erased or burned up after it arrived within the air-space of the walls or within three hand-breadths of the roof, she is not divorced.
If he was on his roof and threw [the get] to her courtyard, if the walls of the courtyard are taller than the roof, such that as soon as he threw the get from the airspace of the roof, it entered into the airspace of the walls of the courtyard, she is divorced, even if it was erased before it reached the ground, and in the instance that it was erased after it began to descend.
If she had a stalk standing in her courtyard, and it reaches above the walls of the courtyard, and he throws the get on it, she is not divorced, for it is not preserved there.
If he threw it to her property, and it traveled through all of her property and then exited outside of her property, she is not divorced, even if it was within three tefachim (hand-breadths) of the ground within her property, since it was not going to ultimately come to rest in her property.  And there are those that say that she is questionably divorced.
Two courtyards one inside the other, the inner [courtyard] hers and the outer [courtyard] his, and the walls of the outer [courtyard] higher than of the inner [courtyard], once he has thrown the get into the air of the outer [courtyard], she is divorced, for the inner [courtyard] is preserved by the walls of the outer courtyard. Which is not the case with boxes. How so? Two boxes one inside the other, the inner one hers and the outer his, and he threw her get to her inside them, even if it reached the air of the inner one, she is not divorced until it rests on the side of the inner box. Regarding what is this said? When it lies on its side and has no rims, but if it has rims, even if [the get] rests on its floor, she is not divorced, for the wife's utensil in the husband's domain does not acquire a get on her behalf unless he is in fact not particular about its place.
If she was in his courtyard, and he threw the get to her there, she is not divorced. Even if she were sitting on a bed and the get fell on the bed, she is not divorced until the get reaches her hand or her lap or one of the utensils which the husband is not particular about its place. And thus if it reached her bed and she was sitting on it, and it was ten tefachim high, she is divorced, for she has reserved a domain to herself and the husband is not particular about the place of the legs of the bed. And if it was not ten tefachim high, she is doubtfully divorced.
If he lent her space in his courtyard, but did not designate the space for her use alone, and it (the get) fell on a beam or a rock, if the space on which it fell is not 4 cubits by 4 cubits, and is not 10 handbreadths high, and it does not have an adjectival name, she is divorced. If even one of these qualifications is present, then [we presume] he separated a region for himself, and he lent her one space and not two spaces, and she is therefore not divorced. There is an authority who wrote that even if none of these qualifications are present she is still not divorced until the get lands within her 4 cubits personal space. 
If her lent her his roof, and the get fell on a roof that he has in his possession, she is divorced, for since it is not customary to inhabit the roof in a fixed fashion, he does not care about the roof (and therefore the get is considered to be in her possession). There is an authority who wrote that even if it fell on someone else's roof and she can reach out and take it from there, she is divorced. 
If a man threw a writ to his wife in a public space, or is a place that was not their shared property, if it falls closer to him she is not divorced.  If it is precisely in between them, or anywhere that is not decisively closer to her, she is doubtfully divorced.  If it is close enough to her for her to bend down and pick it up, it is an invalid until it reaches her hand, and then she may remarry with it (even as a matter of first resort).  What is meant by 'closer to him'?  If he could protect it [from theft] and she could not, it is closer to him.  If both of them could guard it, or neither of them, it is considered in between.
If he came first and stood, and afterwards she stood opposite to him, and he threw (the divorce bill)to her, if the divorce bill was within four cubits of distance from him, she is not divorced, even though if it rolls she will take it. If she came first and stood, and he arrived and stood opposite her and he threw (the divorce bill)to her, even though he is halfway, since she is within her four cubits, this is an invalid divorce bill until the divorce bill gets to her hand. Rem"a: However, if he threw to her within her four cubits and the husband did not come within her four cubits, she is divorced. And all this is according to the law, but from the outset this is no divorce, and [the same applies regarding] even throwing the divorce bill in her courtyard or inside her clothing - rather, inside her hand literally, and her hand needs to be open from the beginning of the [process of] giving to the end (Mordechai Chapter Hazorek, and Smak, and Kol Bo) as we explained above on the siman 138. And even after the fact we should not permit her to the world unless the divorce bill gets literally to her hand. And there is still the practice that she closes her hand after the giving of the divorce bill, and puts it inside her clothes. And be careful that no man should aid her in the [act of] receiving the divorce bill, and that no thing should be in her hands, such a ring and the like, at the moment of the receiving (everything according to the divorce bill).
If her hand was katafres (explanation - she had her hand slanted [obviously ready to receive the divorce bill], and not  vertical like a partition not ready to receive), and he threw the divorce bill towards her hand and it fell on the ground: if it fell within four cubits and it stayed there, this is a divorcee. And if it did not stay within [the four cubits], and rather rolled immediately outside of [these boundaries], this is a doubtfully divorcee. If [the divorce bill] fell into the sea or into the fire, she is not a divorcee. And if it was close to the water or the fire - from the beginning of the fall it was in position to be destroyed. Rem"a: "And all this only applies if she is not in her own domain, but if she is in her domain, even though it fell from her hand and rolled outside of the four cubits, she is divorced, since it only rolled in her domain. However, to us, [whose practice is] that we don't divorce [a woman] through her domain, as we explained, if the divorce bill fell from her hand she needs to be divorced a second time. And thus, the woman raises her hands in the moment that she receives the divorce bill, so that it won't fall from her hand. Also, her hands need to be higher than 3 hand breadths from the ground."
If he put it in the hand of her [Canaanite - non-Jewish] slave (the laws of Canaanite slaves and land are comparable in many ways) and he is awake and she is guarding him, if he was bound, then she is divorced, for it is if it landed in her courtyard next to which she is standing. If he was not bound, she is not divorced. Some authorities say that two [qualifications] are needed: Binding - so that he will not be a mobile courtyard; and sleeping - so that he will be watched as per her volition (and not the slave's volition).
If he put the get in the hands of the slave and he is sleeping and she is guarding him, the get is invalid. If he was bound, she is divorced. 
If he wrote the get and put it in the hands of his slave, and wrote her a writ of gift-giving transferring ownership of the slave to her, since she has acquired the slave, she acquires the get and is divorced - if the slave was bound.  If he was not bound, and he was awake, she acquires the slave, but is not divorced until the writ of divorce actually arrives in her hands.  Similarly, if he put the get into his courtyard, and sold her the courtyard, or gave her the courtyard as a gift, since she has acquired the courtyard with a document of sale or with monetary acquisition, or by making an improvement in the courtyard (a form of acquisition protocol), she is divorced.  But if he put the get in another man's courtyard, and the other man subsequently gave her the courtyard, or she bought it from him, she is not divorced (because there was never any delivery of the get from husband to wife). 

Siman 140

A man may appoint an emissary to deliver his writ of divorce to his wife, and this is called a "messenger for delivery".   It is not a valid divorce until it reaches her hand.  Therefore he can back out until the writ reaches her hand.
All of the laws that apply to a husband with his wife, with respect to giving the writ of divorce and reading it and speaking about it, also apply to his emissary's conduct with her.  Rem"a:  The rabbi who organizes the transfer [of the writ] with two others with him (as explained futher on (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 142:4)) should review the writ first to ensure that it is written properly as explained later on in the process for writing the writ (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 91).
A woman appoints an emissary to receive [the get], and she is divorced when he receives [the get] immediately when the get reaches his hand. And the ruling for him is like the ruling for the woman in every way, for the matter of whether he threw the get to his courtyard or to within four amot of him. Hagah: And he writes in the get: Behold you are permitted etc., but when he gives the get he says to him: Receive this get for my wife (the Ran first chapter of Kiddushin).
If she said to the agent, "Accept for me my get," or "Take for me," or "It shall be for me in your hands," these are all [valid] language [to appoint an agent] for acceptance [of a get].

Rama: Some authorities also accept "Pick it up for me" (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashi and Magid Mishna) or "Take for me" (Ri; the first 'take for me' above was in Aramaic, the second was in Hebrew). 
She may also delegate an agent to bring it to her, as she may say, "Bring me my bill divorce," and his laws are the same as those of an agent of the husband, that it is not considered a bill of divorce until it reaches her hands.  Homessengerwever, the man is unable to accept it as her agent, for he may not be made an agent to perform her obligation without hmessengerer knowledge, even if she were the wife of one afflicted with boils, or there was strife between them and she requested a divorce.  There is one who says that in such a case, her divorce is subject to doubt.
Rem"a:  If her husband is an apostate, and it is known that she is seeking a divorce, there are those who say that the apostate may grant her a bill of divorce (T"H #237 and in his decisions #43).  There are those who are stringent even in this (Ra"n in a responsum).  So too if the levirate husband (see Beit Yosef) was an apostate, the husband can grant her a bill of divorce so that she will not fall before a levirate marriage (see Beit Yosef).  If his wife was an apostate, her bill of divorce may be acquired for her via another (see T"H #237 and in his decisions #44), as has been explained above, even though she went back on it afterward, she does not need another bill of divorce (T"H ibid.).  This is also the case for a woman who has become forbidden to her husband--the bill of divorce is transferred to her via another person.  There are those who are stringent in this (Mahari"k #141).
A woman who appointed an agent to receive the get, and the husband said to him: I don't want you to receive the get, rather this is her get and you should bring it to her, the husband has permission to do so, and he becomes an agent to bring her the get. 
But if he says to him: Receive this get for her, or here it is, or merit it for her, he has not uprooted the agency to receive the get.
But if he says to her: Take it to her, he has uprooted the agency to receive the get and the agent has become the husband's agent. 
And also if he says to her: Bring it and give it to her, he has uprooted the agency to receive the get.
And in both cases, she is not divorced until the get arrives in her hand.
And there are those who say that if he says "give it to her" she is doubtfully divorced (Ran, ch. hitkabel in the name of 'there are those who say').
If she didn't appoint him as an agent to receive the get, and the husband says: Receive it for her, when the get reaches her hand, she is divorced. For one knows that he can't appoint an agent to receive the get, and he meant--take it and bring it to her. 
If she appointed an agent to bring her get, and he came and said to the husband: Your wife appointed me as an agent to receive her get, and he (the husband) said: Take it like she said, even if the get arrives at her hand, she is not divorced.
But if the husband said to him: Bring it to her, or acquire it for her and didn't say: like she said--when she receives the get, she is divorced. 
If she made an agent to receive the get, and he came to the husband and said: Your wife made me an agent to bring the get, and he said: Bring it to her, like she said, once the get arrives at her hand, she is divorced.
And if the get is burned or lost before it arrives at her hand, she is doubtfully divorced. 
If she appointed an agent to receive the get, and he came to the husband and said: Your wife made me an agent to bring the get, and the husband said to him: Accept it, and he didn't say: like she said--once the get arrives at her hand, she is divorced.
Hagah: If she made him an agent to receive the get, and the agent said so to the husband, and the husband gave the agent a document to bring and then he gave him a document to accept, if he gave him the get when he gave him the document to bring, behold he has annulled the agency of his wife. And then when he went back and gave him to receive it, behold he has annulled the agency to bring it. And a husband cannot appoint an agent to receive the get and therefore there is no agency at at all. And she is not divorced through this agent. Rather he should go go back and he should give it to him for the sake of the agency that the woman created.
But if he gave him the get only when he gave him the document of agency for accepting, she is divorced immediately when he gives him the get, for since he didn't give him the get at the outset, the agency appointed by the woman has not been annulled. (Bet Yose in the name of the Ribash, siman 329). 
If her hand was katafres (explanation - she had her hand slanted [ obviously ready to receive the divorce bill], and not  vertical like a partition not ready to receive), and he threw the divorce bill towards her hand and it fell on the ground: if it fell within four cubits and it stayed there, this is a divorcee. And if it did not stay within [the four cubits], and rather rolled immediately outside of [these boundaries], this is a doubtfully divorcee. If [the divorce bill] fell into the sea or into the fire, she is not a divorcee. And if it was close to the water or the fire - from the beginning of the fall it was in position to be destroyed. "Rem"a:"

Siman 141

The woman is able to make [appoint] an agent to accept her Get from the hand of her husband's agent. What case are we talking about here[?], that she made another agent to accept it from him. But if she said to the agent of her husband, "This Get shall be entrusted to you", or she said to him, "Behold you are an agent who will accept it for me", and there are those who say even if she only said, "You will accept it." (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ramban and the Rashba), behold this is a doubtful divorce, until the Get will arrive to her hand, and when it arrives to her hand she will surely be divorced. Gloss: The wife said to her agent to accept the Get from the hand of her husband, he does not accept it from the hand of his [the husband's] agent. But if she said: "Accept the Get from my husband, it is possible to accept it from the hand of his agent (Responsa of the Rashba 1,250) And there are those who say that the wife is not able to make an agent to accept [the Get] from the hand of her husband's agent.
A betrothed (through erusin) maiden (between the ages of 12 and 12.5 years), even though she is divorced by receipt of the get into her own hand just as [she is divorced] by her father's receipt [of the get], her father may appoint an agent for receipt, but she may not appoint an agent unless she has no father, or she has been fully married (through nisuin).
A minor, even is she has no father or she has been fully married (through nisuin) cannot appoint an agent for receiving a get, but her father may appoint an agen if she was [only] betrothed (through erusin; but not if she was fully married through nisuin).
If one betrothed (by kiddushin) a minor by the hand of her father, and divorced her while she was still a minor... Rama: while still only betrothed and her father yet alive (Tur), Mechaber: ...her father receives her get, and she may not receive the get without his knowledge [and consent]. But some authorities say that she may indeed receive her get. 
If she (a minor) was fully married (by nisuin), her father may not receive her get. 
If her father betrothed her while she was a minor, and then he died, or she completed marriage with nisuin; if she recognizes the difference between her get and something else, i.e. when given a stone she throws it away, but when proferred a nut she will take it, and some say when she reaches the age of young girls... Rama: which is about 6 or 7 years old, depending on her mental acuity (Tur), Mechaber: ... she may be divorced by her own acceptance of the get.  If she cannot differentiate between a get and other items, yet received a get to her own hand, she is not divorced. But she may be divorced by her father's acceptance of a get, even if she cannot distinguish between a get and other items. There is an authority who argues and says that any girl who cannot distinguish between a get and other items may not be divorced even by the hand of ther father.  Rama: See infra in Seder haGet se'if 96 how to write a get for a minor who is being divorced via her father's acceptance of the get.
Everywhere that a Katana is able to accept a get, she has the laws of a courtyard or [the laws of one] being able to acquire  whatever is in her four amos of personal space, just as there is [the ability to acquire] to a Gedolah.
when she [the woman accepting the kesubah] has an agent [to accept it for her], she needs to establish him in front of two witnesses. Its necessary that [he the messenger] accepts the get on her behalf in front of two witnesses, even if they are testifying [only] on the agent's work their testimony is accepted on the acceptance of the Get, or [even] if one witness testifies on the agent's work and one witness testifies on [her] acceptance [of the get]. One joins with everyone that testifies about both the agent's work and her acceptance of the Get. REMA:  at the preferred Halachic standard [its best] not for the husband to give the get through an agent, until he will be certain in the first place that the agent accepts with witnesses.
whats unique to the requirements of two witnesses [who sign off] on a invoice? its only in a case where there is no proper messenger [between the two parties involved]; But if the messenger is proper, [the invoice] is can be supported with one witness. there are those that seem to disagree on this opinion.   THIS IS THE RULING FOR SENDING MESSENGERS 
In what circumstances do we say that we need the witnesses of the receiving? When the divorce bill was lost or torn. But if the divorce bill comes from the hand of the proxy of receiving, there is no need for the witnesses of the receiving. And see below in this siman on paragraph 13.
No agent that is sent requires witnesses [to determine his validity], if he and the sender is worthy . And if the sender [of the witness] is a heretic, it is doubtful [if the function could be preformed]. Some say that the agent that is sent could be counted with witnesses. REMA: whats the case that the agent is believed to say that he is included with the witnesses, and there is need to require testimony on this. Its customary its necessary for legal purposes and the witnesses on the legality to be made [also serve the function as] an agent. See later on in Seif 24:  
When was it said hat a man's agent doesn't need witnesses? When he hands her a divorce document with witnesses signatures. But if there are no witnesses signatures on it, an the agent goes and hands it to her in front of witnesses, this is a doubtful divorce.
There those that say, that a agent that is sent or a agent that is brought, it is not necessary make him [included in a group] with witnesses, and there are those who differ on this opinion. REMA: multiple subjects [which require explanation] are here, when it is explained in seif 11. There are those  that disagree with the law in another way, explaining that a agent that goes- if it is to give her [the woman] the get between him [the husband] and her , and its impossible to return and to give her [the get] before two [witnesses], she is divorced [from then husband] when she accepts from him [the agent] the get (Tur in the name of the Rambam) . There are those that say this is invalid (Tur in the name of the Goaniem).  Is it, if the get is fulfilled in the document, from under her hand [???], its not necessary to bring testimony that she accepted it before us, only that she said that she accepted it  before two [witnesses] who were fitting. And it is the ruling in regard to a agent's acceptance from the husband.
Neither an emissary appointed to receive a writ of divorce, nor an emissary appointed to deliver the writ need hear from their senders that they have been designated as an emissary.  Therefore, both the man and the woman may designate, in the presence of witnesses, an emissary who is in some other place, and the witnesses will then write and sign that such-and-such has been designated as an emissary.  Rem"a:  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 141:35)
If a husband designated an emissary to deliver the write, he must say to him, "Give this writ to my wife" or he must tell the scribe and the witnesses that they should write and sign the writ, and give it to his wife, or some other language that implies that he will divorce her, such as, 'divorce her' or 'send her away' or 'separate her' or 'divorce her [in Aramaic]' or 'write a letter and give it to her'.  If, however, he said, "dismiss her, support her, do with her what is in keeping with our religion, do with her what is lawful, do what is proper with her" he has said nothing.  If he said to them, "forsake her, take her out, permit her, leave her be, assist her" it is considered a doubt.
He who says, "write a <i>Get</i> for my wife", they shall write it and give it to the husband, but they should not give it to the wife until he [explicitly] says they should give it to her.  And if they gave it to her, it is not a valid <i>Get</i>.  In which case does this apply? A healthy person.  But for someone who is in danger, that is, someone who was suddenly sick and the sickness was immediately serious, and one who goes out with a [???], even for monetary matters, and one who sails out to sea or travels with a traveling market -- if he says "write a <i>Get</i> for my wife," they shall write it and give it to her, since it is known that he intended for it to be [both] written and given to her.
A healthy man who said: 'write a divorce bill for my wife'; and it was written and it was delivered to her, and then he committed suicide immediately - for example, he threw himself from the roof, or into the sea - this is a effective divorce bill. And if it wasn't written, we still write and deliver it to her all the time while his soul is still within him. If he went to the roof, and a strong wind pushed him and he fell and died - this is not a[n effective] get.
If there is a doubt whether he threw himself or a wind pushed him [off the roof] - if he fell immediately, it is a[n effective] divorce bill; and if he did not fall immediately, behold the doubt remains.
And it is the same regarding someone who was thrown into a pit and said: 'anyone who is able to listen to my voice, go write a divorce bill to my wife', and he makes explicit what are his name and his wife's name, the name of his town and the name of her town, those should write [and deliver] it to her. and even if he was brought up and did not acknowledge [the divorce bill], it is still effective, since it is like [what happens in] a moment of danger: we write and deliver, even if we do not acknowledge [later]. And there are those who say that these words only apply when they saw a figure of a man, or even a faint resemblance, so that one does not suspect it to be a deamon, since usually deamons are found in pits and fields.
If there were three, and he said: All who hear my voice shall write a divorce writ for my wife, one writes it and two sign it. There is no need for the attendance of all of them, because even though he said: "All," it is not the same as if he said: "All of you write."
If many people were standing together, and he said: Take a divorce writ to my wife, any of them who wants may take it on behalf of all of them. See below at the end of Se'if 23. If he said: Two of you shall take it, two of them need to take it. Even if there were a father and his son among them, his intent is also on the son, and the son may become an agent [even] in the presence of his father.
So too if one says to three people: Two of you shall write a divorce writ for my wife and sign it and give it to her, and there were among them a father and his son, whether the son signed it with the other or whether the father signed it with the other, it is a kosher divorce writ.
If he said to a group: All of you take it [to her], it is not a valid divorce writ unless all of them take it [to her]. Nowadays the sages decreed that whoever asks many people to take a divorce writ to his wife, should say: Any of you shall take a divorce writ to my wife.
That which is written in Tikkun Shtarot, "A writ that designates an agent when sending a Get from one place to another," is not needed, since it is written in it that the husband gives permission to make a number of agents, even without the agent getting sick or otherwise prevented. Rem"a: Therefore, if the writ that designates the agent is lost or disqualified, if it is an urgent moment, we give the Get without the writ (Mahari"k, Shoresh 26). The agent is trustworthy with regard to his agency and to say that he was designated as an agent in the presence of witnesses, just like he is trustworthy to say, "it was written and sealed in front of me." Look also later in 142:3. A priori, however, one should write the writ of agency carefully, and be cautious not to use acronyms (in tikkun Mahar"i of Mintz in the name of the Mahara"i). Also one should not change things that are written in the Get, such as if the name "Zanvil" is written with a bet, he should not write in the writ of agency with a vav (G"Z ibid.) etc. The language of the writ of agency can be found in Even Haezer 141:30. The other rules and the order of the agency, look later in the order of the Get. The witnesses to the writ of agency should not be related to each other, nor to the husband or the wive, nor to the witnesses of the Get (Seder Gittin 73). If the witnesses to the writ of agency are invalidated, the entire agency is cancelled because they are testifying to the essence of the agency and that in front of them the husband appointed the agent, which is different than the other possible invalidations of the writ of agency [itself] as it seems to me. The custom is that the Rabbi who is arranging the Get establishes the writ of agency also. Some have the practice that one should establish it with [a beit din of] three. In any case, even if only one of the signatures is recognizable (this is also acceptable). Some have the practice to write a writ (or in the handwriting) (of) [to] the place where it is being given to advise if there is a change in anything having to do with the writ of agency (there, in the name of the Mahara"r Za"kh).
If the husband or the proxy are young in age, it is good to inquire and examine if he brought proof of his agency [that he was made a proxy], since a minor cannot be a proxy nor appoint a proxy. And if he has a beard on his face, there is no problem. Rem"a: But one does not need to check too much the witnesses of the signing, since the witnesses of the delivery are [more important], and it is common to be much older regarding the giving of the divorce bill (Beit Yosef in the name of A"ch). And since we are used to setting aside the witnesses of the delivery, one should be punctilious that they are adults.
It is customary to perform the ceremony of acquiring to the one who appoints a proxy, to make public that he is set on this. And if he says: 'I said this with all intention, and I am completely set on doing this' - there is no need to perform the ceremony of acquiring.
On a document of accepting agency [to act on another's behalf] two witnesses who are fit [in regard to testimony] will sign off on the document. and its necessary that the people [who are signing off on the document] know that they are signing instead of giving [as apposed to getting married without a agent] and even if in the issuing [of the document], its necessary for those signing off [on the document] to know the laws  and that people are being used [agency] instead of giving [to the woman personally by the man who is getting married]. see in Tur  Even HaEzer 141 reception of a document through agency. 
Its necessary to be wary and particular, that the woman that made a agent  to accept the document [from the husband] is an adult with two and with signs. and if there is not (women's knowledge) [the women who know if she posses the signs] because it is with the word of the father, it requires a multiplicity of black hair [more then one at least two] and as large as the measure [of those hairs] on the cape [back of neck].
On the moment of giving the divorce bill through an agent for its receiving, a beit din of [three are implied] upstanding [men] should be gathered. [They] must not be related to each other, nor to the husband, nor to the wife, and there is the custom of forewarning that they should not be related to the agent. They are to recognize the signatures on the document of authorization, and afterwards the husband brings the divorce bill, and they read it and give it back to him [husband], and he must nullify all notices, and all disqualifications of the witnesses that would witness anything that would cancel the divorce bill, and he should give it on the hands of the agent and say: "Receive this divorce bill [in place] of Plonit, my wife, and behold she is divorced from me (from this very moment) and she is permitted to any [other] man. And there are those who say that he must not apply on it any conditions. And they [beit din] read the divorce bill again after the delivery [to the agent], and the judges should sign their witnessing (Tur: and their signatures must be recognizable and well known) and they will give it in the hand of the agent. Rem"a: And [regarding] the wording [of the divorce bill/of the document of authorization] that we give him, see the Tur in this siman. And all this is according to the law, however, there are those who say that the right thing is to be strict and not divorce through an agent, at all, and this is how we proceed. (Tur in the name of Harap)
The nusach (proper formula) for the document that designates the delivery agent, needs to be added to that which is written in The Tur Even Haezer: 
All are valid to be an agent for a bill of divorce, whether receiving or delivering, men as well as women, besides a deaf-mute, someone who is mentally disabled, a minor, a slave, and a non-Jew. Some say that if a slave is a delivering agent, it is doubtful [whether the bill of divorce is valid].
If the agent was a minor when he was charged with delivering the divorce document, and he came of age and brought it, or if he was deaf-mute and was cured, or if he was mentally disabled and he became sane, or if he was a slave and was freed, or if he was a non-Jew and converted, it [the divorce document] is invalid. However, if he gave it to him [the agent] when he was cured, and he became deaf-mute and was cured again, or if he was sane and had a mental break down and became sane again, it [the divorce document] is valid, because the beginning and the end were valid.
Women and relatives are valid agents for sending a bill of divorce. (Rem"a: Some write that if possible, at the outset the agent should not be related to the man [husband], the woman [wife], or to the judges before whom the bill of divorce is given (in the order of Gittin).) Even those who are rabbinically invalid, in sin [it is a sin to appoint such an agent], are valid agents for sending a bill of divorce. But those Biblically invalid, in sin, are invalid to bring a bill of divorce unless the bill of divorce is upheld by its signers. Some declare it invalid even if it is upheld by its signers. (Rem"a: The law of an apostate, is the same as that of a Biblically invalid witness. So is the sense of the commentary of Alfasi on Gittin.)
If they were invalid [because of sin] when they were appointed agents, and they repented before they delivered [the bill of divorce] to the wife, they are valid.
One who sends a bill of divorce through a non-Jew so that s/he will give it to John/Jane Doe, and the husband appoints John/Jane Doe in writing as an agent to deliver the bill of divorce to his wife, it [the divorce] is valid, because the non-Jew is only performing an insignificant act. Some disagree, and argue that an agent cannot be appointed by writing. I have also not seen this practiced.
One who gives a bill of divorce to an agent and tells him, "Send this bill of divorce to my wife," and the agent says to him [the husband], "I don't know her," and the husband says to him [the agent], "Give it to John/Jane Doe that knows her and s/he will give it to her," the first [agent] is not an agent to give divorce, but to send the bill of divorce to John/Jane Doe. (Rem"a: He can therefore not send it [the bill of divorce] through a [different] agent--Tur). John/Jane Doe is therefore an agent of divorce and gives it [the bill of divorce] to her [the wife], or sends it with another [agent] if he becomes sick or is [otherwise] prevented. If he gives her the bill of divorce, that is, the first [agent] or his agent, there is a doubt of divorce. (Rem"a: If one sends a bill of divorce to his wife and the agent does not know her, he [the agent] should give it to her according to the testimony of two [witnesses] that this is his wife--Tur).
One who gives a bill of divorce to an agent and says to him/her, "Do not give this to her [my wife] until thirty days," if s/he [the agent] sickened or was prevented [from delivering the bill of divorce] during the thirty days, s/he can appoint an agent to give it [the bill of divorce] to her [the wife] after thirty days. This is true even though s/he is not an agent for divorce at that moment, since s/he will become an agent of divorce after thirty days, provided that the husband says to him/her, "She has promised me that I will not be reconciled, if she is married." Some say that s/he [the agent] should not transfer it to a second agent, but rather should transfer his agency to a court, and they do not appoint a second agent until after 30 days.
If one who sends a bill of divorce to his wife, and says to him/her [the agent], "Deliver this bill of divorce to my wife," or if he says to him/her, "You deliver it, do not send it through another [agent]," but even so, s/he [the agent] sickens or is prevented, or if s/he is given instructions to appoint [additional] agents, s/he appoints agents until many agents. (Rem"a: If it is explained to him/her not to send it through another [agent], s/he cannot appoint an agent, even if s/he sickens or is prevented--this is the sense of the Tur.) Some disagree and say that one who is delivering may send through another [agent], even is s/he does not sicken. For "You go," [the agent is instructed to deliver the bill of divorce personally] s/he cannot send it through another [agent], even if s/he sickens or if it is explained to him/her that s/he is permitted to appoint an agent.
The laws of a second agent are like the laws of a first agent, in that he cannot appoint a [subsequent] agent unless he is coerced or given specific instruction.
When an agent appoints another agent, if s/he must say, "In my presence it [the bill of divorce] was written and it was signed," the appointment must be in the presence of a court. If s/he does not need to say, "In my presence it [the bill of divorce] was written and it was signed," the appointment does not have to be in the presence of a court, but the appointment must be in the presence of witnesses. (Rem"a: See above Shulchan Arukh Even HaEzer 142:9.)
If an agent has made a second [agent], and a second [who has made] a third, the death of the husband cancels [the agency of] all of them. But if the husband remains alive, even if the first agent dies, the agencies of the rest are not cancelled, because the husband is still alive.
If the second agent dies, the first agent may take [the responsibility of agency] from the heirs of the second [agent] and go personally or delegate the task to another.
A proxy for receiving does not have the power to appoint a proxy, even if he was under duress, and even if she gave her permission to appoint another proxy, because [all] he has [are] words, and words are not [able to be] passed onwards. And there are those who permit [this] if she gave him the [express] permission to appoint a proxy. 'And then he can appoint another one without a beit din, just [doing so] in front of two [witnesses]'. (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashbatz)
If she [the woman desiring a divorce] designated a receiving agent, and she then designated another, even ten one after the other or at one time, she becomes divorced if the bill of divorce is delivered to one of them.  This applies even if one of them is given an invalid bill of divorce and another is given a valid one.
An agent who, in his agency, deviated from what [his sender] told him, has done nothing.  What is this case?  [The sender] said to [the agent]: "Put this [item] in such a place," and he put it in another; or "put this item on the upper floor of the house" and he put it on the lower floor, or the reverse; or "don't give it except with the right [hand]" and he gave it with the left hand, or the reverse.  In all these cases the agent has done nothing.
Some say that if he [the husband] says [to the agent], "only divorce her with your right hand," it [the bill of divorce] cannot be sent through an additional [agent], even if [the first agent] sickens, because it is as though he [the husband] explained, "another shall not divorce her, only you."
If [the sender] said to [the agent]: give this bill of divorce to my wife, who is in this place, and [the agent] gave it to her in a different place, the divorce is valid, as this condition is a speculation of place rather than a specific care of the sender.
If [the sender] said to [the agent]: give [the bill of divorce] to her on such-and-such a future day, and he gave it to her in the intervening time, the divorce is not valid.  [If the sender said:] only give it to her on such-and-such a day, and he gave it before or after, the divorce is not valid.
A woman who says to her agent: "receive my bill of divorce for me in this place" and he receives it elsewhere, the divorce is not valid.  However, if she says "bring me my bill of divorce at this place" and he brings it to her elsewhere, the divorce is valid.
If she [the wife] says to [her agent], "accept my bill of divorce for me in Babylon, and sometimes he [the husband or his agent] is found in Damascus," in any place it is accepted [by the agent] it is a [valid] bill of divorce, as long as when it reaches Babylon it reaches the place she specified.
[If] the husband says to the messenger: Take from her this item and give her this <i> Get </i>, he [the messenger] cannot send it in another's hand. And if he sent it in another's hand, and the wife gave the [other] messenger the item first and afterwards he gave the <i> Get </i>, she is divorced. But if he gave the <i> Get </i> first and afterwards she gave the item, even in the hands of the first messenger it is not a <i> Get </i>. [If the husband] said to him: Give her the <i> Get </i> and take from her this item, he [the messenger] cannot send it in another's hand. And if he sent it in another's hand, it is a <i> Get </i> whether she gave [the item] first or she only gave it afterwards. And there are those who say that when [the husband] says to him: Take from her this item and give her the <i> Get </i>, if he sent it in another's hand, even if she gave him the item first and afterwards he gave her the <i> Get </i>, because she did not give the item to the first messenger before she received the <i> Get </i> from the second messenger, she is not divorced. What should he do [to rectify the situation]? The first [messenger] should take [the <i> Get </i>] from her hand and return it under the law of divorce, after he has received the item.
When the husband imposes a condition on the agent, such as, "Only divorce her in the house" or "in the attic" and anything similar, if the husband does not give the agent permission to appoint a [different] agent, it [the bill of divorce] should not be sent through another at the outset, because the second might not be specific in agency and the bill of divorce would be invalidated. (Rem"a: In any case, if a second agent was appointed and he was not told of the condition or he replaced it, if the condition was fulfilled the bill of divorce is valid (Riva"sh 316). If the condition was that she renounce all prerogatives she had over him, even though it must be discussed what is included in "all prerogatives", in any case there is reason to be strict about a bill of divorce in which she forgives all prerogatives over him, and then discuss with him what that entails, and so everything similar (Riva"sh 217).)
A messenger bringing a <i> Get </i> from a place that does not need to say "In front of me it was written and in front of me it was signed", he gives [the <i> Get </i>] to [the wife] and she is divorced through it, and she can [re]marry even if [<i> Beis Din </i>] does not recognize the signatures of the witnesses, and she can collect her <i> Ketubah </i> from (???). And if one witness comes to appeal and says [the <i> Get </i>] is forged, we don't listen to him. If two come and appeal, even if she is already [re]married, she must get divorced. And if the husband comes and appeals, saying: I never divorced her and the <i> Get </i> that was brought to her is forged! [<i> Beis Din </i>] confirms [the <i> Get </i>'s] signatures; and if they are not confirmed and nothing is known of the witnesses, she must get divorced and any child [of the second marriage] is a <i> Mamzer </i>, because she was [never] divorced. If the <i> Get </i> was lost, she is doubtfully divorced. 
Her mother-in-law or her sister-in-law or her co-wife, even if [now] she was married to someone else, or her <i> Yevama </i> (I believe this refers to her potential co-wife through <i> Yibum </i>) even if she is her sister (and therefore no <i> Yibum </i> can occur) or the daughter of her husband [from another marriage] are not believed to bring her <i> Get </i> in a place where they don't say "Before me it was written and before me it was signed", because maybe it is forged and they want to ruin her. And if she (one of the previous women, not sure why it says 'he'...) was in a place where they need to say "Before me it was written and before me it was signed", and they said it, they are believed. And if she is in a place that they do not need to say it and they say it, there are those that say that they are believed and there are those that say that they are not believed.
[If] she appointed a messenger to accept [the <i> Get </i>], and the <i> Get </i> is sent through him and the husband [later] says: It is forged! If the signatures or the sending messengers are confirmed, she is divorced. And if he admits to writing it, but he says that he did not give it to her under the law of divorce but rather for safekeeping, and [her] messenger says he received it for her to be divorced through it, the messenger is believed, even if all three were in the same city. And there are those that say, if the three are in the same city, the husband is believed, because if he wanted it to be under the law of divorce, he would have given it to her. And this [last law] is only when he claims it given for safekeeping, but if he claims it was that he used a messenger to bring it, but wanted to take it back before it reached her, he is not believed. And if they're not in the same city, the messenger is believed and this is when witnesses who were appointed by the receiving messenger come to us [<i> Beis Din </i>] and the messenger said that he sent it in front of witnesses. Rem"a: There are those that say this is only when the <i> Get </i> is sent through him [the wife's messenger], but if the <i> Get </i> is not in his hand, he is not believed, even if he has witnesses that saw it in his hand (Tur accord. to Rosh). Mechaber: And according to this logic, it is good to beware divorcing through a messenger when the husband and the wife are in the same city because there is a possibility of destruction (translation is unclear...) because if he claims that he did not give it for divorce, he is believed. Rem"a: And there is no distinction between a messenger for bringing and a messenger for receiving (Rif). However, once there is [written] permission in his hand to be a messenger of divorce, there is no distinction whether the husband is in the city or not (Maharam Padva Siman 3). And if the wife says: In front of me the messenger accepted it for divorce, she is believed. And there are those that say this is only when the <i> Get </i> is [now] in the hand of the wife.
If the divorce document came from the woman's hand and she says, "This messenger gave it to me for the divorce process", and the messenger says, "Yes, I have given it to her for the divorce process," and the husband says, "It was only given to her as a deposit," the messenger is trustworthy and she is divorced. And if the divorce document was lost and there are no witnesses who saw the document in her hand, even though the husband says, "The messenger gave it for the divorce process," and the messenger says, "it was given to her," this is a divorce in doubt, since she held up as a married woman, and here there is only one witness and a husband. And even if the woman says, "In my midst it was given to him for the divorce process and the messenger gave it to me," since the husband and the messenger are assisting her it is possible that they will scorn her and perhaps she will not be divorced.       
A messenger of receiving that receives a <i> Get </i> for a woman, and sends it to her in front of two witnesses, and it reaches her and she takes it, and therefore the <i> Get </i> has passed into her hand, but she doesn't know if her husband sent it to her or her receiving messenger received it, or [if it was from] the messenger of the husband, she is [nevertheless] divorced. And if the husband comes a protests that he didn't write it, or that it was an annulled <i> Get </i>, we confirm it through its signatures, because there are witnesses that the <i> Get </i> that was given to her came from her messenger because his hand is like her hand (i.e. he can accept it for her), and even though she didn't know, the witnesses knew. And if it is not confirmed, she is not divorced. And there are those that say that if the three of them are in the same city, we are worried that maybe the husband will say: I gave it to her [only] for safekeeping. And even if they are not in the same city, there are those that say that a messenger is only believed when the <i> Get </i> is in his hand (so it seems from the Tur in the name of the Rosh) because he is like a Shlish (???) which is explained in Choshen Mishpat Siman 56.
Since the divorce document which is sent to his wife is not a legal divorce document until it reaches her hand, he is liable in her nourishment and in all the stipulations of her marriage license until it reaches her hand or it is accepted by the hand of the messenger. And if he dies before it arrives, there is no divorce after death. 
One who sends a <i> Get </i> to his wife and annuls it before it gets to her, it is annuled. But if it reached her, he is not able to annul it, even [if it had reached her] within the time of speaking [a greeting to someone]. Rem"a: There are those that say that a <i> Mumar </i> [someone who denies a specific Mitzvah] is not able appoint a messenger to bring a <i> Get </i> to his wife, because we are concerned that he will annul it (Mahariv Siman 126). And even if he accepts upon himself a <i> Cherem </i> or a vow that he will not annul it, it does not help, because we are concerned that maybe he will violate his oath. And there are those that say that a <i> Mumar </i> can make an initial messenger as a messenger a reception [of the <i> Get </i>] and say to the messenger: Accept this <i> Get </i> for my wife so-and-so and with it she will be divorced etc. And then he gives it to the messenger and afterwards he takes it back from the messenger and makes him into a messenger of bringing [the <i> Get </i>] and says: Bring this <i> Get </i> to my wife etc. (??? Siman 237 and his ruling in Siman 42), and this is our practice. But he should not make a messenger initially as a messenger of bringing and then afterwards [make] a messenger of reception. And this has all already been explained above in Siman 140 Se'if 11.
Ideally, he [the husband] may not nullify it [the bill of divorce] except in the presence of the agent or in her [the wife's] presence. However, he may still nullify it when he is not in their presence, as long as he is before two [witnesses]. (Rem"a: The husband is not to be trusted that he nullified it, unless the wife or agent back him up, or he has witnesses (Be'er Yosef and in the commentary of Asher"i in the chapter of the sender). Some say that he must nullify an agent before the two [witnesses] together, but not separately. However, if he is nullifying the bill of divorce, even after it is written he may nullify it [before the two witnesses] even separately (Riva"sh 232).)
If it was sent through two or ten agents, there is no issue with nullifying [the agents] separately. Those who are nullified have their agency nullified, and cannot fulfill it even if they are appointed another time. With ten who are appointed agents, whether to write and give the bill of divorce or to deliver it, if some are nullified, the rest are not. Some say, that with agency, if one is nullified the rest are.
In what circumstances is a get nullified? Only when he nullified it explicitly. But if he did not nullify it explicitly, even if he demonstrated that he wanted it to be nullified, such as if the messenger told him "I have not yet given it to her" and he replied "Blessed is the Good One who does good!" or something similar, it is not nullified. And in addition, even if he had attempted to run after the messenger in order to nullify it, but he did not reach him until the get was in her hand, it cannot be nullified.
Rem"a: Similarly, if he said to the messenger, "bring me back this get and I will give you a different one," that is only demonstrated desire and does not nullify the get. If he sent a letter after the messenger telling him not to deliver the get, that constitutes nullification because a get can be nullified in writing. If he sent a get to his wife and told the messenger: "if my wife wants to come to me, I will honor the marriage, but if not, release her with the get" and then left the city, the messenger may deliver the get, because the wife did not come to her husband because he had left the city. And even if the husband was in the city, if he could not make up with her, the messenger may deliver the get, because what he said originally, "if she comes to me, I will honor it" is nothing but idle words, and is only demonstration of desire, which is nothing. 
With which phrases may a get be nullified? He could say "It is nullified!" "It is nothing," "This get will be ineffective," will not release her," "will not leave," "will not send her away," "will not divorce," "will be as a shard of pottery," or "Behold! It is as a shard of pottery." If he said any of those phrases or other similar ones, it is nullified. But if he said "this get is not a get," or "is not effective," "does not release," "does not send away," "does not divorce," "is as a shard of pottery," it is as if he said nothing. If he said "this get is nullified" but did not say "it" or said "this get has been nullified, in the past tense as in "had turned and gone" (Song of Songs 5:6), this is ambiguous. 
There is one [opinion] who says, if [the husband] says: it [the <i> Get </i>] should be invalidated, it is annulled. [If] he said: Don't go forever, it is annulled and it is as if he said: today you are not my wife, but tomorrow [he says]: you are my wife. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Teshuvat HaRan Siman 43)
If he did not reveal his intent that he wanted to annul [the <i> Get </i>], and he says one of the phrases which is not effective in annulling the <i> Get </i>, nevertheless [if] he protests in order to invalidate it, [<i> Beis Din </i>] needs to confirm its signatures.
One who sends a <i> Get </i> in the possession of a messenger, he can go back [on sending the messenger, and still] divorce her with it when he wants, because he did not annul the law of the <i> Get </i>, but rather the law of the messenger. Therefore, if the <i> Get </i> was in the hand of the husband and he annulled it, for example he said: This <i> Get </i> is annulled, he cannot ever divorce with it. And so too, even he specified at the time of his annulment, and it was in the possession of the messenger [at the time], and he said: The <i> Get </i> that I sent, behold, it is annulled from being a <i> Get </i>! He cannot divorce with it, and if he did [try to] divorce, she is doubtfully divorced.
One who sent a <i> Get </i> to his wife, and went back on it and annulled it in front of two other [people], and so too one who sent information about the <i> Get </i> [to his wife], we flog him with <i> Makkat Mardut </i> (lit. rebellious lashes) because he caused there to be <i> Mamzerim </i>.
A messenger who brought a <i> Get </i>, we do not worry that maybe the husband annulled it or maybe he sent a message, and it is given to the woman on the assumption that he is alive, even if he was left old or sick. And there are those who say specifically a sick man is in the hands of heaven [and we assume he's alive], but an injured person who is mortally wounded, he is considered on death row (HaGaot Alfasi). But if he was left on death row, [the messenger] should not give it to her, because the majority of people on death row die. But if he gave it to her, she is doubtfully divorced. And there is [an opinion] who says, that which we said about an old person [that we assume he is still alive] is specifically when he is less than eighty and greater than one hundred (not sure why...) but if he is between eighty (Tur in the name of Rem"a) and one hundred, he is considered one on death row.
A city which was surrounded by soldiers from his own kingdom and they were sieged, or a ship which is being tossed at sea, and one who goes to court for case of capital punishment, they are assumed to be alive [after the fact] and if a <i> Get </i> from one of them was in the possession of a messenger, he can give it to his wife and she is assumed divorced. But a city which was captured before, or a city surrounded by soldiers of another kingdom, or a ship that is lost at sea, or one sent to death from a case of capital punishment in the courthouses of <i> Kutim </i> (presumably referring to non-Jews), or one hauled by a wild animal, or washed away by a river or one who a pillar fell upon, we place upon them the stringencies of the living and of the dead, and if a <i> Get </i> from one of them was in the possession of a messenger, he should not give it to his wife, and if he did give it to her, she is doubtfully divorced. But if it is known that the husband died before the <i> Get </i> reached her, it is not a [valid] <i> Get </i>.

Siman 142

An agent who brings the get from place to place outside the land of Israel or from the land of Israel to outside the land or from outside the land to the land of Israel if the agent was there when the get was written and signed, behold he must say: It was written and signed in front of me. And then he gives it to her in front of them and she will be divorced with it. And even if the witnesses are not known to them. And even if the witnesses have non-Jewish names we are not concerned. And if the husband comes and protests, we don't listen to him. Therefore, even women who are not trusted to say: My husband died are trusted to bring the get and say: It was written and signed in front of me. And similarly an agent who brings a get in the land of Israel and said: It was written and signed in front of me, even though he doesn't need to do so, if the husband comes and protests, we don't listen to him. And if the agent wasn't there at the time of the writing and signing, it shouldn't be given to her unless its signatures can be confirmed. And the agent can be one of the three to confirm it. But if it has not been upheld and he gave it to her, it is invalid until it is upheld. And if the husband comes and protests and it is not upheld, she is not divorced.  If the get is lost, she is doubtfully divorced. And why did they make him say: It was written and signed in front of me, outside the land of Israel, so that the woman wouldn't have to uphold the get if the husband comes and protests, for witnesses are not easily found to uphold it from place to place outside the land.  And it seems to me that now even in the land of Israel he must say: It was written and signed in front of me. Hagah: And in these time one who brings a get even from one house to another house in the same city, he must say: It was written in front of me and signed in front of me (Tosafot, the beginning of Gittin).  And see above siman 141, seif 55, that he should not give it when the husband is in the city.  And there are those who say that if the agent has authority and wrote in it who are the get's witnesses, that this is considered the upholding of the signatures, and if so the agent need not say: It was written and signed in front of me (Rashba siman 561, and Mordecai, beginning of ch. hitkabel).  And there are those who disagree and say that authority is not considered upholding (Ribash siman 318 and in the sedarim).  And thus we are accustomed to doing, that the agent says: It was written and signed in front of me, even if he has authority and we should not change this custom.
A husband who brings clear proof with two witnesses that this get about which it was said: It was written and signed in front of me, is actually forged, the get is annulled. 
Just as it is unnecessary to uphold the get when he says: It was written and signed in front of me, so too it is unnecessary to uphold the witness to the agency. Rather he is trusted to say that the husband appointed him to be an agent in front of witnesses, even if they don't recognize the signature of the witnesses to the agency. And even if there is no testimony as to the agency whatsoever but he just said that the husband appointed him an agent in an appropriate manner, he is trusted. And see above siman 141 seif 11, and seif 24 concerning the appropriate manner of acting ab initio.
When do we say [that an agent is believed]? When the husband gave [the get] to her in front of two [witnesses] when the agent is neither a relative or invalid [witness]. If [the agent] is a relative or invalid witness, he [the agent] needs to hand her [the get] in front of three [men] excluding himself. Rema"h: And some say to be stringent, that even if the agent isn't a relative or invalid [witness], he should give it to her in front of three [witnesses] so as not to [mistakenly] give her [the get] even when he is a relative or invalid [witness], and that is our practice. There are those that are even more stringent, to take to additional [men] as witnesses of the handing over [of the get], and [the witnesses] can not be related either to the judges or to the man or the woman. Additionally, the three [judges] that sit can not be related to the witnesses of the get or to the agent. And see earlier 141:33. There are those that are stringent and say that the rabbi that earns a reward from organizing the giving of the get can not be one of the three that sit as judges. Rather, three others should sit [as judges] and the rabbi asks all the questions and organizes the handing over.
Those, who he gives it to her in front of them, do not need to sit. And when the messenger says, "Before me it was written and before me it was signed," he needs to stand. And some say that ideally they need to sit, those who he says in front of them, "before me it was written and before me it was signed." Rema: And ideally he gives it to her at daytime and not night (Binyamin Ze'ev Siman 122).
[The agent] proclaims: "Before me it was written and before me it was signed," at the time that he hands it (the get) over to the woman or immediately thereafter within the amount of time it takes to say a short phrase ("tokh k'dei dibur").  Therefore, if he handed over the get but did not suffice to say "Before me it was written and before me it was signed," before becoming silenced (unable to speak, e.g. by a stroke), the get is invalid until it is validated by the signed witnesses. 
If [the agent] delayed saying it ("before me it was written...") for more than tokh k'dei dibur (the amount of time it takes to say a short phrase), or he did not say it at all... Rama: in front of the woman (Tur) Mechaber: ... or he handed it over in private between him and her, even if she had already married (another), he takes the get from her, and hands it over to her in front of two witnesses, and says in front of them "before me it was written and before me it was signed." If he (the agent) did not take the get back from her [and redeliver it in the proper manner], the get is invalid until the signatures of the witnesses are validated.  Rama: Therefore, a mute person is unable to bring a get, even though he is capable of writing "before me it was written and before me it was signed," for he is required to speak the phrase by mouth (Rivash chapter 240). Some authorities say that he must say the phrase in Hebrew, to wit: "befanai nichtav uv'fanai nechtam," (so apparent in Rosh first chapter of Seder Gitin).  If he is an ignoramus, he repeats (the phrase) word for word after a reader, and they inform him the interpretation in the vernacular (this also in the sedarim). Nevertheless, if he said the phrase in the vernacular, it appears to me that the get is valid ex post facto.  
If the agent did not say "before me it was written and before me it was signed," and the husband died, there is no possible fix of taking the get back from her and re-delivering it accompanied by the statement of "before me it was written and before me it was signed," and there is no solution other than to validate the signatures of the witnesses on the get. 
If one agent designates another agent, he should designate him before a court. {This should consist of three judges, but there can be an alternative:} i.e., two people {serving as judges}, and he joins them {to be the third}—if he is qualified to be a judge. And {the first agent} says, “{The get} was written in my presence, and it was signed in my presence,” at the time that he gives it to the {second} agent. And that {second agent may give the get} to another {agent}—up to a hundred. And each {designating agent} says before the court (at the time of the transfer of {the get} or within a time span in which one can speak {a brief formula} &lt;unclear&gt; [Seder Gittin]), “I am an agent of the court.” And so should the last {agent} say when he places {the get} in the woman’s hand. (Rema: And {he need} not necessarily {use} this phraseology. But the same applies if he says, “I was made the agent before the court.” That {too} suffices [Matnot Kehunah , Tikun Yashan]. But even if he says nothing, as long as he has a harsha’ah {a document testifying to his credentials} and the alternative is {the woman becoming} an agunah {a grass widow}, one should be lenient [Rivash 318]. And so should each {agent} say to his compatriot: “I, So-and-so son of So-and-so, appoint you, So-and-so son of So-and-So, to be an agent in my place, in my stead, and your hand should be as my hand, etc., to divorce Woman-so-and-so daughter of So-and-so, the wife of So-and-so son of So-and-so, wherever you may find her. And I give you permission to appoint an agent, and that agent an agent, etc. And as soon as the get comes into the hand of Woman-So-and-so daughter of So-and-so, she will be divorced, etc.” [all in Seder Gittin], as is explained below in Seder HaGet, 30. And the {latter} court agent does not need a harsha’ah as does the first agent. But the custom is for him to have such a document, as does the first agent [Rivash 53]. And see above 141:24. And {in addition} even if only two people signed the authorizing document {instead of three}, and {even if} they wrote as witnesses and not as judges, {even then} the second agent is believed if he says that there were three or that he was with them {to make three}. And in this case, the principle that a witness is not made a judge is not germane (Rivash 318). And we are not concerned about the court [judges] being in error unless we know that those who produced the get are not expert. In such a case, even if {the get} is written properly, we are concerned about {the judges} [ibid.].)
When {one agent} comes to appoint another agent, {the new agent} does not need to be in his presence. Instead, {the first agent} declares in court: “So-and-so is my agent”—even if {the latter} is not in his presence. And similarly, {the agent} can transfer agency to the court to appoint other agents. And {the judges} can appoint an agent not in the presence of the previous agent. (Rema: And some say that it is not effective for {the new agent} to say, “I am an agent of the court,” because he did not hear the {first} agent say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” Rather, he must have a harsha’ah or else the signatures on the get must be validated [Rivash 53].)
A person blind in both eyes cannot bring a get {that comes from} outside the country, because he cannot say: “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” Therefore, if it was written and signed before him when he had sight, and then he became blind, he says (before {a court of} three people): “It was written before me and it was signed before me,” and he gives it to her. And that is the case if he recognizes the woman’s voice. But if he does not recognize her voice, it does not help for others to tell him that she is the woman, although that would help with someone who is sighted. (Rema: And in regard to a sighted person, we need two kosher witnesses {to testify to her identity} who are not {her} relatives and not disqualified [Terumat Hadeshen  248].)
If there are witnesses that the husband handed over the get to a blind man for purposes of divorce, it is kosher; for since there are witnesses, the blind man does not need to state "before me it was written and before me it was signed," and he gives her the get in the presence of those two witnesses themselves. If the signatures of the witnesses to the divorce document were validated, it is kosher in all circumstances.  
If a man gave a get to his wife, and it was written and signed in her presence, and he told her, “You are an agent to bring it to Court So-and-so, and they will appoint an agent and give you this get and {then} you will be divorced with it,” she is believed when she tells {the judges of that court}, “It was written before me and signed before me.” (And she must say this at the time that the get leaves her hand [Tur and the Rosh].) And {the judges} take it and give it to an agent to give to her in keeping with the statement of {her} husband. And if the husband did not did not impose this condition upon her, and she gives the get {to the court}, she need not say anything, and she is assumed to be divorced, and {that is the case} even though the signatures of the witnesses have not been validated; {that is} because witnesses that sign the get are considered like people whose testimony was validated by the court, as long as there is no challenger. And even if {the husband} told her, “Only get divorced with it before Court So-and-so,” that is a mere condition&lt;unclear?&gt;; and when she comes to that court and the get is in her possession, she is divorced {retroactively} with her initial receiving {of it}. And she does not need to say, “It was written before me and signed before me.”
And some disagree and say that she should not be allowed to marry with a get that she has produced unless its signatures have been validated, even if there are no challengers to it, for no one has ever heard of anyone who employed such a leniency. (Rema: A husband who brings a get to his wife, and he himself transported it from where it was written to the place that {he} gives {it} must transfer it to her as an agent, and he must say: “It was written before me and it was signed before me” like the agent, so as not to come to err with another agent&lt;unclear&gt;, since at present people are unlearned [Beit Yosef in the name of A.Ch.).)
If part of the get was written in the presence of {the agent}, and all of it was signed in his presence, if that {part that was written in his presence} is its first part, he says, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” Even if only one line was written before him, and, {moreover,} even if he {only} heard the sound of the quill writing, and {then} the witnesses signed in his presence, he says, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” And also, if the scribe {interrupted his writing and} went outside, and he returned and finished the get, {the agent} should not be concerned lest another person met {the scribe} and spoke with him and {the scribe} wrote {the get} in the name of another woman. And if {the agent} wishes to be strict and insist that all of it should have been written {in his presence}, we do not listen to him, so as not to cast into doubt {the legitimacy of} previous gittin. And all of this is in regard to its writing. But in regard to its being signed, {the agent} must be present with the {signatories} from beginning to end.
If {the agent} said, “It was written before me,” but he did not say, “And it was signed before me,” or if he said, “It was signed before me,” but he did not say, “And it was written before me,” or if he said, “Its second half was written before me and all of it was signed {before me},” or if he said, “All of it was written before me, and one witness signed {before me}, but not the second witness,” that counts for nothing. Even if {the agent} is one of the {signed} witnesses of the get, and he said, “One witness signed before me, and this is my signature,” {but he did not see the second witness sign}, its signatures must be validated. And if he and another person testified regarding the signature of the second witness who did not sign before him, that is fine. And there is no need to say that if two others testified regarding the signature of that witness who did not sign before him {that that is fine as well}.
If there were  three witnesses signed on the divorce, and two of them signed in the presence of the delivering agent, even though the third witness signed not in the presence of the agent, it is of no concern.
If the husband appointed two agents to transport the get to his wife, even though it was not written and signed in their presence, they give it to her and she is divorced. And that is the case if they are fit to give testimony, for the husband cannot challenge this get even though it is not validated, for his agents are his witnesses. (And some say that if the husband came and challenged {the get}, its signatures must be validated [Tur, and so too Maharan as understood by the Beit Yosef].) And some say that even if {the husband} only appointed one {person as an} agent, and a second {person} testifies that in his presence the husband gave this one {person} the get to transport to his wife, {the agent} does not need to say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” And there is an authority who does require that in such a case he  should transmit it before people who witness the transfer.
If two people bring a get, and one says, “It was written before me,” and the other one says, “And it was signed before me,” if one of them is the {sole} agent, it is not given to her until its signatures are validated. And similarly, if two people say, “It was written before us,” and a third person says, “It was signed before me,” if there is only one agent, it is not given to her until its signatures are validated. If one says, “It was written before me,” and two say, “It was signed before us,” even though it does not leave their hands, it is kosher, for its signatures are validated. (Rema: Some say that if the agent brought a get with its signatures validated, even though {the judges} do not recognize the signatures of the judges giving the confirmation, at any rate, in a pressing situation and possibility {of a woman being an} agunah, one should be lenient and rely upon it, although the agent did not say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me,” because it is impossible to return and say, one should rely upon the signatures, because according to the Torah the signed witnesses to a contract are considered as though their testimony has been investigated {and accepted} by the court (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashbatz).)

Siman 143

If a divorce was conditional, then if the condition was fulfilled, she is divorced, and if the condition is not fulfilled, she is not divorced.  [If the condition was not fulfilled] she remains permitted to her husband even if he is a priest (who is forbidden to marry a divorcee). The rules of conditions are discussed in chapter 38.
One who divorces his wife with a condition when she fulfills the condition, she will be divorced at the time the condition is fulfilled, and not at the time the <i>get</i> is given to her hand. Therefore, the husband can nullify the <i>get</i> or add an additional condition or he can make another condition the entire time that the original condition was not met, even though it arrived at her hand. And if her husband dies or the <i>get</i> is lost or burnt before the new condition is fulfilled, she is not divorced. And if she married, she needs to exit [the new marriage]. And if he says to her, you are divorced from now or from today on the condition of x and y, or you are divorced on the condition of x' and y' (see later 144: 4 and there are those who say that "on the condition" is not similar from "now"). When the condition is fulfilled, they were divorced from the time <i>get</i> was given to her hand.  If it was lost or burnt (even if the husband died) but before he fulfilled the condition, then this fulfills the condition after his death, so they were already divorced from the time he gave her the <i>get</i> to her hand. Initially, she should not marry before the condition is met, but if she marries, he should separate from her, until the condition is met. However, with a condition that she can control and passively fulfill, we do not suspect that she will violate it. Therefore, she is allowed to marry immediately, on the condition or "from now". There are those who say even if he did not say "from now," and not "from today," and not "on condition," the law is as one who said "from today," because the time [written in] the <i>get</i> proves [his intention]. (There are those who say that even in the condition "from now", he is able to nullify, but there are those who are strict.) (Itor and that is what is implied in the Ros"h). 
He said to her "[I give you a <i>get</i>] on condition that you give to me two-hundred zuz from now until thirty days" and he dies in the middle of the thirty days before she gave to him [the two-hundred zuz] she is unable to fulfill the condition, because if she gives to his inheritors, it is considered null. Thus, because the 30 days have passed and she did not give him [the money], the divorce is nullified and she must undergo <i>chalitza</i> or <i>yibum</i>. If he said to her " [I give you a <i>get</i>] on condition that you give me two-hundred zuz and he does set a time [for the transaction to take place] and  he dies before she gives him [the two-hundred zuz] even if the <i>get</i> was lost or ripped before he died, she should not marry another until chalitza is preformed.
He says to her "[I give you a <i>get<i>] on condition that you give me 200 zuz, from now until thirty days [from now]," and she gives it to him within thirty days against his will, and he does not want to accept it, this is an invalid <i>get</i>, until she gives it to him with his consent. </i></i>
He says to her, "[I give you a <i>get</i>] on condition that you give me 200 zuz within 30 days" and he came back within the 30 days and said, "they have pardoned you [from paying]" then she is not divorced because the condition did not come into effect. Some say that this is true only when he tells her "they say only your loan is forgiven" but if he says to her "get a <i>get</i>" without any conditions, then she is divorced and they need not take from her. 
[If the husband] said to her: "[I will divorce you] on condition that you give me this utensil," or "this article of clothing," and that utensil or clothing is lost or stolen, the bill of divorce is not valid even if she gives him 1000 <i>zuz</i> as restitution. It is only valid if she gives him the utensil or clothing or he says to her: "Here is the bill of divorce without any condition." Some say that the bill of divorce is valid if he accepts the restitution.

If he makes a condition on her "that you do this thing," it is to be assumed that he meant that she "do it some day." After all, he did not specify when she should do it, or for how long.     How so? He says to her, "This is your <i> Get </i>, if you do work with me." "On the condition that you serve my father." "On the condition that you nurse my children" - if she does work with him, or serves his father, or nurses his children for one day, within the span of time that children nurse, which is 24 months, then it is a <i> Get </i> and she is divorced. Rem"a: And there are those who say that she needs to serve his father all the days of his life, nurse the baby until the end of the 24 months (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And if he dies even one day after she has begun to fulfill the condition, it is a <i> Get </i> (Tur). If the son or the father die before she nurses or serves them [respectively], it is not a <i> Get </i>. If he says, "...on condition that you nurse my son or serve my father for two years" she must complete the time that he specified. If the son or the father die in the time that he specified or the father says, "I do not want he to serve me" it is not a <i> Get </i> because she has not fulfilled the condition, and so too [any case] like this. And there are those who say that any [case] where the prevention [of fulfilling the condition] is not from her, it is a <i> Get </i> and it seems to me that in all these [cases], we rule stringently.
There are those who say that when we say that if she nurse or serves for one day it is a <i> Get </i> (see previous Seif) this is not specifically one day because even one hour is enough. And there are those who say that one day is specifically [referring to] Shabbat night and day.
One who gives a <i> Get </i> to his wife on condition that she give him 200 <i> Zuz </i> and [later] rethinks it and makes [another] condition on her in front of witnesses that she serve his father for two (typo in hebrew) years, his last words don't annul his first words, rather it is as if he said to her that she should do one of the conditions. If she wants, she can serve [his father], if she wants, she can give [the money] and the first and last [conditions] don't combine. But if he made a condition on her that she give him 200 <i> Zuz </i> and [later] he made a condition in front of two witnesses that she give him 300 <i> Zuz </i>, the condition of the 200 <i> Zuz </i> has already been annulled and she needs to give him 300 <i> Zuz </i> and so too anything like this. Rem"a: And there are those who say that all this is only when he sent her the <i> Get </i> without either condition, rather [only] after [making] the two conditions did he send her the <i> Get </i> in front of the first and second witnesses [of the conditions]. But if he sent her the <i> Get </i> at the time of the first condition or the second condition, it is specifically that condition [which is binding]. (Ran Perek Mi ShAchzu)
"This is your get, and the paper is mine" - [with this formulation] she is not divorced, since it is not complete. "On the condition that you give me the paper [in the future]" - she is divorced if she gives it.
If he makes a condition that is impossible to fulfill, such as "on conditional that you go up to the heavens" or "that you go down to the primordial deep" or "if you swallow a reed four by four hand-breadths wide" - this is not a condition, and the get is a get. But, if made a condition which is possible to fulfill, even if it would involve prohibitions, such as "on condition than you eat pig meat" - this is a [valid] condition, since it is possible for her to eat it and be whipped. This does not fall under the category of "making a condition against what is written in the Torah" since he did not make a condition that she eat pig meat in any case, since, if she does not eat it, she is [merely] not divorced.  This is the case only if the prohibition depends on her [alone] to do it. But if it's dependent on others, [such as] if he says to her "on the condition that you have sex with my father," this is not a condition, since his father will not listen to her to do a forbidden thing.
He said to her  "[I give you a get] On condition that you do not have sex with my father and she has sex with him, there is no Get.  But any time there are no witnesses to verify that she had sex with him, there is no concern that maybe she did have sex with him (and she is permitted to be married) and there is no concern that perhaps (she will have sex with him) (Tur):  





"[I give you a get] on the condition that you do not have sex with so-and-so (unspecified male), there is a get. And she can not marry until this same so-and-so dies for fear that maybe she was raped by him.
He must not require of her any conditions which apply for her entire lifetime such as: "on condition that you do not eat meat or drink wine", or "that you never drink wine", or "for all the days of your life" as if he forced her to to accept these conditions this is not a dissolution of the marriage. However, if he told her, [that the condition applied]: "all the days of my life", or "all the days of ploni's [a hypothetical third person's] life", or "for fifty years", behold - this is a [valid] divorce. There are those who hold that even if he expands [the duration of the conditions] beyond the length of a persons life, because the time is [explicitly enumerated and] decided this is a [valid] divorce.
[If] He said to her -[I will give you a divorce] "on condition that you do not go to your father's house until a certain time" - eve though the divorce is Kosher [valid] and the condition in full force - a person should not endeavor to facilitate a divorce given with this condition, this is because it is impossible to stand over her [to observe her at all times, to prevent her] to prevent her from going to her father's house. The divorce will then be nullified, her children will become mamzeirim [those conceived through illicit relationships]. If the divorcer [husband] is one of those whom we force to give a bill of divorce, and if the divorce only agreed to give the divorce with this condition, he is forced to give the divorce without this condition. 
If he says to her "[This is your writ of divorce] on condition that you don't marry so-and-so," and he didn't specify a time [that this was binding], then this is not a [valid] get, because this is not [total] "separation."  It is the equivalent to saying "on condition that you never drink wine again," or "[on condition that you] smile all of my days."  And there are those who say that since the stipulation lasts only the days of his life, it is as if he said "on condition that you never drink wine all the days of the life of so-and-so," and she is divorced.  And we rule like both of these positions, depending on whichever one is more stringent.
[If] he says to her: "On condition that you do not drink this wine ever" or "[on condition] that you do not ascend this tree" or "[on condition that you do not ascend] this wall ever," and the wine was spilled, the tree was cut down, or the wall fell, this is not considered separation [necessary to allow for divorce], since she never becomes permitted in what she was prohibited. And some say that since the condition only extends as long as the wine exists or the tree or wall exist, this is separation [necessary to allow for divorce] and we follow the words of both [opinions] towards stringency.

Siman 144

If he says to her, "Behold this is your get if I don't come [back] within 30 days," or he says, "On condition that I don't come [back] within 30 days," and he is on the way to come back within 30 days but he gets sick or he is prevented because of a river, and he only comes after 30 days, the bill of divorce takes effect, even if he stands and protests, "I was an oneis [the events were not in his control]!" For there is no oneis in regard to divorce. And [this is so] even though his intent was openly known that he did not want to divorce, since he did not stipulate "except for the case if I become an oneis." But an oneis that is very uncommon, such as being attacked by a lion or being bitten by a snake or a house fell on him, he never intended for that to make a condition on, and the bill of divorce is void [and if he dies] she is bound to the yibbum [levirate marriage]. Rem"a: And if he becomes a captive, that is a common oneis, and the bill of divorce is not void because he did not stipulate [the exception] (Mordechai Perek Mi Sheachzo).
"Behold this is your bill of divorce if I don't come [back] from this point [mi'kan] for 12 months," and he didn't say "from now" [me'achshav] and [he didn't say] "on condition" [al menat], and he dies within 12 months, this is a doubt, and she must do chalitza and not yibbum.
"Behold this is your bill of divorce from now [me'achshav], if I don't come [back] from this point [mi'kan] for 12 months." And he dies within 12 months, she is divorced. But if there is a yibbum to her, she cannot remarry with chalitza until 12 months pass. If she doesget remarried, she does not [get forced to] leave [her second husband].
If he gave the bill of divorce at night and said to her, "Behold this is your bill of divorce on condition [al menat] the sun emerges from its sheath, and he dies at night, the bill of divorce take effect. But if he said to her [instead of al menat] "if the sun emerges from its sheath] or he says, "when the sun emerges from its sheath," and he dies at night, it is doubtful. Some say that even [the phrase] "al menat" should be treated stringently, unless he said "from now [will this bill of divorce take effect on condition...", explicitly.
He said, "If I don't come [back] in 12 months [from now] write a Get for my wife." Or, if he says, "Write a Get and give it to my wife if I don't come [back] in 12 months, we don't write it within the 12 months, even if they don't want to give it until after 12 months. And if they write it within the 12 months, in spite of the fact that they give it to her after the 12 months, it is not a [valid] Get. [If] they wrote it and they gave it to her after 12 months, and he dies, if his death precedes the giving of the Get, it is not a [valid] Get. And if the Get [is given] before death, then it is a [valid] Get (Tur). And if there is a doubt as to which came first, then there is a doubtful divorce. Gloss: [If] they didn't give it to her immediately after 12 months, rather it was a long time afterwards, in spite of the fact that it was impeded by the wife who did not want to accept it immediately, even so it is a [valid] Get, and that is only if the husband is alive. (Go look in the Beit Yosef):
If he said, "Write and give a bill of divorce to my wife after the week," they only write until a year after the week. If he said, "After a year," they only write until a month into the second year. If he said, "After a month," they only write until the Sabbath into the second month. If he said, "After the Sabbath," they only write until the end of Tuesday. If he said, "Write and give it to her before the Sabbath", they write it from Wednesday to the end of Friday, and give it to her. If they delayed past the times that he told them, and then they wrote and gave it to her, she is doubtfully divorced. Rem"a: Some say that if he said, "After 12 months," its as if he said, "After a year." If he saif "After 30 days," they write one day after the 30th day (Hagahot Alfasi Perek Mi Sheachzo).
if he made a condition that if he does not pass before her for 30 days she is divorced, and he walks about and does not seclude himself with her, once 30 days pass she is considered divorced; this is true even if he passes her during the 30 days but does not seclude himself with her, it is still a kosher get (divorce document).When is this said? Only when he says "she is to be believed when she says I did not appease her". But if she is not believed by him, then we are concerned perhaps he appeased her while passing her, and he forgave her, and the get was annulled- making the get invalid. Similarly, one who says to a woman "here is your get, it goes into effect in 12 months", and he remained with her in the city, we are concerned that perhaps he appeased her, until he declares "she is believed by me to say that she has not been appeased". This similarly applies to all condition [of a get] that are contingent on her willingness. And if she is willing, and she forgives the conditions for her husband, the get is nullified, because we are worried perhaps he appeased her, until he says "she is believed by me". When is this said? When she is divorced after nisuin (meaning from a full marriage), and he is considered familiar and comfortable with her. However, if the divorce is from erusin (betrothal), we are not concerned that she maybe she was appeased by him. 

I he says "here is your get, if I don't return within 12 months",  we aren't concerned that he returned in a secretive manner, because that is not the normal way of people. So if the set time (i.e. 12 months) passed, she is divorced. Some say that even in such a case we are concerned that he came back secretively, unless his condition included the fact that his wife is to be believed if she says he didn't return. It is appropriate to ideally be concerned about this opinion, and such is the custom, that he should include in the condition that she is believed to say that he didn't return. And is the condition was that his return must be corroborated by witnesses, and the time passed and no witnesses came forward that he returned, according to all opinions we are not concerned that he came, even if he did not indicate that his wife is reliable.

Siman 145

There is a divorce document of somebody dies. Or there is a divorce document for when somebody is sick (probably coma or incapacitated). Or a divorce document for after somebody dies. The document isn't only for divorce, this is generally an accepted idea.
 If, [however, the husband] tells her: "This is your get. If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present day," or "...If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present time,this divorce document starts the day they die, or right away if they die, its a divorce document. And its better if you say from now (it starts) than to saying today. If you say today and they die in the middle of the day then the document doesn't take into effect until the end of the day, and there is no divorce document after the death.
[If a husband] says: "This is your get. If I die, [it is effective retroactively] from the present time - or from the present day - after my death," when [the husband] dies, the status of his wife's divorce is in doubt. [We suspect that] perhaps, after saying "from the present time," he changed his mind and [did not desire that the get become effective] from the present time, and instead take effect after his death. And there is no concept of divorce after a person's death.
A person who is deathly ill and he divorced his wife without the condition of from today if I die, we don't say that this is what he was intending as we say by a gift that intention matters. A bill of divorce is different that if he gave it there is no taking it back.
A sick man who wants to divorce conditionally in case he dies, so that [his wife] won't fall before a *yavam* [levirate marriage partner], but if he would recover, she won't be divorced, says to her as he gives her the *get* [bill of divorce]: "If I have not died, this shall not be a *get*, and if I have died, this shall be a *get* from now, and if I have not died, this shall not be a get," so that the condition is two-fold, with the positive statement preceding the negative, but not opening his mouth first with troubles. Then, it will be nullified immediately when he recovers, even though he doesn't say "return to me." And if he doesn't want it to be nullified immediately when he recovers, but after X period of time, he should say: "If I have not died by X time, this should not be a *get*, and if I have died by X time, it should be a *get* from now, and if I have not died by X time, it should not be a *get*. Rem"a: And he should say specifically this formula: "If I have died ... if I haven't died ... etc.," and he should not say "If I die ... if I don't die ...," since [the former] is the language of the sages. But see above Siman 154, Sa'if 100, which does not imply thus.
[If a husband said] "Here is your *get* [bill of divorce] from now if I have died from this illness," and a house fell on him, or a snake bit him, or a lion mauled him, or the like, and he died, it is not a [valid] *get*. But if he said, "... if I don't recover from this illness," and a house fell on him, or a snake bit him, or a lion mauled him, she is doubtfully divorced.
[If a husband said] "Here is your *get* [bill of divorce] from now if I have died from this illness," and he got up and walked in the marketplace, then took ill and died, we evaluate him: If he died as a result of the original illness, this is a [valid] *get*, even if he walked without support, and if not, it's not a [valid] *get*. But if he was plucked from one illness to another illness and never stood in the marketplace, this is a [valid] *get*, and he does not require evaluation.
A man on his death bed who gave a get and said, "[You are divorced] from today if I die," without additional detail, and he recovered, the get is nullified. We do not interpret his words to mean before he dies [even in the distant future], but he meant to say if I die from this illness. But if he gave the conditional get while healthy, stating, "from today if I die," he certainly meant [to cover any circumstance in which] he dies in her lifetime, and whenever he dies she is divorced.
The great leaders of the [Jewish] world gave good advice to suspect for defrauders in regard to the bill of divorce of a shechiv mera [one on his deathbed]. When he says, "If I die, from now until a certain day, inclusive," that is a bill of divorce. But not if he says, "If I die from this sickness," for that is a condition dependent on the sickness, [we do not allow this condition] lest a corrupt man schemes with a doctor to say he did not die from that sicjness from rather he contracted a different sickness, and he casts aspersions on the bill of divorce. <i> Rem"a: Some say we are not experts nowadays, and therefore we do not rely on the estimations of doctors. And some say that ideally we do not do divorce by way of condition, rather we divorce plainly, and to accept excommunicate communities or [require] the giving of collateral should the case happen that the go back and marry each other (Mordechai Perek Mi Sheachzo). And a divorce kohen, who needs to give conditions, that she should be prohibited to return to him, as earlier in the beginning of Siman 143, or if there is suspicion of mental illness in the sick person, there is what to divorce on condition, in the way that was explained (Seder Gittin). A woman who was divorced on condition, and her husband died, she does not need to be in mourning for him (ibid in the Mordechai). But if she wants to be stringent on herself and cry for him and to follow his deathbed, there's no prohibition to do so. </i>
A dying man who gave a divorce document to someone and said to him: "Take possession of this divorce document for my wife, so that she not become obligated in levirate marriage," who died before [the divorce document] made it to her hand, she is a doubtful divorcee, and must undergo halitzah and may not marry the brother.

Siman 146

One who divorces his wife after a fixed time, behold she is divorced when the set time arrives. And behold this is like a condition, but it is not a condition. It is like a condition, in that she is divorced when the set time arrives; and it is not a condition, for one who divorces on a condition behold he has divorced, and this man has not divorced until that time comes. Therefore, one who divorces on a condition must state his condition twice, and this one does not have to say his words twice or [adhere to] the other laws of conditions. How so? One who says to his wife: Behold this is your get but you are not divorced with it until after thirty days, she is not divorced until thirty days pass. And if the husband died or lost the get or if it was burned within the thirty days, she is not divorced.
If she went and put it [the bill of divorce] on the side of a public space, and it was stolen or lost after 30 days, she is divorced, since the bill of divorce was extant on the day she was divorced with it, and she placed it in a non-public space, for the sides of public spaces are not considered as public spaces proper.  So too if he made the divorce dependent on some action, the law is the same as the law of one who divorces after some time.  How so?  For example, he said to his wife, "This is your bill of divorce and you will not be divorced with it until you give me 200 <i>zuz</i>," she will be divorced after giving.  He need not duplicate the condition [i.e. specify what will happen if the condition is fulfilled and what will happen if it is not] or fulfill any other laws of conditions, for he did not divorce her conditionally, but rather he has still not divorced her, he has instead made the divorce dependent on the doing of such and such, and afterward she will be divorced.  What is the difference between one who divorces conditionally and one who fixed a time for divorce or fixed the divorce to an action?  One who divorces conditionally, there is divorce there, and it is not completed until the condition is fulfilled.  Therefore, when the condition is fulfilled, she is divorced, if the bill of divorce had been validated, even though it was not in her possession, and she need not go back and take it again or for it to be in her possession after the condition is fulfilled, for it had already arrived in her hand originally under the laws of divorce.  However, one who fixes the divorce to a time or action, it does not arrive in her hands under the laws of divorce but rather under the laws of a deposit until the fixed time arrives or the action is done.  Therefore, when the time arrives, the bill of divorce must be in her possession, or she must go back and take it again, or it must be in a place that is unique to her, even if it is not in her possession, as we have explained, and then she can be divorced with it.  If she remarried before the fixed time, or before the completion of the act upon which the divorce depended, she must leave the marriage and her offspring from him are from a prohibited marriage, as she is still entirely a married woman and no divorce has been effected.
If one put a *get* [bill of divorce] and said to her, "If you do not give me 200 *zuz* [unit of currency], this is not a *get*," or "... you are not divorced," he has not divorced at all, and there is no *get* here, neither conditional nor on condition of an action, and similarly for any similar [case]. And if he said to her, "You are hereby divorced, and if you do not give me 200 *zuz*, you will not be divorced," she is divorced even if she has not given, because he did not make his condition two-fold.
One who was divorced conditionally, and another [man] betrothed her before the condition was fulfilled, if the condition was fulfilled, she is betrothed. And if the condition was not fulfilled, and the *get* [bill of divorce] was nullified, she does not need a *get* from the second [man], as the betrothel did not take effect on her. But if she got married , and the condition was not fulfilled, and the *get* was nullified, she needs a *get* from the second [man].
When is the divorce document invalidated when another man betroths her and the condition is not fulfilled? When the condition was not to do something, and she did the act that nullified it; or the condition was an act within a specific time period and the time passed and the action was undone; or in some fashion that the condition was violated actively, then the divorce document is nullified. But a condition that is in her power to fulfill, and the matter is dependent on her, and were she to fulfill the condition she would be divorced (Rem"a: we take into account the possibility that she fulfilled the condition [Maggid Mishnah]) and the betrothal of the second man takes effect.

Siman 147

How does a man divorce on a condition? It is not that he says: Write a get for my wife on this condition, or write and give it to her on this condition, and there is no need to say that he should not write in the get: On this condition so-and-so divorces so-and-so, rather how does he do it? He tells the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign, and they write a valid get without any condition at all. And afterwards he gives her the get and says to her: Behold this is your get or behold you are divorced from me on such and such condition, or he says to them or to an emissary: Give her this get on such and such condition.
[If] he wrote the stipulation in the bill [of divorce] after he finished writing the personalized part of the bill, it is valid, whether he wrote it before the witnesses' signing or he wrote it after the witnesses' signing. However, if he wrote it before the personalized part of the bill [of divorce], even if he wrote "on condition that such-and-such", this is a possible divorce, for a claim to the body of the bill [of divorce] remains his. Likewise, if he stipulated orally before the writing of the personalized part, this is a possible divorce.
Whoever divorces on a stipulation that annuls the bill [of divorce] -- such as that he stipulated to her that she shall not eat meat and not drink wine all the days of her life, or that she shall be permitted to any man except So-and-so, or that he stipulated other stipulations before the writing of the personalized part [of the bill of divorce] -- if the stipulation was written in the bill [of divorce] and he thereafter erased it and gave [the bill] to her, she is possibly divorced. If, [however,] the stipulation was oral, he takes the bill from her and thereafter gives it to her without a stipulation at all or with a valid stipulation.

Siman 148

If a man wrote [a get (that is, a divorce document)] to his wife, and then he decided not to divorce her, and then he was secluded with her after he wrote it, he may not divorce her with that get another time if he decicdes to divorce her.
And if he divorced her with this get yashan (that is, this get that was written before he was secluded with her), then she is divorced and may remarry, for this get was written for her and it was given with witnesses, as the law mandates.
And why may he not divorce her with [with a get yashan] at the outset?  [Because] maybe [she will become pregnant from the husband during that time of seclusion] and people will say that the get was delivered before she became pregnant.
There are those that say that the aforementioned law [that if a get yashan was used, then she is permitted to remarry] only applies if the man delivered the get directly.  However, if he sent it to her through an agent, and then he secluded himself with her after he gave the get to the agent and after the get was delivered, then she may not get married with the get [as evidence that she was legally divorced] but, if she did remarry [with it] she does not need to leave [the new husband].
Anyone who divorces on condition, whether he says, "[You will be divorced] from now..." whether he says, "If it will be... and if it won't be..." he cannot be in seclusion with her as long as the condition has not been fulfilled, unless there is a witness present, even [if the witness is] a slave or a maidservant, and it is enough for [the witness] to come in an out [to be a random presence], the exception being one of her maidservants, or her small son, for she would not be embarrassed to have intercourse in their presence. And it is known that if he was in seclusion with her with two witnesses who were together, and they saw him and her, even if the conditions are fulfilled afterward, it is a doubt-divorce, for perhaps they had intercourse and the bill of divorce was made null and void, and it will be explained in the next siman. 

Siman 149

If one divorces his wife, and then engages in sexual relations with her before witnesses --italics: or it is evident to everyone that he engaged in sexual relations with her, like he married her (the Ran in the chapter titled "Every Get"-- before she married another, whether he divorced her from betrothal or marriage, since she was his wife, we assume that he took her back [as his wife] and for the sake of marriage he engaged in relations [with her] and not for prostitution. And even if they saw that he gave her money, for there is an assumption that a person doesn't engage in sexual relations for prostitution, and it's in his capability to make these sexual relations for a commandment [that is, for marriage purposes].  Therefore, this [woman] is definitely married, and requires a second get (that is, divorce document).
If he was alone with her before two witnesses, and the two witnesses [testified] as one, and he and she saw the witnesses, if she were divorced from marriage, we are concerned that they had sex, and the witnesses of their being alone are witnesses that they had sex.  Therefore, there is doubt as to whether this constitutes a marriage, and she requires a bill of divorce out of uncertainty.  If she had been divorced from betrothal, we are not concerned about her, for he does not desire her.  If we see that they do desire each other, we are concerned about her.  Rem"a:  If he was alone with his match, even though he desires her, we are not concerned, unless he had sex with her before witnesses (Responsa of the Ramba"n #135).
One who sent a bill of divorce, and nullified it afterward, and went and was alone with her, and afterward to became clear that she already received the bill of divorce before his nullification, she does not require a second bill of divorce from him, for he certainly would not have had sex with her for the purposes of betrothal, for he believed that the bill of divorce had been nullified, and he only had sex with her by virtue of the original betrothal.
One who divorces his wife and secludes himself with her, and before he divorces her a second time [out of doubt whether the seclusion constituted marriage], another man took her as a concubine, she is forbidden from both of them and requires a bill of divorce from both of them.
They only stated this presumption that a man does not intend sexual intercourse for licentious purposes regarding his wife whom he divorced or one who betrothed on condition and subsequently had intercourse without restating the condition, for she is his wife and regarding his wife it is presumed that he is not having licentious intercourse unless he states explicitly that it is licentious intercourse or he states explicitly that he is having sex on condition. But all other women it is presumed that he has sex with them licentiously until he states explicitly that he had sex with them for the sake of betrothal.
Likewise, a man or woman who converted [to another religion] under the duress of the decrees, and married each other under non-Jewish law, even though they are secluded with each other daily in front of everyone, one needn't be concerned that they have done formal betrothal. (And see above ch. 26.) 
Someone who is secluded with his wife after he instructed a divorce document to be written, signed, and delivered to her, they should not write [the divorce document]. And if they wrote and gave it to her after he was secluded with her, she is a doubtful divorcee.

Siman 150

Any get (that is, divorce document) that is nullified on a Torah level, if she is divorced with it, she is still a complete married woman. And if she married with it, she must leave [the second husband] and the child [that she had with the second husband] is a mamzer (born of an illicit sexual relationship), and she requires a get from the second [husband] on a rabbinic level, and from the first [husband] on a Torah level, to permit her to [other men in the] world.  And she is forbidden to both of them forever. And all of the thirteen ways that we treat a woman whose husband went to a foreign country and she married [another] and then afterward her husband came, that are explained in Section 17, we apply to her [this woman]. --Italics: And there are those that say that the first husband inherits her (The Magid Mishna Chapter 10 of [the laws of] Divorce)-- However, if she still hasn't married, but she became betrothed, she is permitted to her [first] husband, and she does not require a get from the second. And any get which is only unfit to marry with on a Rabbinic level, she may not marry with it a priori.  But if she married, even if she did not engage in intercourse, she does not leave [the second husband] and the child is kosher (that is fit, not a mamzer).  And they write for her another get [from the first husband] and she lives with her [second] husband. And if it is impossible to write [another] get for her, and the [second] husband was righteous and divorced her on his own, that is praiseworthy.  When does this?  When he doesn't have children from her.  However, if he has children from her, he should not release [her], for it brings slander upon the children. --Italics: However we give another valid get and there is no issue of bringing slander upon the children (Rulings of Mahara"y section 21).  Anything that we are strict [about] with gitin (plural of get), and the get is valid without it, but we are stringent to write it [this way] a priori, if it is not written [this strict way], then the get is valid (Mahariy"o section 23).
As long as a women status as being divorced is in doubt, she should not marry. If she marries, she should be released and her child will be considered bastard. 
Any Get (writ of divorce) that is nullified from the Torah, if her husband was a Cohen she was not forbidden to him because of divorce, except for the divorcer and says to her: "Behold you are divorcing from me and you are not permitted to all men, that even though there is no Get here at all, you are disqualified to Kehuna (marrying a Cohen)."
One who divorced his wife with a divorce certificate containing a flaw (invalid), or if it was doubtful that she was indeed divorced and he wished to reverse the process, he must repeat the blessing of marriage, but he is not required to recite the "seven blessings" or to write her a new marriage contract.

Siman 151

The scribe wrote the receipt [for divorce] and the divorce document, and made a mistake and gave the receipt to the man and the divorce document to the woman, and they gave them to each other and they were under the impression that they were divorced, and afterwards the husband objected to say she wasn't divorced, that he only gave her the receipt and the divorce document is still in his hands, if she didn't [re]marry yet, he's believed, and he should divorce her now and she will be permitted onwards. And if he didn't divorce her, and she gets up and [re]marries, she leaves this one and that one (first and second husbands), and all of the 13 ways [apply] to her. And if the husband did not object until after she [re]marries, he's not believed to forbid her, and she retains the status of a divorcee, since we "hang" [it] that [the divorce document] fell from her and he found it.

Siman 152

The that husband says, "I divorced my wife" is not believed since we are are skeptical of his words and she is thus rendered to be "questionably divorced."  Even if she admits to being divorced by him, they are not believed.
[The case of] a woman that said to her husband, "You divorced me," but he denied [her claim] will be clarified in siman 17.
Two say, "she was divorced" and two say, "she was not divorced," even if the husband withstands and she says to him, "you divorced me," she [retains] that status of a completely married woman, since the witnesses support her and she would be brazen [to lie about divorce]. Therefore, if she [re]marries, she goes out and the child is a halakhic bastard. In what cases are we talking about? When they say, "now she was divorced," since they say to her, "if the matter is truthful, take out your get," but if the witnesses say, "for many days she was divorced," you could say the divorce writ was lost, and since she says, "I am certainly a divorcee," and two witnesses testify for her, even the [other] two [witnesses] contradict them, if she marries one of her witnesses, she does not go out, since she and her husband know certainly that she is permitted, and it's a presumption that they wouldn't ruin themselves. But if she marries someone else, since the matter is a doubt for him, and similarly if she says, "I don't know," she goes out and the child is a questionable halakhic bastard. But whenever there is no contradiction, rather two say, "she was divorced now" and we say to her, "show us your divorce writ," and she says, "it was lost or torn," we're not concerned for her.
Two said: "We saw that she was divorced," and two say, "We did not see her," even if all of them were in one courtyard, this [woman] should not [re]marry, and if she [re]marries, she should not go out, and the child (of the second marriage) is valid, since people tend to divorce in private. Ram"a: And some say that if they say they were all in presence of each other, and two say, "we didn't see," that's a contradiction, since that much is not done in private.
One claims, "She was divorced," and one claims, "She was not divorced," she cannot remarry. If she does remarry, if she was assumed to have been married [to the first husband], she leaves [the second marriage] in any case. If she was not assumed to have been married, but it was only their word [that causes the assumption], if their testimony contradicts, such as one saying, "She was divorced," and the other saying, "She never had [even] a possibly [illegal] divorce," she can remarry [even] ideally. If both testify that she was married, but that he had thrown her a get [bill of divorce], one claiming it was closer to him [and therefore she never acquired it], and one claiming it was closer to her [and therefore she did acquire it, since this is a case of not contradictory facts but opinions], if she remarries, we require her to leave.
A woman comes and says, "I was married, but now I'm divorced," she is believed, for the very mouth that prohibited herself is the mouth that permitted herself [we believe her when she claims she was married, so we believe her when she claims she was divorced]. Some say this is only when she says this within the normal amount of time [to say such a sentence], unless she gives a pretext to her words.
If there are witness to the fact that she was fully married, she is not believed to say "I am divorced" [because it is not by her mouth that she was made prohibited to others], and [therefore,] if she remarries, we make her leave. And even if she remarried before the witnesses come who testify to the fact that she was fully married [beforehand]. But we are mindful of her words and we do invalidate her to ever [marry] the priesthood. And if he [her new husband] dies, [his relatives] do chalutza and not yibbum. Rem"a: If witnesses come and claim, "We heard she is a divorcee," that is not a testimony that can take her out of the assumed category [of marriage], until they testify to the fact that she is a divorcee (Rivash Siman 504). But if there are no witnesses to the fact that she was fully married, but they only claim "We heard she got married and was divorced," it is considered like a regular rumor, and its way is clarified earlier Siman 46.
If she has two witnesses that she is a divorcee, even though there is no get [bill of divorce] present, she can remarry [even] ideally.
If she removes her get [bill of divorce] from her hand and says, "My husband divorced me with this," she is believed, and she can remarry even though [the divorce] was not confirmed [to have been taken place], as was explained in Siman 141 and 142.
If the husband comes and protests: If he says, "I dropped it [by accident] and she found it [and I never meant to divorce her]," he is not believed, for he admitted to having written it for her, and it ended up in her hands. But if the husband says, "It was conditional, and the condition has still not been fulfilled," or "It was [just] something to be watched," or "I never had it written," or "It's a forgery," [the matter must be] confirmed by his signature or through witnesses to the giving [of the get], as was explained in Siman 141 and 142 (Se'if 13 and 14).
And if [the matter] is not confirmed, she is not divorced to be permitted to others, but she does invalidate herself from [marrying] the priesthood.
A woman who has in her hand the court decision, she cannot remarry until the signatures of the court are recognized. (Rem"a: See the end of Siman 142 in the gloss).

Siman 153

If someone finds a woman's bill of divorce in the marketplace, if the woman gives a sign [it is hers], saying, "This hole is next to this letter," and she says she was already divorce with it and it fell off of her, they return it to her. [This is so] even if the husband contradicts her and says that it fell off of him and that he never divorced her ever, but rather he had commanded it to be written but he had yet to give it; even if he also gives a sign. If she does not give a sign, and the husband contradicts her, they don't give it to him, nor to her. And if the husband admits he wrote it, and says he they should give it to her for divorce, at a place and time that it is appropriate to return, for there is not what to suspect after it fell, according to what was explained in Siman 132, they can give it to her and she can be divorced from then on. If not, they should not give it to her. And if he admits he divorced her with it, and she requests of him that she should collect her ketubah, and he said that he already paid her and returned it to her and [the bill of divorce] fell from him, he returns it to her, even if she doesn't say, "This hole is next to this letter," but any other sign (<i>that does not so much</i>) show intimate knowledge [of what the bill of divorce looks like], such as her saying, "Such and such fingers are the length of the bill of divorce," or "[Such and such fingers are the width of the bill of divorce," or she says the measurement of the string-tie for it, or [whether] the string is white or black, or she says it was placed in a box or in a chest, those are not sign that are enough for him to return it to her.

Siman 154

These are the [reasons] we force him to divorce her and to give her the ketubah: One who develops bad breath of the mouth or nose, or goes back to become a collector of dog feces, or a tanner, or to a scraper of copper from its source [i.e. a miner]. If she wants, she can stay with her husband. <i> Rem"a: And if she knew [about this problem] before she was married, we do not force him to divorce her, for she understood and accepted it (Tur in the name of the Ramah).</i> If the man becomes afflicted with boils, we force him to divorce her and to give her the ketubah. Even if she wants to stay with him (<i> Rem"a: Or [even] if she stipulated [that she knew about this] </i>) we don't listen to her, rather we make them separate against their will, for she exacerbates his condition [if they have sex]. And if she says, "I will stay with him with witnesses [about], so that he does not have sex with me [because they are around]," we listen to her. <i> Rem"a: Some say that [if he becomes] an apostate, we force him to divorce her through non-Jews (Bet Yosef Siman 134 in the name of the O"Ch and the Mordechai Perek Hamegaresh), as long as he voids it at the time of the bill of divorce (ibid Mordechai). Some argue and say that we do not force an apostate [to divorce], or any transgressor against the faith (Teshuvat Mora"m), unless he makes her transgress, for example feeding her prohibited food (Mohry"V Siman 22), or he violates a promise that he made upon himself that he would not tease her or hit her, or he makes a promise and he does not fulfill it, for sons die [as a result] of sins of [violating] vows (Hagahot Maimoni end of Ishut). One who pimps prostitutes, and his wife complains about it, if there are witnesses, and they see him with adulterers or he admits, some say we force him to divorce her, but we do not suspect he caused the bringing of gentile children, for perhaps they are lying about him (Chiddushei Aggudah D'Yevamot).</i>
If a woman has a husband with bad breath of the mouth or nose, or he collected dog feces, or the like, and he died [childless, causing his wife to be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah of either yibbum or chalitzah]. If [the yavam] has the same blemish of his brother, she can say: "With your brother, I could accept this. With you, I am not willing to accept this." He does chalitzah and he gives her her ketubah[-worth].
If someones says, "I will not give food nor provide for [my wife]," we force him to give food. And if the court cannot force him to give food, such as one who doesn't have anything to provide and doesn't want to make money to become profitable and provide food [that way], if she wants, we force him to divorce her immediately and giver her her ketubah. The law is such to someone who does not want have sex. <i> Rem"a: Similarly, a man who gets angry often and consistently kicks out his wife from his house, we force him to divorce her, for because of this he will not provide food for her sometimes, and he will separate from her from sexual relations more times than her rights to conjugal relations, and that is like refusal to provide food and sex [which are grounds for divorce] (Teshuvat HaRashba Siman 693). And see earlier Siman 70 and Siman 77. A man who hits his wife, has a transgression in his hand as much as striking his fellow. If he does this often, the court had the right to cause him pain and to excommunicate him, to whip him, to use all types of force, and to make him swear he will not do it again. And if he does not obey the court, some say we force him to divorce her, as long as he is warned one or twice, for it is not the way of Jews to hit their wives, that is the actions of the gentiles. This only applies when he starts it, but if she curses him for no reason, or mocks his father and mother, and she contradicts what he says and he has no authority over her, some say it is permitted to hit her. And some say that a bad wife is [also] prohibited to strike. The first opinion is the essential one. If it is not known who started it, the husband is not believed to say that she started it, for all women are assumed kosher, and they place others among them to see who is the bad one. And if she curses him for no reason, she is divorced without her ketubah. And it seems to me that this is only when this happens often, and after warning, as was explained earlier siman 115. If she left his house and borrowed [money] and ate [food], if she left because of him hitting her so often, he must pay her back (all of this note can be found in the Mordechai Perek Naara in the name of the Mohar"am and the B"Z Siman 88), and as is explained earlier Siman 70.</i>
 man who becomes blemished after his marriage, even if his hand is amputated or his eyes become blinded, we don't force him to divorce his wife and give her her Ketubah; rather if she wants she can remain, and if not then her law is like a rebellious wife.  Haga: There are those who say this law only applies if one of his hands or feet is amputated, or one eye is blinded, but in a case where he loses both, he must divorce his wife. (Tur and Rosh) 
A man who behaves in an uncontrolled fashion (lit. as a "shoteh" - see note) on a daily basis, and his wife says, "My father, because of his downtrodden financial circumstances, married me to him, and I thought i could tolerate it, but it is impossible to me because he is crazy and I fear he will kill me in his anger," we do not force him to divorce, for we only force divorce in those cases listed by our sages.  Rama: An epileptic, some say that it is not a blemish, and we do not force him to divorce.  On the other hand, we do not force her to be with him, since she has a [reasonable] claim (Mordechai, chapter haMadir, in the name of Ra'aviya).  Some say that it is a blemish in a man, and we force him to divorce (Rosh, rule 42). 
If a woman demanded a divorce because she cannot produce children with this man we so not listen to her.  If she demands a divorce because she want a son to lean on [in her old age], and she does not yet have any son, and she she says that he is the cause of the infertility because he cannot ejaculate with force, if she has lived with him for ten years and she ah not become pregnant, and she does not demand her Ketubah (such that we would have reason to suspect that she is only demanding to divorce to collect the Ketubah), and there is also no other reason that she might be demanding the divorce, we do listen to her, even if he has children from another woman, for perhaps his physical state deteriorated later.  We force him to divorce her and give the primary 100 or 200 [of the Ketubah], but not any additions.  He must also return the dowry that she brought into the marriage.  He should issue a generic ban against the fact that she is making a claim without certain knowledge, and then he must giver her the Ketubah.  If he said, "I will marry another woman and inspect myself," we listen to him.  If the second woman becomes pregnant, the first is divorced without a Ketubah.  If she does not [become pregnant], both women must be divorced and given their Ketubah, or he can marry a third woman, if he can afford to support them.  Some authorities say that if the second woman also said that he cannot ejaculate with force, he must divorce both and give the Ketubah.  In all cases, if it is known that he is sterile, and she comes with this demand, he must divorce immediately.  Rem"a: The same applies if they were married for ten years with no children, and she comes with this claim, we then force him to divorce and give the Ketubah.  In that case it will not help for him to say, "I will inspect myself with another woman," because the first will still not lose her Ketubah since she has not been inspected with three men [and found barren].  The rule that she must claim that he cannot ejaculate with force is only if we know that he already had children, for we then assume that [the infertility] is from her unless she makes the claim that he cannot ejaculate with force, or if this is her third husband such that it is already established [that she is infertile].  So appears to be the view of the Tur, and it is from the conclusions of the Tosafot and the Hagahot Ashri. 
If she says that he has erectile dysfunction and cannot have intercourse with her, and she requests a divorce, and he contradicts her, some authorities say that she is believed (Rem"a: even if they have not been married for ten years), and we force him to divorce her immediately, though he does not hive her the Ketubah.  If he divorced her without being coerced, he must give her the Ketubah.  Rem"a: Some sauthorities say that even though he can have intercourse with another woman he still mist give this woman her Ketubah; since he cannot have intercourse with her she can say, "I have given myslef to you, what more can I do for you?" When is this the case?  When she does not demand the Ketubah.  If, however, she demands the Ketubah, she is not believed, and we do not even force him to divorce.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that these days when some woman are impudent, she is not believed.  Nevertheless, if there are reasons to suspect (or circumstantial evidence) that she is telling the truth, she is believed.  If we suspect that he cannot have intercourse with her because she has a narrow womb and she is a virgin, or that he cannot have intercourse with her because he is aged or weak, we rely on this we do not force him to divorce her.  Some authorities say that even in cases where we do not force him to divorce, we still do not force her to make peace with him, and we do not consider her to be a rebellious wife.  Instead, we allow time to pass such that they either make peace or wait ten years without children.  The same applies if he betrothed a woman and she may not marry him or another, he must divorce her.  If she claims that he husband refuses to lie with her or have intercourse with her, it is judges as if she said he had erectile dysfunction.
If it is known that a man intends to travel to another country, we make him take an oath that he will not go or we force him to issue a time bound divorce before he leaves.
If it is known that he cannot stay in the place that he married because of some mortal danger, we force him to divorce (Rem"a: because she does not need to go with him).
If a man married a woman and stayed with her for ten years and did not produce children, he must divorce her and give her Ketubah, or marry another woman who can bear children.  If he  is unwilling, we force him to divorce.  If he said, "I will not have intercourse with her.  I will live with her with witnesses so that I will not be secluded with her."  Whether she said this, or he said it, we do not listen; instead we require him to divorce or marry a child bearing woman.  Rem"a: Some authorities say that this is true if they had no children at all.  If, however, she birthed a viable child, even though he has not yet fulfilled obligation to be fruitful, we do not force him to divorce her.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 1), that these days we never force a divorce.  A man is believed to say that he knows himself to be sterile, and we do not force him to marry a woman.
If he was away on business during the 10 years, or if the husband was ill, or she was ill... Rama: even though they continue to have relations - Mechaber ... or they were locked in prison, that time does not count as part of the 10 years. 
If she miscarries, she counts [ten years of childlessness] from the date of miscarriage. If she miscarried, and miscarried again [a total of] three times, she has the status of a woman who [always[ miscarries; he divorces her and gives her ketuba monies. Nevertheless, she is permitted to marry another.
He says, "She miscarried during the 10 years," so that she may stay with him, but she says, "I did not miscarry," she is believed. 
He says, "She miscarried twice," and she says, "I miscarried 3 times," she is believed. 
In all of these matters, he may force her to swear a "heset" oath (Rabbinic type oath) that she did not miscarry or that she miscarried three times, for these claims affect whether he must pay her ketuba.
If he remains with his wife for ten years and she does not give birth, and he dismisses her(divorce), she is permitted to marry a second man. If she remains with the second man for ten years and does not give birth, he ruling with him is the same as her ruling with the first. 
(if) he divorced her, she should not remarry a third. If she remarries a third man, she goes out without her Ketubah(receiving her due). Unless he has another wife, or if he already has fulfilled the commandment of "being fruitful and multiplying." But if he is aware of her(barrenness), she does receiver her Ketubah(money).
If she remains with the third husband for ten years and does not give birth, if she still hasn't collected her Ketubah money from the first husbands, she does not collect. And if she did collect, she does not need to return it. 
If the third husband dismisses her without the Ketubah(does not give her money), and she marries a fourth man and gives birth, she cannot collect now from the third money, because now maybe she has been healed. 
Anybody who marries a woman by way of sexual immorality, even if it was only a rabbinicaly mandated prohibition, such as intermarriage, we force him to dismiss her. 
All of these (cases) in which they said he must divorce her, we force him, even with whips.  And there are those that say that anyone about whom it was not mandated explicitly in the Talmud that we force him to divorce her, rather only that he should divorce her, we don't force him with whips, rather, we say to him: the sages obligated you to divorce and if you don't, it is permitted to call you a transgressor. Rem''a: And since there is a disagreement of many, it is fitting to be stringent and not force him with whips, in order that there won't be a bill of divorce given under duress. But if he has a wife through sexual immorality, according to everyone, we do force with whips. And in every situation where we do not force with whips, we also do not excommunicate him. And in any case, they can decree on any Jew to not do any kind deeds to him or do any business with him, to circumcise his sons or to bury them until he divorces (her). And any stringency which a Beit Din wants to enact, they can in this type of case, so long as they don't excommunicate him. But one who does not perform his marital duties, we can excommunicate him and banish him in order that he perform this duty or divorce her, because there is no forcing when it comes to marital relations, and so too in similar cases. And so too he who divorces with a kosher bill of divorce and he discredits it a bit, it is permissible to force him to give another bill of divorce. And any situation where we have a disagreement about whether or not to force him, despite the fact that we don't force him to divorce, in any case, we force him to give the value of the bill of marriage immediately, and so too the value of the wedding equipment that he provides for her. 
We must place a herem on anyone who is present at the time when the get is given, that they should not say anything detrimental about the get.  And we remind them that Rabbenu Tam decreed together with his students against anyone who said anything detrimental about a get that had already been given. 
If the husband was sworn to give a divorce document, it is best that they release him [from the vow] before [writing the divorce document] so that it not appear to be under duress. But he may give a pledge if he wishes. Rem"a: See above ch. 134:4. But regarding the divorce document of an apostate, there is no need to ask whether he swore or vowed, since he is legally required to divorce; but they ask him whether he is divorcing of his own free will, and likewise they ask his wife.
Someone who accepted upon himself the nazirite vow of Samson to divorce his wife, it is permitted to divorce, and this is not a problem of divorcing under duress. And it is best to divorce her with two divorce document, and to give them to her one after the other.

Siman 155

A ketana [girl less than 12 years and a day old] who does not have a father, or she has a father but her father had married her off and she became a widow or she was divorced while still a ketana, and thus she becomes like an orphan in her father's lifetime for he has no authority over her anymore, and she is married off with her permission, since her marriage is only on a rabbinical level, if she does not like her husband, she does not need a get [bill of divorce] from him, but rather she can leave through [the law of] me'un [where she can simply denounce the marriage]. But if she was married off without her permission, or even if it was with her permission, but she didn't know to keep her marriage, she doesn't even need me'un. Rem"a: Ideally the court should make sure not to allow the marriage of an orphan ketana when it seems it will end in me'un. And we can only judge this according to what we can see (Hagahot Maimoni perek 11 in the name of R"Y).
What is [a case of] a ketana [a girl less than 12 and a day] who must do a me'un [i.e. refusal of marriage which allows her to leave her husband when she is married off as a ketana]? From 6 years old until 10 years old, we examine her according to her intellectual abilities, if she knows [that she must] guard her marriage, and that when she is married, that the guarding is not like the guarding of a nut or date or similar, that is [a case where] she needs to perform me'un. But if she does not know to guard her marriage, she needs not me'un, but rather she can leave to her mother's house, as if she were never married. Less than 6, even if her sense of understand is great, and she knows to guard, she does not need me'un. More than 10, even if she is very dumb, she needs me'un. Rem"a: Some say that all this is only when she is married off by the permission of her brother and mother, but if she was married off without their permission, she does not need me'un [to go free] (Hagahot Alfasi perek Bet Shammai). Some say that if she is already past toddler's age, she needs to do me'un (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ritva).
The me'un [i.e. refusal of marriage in which a ketana girl can go free from marriage without a bill of divorce] is when she says, "I do not like so-and-so my husband," or "I do not like the marriage my mother and brother set up." Even if she doesn't say anything, but leaves and gets proposed to someone else while she is a ketana [less than 12 and a day], even if she was in nissuin [full marriage], her proposal is her refusal.
A girl who does me'un [refusal of marriage while she is a ketana where she can go free without a bill of divorce]], whether it [is a refusal] from erusin [engagement] or from nissuin [full marriage], even if it was not in her husband's presence and not in the presence of the court, will only [work] when it is in front of two who will testify to it. And some say, ideally there needs to be three [witnesses].
Just like she can do me'un [refusal of marriage when she is a ketana that allows her to go free even with a bill of divorce] to her husband, so too she can do me'un to her yibum [levirate marriage], if she didn't do me'un to her [present] husband.
If she does me'un [refusal of marriage when she is married off as a ketana girl less than 12 and a day that allows her to go free without a bill of divorce] and she does nissuin [full marriage] with another, she may do me'un with him [as well]. And so with a third [husband] and a fourth [husband], even many times, so long as she is a ketana.
The two [witnesses] in front of whom she refused [to marry the man to whom her father betrothed her] write for her a divorce document of refusal and sign in it and give it to her. It is not like a [regular] divorce document whose handing over creates the divorce. Therefore, it does not need to be written for her name, nor does it need to be handed over, nor does it need any of the requirements that a regular divorce document needs. And we do not write in it the regular formulation of the divorce document because it [the document] is nothing more than an action of the court.
Those that she refuses [the marriage proposal] before must know both her and her husband. Therefore, all who see her refuse [the marriage proposal] before two may write a bill of divorce of refusal for her even if they do not know her, because she surely knows those before whom she refused [the marriage proposal]. (Rem"a: This is true [that they must know both the woman and her husband] ideally, but even if they only know the woman and not the man, it is sufficient.)
Those who witness the refusal must verify that he is a minor.
A female minor who did mei'un (declared her marriage annulled)  receives no ketubah [whether] a hundred or two hundred [zekukim], but does receive an addition [made to the ketubah]. All the time she had not done mi'un, her husband has a right to her handiwork and whatever she finds. He is obligated to feed her and redeem her all the time she is living with him. But he went overseas and she borrowed to eat or to redeem herself, and  she [then] rose up and did mei'un, he is not obligated to pay, even if he ate her fruit [profits arising from her possessions], and even if they still exist, such as if he collected them and they are lying in his jurisdiction, he does not return them. Regarding properties of tzon barzel and melog [], if they still exist, he takes them. If some of the tzon barzel were lost, he must pay, but from the melog property he is exempt. He is permitted to [marry] her relatives [after mei'un] and she is permitted to his relatives. She is kosher to [marry] the priesthood and she does not need to wait three months to marry [again].  If she married another man and he divorced her or died, she is permitted to return to the first [husband she did mi'un with]. Furthermore, even if the first divorced her and took her back, and she did mi'un with him, and she married someone else after she gave him mi'un, and the other divorced her, she may return to the first. For whoever goes out with mi'un, even if there was a divorce beforehand, it as  if she was never divorced from him with a divorce document and she may return to him. But if one divorces a female minor with a divorce document, she receives a ketubah, and he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his relatives, and she is forbidden to priesthood, and she needs to wait for three months. And if she married another and did mei'un to him, she may not return to the first because she left him with a divorce document, even though she left the last one with mei'un. And this obviously applies if the last one divorced her or died. She is also forbidden to the father of the first one and to his son, and to his brothers, like other divorced women, even though she left the last one with mei'un.  And if she did mei'un with the first, and he took her back and divorced her and she married another and became a widow or was divorced or did mi'un to him, she may not return to the first  or to his relatives. For whoever left him with mi'un in the end, her law is that of a woman who did mi'un. And whoever left him with a divorce in the end, her law is that of a divorced woman.  
She who refuses the redeemer, is forbidden to marry his father, for she is looked upon like his daughter-in-law once his son (the original husband) dies and she must be redeemed. However, she is permitted to marry other relatives (of the husband). Some say that (she) additionally (cannot marry) any other relatives (of the husband). She is originally (not allowed to marry) any of the deceased husband's relatives (except for the redeemer), but if the redeemer refused her, then she is allowed to marry his relatives (This is how the Beit Yosef ruled). And always, if she refuses one of the redeemers, she is permitted to marry the other brothers.
Until when may a minor reject [a marriage contracted for her by other family members in the absence of her father]? Until she grows two [pubic] hairs after [the age of] twelve years, or unitl she gives birth. <i> and from the time when [she becomes] pregnant, she is considered an adult (Or Zarua)</i>. As long as she has not grown two hairs and has not given birth, she is considered a minor, even if she shows signs of being an aylonit. (aylonit- a woman who never goes through normal puberty.) But if she is twenty years of age, and shows signs of being an aylonit, then she is considered an adult <i>retroactively from the time she turned twelve, even if she grows two hairs later (Choshen Mishpat 235)</i>, and she may not reject [the marriage]. A woman who is nineteen years and thirty days of age has the same law as one who is twenty years of age, since thirty days in a year are considered as a year.  And there is [also an authority] who says that she is not considered [as though she was] twenty years of age until she is twenty years minus thirty days of age.
If she is twenty years old and has no signs of infertility nor has she grown two pubic hairs, she is considered to be of minor age until she has two pubic hairs or until she arrives at the age of thirty-five and one day which is the majority of her years; at that point she is considered infertile even if she has no signs of infertility and she is not allowed to refuse. (see above in paragraph 172 where the signs of infertility are enumerated.)   
Two [pubic] hairs are only a sign of majority age if they come in the twelfth year and on, but, if they came before this, even during the twelfth year, they are considered to be a mole, and the child is not considered of majority of age, unless more hairs comes up after twelve years. REMA: there are those that say if the hairs come up on the last day of the twelfth year she is considered of majority age (Tur in the name of Rabbeinu Tam and the Rosh wrote similarly). Nonetheless, if she brought forth hairs after the prescribed time, she is considered of majority age, even for halitza, and we are not considered if they may have come before the appropriate time. There are those that say if two hairs appeared before the twelfth year and they are still on her after the twelfth year, she is considered of majority age for declining a marriage, but she is nonetheless considered a minor for halitza. REMA: if there is a doubt as to whether or not she has reached twelve years we rule stringently (Responsum of Rashba 1216?)
When she is checked it is done by approved women who are trusted. Even one woman can check her and we listen to her if she says that she has or hasn't (grown two pubic hairs), even if the woman is a close relative. (see below paragraph 169 regarding if women are believed regarding her age.) 
The two hairs must have a follicle at their root. Even if both of them come from one follicle, this is considered a sign [of puberty]. If there are two follicles one next to another without hair, these are considered a sign [of puberty], there is a presumption that there are no follicles without hair, there had been hairs in them that fell out. 
The two hairs must be in the pubic region.  The entire pubic region qualifies for signs of maturity, whether above or below [the genitals], and the genitals themselves.  Some authorities say that even if one is on her back and one on her belly, or one is on her finger knuckles and one is one her toe knuckles, she is considered matured for the purposes of declining a rabbinic marriage, but not for the cancellation of a levirite marriage.
The length of the two hairs, from when they grow until they are fitting to be cut with scissors or to pull them out with fingernails, she is considered of majority age for refusing a marriage. But she is not considered of majority age for halitza until they are long enough to be folded over such that their top reaches the root. See further on in the commentary on the order of halitza number 27...
In what case is she allowed to refuse a marriage after twelve years [of age]? When she is examined and she is not found to have two hairs. But in general when she is twelve years old she is not allowed to refuse, there is an assumption that she has two pubic hairs. Nonetheless she should not have halitza until she is examined and found to have two hairs. 
In what case may she decline a marriage after we check her and she has not yet grown [two hairs]? When she has not had sexual relations after the age of twelve years and one day. But if he had relations with her afterward she may not decline, for, even though we do not see the signs on her we are considered that the may have fallen out; which is a doubtful [case of] Torah [law], for if it was known that she had two hairs before she had relations it would be undoubtedly be considered marriage, for he certainly had relations with her for the sake of marriage, and if another person had married her [afterwards] she would not need a divorce document; and, since it is a doubtful [case of] Torah [law] we are concerned that she may have had the signs before they had relations and she would need a divorce document [to obviate] the doubt. And if she refused him after they had relations, and she was examined and not found to have [two] hairs, and she married another, she would need a bill of divorce from him, [to obviate] the doubt, and she would be forbidden to return to him, and she married she would have to leave both men and any children would be considered suspected bastards from either father. 
If she had two hairs after twelve years, and she did not have sexual relations, it would be considered doubtful marriage. And if he came to send her away he would need a divorce bill by rabbinic decree. And, if he didn't divorce her, and she married another, she would need a bill of divorce from both men. If they wished she could divorce the first and marry the second. But, if she divorced the second the first could not be upheld for people may say: he returned to his divorced wife after she was engaged. And if the second man had sexual relations with her before she divorced the first, she must divorce both of them, and the child of the second would not be considered a bastard. And if the first had relations with her before she (divorced) the second the child would be a bastard.
There are those that say that in today's day and age we should be strict and not allow a woman to decline a marriage after twelve years, even though she has been checked and not found to have two hairs and even though she has not had sexual relations after twelve years. REMA: and, according to everyone, if she is less than twelve years of age she may decline, even today. And our teacher and master Rabbi Yaakov Folk ob"m did so in his days. And this is not like those who are stringent who say there is no declining a marriage today at all (Maharam from Reisburg and R"Y Mintz #13).  

Siman 156

Someone whose brother by his father died and did not leave descendants, it is a commandment to perform levirate marriage with his wife, whether she is his wife from marriage or his wife from betrothal, as it is written: "When brothers dwell together and one of them dies and has no son, her yavam shall go in unto her" (Devarim 25:5)
It says in the Torah: "And a son is not to him" (Deuteronomy 25:5 is discussing when somebody does yibbum) one son and one daughter, or the seed of a son and the seed of a daughter, until the end of the generation, between this woman to another. Even if it was a seed for a bastard. Behold these exempt a wife from doing chalitza and yibbum. But his sons with a slave or a non-jew don't exempt (yibbum and chalitza), even if the son (of the slave or non-jew) is converted to freed (rambam perk 1 hilchot yibbum and chalitza). And there are people who say that the son of another (not his) female slave counts, but his female slaves son doesn't count to exempt.
Even if there is a child that is dying or injured [so badly] from lashes that it is impossible for him to live, he is covered.
If one died and left behind a pregnant wife: If she has a miscarriage, she becomes someone who needs to do yibbum. If she gives birth, and the fetus emerges alive into the world, even should it die in the hour after it was born, its mother is exempt from chalitza and from yibbum. But on a rabbinic level, [we require] that until it is known for certain that it can live out the month, and that it was born after nine full months. <i> Rem"a: Some say that nowadays, even if it only entered the ninth month of pregnancy by just one day, it is considered a viable fetus. And even though we say in the Talmud that a pregnant woman for nine months cannot be a "pieced" pregnancy [i.e. eight months and a day, for it will die], many have already asked about this how empirical evidence contradicts this. Rather we must say that now, the matter has changed, and similarly for many things (Bet Yosef in the name of the Rshbetz). However, the months of pregnancy are each 30 days, and we don't count them like we count the year [some months 30 days, some months 31, some 29] (so implied ibid.).</i> But if it is not known how long it was born for, if it lives for 30 days, that is considered a viable fetus and the wives of its father are exempt from chalitza and yibbum. <i> Rem"a: And some say only when its hair and fingers grow in (Tur). </i> And so it seems to me. And if it dies within 30 days, even on the 30th day, whether it died from disease, whether it fell off the roof or a lion ate it, that is considered a doubt either a fetal death or a viable fetus, and she needs to do chalitza on a rabbinic level, but not yibbum. <i> Rem"a: And some say even if it was born dead, and even if there is what to doubt it would live out the month, she does chalitza and not yibbum (Tur in the name of the R"P). </i>
If they only know that he came to full term by her word, she is not believed. [If] a yibbum woman who went to the marketplace and got married, and witnesses testify that the fetus she gave birth to after her husband died lived for thirty days, and other witnesses contradict them and say that it did not live for thirty days, she is permitted to her [new] husband and she is not required to do chalitza. And if there are no witnesses that testify that it lived for thirty days, and there is no clear testimony that it did not live thirty days, but there is a pernicious rumor, we do not prohibit her based on a rumor after the marriage.
One who says, "That is my son," or "I have sons," he is believed to exempt his wife [from yibbum or chalitza should he die], even if he is assumed to have brothers. Some say that if there are witnesses that he has brothers, he is not believed afterwards to say that he has sons.
If he says at the point of kiddushin [quasi-married but not yet consummated] (<i>Rem"a: Or after that (so inferred from the Ran)) </i> "I have sons,", he is not believed to prohibit her [from remarrying]. Some say that she does chalitza but not yibbum.
One witness is believed to testify that she gave her husband a child, so that she can be permitted to a non-kohen. <i> Rem"a: Some disagree. (Bet Yosef in the name of the Raavad and the Rosh)</i>
one who has relations with a woman (that is not his wife), between the time that she is single and married she became pregnant, and he (the man that had relations with her when she was single) said "she is pregnant through me" and even if she agrees with him, there is a doubt, (and he needs to divorce her, and in a case where Yibum is an option) she does Chalitza and she does not do Yibum. If they were imprisoned together that its surely from him , he does not have to divorce her (Mordichai Perek Katzad). Some say even in a case when there is another Prostitute thats alone with him.
a woman who's husband goes overseas, and comes someone (who is a reliable source)  and says to her: "your husband died", its permissable for her to get married 
If she and her husband and her son traveled to a sea state, and she came and said: my husband died and afterward my son died, she is trusted. But, if she said: my son died and then my husband died, she is not trusted to be allowed to (participate in) levirate marriage. Rather, she performs halitzah(the refusal service of the levirate marriage) and she does not perform the levirate service. 
If she and her husband journey on their own and she comes and says: a son was given to me in this state and he died, and then my husband died, she is believed. But if she says, my husband died and then this son died, she is not believed, and she performs the refusal service and is not allowed levirate marriage. In what situation is this: when she is unfit for Kohanic status or if she says: we were in a cave when he died and there was no one there to testify. But if this is not the truth, she cannot perform the refusal service or levirate marriage until witnesses come. 
If he husband and her associate wife journey to the sea district(a long journey), and two (witnesses) come and say to her: your husband died, behold she cannot perform the refusal service(of levirate marriage) or do levirate marriage until she knows whether the associate wife gave birth or not. And if she was forbidden, from the outset, for kohanic status, she can perform the refusal service after 9 months. 

Siman 157

One who has a brother of the same father, even if he is a bastard or an apostate, even if he is a child, [the law is that] from the point that his head and most of his body already was born before his brother died, behold he is tied (Rama: [Zokek] meaning "tied", like (Job 36:8)) to his [brother's] wife in levirate marriage. Even if he is on his deathbed, or diseased so much so that he will not live because of it, she cannot remarry [to someone else] so long as he lives. But if it is a brother of the same mother, or he was born after [the married childless brother] died, his "yibbum" can remarry [lit. "permitted to the marketplace"]. Similarly, if [the married childless brother] has a brother from a maid-servant, or a gentile woman, he is not tied to his [brother's] wife in levirate marriage, even though he was born in holiness, since his conception was not in holiness.
Even a relative, or woman, or slave, or child who can understand, they are believed to say, "So-and-so is the brother of so-and-so from his father's side, and that is his levirate wife," and they do halitza or levirate marriage by their word.
Converts or freed slaves have no brothers at all, even if one of them was conceived in an unholy manner but the birth was holy [i.e. of completely Jewish stock],  and the other was conceived and born in holiness. And even if they are twins and they were [both] born in holiness, they are not brothers unless both were conceived and born in holiness.
[a woman who requires Yibum] proposal plan is with [the deceased's] brother-in-law who converted [to another religion from Judaism], there are some authorities who permit if he was converted when his brother was married; she does not have to rely on him [meaning he is free from any form of obligations to levirate marriage i.e. yibum,chalitza] REMA: who is he? if   she sins and marries without challitza, since its not know to her that there was a brother-in-law, and afterwards its known that she has a brother-in-law who converted, she is not free [from the available options in regard to the obligation of  levirate marriage]. there are authorities who say if there is an option to do Chalitza to her [she should do it] to end [the halachic relationship between the two of them]. if there were two brother-in-laws, one converted and is a Gadol and one is a Katan and is a Yesroel, No chalitza [from the converted brother-in-law] rather from the Yesroel; and even post facto [if she did chalitza with the converted brother-in-law] he is not survived with the converted brother-in-law. But If he was converted by force, he [the deceased] is survived by him [halachically] its permitted post facto [to do chalitza/yibum with him]. and the one who marries a woman and he has a brother who converted,  he is able to marry and stipulate with a condition twice that if  [he dies and] the proposal plan is before the [brother] who converted to do levirate marriage- they will not be married.
if the diseased was an individual who converted from Judaism, his wife is in need of the brother [to preform levirate marriage/chalitza]. THIS IS THE RULE TO BRANCH [from his brother]  THAT THERE IS [this obligation] TO HIM FOR A JEWISH WOMAN
Information of the deceased's brother was not withheld, and he [the deceased] said:"I have a brother" he is not believed. some one comes and says "I am the deceased's brother" he is not believed; Even if one witness of a relative comes to testify that this individual is the brother of the diseased, they are not believed and she is free from any form of levirite marriage.  
If someone was known to have brothers and at the time of his death he said: I have no brothers, he is not believed. So too if he said about someone who was known to be his brother: This is not my brother, he is not believed.
If he was not known to have brothers and a rumor started that there are witnesses who will testify that he has brothers and the witnesses are in another country, even if he said at the time of his death: "I have no brother." She [the widow] must still be concerned and should wait until the witnesses who said [he has a brother] come and are asked.
A woman whose husband has neither a son or a brother, and her mother-in-law and father-in-law are overseas when her husband dies is permitted to remarry; for we are not concerned that her mother-in-law may have given birth to a son and he is entitled to her [via levirate marriage]. But, if her mother-in-law left when pregnant, we are concerned lest she gave birth to a boy and he is entitled [to her via levirate marriage].
A woman whose husband dies, and he had a son overseas, she is permitted to [marry] a non-family member [i.e. not her husband's brother. We are not concerned that the son may have died, rather she stands in her place by presumption [of the son being alive]. The brother of a deceased husband may not live with [his brother's widow with whom he will do] halitza if he is attracted to her, just like an engaged [but not married] couple. (Responsum of the Rashba #209); this is specifically after the halitza ceremony, but, prior, it is permitted (Maraharm Padua paragraph 7).

Siman 158

Similar to that a woman is believed to say: "my husband died", [in order] that she may marry, so she is believed to say: "my husband died", [in order that] she may be married in a levirate marriage, and the yovom (brother who enters into a levirate marriage) enters into the inheritance on her word. But she is not believed to say: "my yovom died" [in order] that she marry to the market. And the man is not believed to say: "my brother died and I will enter into levirate marriage with his wife". Therefore, if she went with her husband and her yovom to a country of the sea, and she came and said: "my husband died and then my yovom died", or, "my yovom died and then my husband died", she is not believed. 
If she and her husband went overseas by themselves, and she came [back] and said "a *yavam* was given to me, and he died," whether she said "my husband died, and then my *yavam*," or whether she said "my *yavam* died, and then my husband died," she is believed.
A single witness witness is trusted to testify that a *yevamah's* husband died, and she can enter levirate marriage based on his testimony. Or, [to testify] that her husband died, [permitting her] to marry [anyone from] the marketplace. Or to say "Your husband died, and afterward, your son died." And even a male slave, female slave, woman, Samaritan speaking off-the-cuff, or a witness [testifying to] what another witness said is trusted to testify that the *yavam* died, just as he is trusted regarding the death of the husband. And the rule for this testimony is the same as the rule for that testimony regarding witnesses who contradict each other about the death of the *yavam*, for all matters. Rem"a: And there are those who say that a single witness id not trusted to say that her *yavam* died, to permit her to [marry anyone in] the world.
The five women who cannot testify for each other that [one's] husband died, similarly cannot testify that [one's] *yavam* died.
Two sisters-in-law who came from a country [over]seas, this one saying her husband had died and the [other] saying her husband had died -- the [one] is forbidden because of the [other]'s husband and the [other] is forbidden because of the [first one]'s husband. [This is] because one's sister-in-law is not believed to testify for her that her brother-in-law died, as will be explained. [If] one of them had a witness that her husband had died, [then] the one who had a witness is forbidden because of her brother-in-law; the one had no [witness] is permitted, for the witness testified that her brother-in-law had died and she is believed to say her husband died. If the [one] had children and the [other] had no children -- and both had no witnesses -- the one who has no children is forbidden and the one who has children is permitted.
If they had neither witnesses nor children, and a brother-in-law or brothers-in-law were present and effected levirate marriage with them and [then] died also without children and without further brothers, [then] they are barred from marrying an outsider as they were from the outset. But if these left children or divorced them with a bill [of divorce], they are permitted to marry an outsider.

Siman 159

One connected to a brother-in-law who became betrothed to another by accident -- the outsider who betrothed her gives her a bill [of divorce], and her brother-in-law does levirate marriage or <i>chalitsah</i>. If her brother-in-law was a <i>kohen</i>, who cannot wed a divorcee, she leaves the outsider with a bill [of divorce] so that a sinner not profit [thereby], and her brother-in-law effects <i>chalitsah</i> with her. If the outsider, who divorced her from betrothal, returns and <i>nisu'in</i>-marries her after her brother-in-law has effected <i>chalitsah</i> with her, we do not remove her from him. Comment: And some say that even if he returned and <i>nisu'in</i>-married her, we do remove her from him, since she was betrothed to him illicitly. That [however] is specifically if he betrothed her on purpose, but if he betrothed her by accident -- that they did not know she had a brother-in-law -- [then:] if the brother-in-law wishes to effect levirate marriage, the betrother must divorce her, [but] if the brother-in-law wishes to effect <i>chalitsah</i>, he does <i>chalitsah</i> and she is <i>nisu'in</i>-married to the betrother; and he must betroth her again after her brother-in-law has effected <i>chalitsah</i> (Rabbi Tam). So seems principal to me. And some say [this is] specifically in [a case of] complete accident, that they did not know that there is a brother-in-law present, but if a brother-in-law had been present but it was thought that he was dead -- for so the rumor had spread -- she shall leave the betrother (Torat HaBayit chapter 222).
A woman who had been bound for levirate marriage, but instead married (by nisuin) an outsider, even accidentally, he must divorce her, even if they had children together.  She is forbidden to him and also to the yavam (living brother of her late husband).   The thirteen rules listed in chapter 17 (I believe referring to se'if 55, regarding a woman who remarried in the lifetime of her husband who had been mistakenly thought dead) apply, except that her progeny (from the outsider) is not a mamzer (bastard).  Some say that the child has a status of Rabbinic mamzer. Her yavam gives her chalitza (ceremony dissolving the levirate bond), and she is then permitted to marry others.   (Comment: See supra chapter 157 se'if 4).
A woman bound for levirate marriage (shomeret yavam) who committed fornication, does not become forbidden to the yavam (surviving brother of her late husband) if he is an Israelite (non-priest). Rama: Some authorities say that she is forbidden to her partner in fornication by k'nas - rabbinic punishment (Nimukei Yosef chapter haIsha).
If she consummated levirate marriage by accident, as when she heard that her husband had died, and then he appeared; If she was fully married (by nisuin) to her husband, she does not require a get (writ of divorce) from the yavam. Rama: And she is permitted to her husband (Tur). Mechaber: If she was only betrothed (by erusin) to her husband, she requires a get from the yavam. Rama: And she is forbidden to her husband.
The <i>yavam</i> is forbidden to marry any of the relations of the person he must do <i>yibum</i> with, even if she dies before they do <i>yibum</i> or <i>chalitzah</i>, whether he is the only one who can do <i>yibum</i> or there are two. Even if there is a doubt whether she is his intended <i>yibum</i> or not, we go according to the strict opinion (Tur). Therefore, if she engaged one of his intended <i>yibum</i>'s sisters, he is forbidden to marry her, since she is like the sister of his fiancee, until his brother does <i>yibum</i> or he does <i>chalitzah</i> with his intended, and therefore the status of intended is lost. There are those who say that specifically engaged her, but if they married, the status of intended is removed and he is permitted to go to her before he performs <i>yibum</i> or his brother performs <i>chalitzah</i>. Rem"a: there are those who say that in our times, because of regulation of Rabeinu Gershom, that you cannot have two wives, if one became the <i>yavam</i>, it is forbidden to enter into another marriage until you perform <i>chalitzah</i> for his <i>yevamah</i> (R"I from Mintz). Specifically, if they were not already arranged to be married, if they were already arranged, they are allowed to marry (Hagot Mordechai Ketubot). 
If one betrothed a woman, and afterwards his brother, who was married to her sister, died, he brings his wife [into his house, i.e. consummates the marriage].
One who marries a woman who is in need [of a husband because she cannot support herself], and afterwards he dies if he has a brother she will rely on him for support, and she will not remain needy rather she will [be supported] like this [with the brother], to remove [this obligation of having to be engaged to] the fiance [it is done] with a get and the brother-in-law [who has this obligation of levirite marriage, it is done] with chalitza; and if the fiance dies [during the period when they are engaged], she goes to the brother-in-law to permit her [to get married], [it must be the] desire of the woman [and it must be the] desire of the brother-in-law.

Siman 160

The yevamah--for the first three months she is provided for from the estate of her [dead] husband, and her handiwork belongs to the yavam. After this point she is not provided for, neither by her husband nor by the yavam. If she goes to court after three months (Ribash, siman 104) and demands that he have levirate marriage with her or release her in front of the court, and he wants to have levirate marriage but an unforeseen circumstance prevents it, that he gets sick or must run away due to a financial matter or due to oppressors, he must supply her with sustenance without [her being obligated] for an oath. 
If he left her pregnant, she is provided for until she gives birth. If she gives birth to a viable fetus, she is provided for as long as she is a widow, as are all women. 
If she fell before a yavam who is a minor she does not receive sustenance from him until he becomes and adult.  Rema: If she gave birth to a suspected stillborn, when she would be required to perform Chalitzah and not Yibum, as was explained earlier in Se'if 156 she takes her Ketubah money right away.  There are those who say that she only doesn't receive sustenance from a minor yavam's property, even the dowry that she brought in for her original husband and he [the minor] seized, however if he did not take possession of her dowry, as in a case where a third party is holding it, she receives sustenance from her dowry, certainly in a case where she says that the property should be given to her possession and she would like to maintain the principal until the minor becomes an adult and she will get sustenance from the profits that they give her the money. 
Her profits are her's forever, even if she receives sustenance from another source. Rema: Only after three months. 
If moneys came to her while she was awaiting her levirate marriage she may sell them or give them away and these [transactions] are upheld for the man who will marry her has no claim to them until he takes her in. Even if he made a verbal commitment. This is the case if she is a widow from engagement and she came into the money while she had been engaged, she may sell or give away and these [transactions] are upheld for a brother [who will marry her after she is widowed] is no different than a husband.
The brother who will marry a widow derives no benefit from property that the widow brings into the marriage until he marries her. And those assets from which the deceased brother was allowed to derive benefit; he only gets half of the proceeds. There are those that write: that he has no proceeds at all until he marries her. REMA: And the first opinion is correct. And there are those that say that property that she brings into the marriage which she received while she was still married are equal to those assets that the first husband had benefit from and thus the proceeds are split (Ramban, Ran, in Chapter The Woman). And so too her inheritors would split them if she dies. But, in a situation where the profits are hers, she may sell her land according to her portion of the proceeds.  ...
If she dies while waiting for her levirate marriage, her inheritors receive all the property she brought into the marriage and half the property that the husband was allowed to derive benefit from. REMA: So too if her levirate husband gave her a gift her inheritors inherit it. (Maharam Padua #17). And the inheritors of the husband receive her ketubah and the additions to it and half the funds she brought into the marriage. The inheritors of the husband are obligated to pay for the burial. REMA: And there are those who claim that all the properties that her husband is allowed to derive benefit from are in the possession of the husband's inheritors like the ketubah (Rabbeinu Tam and the Rosh), and they can not be removed from the inheritors if they possess them (the Ran wrote this in a responsum). All this is in a place and time when we do not force halitza, but in a place and time when we force halitza, so too if she was not fitting to be married by the brother, then there are those that say that the properties are not in the possession of the brother, and so, if she dies, he does not inherit her; therefore, in a place where we force halitza he does not inherit her according to this opinion (Maharik #91). And, as to who is called the inheritor of the husband, it requires further investigation, for there are those that say that the brother is the inheritor even if their father is still alive, and this brother is ahead of the husband and all his progeny (Mahari'u #41 and the Ran chapter The Woman and Maharam Padua #17). Yet, there are those that say that the father inherits, for as soon as the widow dies the brothers no longer have a claim, and the inheritance falls to whomever was first in line to inherit the (dead) husband (Maharik #91). And, even though logic seems to lean towards the last opinion, and so the language of "inheritors of the husband" seems to point, but the talmud and the Jerusalem talmud chapter The Woman Who Inherited, seem to state that the brother inherits the property of a widow who is waiting for levirate marriage. Thus the father has no claim on her property like the first opinion. If there are a number of brothers see #165 below. 
Reuven died, and he has two wives who are entitled to marry the brother, and then one of the widows dies, the brother has no claim on the assets because the second wife is ahead of him. REMA: If there is a question as to whether or not a woman is entitled to levarite marriage and she dies, the inheritors of the husband do not inherit her, for they are doubtful and her inheritors are certain[ly entitled] (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashbatz) and doubts never force release of property in the face of certainty. ...

Siman 161

Someone who has many wives, and dies, and has a brother: the intercourse or release of one of them removes the obligations of the others, and the brother can only marry one of them.   
If among them are those who are unfitting for a Cohen: if the brother acts to release them, he releases one who is unfitting and not one who is fitting. 
[If he had many wives and died and] he had many brothers and his wives fall to them: One [brother] marries or releases one of the wives and [this act] allows the rest of them [to marry someone else]. 
The [primacy of] commandment is on the eldest brother to marry [Rema: or release].  If he doesn't want [Rama: or he can't free her or marry her, e.g he's married to her sister (Rivash 159)]  [the commandment] returns to each brother in the order of their age.  If none of them want, we return to the eldest and say to him: the commandment is yours, either free her or marry her. If he doesn't want to free or marry or free her, we force him to free her, but we don't force him to marry her.  Rema: even if the eldest had taken an oath not to marry and not to free her, we force him and not the younger brother.  In any case we free the eldest of the oath, even though it never took hold, because of the way it appears (Rivash 159).
If the eldest says, "Wait until my younger brother comes of age", or his younger brother is deaf and [the eldest] says, "Wait until he heals", or his elder brother is overseas and he says, "Wait until he comes back", we don't listen to him. 
If the older [brother] did not want to do levirate marriage preferring halitza, and the younger [brother] wants to do levirate marriage: sexual relations with the younger is preferable. But, if neither of them wishes to do levirate marriage, rather, halitza, the halitza of the elder is preferred. REMA: see below paragraph 165 - that in our times halitza is given priority. If she is not desirous of levirate marriage, only halitza, then the halitza of the elder is preferred (Trumat HaDeshen paragraph 220).
Even though it is a commandment that the elder do levirate marriage, if the younger came along and did it levirate marriage first - he is granted it. REMA: the same is true if the younger did halitza, it is valid ex post facto (Ibid). But, from the outset, she needs to seek out the elder [brother], to give him his portion of money as is explained in paragraph 165.
A man had four brothers and they all died, and all of their wives fell to him.  If he is rich and can provide for them, if he wants he can marry all of them.  If not, he frees who he wants to from them, and marries who wants to from them, one from each [brother's] house.  
A woman who remains obligated in levirate marriage to two brothers, the elder is of the "time forced" [conversos?] and the second is Jew.  The Jew has precedence to free her.  If the other [the elder] goes ahead and frees her, she is free to the world. Rema: see (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 157:4)

Siman 162


When a man performs chalitza (ceremony to undo the levirate bond) on a woman bound to him for levirate marriage, that woman and her co-wives become forbidden to him and to all his brothers by positive commandment.
A man granting chalitza (separation ceremony for a woman bound for levirate marriage) to his [late] brother's wife, is Rabbinically forbidden to marry her relatives, even second degree relatives. Similarly, she is forbidden to his relatives. But his brothers are permitted to her relatives.   Note: Even if he performed chalitza out of doubt, he is still forbidden to all her relatives (Mordechai, beginning of chapter haCholetz).
A man is permitted to marry the sister or other relatives of the co-wife (tzara) to his [late] brother's wife to whom he had given chalitza. 
If is forbidden to marry the co-wife of any of the relatives to his [late] brother's wife to whom he had given chalitza.

Siman 163

A man who takes his [late] brother's wife in levirate marriage acquires the property of the dead man, and stands in his stead to take his share in the property of their father.   Note: Even if he divorced her immediately afterward (Nimukei Yosef, Chapter haCholetz), as long as the levirate marriage was [halachically] appropriate.   This applies only to property already in the dead brother's possession, e.g. if their father died first, and then the brother died before the father's estate was divided. But the rule does not apply to property destined for the dead brother, e.g. if the brother died [first] and then their father died.  Even with respect to property already in the dead brother's possession, the living brother takes only the capital value (at the time of the father's death), but if the property subsequently increased in value, the living brother does not take the dead brother's share in the increase, even that increase which took place after the levirate marriage and before division of the estate.  Note: Some say that anything which is considered to be destined property with regards to [the double inheritance of] a firstborn is also considered as destined property by levirate marriage (Rivash, chapter 470). And some say that a brother who took a levirate wife collects loans and other properties directly destined for his late brother, but not property destined for his (i.e. their) father, if the father had died after the brother (Mahariv chapter 41), but the first opinion seems primary.   
Someone who does chalitzah to his yavamah is considered just like one of the remaining brothers in regards to the inheritance.  If their father is still alive, he inherits everything; if their father is dead, the brothers split the [inheritance] between them.  Rem"a: And even if he wanted to do yibum but she didn't want to do yibum thus he did chalitzah to her, he still only has rights to the property like any other inheritor.  And even if before he did the chalitzah, the father seized the property and said, "consider me like the one who did the mitzvah of chalitzah first" and the brothers then joined {יצטרפו} together to force the chalitzah, do not remove the property from his hand (Mahari''k 73).  And all of this is the technical law, however, there is a subsequent ruling that the one who does chalitzah gets half of the property. See later on in siman 165.
[In the event that] a yavam does yibum within 30 days [of his brother's death] and a baby is then born at the end of nine months later, it is uncertain whether the child is a full-term [=nine months in utero] baby of the first husband[=the deceased brother] or whether he is a premature [=seven months in utero] baby of the second husband[=the yavam].  If this child of uncertain paternity claims [to inherit] the assets of the first husband since he can says that he's his son but the yavam responds "I should inherit from him since you're my son," the yavam and the son will split the assets; even if one of them is muchzak, the chazakah is not considered.  If the son dies before the division of assets, then they should be split between the grandfather[=father of the yavam and the deceased] and the yavam.  There are those that say that if the grandfather is still alive then the yavam takes everything.
[someone] questionable and sons of the brother-in-law [Yavam] whom came to share the properties of the deceased, he says: I'm the son of the deceased and would take everything, and they say: You are our brother and you have a part only as one of us, the share they admit is his - he'll take, and the rest they'll share and he'll take half and they ['ll take] half. and there's one saying, all properties they share equally, he [gets] a half and they [get] a half.
A doubtful [son] and the children of the yavam (levir) who come to divide the yavam's property after the yavam has divided the dead brother's property. And the doubtful son says: If I am your brother, give my my portion and that which I took from the dead brother's property with your father I will return it all, and if I am not your brother, give me back my father's property that your father took, they don't listen at all to his words. 
A doubtful [son] and a yavam who come to divide the property of the elderly one, and the doubtful one says, "I am the son of the dead man and I get to take half," we do not listen to him.
A doubtful [son] and children of the <i>yavam</i> who came to divide the property of the eldest one, and the doubtful one says, "I am the son of the dead man and I get to take half," but they say, "You are our brother and you only get one third," then the half which he agrees [should go] to them, they take, and the third that they agree [should go] to him, he takes, and the sixth which remains, they divide. He takes half [of the sixth = 1/12] and they take half [of the sixth = 1/12].
The eldest one and the <i>yavam</i> dividing the property of a doubtful [son] or a doubtful [son] and an eldest [dividing] the property of the <i>yavam</i>, they divide it [equally].

Siman 164

The sister-in-law shall not do <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage until it will have been ninety days from the death of [her] husband, exclusive of [both] the day of death and the day of <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage. If [her brother-in-law] did effect levirate marriage or <i>chalitsah</i> during this period, and she does not turn out to be pregnant, she is thereby exempted and needs nothing [further]; however, she shall not marry another, even though she did <i>chalitsah</i>, until ninety days from [her] husband's death are complete. If the brother-in-law dies within the ninety days or after them, some say she must wait ninety days after her death. If there were two brothers-in-law and one of them died, she is permitted to effect levirate marriage with the second within ninety days of the [other] one's death. Comment: And some say that any [case in which] she did <i>chalitsah</i> within three months -- whether she turns out to be pregnant and miscarries or does not turn out to be pregnant -- it is an invalid <i>chalitsah</i> and she requires another <i>chalitsah</i> from all [her husband's] brothers (Hagahot Mordekhai, end of Gittin). See also later, chapter 170 paragraph 5.
[Suppose] someone does <i>chalitsah</i> to his sister-in-law and she turns out to be pregnant and gives birth. If the [new]born is viable, [then] the <i>chalitsah</i> is nothing: [the brother-in-law] is permitted to [his sister-in-law's] relatives and did not invalidate her from the priesthood. If she miscarried or gave birth but [the baby] did not live thirty days, [then] she requires another <i>chalitsah</i>, for <i>chalitsah</i> of a pregnant woman is not named "<i>chalitsah</i>": he or one of the other brothers does <i>chalitsah</i> to her. And some say that he should not do <i>chalitsah</i> to her; rather, one of the other brothers [should] (Tur, in the name of Rosh).
Intercourse with someone pregnant is also not named "intercourse". Therefore, someone who married or did <i>chalitsah</i> to his sister-in-law within three months, and she has a co-[widow], [the latter] should not marry until the [other] gives birth, lest she miscarry and the intercourse or <i>chalitsah</i> will not have been anything, [for] a [new]born does not exempt until he exits into the world's atmosphere.
The sister-in-law shall not effect levirate marriage during the time of her <i>niddah</i> [impurity], but [can] do <i>chalitsah</i>. If [the brother-in-law] transgressed [this] and effected levirate marriage and had intercourse with her during the time of her <i>niddah</i> [impurity], he acquired her.
One who enters his yibbum and it turns out she is pregnant, they separate them and wait on her. If she has a miscarriage, the [yibbum] goes back and is upheld. <i> Rem"a: Some say this is specifically when he enters before he perceived the pregnancy, but if he entered her having already perceived the pregnancy he must be made to leave her even if she miscarriages (N"Y Perek Hacholetz). And in the case the yibbum is upheld [as the Shulchan Aruch discusses], he needs to have the sexual intercourse again, for sex with a pregnant woman is not considered sex (B"Y in the name of Rabbeinu Yerucham). If if wants to leave her [before that second sexual act] she needs [both] a bill of divorce and chalitza.</i>
A fetus that does not have complete signs [indicating life] and he was not [born at] full term, is called a "nefel" [a baby assumed to die]. And if the fetus was born with completed signs but it is not known whether he was [born] full term, even if he died on the day he was born, she goes out with a bill of divorce and does chalitza to her, and afterwards she will be permitted to others. If the fetus survives thirty days after it was born <i> Rem"a: or it was born full term (HM"M) </i> that is a fetus [assumed] to continue [to live], and she does not need a bill of divorce from him, for she is an erva [improper relationship] toward him.
If she gave birth to an viable child six months after she had yibbum, this child is doubtful nine months to the first or seven months to the second. Therefore, she goes out with a get and the child is valid. And if he has relations with her after she gives birth and she gets pregnant and gives birth, that child is a doubtful mamzer. 
Any yevama who is Rabbinnicaly doubtfully encumbered to her yavam, such as a yevama who gave birth to a baby and it is unknown if his months are complete (7 months) and he died on or before his 30th day, about whom the Sages said to perform chalitza due to a rabbinic doubt (if she needs yibur), if she went and became betrothed or married to another man without performing chaluzta, her yavam performs chalizta and she may remain with her husband.  If she married a Kohen, who is forbidden to a woman who performed chalizta, the yavam does not perform chalizta with her, because we will not forbid her to her husband based on a Rabbinic doubt.  Rama: Similarly if the yavam is not present she does not have to leave her non-Kohen husband, and she is permitted to remain with her husband since she already married him (Ri Mintz).  If her Kohen husband divorced her or died, she must a priori perform chalitza, and after that she may remarry.

Siman 165

The <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>yibum</i> comes before the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>chalitzah</i>. And if she does not want to do <i>yibum</i> with another one of his [her husband's] brothers, or with the eldest who wants to do <i>yibum</i>, but without a satisfactory claim, she is considered rebellious. There are those who say that the <i>mitvah</i> of <i>chalitzah</i> is more important. The Rem"a comments: She is not considered rebellious if she does not want to perform <i>yibum</i>. Nevertheless, we do not force him to do <i>chalitzah</i>, rather they try to trick him if they are able to, for example that they say to him: do <i>chalitzah</i> on the condition that she give you a <i>maneh</i> [a coin equal to 100 <i>zuz</i>] (Tur in the name of Rabeinu Tam and the Ros"h). Specifically, if they are not among those who force him to divorce her, like was explained earlier in siman 154). If the two of them want to do <i>yibum</i>, we do not allow them to unless it is known that they both have intention to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> (Tur in the name of Rabeinu Tam). Some say that if he has another wife, we force him and pressure him until he does <i>chalitzah</i> (Tur in the name of the Sma"g). There are those who say that even if he doesn't have another wife, if the intention isn't for a <i>mitzvah</i>, and she does not want to do <i>yibum</i>, and they are not able to trick him, they force him to do <i>chalitzah</i>. The custom like the first opinion, that we do not force <i>chalitzah</i> at all, even if we know that his intentions are for money (Maharim Padvoah siman 18). But we appease between them like the communal institutions, like explained below. All this is when he wanys to perform <i>yibum</i>, and it is possible to do <i>yibum</i> without worrying about it being forbidden. But if he says he wants to do neither <i>yibum</i> nor <i>chalitzah</i>, we force him (Beit Yoseif in the name of Rabeinu Tam). Specifically, when she came with a reasonable claim, like explained in siman 154 (Truma Hadeshen siman 220). However, if it is possible to make him make a mistake by saying to him, take a lot of money for the <i>chalitzah</i>, we make him make a mistake so we don’t need to force him (N”Y M”K). They should be careful so they don’t plant money in the hands of a third person, because then they cannot say to him: we were just kidding with you (Mordechai Perek Hacholeitz). See later on siman 169 seif 50). 
A <i>yivamah</i> who vowed [that she would not] receive benefit from her <i>yibum</i> while her husband was still alive, or she vowed [not to] receive benefit from all Jews, they force him [the <i>yibum</i>] to perform<i>chalitsah</i>. And if she vowed after her husband's death, they request that he perform <i>chalitsah</i>. So too if she intentionally took the vow, even while her husband was still alive, so that he [the <i>yibum</i>] would not perform <i>yibum</i> with her, they request him to perform <i>chalitsah</i>. Rem"a: If her <i>yibum</i> was a kohen and she went and married someone else so that he would be unable to perform <i>yibum</i>, her status is as one who vowed from receiving benefit from him. Nevertheless, they do not force him to perform <i>chalitsah</i>, since she caused herself to be forbidden to him (Responsa of the Rashba 820). Some say that if she spit before the brothers so something similar, and caused herself to be forbidden to do <i>yibum</i>, she is not considered rebellious since she cannot perform the <i>yibum</i> now (Rashba 1202). It was already explained nearby that all these distinctions are according to the one who says the Mitzvah of <i>yibum</i> precedes, but according to the one who says the Mitzvah of <i>chalitsah</i> precedes, she would not be considered rebellious at all if she does not want to perform the <i>yibum</i>
If a <i>Yivama</i>  claims that the <i>Yibum</i> should perform <i>Chalitsah</i> but she does not want to [perform <i>Chalitsah</i>] but wants to remain an <i>Agunah</i> [a 'chained' woman who cannot freely marry], we don't listen to her, even if the <i>Yibum</i> is married. Rem"a: and she has the law of a rebellious [wife], which is explained in <i>Siman</i> 77
Any woman who is required to perform halitza and not levirate marriage receives her Ketubah (Rema: and her clothing needs are evaluated like those of a widow).  Similarly, if her brother-in-law has is afflicted with boils or any of the other male defect described in (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 164), he must perform halitza and,  she receives her Ketubah.  Even if her husband exhibited the same defects, she can say, "I was able to tolerate this for your brother; I cannot tolerate it for you."  Rem"a: The same law applies for the view that says that halitza is the first resort, even though we do not coerce him to perform halitza, he must give her the Ketubah immediately, as she is considered to have already undergone halitza.  All of this is the law, but some locales passed an rule that if the two parties agree to perform halitza they will split the estate, even if the half is not sufficient to cover the Ketubah.  We subtractI any amount that she spent during while her husband was alive, and she must take on oath [on that amount], unless they agreed that they would be no oath.  Anything that he gave away as a deathbed gift is not subtracted from her portion.  The half that the heirs of the husband are entitled to is taken by the one performing halitza, and his father and other brothers have no claim to it.  Even if they seized assets, we retrieve them form their hands.  The primary purpose of this rule was to make them amenable to performing halitza, and the one performing the halitza is therefore the primary subject.  Even if the other brothers wish to divide [the estate] with the eldest brother, and they say that they wish to perform halitza, we do not listen to them if the eldest [also] wishes to perform halitza.  All of this is true if half of the estate is insufficient to cover the Ketubah, bacause she certainly cannot take more than the Ketubah.  There are other authoritative views about community rules, therefore the practice is to compromise with them.  Even if she has a contract that binds them to perform halitza, she still must compromise with them for some monetary amount, unless they explicitly stated that they would perform halitza without payment.
If she developed blemishes when she was bound for <i>yibum</i>, if he does not want to do <i>yibum</i>, she does <i>chalitzah</i>, and he gives her a <i>ketubah</i>.

Siman 166

A yevama (widow subject to levirate marriage) goes [to court] according to the place of the yavam (living brother of her husband), and the court advises them appropriately, whether to consummate levirate marriage or to undergo chalitza (ceremony to break levirate bond).  Rama: This rule applies when the yavam is in his place of residence, and there is a court in town. But if he has traveled elsewhere, we do not force the widow to go after him (Nimukei Yosef, end of chapter Zeh Borer - Sanhedrin).  Similarly if he lives among Kuthites (non-Jews) or non-educated [Jews] who do not know the rules of chalitza, the judges are not required to go after him, but can force him to come to the place of assembly (court) and he frees his yevama (Hagahot Alfasi chapter Mitzvat Chalitza - Yevamot). 
According to the Torah, he doesn't need to marry her, rather "come unto her" (have relations). And the Rabbis decreed that he shouldn't "come unto her" until he marries her in front of witnesses, with money or document, and that's called Ma'amar. Ram"a: And if he marries her with a document, that's also called Ma'amar. And even if he gave to her a peruta and says to her, "Behold you are married to me with this and with my brother's marriage," behold [she] is married, since it's like a loan and a peruta (Riva"sh Siman 162). And she also needs the wedding canopy after the marriage, like 0ther woman. And he can do Ma'amar through an agent, like other marriages (ad loc Siman 1). And if he comes unto her without Ma'amar, he acquires her, and he doesn't have to redo and marry her, and we whip him rebellious lashes. Ram"a: And specifically when he comes unto her in front of witnesses.
We don't do Ma'amar with except with her consent. And a minor that was widowed from bethrotal, we only do Ma'amar with her with the consent of her father.
He writes her a <i>ketubah</i>, but the <i>yavam</i>'s possessions are not mortgaged to her, because her <i>ketubah</i> are on her first husband. And if her first husband did not have possessions, her <i>ketubah</i> is on the <i>yavam</i>.
A son is born from him, but the son does not need to be called the name of the brother who died [the first husband]. 
 ...
One who has relations with his <i>yevama</i>, whether by accident or for promiscuity, whether Kutim forced him onto his <i>yevama</i> against his will when he was hard, whether he did it on purpose and she by mistake or forced, whether she did it on purpose and he mistakenly or forced, whether she was awake or asleep, he acquired [married] her, even if they only started it.
What are the circumstances [above, that intercourse without intention to effect levirate marriage still do effect levirate marriage]? When he intended to have intercourse, even if he intended bestiality [but instead had intercourse with the yevama]. But if he did not intend to have intercourse at all, as when he was asleep or so drunk that he does not recognize his surroundings, or he intended to ejaculate on the wall and he instead ejaculated into the yevama, or he became erect for his wife, and then fell from the roof and impacted on the yevama, then he does not acquire the yevama. Similarly, if others inserted him into the yevama without erection, but with a soft member, he does not acquire. 
what is the source that negligent relations is an engagement? In Yevamot  [in the case] that she fell to him for Marriage. But If  she fell to him for the engagement, there are those that say this is not an acquiring [and does not give her legal status] to be a heir and she is impure and her marital vow is broken, there are those that say that this is the rule with relations out of wedlock. There are those that say that the one who comes to have relations needs to say the benediction: "Who has sanctified His commandments and commanded us about [relations] with a Yevamah" 

Siman 167

A youth younger than 9, his sexual intercourse is not [considered] anything [from a halachic standpoint]. From 9 years and one day and on, his sexual intercourse acquires through levirate marriage, as speech would for an adult [over 13]. And a woman normally cannot acquire anything. Therefore, if he marries a woman and dies, she is exempt from halitza and the levirate marriage.
A boy of 9 years and a day who has sexual intercourse for levirate marriage, cannot let her go through a divorce document, until he gets older [to 13] and then has sexual intercourse with her after that point. If he does not have sexual intercourse with her after that point, and he comes to let her go, she needs a divorce document and halitza. If he has sexual intercourse with her when he is a youth [younger than 3], and he dies before he gets older [to 13],  or he dies after he gets older [to 13] but he did not have sexual intercourse with her after that point, she does halitza and not levirate marriage.  And once he gets older [to 13], if he marries another [and he dies], and he has not [yet] has sexual intercourse for his levirate marriage after he got older [to 13], both [women] must do halitza, but not levirate marriage.
A youth does not do halitza until he is 13 years of age and one day, and they check him then that he has the two hairs [that determine Biblical maturity]. But if he he had two hairs before he got older [to 13], he is not considered an adult through [the hairs], but rather only if two other ahirs came after he got older. Nevertheless, if two hairs are found after he got older, we do not suspect perhaps they were there from before.
A girl ages 3 and a day and up, her sexual intercourse is considered such for anything [on a halachic level]. And if her levirate husband has sexual intercourse with her, she is acquired. But she cannot do halitza until she is 12 and a day years old, and they check her after that to find if she has two hairs [as a sign of maturity].
A youth boy who has sexual intercourse with his levirate wife who is a youth girl, they must grow older [to 13/12 respectively] together. And if he comes to divorce her before he gets older, he cannot, for the divorce document of a youth is not an [effective] divorce document.
A yevamah who had relations with the yavam and said within thirty days: I did not have relations. Even if he says: I did have relations, and I divorced her, we force him to perform halitzah with her, since he first divorced her with a get. But if he has not yet divorced her, we force him to have levirate marriage or to do halitzah and release her with a get. And even if he agrees with her that he didn't have relations, she requires a get and halitzah, for anyone who has been married is assumed to have had relations (Maggid Mishneh, ch. 2). If he divorced her after thirty days and she says: I didn't have relations, we ask him to perform halitzah with her. And if he agrees that he didn't have relations, we force him to perform halitzah.
If she says: I had relations and he says: I didn't have relations, she does not require halitzah, for he is not permitted to forbid her to any man once he has married her.
And there are those who say that within thirty days he is believed, and she requires halitzah with a get. 
And her rival wife, is always permitted even if both say that he didn't have relations with her, and even within thirty days. 
And there are those who say that for all thirty days he is believed to say I didn't have relations to forbid her rival wife (Tur in the name of the Rosh). 

Siman 168

When a man performs levirate marriage with his sister-in-law she is married to him in every respect; he ma divorce her a writ of divorce and subsequently remarry her.
If he divorced her and accepted her back before he paid her ketubbah to her, she is considered as any other woman who was divorced and subsequently remarried [to the same man], that is, she only has one Ketubah.
A yevamah, the responsibility for her ketubah is on her first husband's estate. Therefore, the yavam is not allowed to sell any of his brother's property. And if he sold or gave part away as a present, or divided some of the dead brother's property with the other brothers, whether before or after yibbum, he has done nothing. 
If his [dead] brother left produce still attached to the ground, it should be sold, and produce bought with the proceeds, and he eats the fruit. 
If he [died] and left produce detached from the ground or movable property, it should be sold and land bought with the proceeds and he will eat the fruit.
And the same is true if he left money. And even if he was liable to pay he brother money, they take it out of his hand, and land is bought with it, and he eats the fruit.
And there are those who says that when it comes to produce detached from the ground or movable property, or money, he can use them as he wishes.
And if it was written in the ketubah: Movable property based on the value of land, all agree that land should be purchased and he eats the produce.
Hagah: In any case, as long as he has not married her, we don't give him the money, rather we take all of the movable property and the coins from his hand and give them to the court or to a guardian. But land--he eats the fruit (Bet Yosef in the name of the Rashba). 
Property that is the hands of the yevamah, they take it from her and purchase with it land, and he eats the fruit. 
Even if he divorces her and marries her after with no condition, he cannot sell his brother's property, unless he made a stipulation with her at the time that he remarried her that the ketubah would be based on his own property. 
And without divorce, if she agrees to marry him on condition that he writes that responsibility for her ketubah will be on his property, then he can sell [his brother's property.]
A Yevamah that never had a Kesubah, or that the Kesuba was relinquished, receives the assets of his [her husband's] brother, and selling and giving what he likes, or when it will be nissan he will write for her a Kesuba with a portion [of his assets] ,And all his assets afterwards is like all the other women [who are married]
A yevam who does not have a marriage contract with her husband because they are not allowed to be married to each other, but she is permitted to her yavam, if the yavam wants to perform yibum with her she does not receive a marriage contract, just as she did not have one with her first husband.  And only if the first husband did not give her a contract, but it is forbidden to remain married to a woman without giving her a contract (MM in Ch.2).  Her status regarding additional provisions in the contract is just as she received from her first husband.  But if her husband did not write her a contract, [or she sold it] or she declined it, the yavam must write her a contract as all widows receive.  Rama: If her first husband had no assets, she receives a contract of 100 zuz from her second husband (the yavam) like any widow (Tur).  If she had sons with the yavam, if she has a contract against the property of the yavam, her daughters are also fed like the sons from that.  If she does not have a contract against his property, the daughters are not fed with the sons, nevertheless the widow is fed all the days she remains a widow (Ran Chapter Naara)

Siman 169

The mitzvah of halitzah (release from levirate marriage) is to be performed in front of three Jewish judges, who are not related to each other or to the levir (yavam) or to the woman subject to levirate marriage (yevamah). And even two married to the daughters of two brothers shouldn't be on the same court, but a second generation with a third generation is valid (Terumat Hadeshen, siman 226). And even if they are ordinary judges, as long as they know how to read out to the yavam and yevamah. And if she performed halitzah in front of ignoramuses who don't know how to read out, it is valid. 
[If] one of them is found to be related or invalid or a convert, [the <i>chalitsah</i> is] invalid. Even if his father was a convert and his mother an Israelite, [it is] invalid -- unless his father and mother are Israelites. And some say that if his father is an Israelite, [it is] valid (<i>Tur</i> in the name of the Great Book of <i>Mitsvot</i>). However, it is at any rate an invalid <i>chalitsah</i> to invalidate her to the brothers -- even [if done just] between him and her. Comment: Some say that it is forbidden to take pay for <i>chalitsah</i>, because, whoever takes pay to judge, his judgements are nullified (<i>Ri Mintz</i> and [?]); and so seems [correct] to me. At <i>chalitsah</i> ceremonies, one must be cautious that someone who takes pay not sit among the three judges who are sitting to effect the <i>chalitsah</i>, for we require a court that is valid according to [the law] of the Torah. See, in <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> chapter 9, what pay a judge is permitted to accept; but even for this, it seems to me [correct] to be strict if he takes pay for the <i>chalitsah</i>, because of the appearance to the eye, like we are strict about relatives and other matters regarding a court for <i>chalitsah</i> more than regarding another court. And I have seen and heard [cases] wherein a rabbi takes much pay for <i>chalitsah</i> and supports himself [in this position] on [the fact] that he sells him the sandal of <i>chalitsah</i>; this is a great leniency, in my view, and someone who takes care of his soul should distance himself from this. This is not similar to [the fact] that the witnesses of the bill [of divorce] take pay, for the reason I wrote above [in] chapter 130, and the rabbi who orchestrates the bill, as I wrote above in the agenda of the bill [of divorce], paragraph 4, for those reasons are not relevant to <i>chalitsah</i> (all this is his own view).
Ideally, it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to add on two in addition to the three, even if the two are ignorant people. If they did <i>chalitsah</i> with three the <i>chalitsah</i> is valid (Tur). These two that they added, they should not be relatives or invalid. Specifically ideally, but after the fact, it is kosher (Beit Yoseif).
The judges ideally need to set a place to be able to say, "let us go to such and such a place to do the <i>chalitsah</i>." However, if they did the <i>chalitsah</i> without designating a place, it is valid (Tur in the name of the Rambam).
They should set a place that day. Some say, they should set it the day before.
<i>Chalitsah</i> is only valid if done during the day. If the <i>chalitsah</i> was done at night, the <i>chalitsah</i> is invalid.
<i>Chalitsah</i> should not be performed on Shabbos or holidays. However, on Chol HaMoed, it is better. Some say that <i>chalitsah</i> should not be performed on Friday or the day before a holiday, and this is our practice.
It is needed to know that [the individual preforming the levirate marriage is the] brother of the deceased, and was in the world, and this is the wife of the deceased; And Even if only one witness is there to testify about them [the deceased and widow's former marriage], or even if it [the wittness] is a relative, woman, slave, maidservant or a minor- the testimony is recognized and [is deemed] true, it [the testimony] is believed [even] with this.
The judges need to know that ninety days passed from when the husband died, minus the day he died and the day they are performing the <i>chalitsah</i>.
They need to know that the <i>yavam</i> is 13 years old and one day and the <i>yevama</i> is 12 years old and one day, and that they grew two [pubic] hairs after reaching these times. And if the <i>yevama</i> has large breasts, there is no need to check about the hairs. So too if the <i>yavam</i> has a full beard, there is no need to check about the hairs. The laws of two hairs and their checking is found in Even HaEzer 155:15.
We do not really upon the word of relatives or that of women in establishing the age, rather only the testimony of valid witnesses. But there are those who say that if his age is established by neighbors, and not the father, or if there is a rumor that he has arrived at the appropriate age, then they are relied upon to establish his majority age, if they have checked him and found two pubic hairs, Rem"a: but we do not rely upon there opinions if they say that he has gone up to the Torah or led services (Mordechai: Chapter Mitzvat Halitsa). And, even without the opinions of the neighbors, if he has many hairs, or if they are long as is normal for an older man or woman, it is establish that he has arrived at the appropriate age and may, therefore, do halitsa. We rely upon this and do not check if there are mounds of hair since there are many or if they are long. If their height is tall we can rely upon that to establish that they are of majority age even if they only have two hairs. Rem"a: If the widow has sons then they are like signs (of her majority age.) (Mordechai's additions to Tractate Yevamot.) 
The judges sit as is it is necessary to sit in judgement, and the <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i> stand before them, since the Mitzvah of <i>chalitsah</i> is ideally done standing. Rem"a: But after the fact, if the <i>chalitsah</i> was done sitting, it is valid (Tur). So too an ill person who is unable to stand is able to do <i>chalitsah</i> sitting, since anything which has no fix is important after the fact (Piskei Mahari Siman 190). And see later Seif 64 for the specific order of the <i>chalitsah</i>.
Once the Yavam [person obligated to perform the levirate marriage] has agreed to perform halitza, he is to be instructed to nullify all declarations he has made, such as ones regarding [the granting of a] divorce; for if he has already made a declaration, the halitza is invalid.  Gloss: And also if he was coerced to perform halitza, the law is like in the case of a divorce. See earlier clause 134. And even though there are those who say [performing] halitza is preferable [to Yibum], and thus coercion is justified, even so one should not coerce except in the situations we have enumerated in clause 165.
Preferably, the shoe used for halitza should be given to the Yabam as a gift. There are those who say he should walk in it a bit so that it looks like it belongs to him. But if it was not given to him [as a gift], it is valid.
The shoe must be entirely of leather.  Therefore, [the shoemaker] must ideally sew <i> all of its seams</i> with leather. <i> And that is our practice; and some [authorities] invalidate it even after the fact (Tur in the name of the RM"H), contrary to the opinion that since nowadays all shoes are sewn with flax, [the shoe for chalitza] must also be sewn with flax ([this opinion is] in the writings of R"Y Mintz in the name of R' Shmarya) </i>. But its straps do not need to be of leather. <i> And some authorities say that the straps also need to be of leather (Nimukei Yosef), and that is our practice.</i>
There are those who say that from the outset [the shoe] should be made from leather of a clean animal. The strips and the hooks also in it [must be clean], and also the strips of the sewing...(continue)
Some say that apriori it should be made from the skin of a kosher animal. Same for the lashes and hooks and sawing strings (as is written in the book of Rabbai Margalyot) and such is the custom. 
There will be two straps on it to tie with them, one on each side. There are those that say that the straps should be white. And also the straps of sewing should be white. But the rest comment that it should be all black on the outside (compilations of the Mordechai on Yevamot), and so is the practice. But regarding the inside [of the straps], there's no need to be concerned with this. And if the straps become blackened due to age, there is no need to be stringent (rulings of the Mahari, sign 205), and so is the practice. And the straps should be long, so that you can double each strap twice [when tying] (Kol Bo).

















If she tears the shoe off of his leg, or if she burns it, unfit. 
If he is wearing two shoes [in layers one on top of the other], and she removes the outer shoe, even though she tore the bottom one to the point where his leg was exposed, the chalitzah is invalid. But if she removes both of them [i.e. the shoes], the chalitzah is valid. (Tur)
She stands opposite the levir, and she spits on the ground opposite the face of the levir, the spit that is visible to the judges as it goes out from her mouth that reaches the area in front of the levir.  But if the judges to not see when the spit goes out of her mouth, [still] valid.
If she spit, and the wind caught it before it reached opposite his face, like a case where she is taller than him, then she needs to spit another time. But, [if the wind catches it] after the spit reaches opposite his face, even if it did not reach the ground, valid. Therefore, if he is tall and she is short, we apply the verse better "in his face." (Devarim 25:9):
The childless widow awaiting marriage who spits blood, she does not need to spit another time. But some say this specially applies when she sucks, because it is impossible for her to do this without cleaning the spit.
If she ate sesame or cress, or something like that, from things that increase saliva, and the spit flows from her mouth, it is nothing. And it customary to prevent her from eating anything. And so too to drink, and she minimizes speaking, so that the spit will come from itself. Also she should not poke at her teeth, so that she will not spit blood.
After so, [the group will] teach her [the following words while he is] standing, "So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brother’s house. And his name shall be called in Israel The house of him that had his shoe loosed " (Deuteronomy 25:9-10). It is a commandment to all present to say "Shoe loosed" three times, and there are there are those who say that the childless widow awaiting Levirate marriage also says so. 
This is the order of the Chalitsah: She reads "My brother-in-law has refused" (Devarim 25:7), and he reads "I do not desire to take her" (Devarim 25:8), and she removes [the shoe], and she spits, and she reads "so will be done to the man" (Devarim 25:9-10), but the order does not impinge [on the validity of the ceremony]. Moreover, even if she did not read or spit but only removed [the shoe], the Chalitsah is valid. When is this the case? when they are able to speak, such that they are fit to read. But if either the man or the woman is mute or the woman is a minor, they don't perform Chalitsah, and if they did, their Chalitsah is invalid. This is different than the case if the man is mentally disabled or a minor, in which case they have accomplished nothing, such that she is not invalidated to the brothers and can perform Yibum or not. Some say that this is also the rule for Chalitsah where either the man or woman is deaf that it is nothing. And some say that their Chalitsah is invalid, like with a mute man or woman.
The brother-in-law and the sister-in-law have to have the intention that she will be permitted to an outsider through this Chalitsah. If he intends but she does not, or she does but he does not, she is not permitted [to an outsider]; but it is an invalid Chalitsah [sufficiently] to invalidate her to the brothers. Therefore, a sister-in-law that grew up among the brothers, and we have seen that she removed one of their shoes, she is forbidden to perform Yibum, lest they intended it for the purpose of Chalitsah, and she needs a valid Chalitsah to permit her to an outsider; but as long as we have not seen her remove [the shoe] of one of them, she is permitted to perform Yibum, and we do not suspect that she may have removed [a shoe].
And therefore, if she spits in front of the brother of her deceased husband, she annuls the Yibum.  And there are those who say that if she spits blood without saliva mixed in she does not annul the Yibum. 
There are those who hold that one must be careful that the yevama does not spit in front of the yavam before performing halitza, so that the halitza does not become invalid and require her to return [and do it again] with all of the brothers. 
If she [the yavama] only read the declaration [but did not perform the halitza act itself], she is not yet disqualified from the yibum process.
A blind person should not, ab initio, perform chalitza. But if he did perform chalitza, his chalitza was kosher.  There is an opinion that if there isn't another brother [who could potentially perform the chalitza], then the blind brother may perform the chalitza ab initio, [Remah:] such that the widow not fall into the position of an agunah.  Also note that one is not called "blind" unless [blind in] both eyes.
A k'tana [pre-pubescent girl] who performed chalitza to an adult male - her chalitza is considered disqualified, and she is further disqualified from performing chalitza with any of the other brothers. [Remah:] Once she grows up, she may perform chalitza with one of the brothers, and needn't do it again with the other brothers.
A male who mistakenly performs chalitza, in a case like the following: others say to him, "Perform Chalitza with this woman, on the condition that she will pay you 200 zuz"; this chalitza is kosher, even if she gives him nothing, and even if the oath were doubled. [Remah] And even if he said to her at the moment of chalitza: "[I'm doing this] on the condition that you don't marry someone else," and the oath is doubled, it is still unenforceable. Even though the chalitza is kosher even if she doesn't give him the money, nevertheless she is obligated to give it to him, similarly to any case where money is promised in exchange for performing a service.  However, if she has a legitimate claim why she doesn't desire him - he isn't fit for her in some way - and he is considered obligated to perform chalitza and yet doesn't want to, and furthermore the court fools him into performing chalitza under the auspices that she will pay him; in such a case she needn't pay him anything. [Remah] But if she did pay him the money, she can't ask him to return it.
If  they said to him: "do halitza and thereby you will have married her," or if they said to them: "do halitza because it is a  mitzvah and you  don't  lose anything by it, and if you  wish, afterwards you can do levirate marriage..." or similar things, it is not considered halitza that permits her to other men. Since he did not intend to permit her. But this is sufficient to disqualify her from levirate marriage and we force, even half-wits, to do halitza and the halitza is effective.
In the case that they said to him: This woman does not wish to be wed to you via yibbum, so perform halitza for her and remove the levirate bond from her and she will marry you in the normal manner, there are those who say this is a valid halitza.
The rule in regard to compelled halitza, be it by a Jew or a non-Jew, is the same as regards a compelled bill of divorce, as is explained in section 134. REMA: See above in this section paragraph 13.
If one expressed doubts about the [validity] of the halitza [it is not considered a] negated halitza but rather [it is considered] an invalid halitza.
Invalid halitza invalidates the widow from all the brothers and invalidates her from marrying a cohen and forbids the brothers from all of her close relations and she is not allowed to marry out of the brothers' family until you has performed a valid halitza. If she transgressed and married out of the family before she had done halitza: we perform for her a valid halitza and she stays with her [new] husband and she is not caused to leave him, but, nonetheless we seclude her from her husband until the brother in law does the halitza.
After she has had halitza the court writes that she had halitza in from of them in a bill of halitza. And, if they did not write it for her, any two [men] that saw the halitza can write it, even if they don't know the woman or the man; for the court would not have allowed the ceremony in front of them had they not recognized them. [The bill of halitza] must have lines scored into the parchment because of the verses that are in it. REMA: And see below in the comments on the Order of Writing the Bill in paragraph 35. ([I] the Editor say: here too in the Order of Halitza in all places where the source of a comment is not mentioned it is to be assumed that they take from the Sedarim and specifically from the Seder (Order) of Mahari Margaliot.)

Siman 170

A yevama (widow waiting for yibum [a levirate marriage to be performed]) who has received a bill of divorce from the yavam (brother of deceased who must perform levirate marriage), is forbidden on a Rabbinic level from wedding her yavam, and [receipt of this bill of divorce] invalidates her co-wives to the yavam and to the other brothers on a Rabbinic level. All bills of divorce which would invalidate a man's wife from marrying a priest [i.e. the document constitutes a valid divorce], also invalidates a yavama from the performance of yibum [if given to her by the yavam].  And the yavama is not permitted to marry a zar (a non-brother) until the yavam performs chalizta (the ceremony thereby permitting her to marry a non-brother).
So, too, statement (an explanation: a sister-in-law is acquired, by Torah [law], through intercourse, nothing else, but the sages amended that he must betroth her first, and this is called "statement", the explanation [of which is] "the sages' statement") does not acquire in her a complete acquisition: for if he wishes to divorce her after the statement she needs [both] a bill [of divorce] for the statement and <i>chalitsah</i> to release the connection.
Since statement doesn't acquire a complete acquisition, and a bill [of divorce] doesn't divorce a complete divorce, therefore the action done thereafter works -- whether bill [of divorce] after bill [of divorce]; or whether statement after statement; or bill [of divorce] or <i>chalitsah</i> or intercourse after statement; or statement or intercourse or <i>chalitsah</i> after a bill [of divorce] -- whether with one brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law, or with one sister-in-law and two brothers-in-law, or with two sisters-in-law and two brothers-in-law.
How? A brother-in-law who gave a bill [of divorce] to his sister-in-law, and thereafter gave a bill [of divorce] to her co-wife, is barred from the relatives of both of them. Or: Two brothers-in-law who both gave bill[s of divorce] to one sister-in-law, one after the other, both are barred from her relatives. Or: Two brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law, [such that] each [of the former] gave a bill [of divorce] to one [of the latter] -- each [of the brothers-in-law] is barred from the relatives of the one to whom he gave a bill [of divorce].
When they come to release her, according to the opinion that halitsa is invalid she must seek out each of the brothers. In a case of two brothers and one potential yivama, she requires halitsa from each of them. There are those that say that it is the same in a case of one brother and two potential yivamot who each received a bill of divorce, nonetheless both require halitsa. According to the opinion that halitsa is ineffective she needn't seek out each of the brothers, even in the case of two brothers and one yivama, halitsa with one would be adequate. Rem"a: The Rosh, ob"m agreed with this. In the case where the halitsa was ineffective and she must return, that is when she was outright entitled and then was made unfit, for her claim was weakened. But halitsa that was unfit from the outset, she needn't go back..
There is also a case of [rabbinic engagement via] speech which comes after another event of [rabbinic engagement via] speech, for if one did [rabbinic engagement via] speech with one [woman] and then with another, or brothers who did [rabbinic engagement via] speech with one and then with her co-wife, each one of them requires a bill of divorce for each [rabbinic engagement via] speech and halitsa for one of them to exempt them both. So, too, if one did [rabbinic engagement via] speech with one woman and then gave her a bill of divorce or did halitsa with her or her co-wife or had sexual relations with her co-wife or after his [rabbinic engagement via] speech his brother gave her a bill of divorce or did halitsa with her or her co-wife or he had relations with her or her co-wife; that which transpired after the [rabbinic engagement via] speech is enough to prohibit the one who did the [rabbinic engagement via] speech. [It is also effective] in forbidding him to her close relations by means of the actions which took place after the [rabbinic engagement via] speech, and to require a bill of divorce for the [rabbinic engagement via] speech or sexual relations which took place after it. 
This was their enactment: if one [engaged a woman via] speech and then gave her a bill of divorce, she still needs halitsa. If he [engaged her via] speech and then did halitsa, she still needs a bill of divorce. If he [engaged via] speech with one co-wife and gave a bill of divorce to another, he must give a bill of divorce to the one he [engaged via] speech and he or his brother must do halitsa with one of them and this exempts the other. And there are those that say that both of them require halitsa. 
If one [engaged via] speech one woman and then he or his brother had sexual relations with another, the one who was [engaged via] speech needs a bill of divorce and so too the second one needs a bill of divorce and one of them requires halitsa.
And so too if he gave her a bill of divorce and then later on had sexual relations with her or [engaged her via] speech or with her co-wife or did halitsa with her co-wife or after his bill of divorce his brother [engaged her via] speech or had sexual relations with her or did halitsa with her or with her co-wife, that which occurred after the bill of divorce is effective in forbidding him to her relations and to require a bill of divorce for the [engagement via] speech that happened after it. 
This was their enactment: if he gave her a bill of divorce and then afterward he had sexual relations with her or [engaged her via] speech, she needs a bill of divorce and halitsa.
If he gave her a bill of divorce, and afterward he or his brother had sexual relations with her co-wife, or [engaged her via] speech, that [brother] who had sexual relations with her or who [engaged her via] speech, requires a bill of divorce, and halitsa is required for one of them to exempt them both. 
Sexual relations affect an absolute acquisition, so too, halitsa affects an absolute rejection. Therefore, any action which was undertaken after them is ineffective, neither to render [a woman] unfit nor to render him unfit to her relations. How so? A man had relations with his levirate wife, and then he or his brother came and did halitsa with her or her co-wife, this halitsa is meaningless. So too, if his brother came along and gave a bill of divorce to her or her co-wife, it is meaningless. So too if he came back and [engaged her via] speech or had sexual relations with her, it is meaningless. But, if he or his brother had sexual relations with her co-wife, or [engaged her via] speech, she requires a bill of divorce. 
So too, if he did halitsa with his brother's widow, and then he or his brother came along and did halitsa with her co-wife, this [second] halitsa is meaningless in regard to prohibiting him to her close relations. Or in the case of two brothers who did halitsa with one widow, one after another, the second halitsa is meaningless, and he is permitted to her close relations. But, if after he did halitsa with his brother's widow, he had sexual relations with her, or he or his brother's married her or her co-wife, the marriage was valid and she requires a bill of divorce, this is the case whether he just married her or whether he married her for the sake of levirate marriage, such as, if he said to her, "Behold thou art sanctified unto me for the sake of the benefit of levirate marriage." 
In regard to the fact that no actions are effective after sexual relations, this is only in the case of kosher sexual relations where there was no action (speech, bill of divorce, etc...) that preceded. But improper relations, for example: if one gave a bill of divorce to this one [a co-wife] and had relations with this one [another co-wife], or if one did [engagement via] speech with one and had relations with the other, then actions undertaken after (the sexual relations) are effective; if he, or his brother were to do halitsa with a third co-wife, they would all be forbidden to the close relations of the halitsa, and a bill of divorce would not be effective for she would still have a claim. But halitsa, even if it is improper, such as if there were actions which preceded it, for example: if he gave a bill of divorce to one or [engaged via] speech another, and then did halitsa with her or her co-wife, nonetheless in this case nothing is effective after it, i.e. if he or his brother came along and did halitsa with her or her co-wife; but, if he had sexual relations with her or married her, this would be effective.
If one made a verbal declaration to his brother's widow and then afterwords gave her a bill of divorce for her levirate association, she has been invalidated [as a wife] for him and for all his brothers and she requires a bill of divorce for the verbal declaration and haltitza for the levirate association. 
Sexual relations with a nine year old are equivalent to [engagement via] speech with a man of majority age. Therefore, if he had relations with his brother's widow, he has rendered her unfit for all his brothers. And, if after he (the minor) had relations with her his older brother came along and had relations with her or her co-wife, or [engaged her via] speech or gave her a bill of divorce or did halitsa with her or one of her co-wives, she has now been rendered unfit to the minor. And so too, if the minor came along and had relations with a co-wife, or if his brother of nine years of age had relations with her or her co-wife; she has been rendered unfit to him as is the law with [engagement via] speech after [engagement via] speech. So too if the brother of majority age did [engagement via] speech with his brother's widow, and then the nine year old came along and had relations with her or her co-wife,  she is rendered unfit as in the case of [engagement via] speech after [engagement via] speech. The [engagement via] speech of a nine year old is not accounted as that of a man of majority age, and it is not effective, except in the first case (i.e. not to render the situation unfit), and not as the second one. How is this? A minor does [engagement via] speech, this is effective to render her unfit for the other brothers. But, if the older brother did [engagement via] speech, and then the nine year old came along and did [engagement via] speech with her or her co-wife, this is not effective in rendering her forbidden to his older brother. But [engagement via] speech of a nine year after [engagement via] speech of a nine year old - there are those that say that it is effective since the first one was nine years old. In regard to bills of divorce and halitsa - there is nothing to them by a nine year old, neither at the beginning or at the end. 
If a man of majority age did [engagement via] speech with his brother's widow or gave her a bill of divorce and she has a co-wife, when he comes to do halitsa with one of them to permit them (to others), the halitsa of the one who received the bill of divorce or the one who was [engaged via] speech is ineffective in regard to the co-wife. But the halitsa of the co-wife exempts the holder of the bill of divorce completely, and the one who was [engaged via] speech is exempt from halitsa, and she requires another bill of divorce from her [engagement via] speech. And if her had done [engagement via] speech with this one and given a bill of divorce to the other one, he may do halitsa with whomever he wishes and thereby exempt the other one, as we shall explain. 
Someone to whom two yevamot from one house (i.e. one husband) fell for consideration of levirate marriage, one is forbidden to the yavam as a secondary (i.e. Rabbinic) incestuous relation, and the other is permitted for levirate marriage, if he elects to perform levirate marriage, he does so with the permitted woman, and if he elects to perform chalitza, he does so with the woman forbidden as a secondary incestuous relation.  There is one sage who says that if performed chalitza with the forbidden woman, her (permitted) co-wife is not thereby released (for general marriage), but if he performed chalitza with the permitted woman, then the forbidden (to him) woman is released (for general marriage). 
If many widows come from one home, once he has had appropriate sexual relations with one of them, or did an effective halitsa, they have all been exempted and the rights of the brother have been removed from them. But if he had improper sexual relations with one of them, or did [engagement via] speech that was ineffective, they are all forbidden to the brother, and the one who he had relations with or whom he [engaged via speech] requires a bill of divorce, and all of them require halitsa to permit them to a non-family member, for the right of the brother is not removed with inferior sexual relations. If one of them had inferior halitsa, the one who did halitsa is permitted to non-family members, but her co-wife is forbidden until she too does halitsa, or until all the brothers to halitsa with the one who had inferior halitsa, for inferior halitsa does not remove the obligation of the brother from this household, until she has gone to all the brothers, or until she has done halitsa with each of them. This is the opinion of the Rambam (2:118:2), and many argue against him as is expressed in the words of the Tur.
Two brothers who did levirate marriage with two co-wives who came from the same house and neither knows who did the levirate marriage first, both of them must divorce with a bill of divorce, and they will be permitted to non-family members, and forbidden to brothers. Therefore, Reuven who had two wives, one in Acco and one in Tzur, and Shimon and Levi, his brothers, one in Acco and one in Tzur, who heard that Reuven died, should not do the levirate marriage until they know what their brother has done. If one of them went ahead and did levirate marriage, we do not force them apart until we establish that his brother did levirate marriage first. 

Siman 171

A man who was married to an orphan of minor age (note: who was married off by her brother or mother, and whose marriage is valid by Rabbinical decree) and a deaf woman (whose marriage is also only valid by Rabbinical ruling) and he died, and the women have fallen to his brother for possible levirate marriage, consummation of levirate marriage with one of these (Rabbinically married) women does not free her co-wife from levirate bonds.  What is their resolution? We instruct the minor to reject him (annul  the marriage), and the brother marries the deaf woman.  If he wants to divorce her, he writes a divorce after consummating the marriage, and she is then permitted to a stranger. 
If both wives were deaf or both were minors, consummation of levirate marriage with one frees her co-wife [from levirate bonds]. 
If one wife was of majority age, and the other was a minor, consummation of levirate marriage or chalitza (ceremony severing the levirate bond) with the adult  wife frees the minor [from levirate bond], but consummation of levirate marriage with the minor does not free the adult wife. 
If one wife was wise (of sound mind), and the other wife was deaf, consummation of levirate marriage or chalitza with the wise wife frees the deaf wife from levirate bond, but consummation of levirate marriage with the deaf wife does not free the wise wife. 
If both [wives] were minors, and the living brother consummated levirate marriage with one of them, and then he or another brother had sexual relations with the second [minor wife], this did not invalidate the levirate marriage of the first, but he is forbidden to stay with the second.  Therefore we instruct the second to reject (annul) her marriage, and he upholds marriage with the first. 
Similarly, if both were deaf, sexual relations with the second woman do not invalidate [the levirate marriage to] the first; the second woman is forbidden to him, and he should divorce her with a get. 
A minor girl and a deaf girl, when the levir first has relations with the minor and then he or his brother has relations with the deaf girl, he has not disqualified the minor, and the deaf girl requires a get. For relations with a minor is has greater legal consequences than relations with a deaf girl, for the minor will be fit for marriage after some time. Therefore, he should uphold the minor who had relations first. 
If he had relations with the deaf girl, and then he or his brother had relations with the minor, he has disqualified the deaf girl. And we should instruct the minor to refuse marriage, and then he divorces the deaf girl through a get. This is the opinion of the Rambam, but others disagree with him, as is explicit in the Tur and the Nimukei Yosef, ch. Bet Shammai. 
One was a girl of sound senses and the other deaf, if the levir had relations with the girl of sound senses first, and then he or his brother had relations with the deaf girl, he has not disqualified the girl of sounds senses, but the deaf girl requires a get. 
If the levir had relations with the deaf girl first, and then he or his brother had relations with the girl of sound senses, he has disqualified the deaf girl. And the deaf girl goes out with a get, and the girl of sound senses [goes out] with a get and halitzah. 
If one was of majority age and one was a minor, and he had relations with the adult, and afterwards he or his brother had relations with the minor, he has not disqualified the adult, and they instruct the minor that she should reject her marriage. If he had relations with the minor, and afterwards he or his brother had relations with the adult, they instruct the minor that she should reject her marriage, and he upholds marriage with the adult.

Siman 172

Someone "saris chamah" (explanation: he became impotent through a disease of fever, Aruch), and an "ayalonit" (explanation: she has a male nature, which means she cannot become pregnant, and "ayalonit" comes from "ayil" which is the male sheep [i.e. ram]), they do not have to do chalitza and yibbum. Therefore, someone who is a definite ayalonit who does chalitza [even though she didn't have to] is not invalid to a kohen. And similarly if someone who is impotent because if fever who does chalitza, or [his relative when he dies] does chalitza to his wife, it is nothing. <i>Rem"a: If it is [only] a possible saris, he does do chalitza. And we do not assume for a definite saris, unless they see when he was born that he had one of the signs of impotence, for example they sprinkle water but does not make a covering. Buit without this, we suspect the damage happened after birth, and he must do chalitza (Rivash Siman 474). </i> A definite ayalonit's rival wife is permitted to her yibbum [despite the fact that the ayalonit is not].
A doubted ayalonit, she does chalitza but not yibbum.
A man who was castrated by human intervention (that is, that his castration was done by a person) who had a period [in his life] when he was complete, [his brother] performs either halitza or levirate marriage [with his widow], and he performs halitza [with his brother's widow] but not levirate marriage, becasue he is ineligible to marry into the community.  If he did transgress and have intercourse with her, he has married her and must divorce her with a write of divorce.  Rem"a: If his sister-in-law is a convert or any other woman who may marry a 'man with a severed member', he may perform levirate marriage.


The age one needs to be to considered infertile according to these aforementioned signs, is discussed in the Rambam's second perek of hilchos ishus, and in S.A E.H siman 155. Rema: 
One who's testicles or sinew are torn, broken or crushed by another person is called infertile. When he is 13 years and one day old he is called a major because he will never be able to produce the normal signs of puberty.
An androgynous [somebody who has both male and female parts] is not able to perform chalitzah or yibum. Some say he is considered a male for everything.
Tumtum (person of indeterminate sex) extracts but does not levirate, because he's questionable. and if [it] got torn and happens to be male, [if he] wanted extracts, [if he] wanted levirates. and there's one saying that he's questionable and [adjudicate] to Chumra.
A very elderly man, whose strength has weakened and stumbles has the status of a eunuch with regards to <i>chalitzah</i> or <i>yibum</i>. But if he has relations with his <i>yevamah</i>, then he may keep her [stay married to her].
A woman who is deaf or mentally impaired or a minor performs yibum but not chalitzah. And if the yavam wanted to divorce the deaf woman with a get after having intercourse with her, behold he divorces [her].
The deaf, the insane and minors cannot perform Halitza, but they can perform Yibum.  A deaf man whose sister in law "fell" to him from his "intelligent" brother is unable to ever divorce her. However if she "fell" to him from a deaf brother he can divorce her by giving a get after consummation. A minor can divorce her with a get if he consummated after achieving majority. If that is not the case he she requires a get to free her from his ma'amar as well as  halitzah to end the Yibum relationship. (Zika)  
Two brothers, one who is intelligent and the other deaf, are married to two intelligent women, upon the death of the dead brother married to the intelligent woman, his intelligent brother can perform Halitzah if he so wishes, or Yibum if he so wishes. If the intelligent husband of the intelligent woman dies, his deaf brother cannot perform Halitzah; he must marry her and can never divorce her. 
Two intelligent brothers who are married to two women, one whom is intelligent and the other deaf;  if the intelligent husband of the deaf woman dies the deaf woman cannot have Halitza rather he must marry her and he may divorce her with with get afterwards if he so wishes. If the intelligent husband of the intelligent woman dies, his brother can perform halitzah if he so wishes or Yibum if he so wishes.  
Two brothers one who who is deaf and the other intelligent who are married to two women one who is deaf and the other intelligent; the intelligent brother is married to the intelligent woman while the deaf brother is married to the deaf woman. If the deaf brother who is married to the dead woman  dies, his intelligent brother marries her and may divorce her with a get afterwards if he so wishes. If the intelligent brother who is married to the intelligent woman dies, his deaf brother marries her and can never divorce her. A blind man performs Yibum. Rema- he may not perform Halitzah, and if he did perform Halitzah his Halitzah his Halitzah is valid. (Tur) It appears to me that if there is no brother besides him he may perform Halitzah a priori as there are no alternatives. Check on this further on in Chaper 149 in the commentary on Chalitza verse 64. 
A woman who is small or a woman who is mentally retarded is exempt from  חֲלִיצָה and יִּבּוּם; but a woman who is deaf, old, or barren, they are like all other women, and do חֲלִיצָה and יִּבּוּם

Siman 173

A female obligated in Yibum (Levirate marriage) who is a forbidden sexual partner (lit. nakedness) to a male obligated in Yibum with a prohibition of excommunication, except for a menstruating woman who has not ritually purified herself, are not in need of performing Yibum, and are permitted to someone else (lit. stranger) without Chalitza (ceremony releasing woman from obligation to marry brother-in-law), and other wives in her widow's marriage are exempt from Yibum and Chalitza. And if he had another brother, and one of his other wives performed Yibum to the same brother, and this brother has other wives, and dies, all of them are exempt from Chalitza and Yibum. And if he had yet another brother, and one of these wives had performed Yibum to him, and this brother has other wives, and dies, they are all exempt from Chalitza and from Yibum. And so unto forever. 
But if one of all of the Arayot (forbidden sexual partners) is married to another man (lit. foreign) who is not her brother(in-law), and he dies, it is permitted to marry his other wife. 
A woman required to perform Yibum (Levirate Marriage) who is possibly a forbidden sexual partner (lit. doubt of nakedness) to her husband, or is possibly a forbidden sexual partner on her brother-in-law (lit. one with whom she is required to perfrom Yibum), behold she performs Chalitza (ceremony exempting one from performing Yibum) and does not perform Yibum. Therefore, he who betroths a woman where is a doubt if their marriage took effect, and afterward the brother dies who married his sister, and he performed (lit. fell into) Yibum, that there is a doubt she is the sister of his wife, here she performs Chalitza and not Yibum, and gives (lit. brings) his wife a Get (writ of divorce) from doubt, and the two of them are prohibited to him; and in his death, because she is possibly a forbidden sexual partner; and his fiancee, because she is possibly a relative of someone he must perform Chalitza with.
If [the woman who fell to] yibbum had been [married to] a husband who was forbidden to her because of erva [sexually improper relationship], she was not his wife. If she had a rival wife [from her first marriage], they must have chalitza or yibbim. In the situation of her having been [married to] a husband who was forbidden to her because of erva [and he dies], she is to her levirate association as a regular woman who is permitted to him.
she was a female who is required to perform Yibum (Levirate marriage) and was possibly a forbidden sexual partner to her husband; she either performs Chalitza (ceremony exempting one from performing Yibum) or performs Yibum.
A [woman who falls to] yibbum where she is possibly an erva to her levirate association, and his brother had with her a doubtful kiddushin or a doubtful divorce, and he has another wife, her rival wives should have chalitza and not yibbum.
If someone's brother was married to a sexually inappropriate female who had undergone levirate marriage, and he [the first man] had another wife, and afterwards the sexually inappropriate woman dies during the life of her husband, or she  divorces him, or there was a young child that she objected to having that died afterwards, it is allowed for the other woman to undergo levirate marriage. But if she doesn't object to it in his life, and she objects after his death, than she does Chalitza (a way to get out of levirate marriage) instead of levirate marriage. 
It is doubtful whether it is Lewd to perform levirate marriage when the husband is dying or after his death, The wife is divorced [from the brother through chalitza] and no levirate marriage is preformed.
a yevamah that is a forbidden to preform levirate marriage but she is childless, even if it is know she already had relations, behold its like she has not, and she is either divorced or  levirate marriage is preformed. And if  levirate marriage is preformed on the woman because she was thought to be a forbidden woman who is childless, and afterwards it found that she is not childless,  she will subject to the levirate marriage and she will give birth to mamzariem  
[in a case where one's] brother's wife becomes betrothed another man, because she was thought that there that she does not have the status of a barren woman [i.e. she had children already] and afterwards it is found out that she was childless, you will go and give her a get, or nullify the mitzva of yibum [by preforming chalitza] to permit her [to be with her new husband]. If she was not betrothed to the other man, only engaged to him, its permitted to preform levirite marriage.  
one who's wife committed adultery while still married with witnesses to testify that she did it willingly, and he [the husband] dies and she is now in falls to the brother [halachically], it has the status of a forbidden relationship, and the wife is free from chalitza and levirite marriage. But if it is doubtful if she committed adultery or she didnt, she requires chalitza or levirite marriage. REMA: there are those that say even if it is certain she committed adultery, she requires chalitza, this is the rule in regard to another's wife, and there is what to be strict upon [in this regard]. Therefore, whoever has a wife that converted [to another religion] even though it is certain that she committed adultery, the other wife requires chalitza. woman who's husband goes overseas, and marries [another man] and afterwards the husband arrives [back] and he dies, its permissible to preform levirite marriage, and its not like the sister-in-law is a sotah.  
The wife of a brother who did not live at the same time is considered as the wife of a brother in the absence of any mitzva (of levirate marriage), and she also relieves her co-wife from any levirate bond.  How? Reuven passed away, and his wife fell to Shimon in levirate marraige, and Levi was subsequently born (after Reuven's death), whether before or after the levirate marriage, and then Shimon died, she (Reuven's wife) is forever forbidden to Levi. If Shimon had another wife, she is also released from chalitza and from levirate marriage, and in turn frees her co-wife and her co-wife's co-wife and so on, as is the law with any other co-wife of a woman forbidden to undergo levirate marriage because of ervah. However, if Shimon died even before he gave her "maamar" (money showing intent to consummate levirate marriage), the wife of Shimon undergoes chalitza but may not undergo levirate marriage to Levi, because we have establisehd that there is a levirate bond even when he did not give maamar, and therefore there is still an element of being the co-wife to the widow of a brother (Reuven) who was not in the same world (did not live at the same time).
a female minor was married to the brother from her mother [the mother's brother, the girl's uncle] and she is [married to her uncle] for a moment, and he dies, and remains or she marries the brother from her father's side, and he [the brother from the father's side] dies, and she falls to the brother-in-law while she is still a minor, they [beis din?] don't say you will refuse [to marry her], to uproot the marriage of the original brother-in-law, in order that levirite marriage will be preformed] rather the other wife [making reference to the minor in this case] has chalitza preformed and not levirite marriage, that is if she refuses [levirite marriage]. ..
a minor female that is not forbidden for him marry, and he dies, or she refuses the preformance levirite marriage [with a brother of the husband], she is forbidden to the brother-in-law [in this case] and permitted to others without chalitza, if there are no other brothers [than the one]. and specifically her [the widow of the deceased], but her sister is permitted to him, even she is permitted to the remainder of brothers that she did not refuse [for the performance of levirite marriage].
[in a case where] one who's brother's wife is suspected she was divorced from him, he preforms chalitza and no levirite marriage is preformed. But if it was [a case of] doubtful they were married [in the first place, certainly [in] this [case] his is able to preform levirite marriage.
The one who divorces his wife who is an adult or a minor that is too be married to his brother [after the divorce], and she returns [back to the to her original husband], and he [the husband] dies, she falls to the commitment of the brother-in-law [requiring levirite marriage], she is permitted to him [the brother-in-law]. But  a minor that  is married off by her father, and she is divorced [from her too be husband] through her father, and she returns [to her too be husband]  and he dies[the now current husband] while she is still a minor, it is forbidden to preform levirite marriage. and is the case with a divorcee who is sharp-sighted,and does not listen to her husband, and she returns to her former husband, and he [the husband] dies, and she does not listen [she does not listen to anyone?]; whether this or this the other wife [of the dead husband] is permitted to the brother-in-law.
The woman who returns [back to her house; in regard to a prenuptial marriage] when she is a minor or deaf [she wont listen to her husband], and she becomes an adult and regains her hearing and went [back] to him, and he dies [after she returns to her former husband] its permitted to preform levirite marriage. and its not necessary to say to her if she returns after she matures or regains her hearing [the laws of  levirite marriage will apply]  

Siman 174

A yavama (a widow who must perform a levirate marriage with her late husband's brother) who is forbidden to the yavam (her late husband's brother), whether through a negative commandment [in the Torah], or a positive commandment [in the Torah], or is a secondary [relative of his] on a Rabbinic level, she performs chalitza (action by which a yavama is permitted to marry a non-yavam) and does not perform yibum (a levirate marriage), and her co-wife performs either chalitza or yibum.  And her performance of chalitza does not exempt her co-wife [from having to do chalitza or yibum],  but the chalitza of her co-wife exempts her.  And if he violated [this rule] and engaged in sexual relations with her, he [thereby] acquires her [as his wife] and this exempts her co-wife.  And if he wishes to divorce her, he divorces her with a get (a divorce document)
If she was forbidden to her husband by a negative commandment [in the Torah] or a positive [commandment in the Torah] or a Rabbinic prohibition, and permitted to a yavam, she can perform yibum; except [in the case of] a man who brings back his divorced wife once she was married and he dies, she performs chalitzah and not yibum, and her co-wife performs either chalitzah or yibum.
The sisters of a woman that you did halitzah with are forbidden to marry, by rabbinic decree. Therefore, if the sister of the halutza "fell" to the yabam (meaning, she is married to another brother of the yabam and her husband died), they cannot marry and do yibum (since her sister already went through the process). She needs Halitzah to permit her to the world. Her co-wives (other wives of her husband) have the same law, by rabbinic decree.
A woman who has double levirate ties, either she or her co-wife undergo halitzah, but not yibum. How is this (what is an example)? 3 brothers are married to 3 unrelated women. One brother dies and one of the remaining brothers gave the widow "ma'amar" (kiddushin-style money which creates a partial bond but does not effect full levirate marriage), but dies before they have relations. In this case, the woman is now a double yebama to the remaining living brother and he must do halitzah- he can't marry her.
If her gave her a get, and explained that it was to invalidate the ma'amar (money given to partially effect levirate marriage), he thereby abrogated the ma'amar, and she is bound by only a single levirate bound, and she remains permitted for levirate marriage [to another brother]. But if he gave her a get per se [without specifying that it was intended to abrogate the ma'amar] then she is forbidden to undergo levirate marriage. 
A minor who had relations with his yevama, and then died, she must undergo chalitza and may not undergo levirate marriage. For his intercourse does not effect a full acquisition [of the yevama], and she now has dual levirate bonds (via the death of her original husband, and the subsequent death or his minor brother who was also her partial husband).
She who is half maidservant, and half freewoman that was married to Reuven, and was freed, and married his brother Shimon, and the two of them died, and she came before Levi their brother, she does Yibum with him, for she is not the wife of two dead men; For if Reuven's marriage is valid, Shimon's marriage is as nothing, and if Shimon's marriage is valid, Reuven's marriage is as nothing.

Siman 175

A woman who is not fit to do yibbum [levirate marriage] when it falls to her because of the prohibition of sexual impropriety ["erva"], is forbidden [to remarry the brother] forever, even when the prohibition is lifted. For example, two brothers who marry two sisters, and one of the [brothers] died, and his wife falls to the second who is married to her sister. Even if his wife dies afterward [and now he would be able to marry the sister], for the prohibittion of the sister of one's wife had been lifted, even so, she is prohibited [to him]. [This is so] even if she falls to him [in yibbum] another time [even] after the death of his wife. For example, [two brothers marry two sisters, and] they have a third brother who does not have this erva [because he was not married to one of the sisters, and then one of the brothers dies], and he performs [yibbum] with her. Then, the [brother's] wife who was the sister dies. [Then,] the third [brother] who did [the yibbum] dies, and now she falls to him, she is [still] prohibited to him. It matters not if his wife had died before the third had performed [yibbum], and it matters not if she died after he had performed [yibbum]: Even though she was not prohibited to him the last time she fell to him [in yibbum], even so, she is prohibited to him, she and her secondary wives, for example when the third brother had another wife, once she was already prohibited to him the first time around. But if she was permitted to him when she [first] fell to him [in yibbum], even if she became prohibited to him afterwards, if the prohibition [eventually] lifts, the permittedness returns to her. What's the case? There are three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters. One of them dies, so his wife is tied to yibbum with the third [brother] who is not married to her sister. He did not have a chance to perform [yibbum] with her, and the second brother dies who was married to the other sister [so now both sisters are the third brother's yibbums], but both [together] are forbidden to him. [Now,] the second [of those sisters] dies. The first becomes permitted to him again, since she was permitted to him [the first time] she fell to him in yibbum, even though in between she was prohibited to him. But if it was the first [sister] hat died, the second one would not be permitted to him, since she was prohibited to him when she fell to him in yibbum. And so if they had more brothers there, and one of them goes and performs chalitza with the second one, who is permitted to him, the first one becomes permitted to the rest of the brothers, for the second one caused her prohibition [to the brothers], and it takes chalitza or yibbum to make her permitted But if the second one was prohibited to one of them because of erva, he can perform yibbum on the first, and the rest of the brothers are prohibited to both, and they must perform chalitza and not yibbum.
Two brothers of [many brothers] who marry two sisters, and both [brothers] die, and it is not known who died first, since one cannot perform yibbum on for both together, and the levirate association falls on both, they are performed upon chalitza and not yibbum. Even if one of them is prohibited to her yibbum because of the second, or he is guilty of violating an positive-action sin or guilty of violating a negative-action sin, they do chalitza and not yibbum. But if one of them [is prohibited] because of erva [prohibited sexual impropriety], her sister is indeed permitted to him, and so if he wants to do chalitza [he can], if he wants to do yibbum [he can] for the levirate association did not fall on both together, for there is no levirate association in the case of erva.
If there are four brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and the ones married to the sisters die [at the same time], or one after the other but before there was enough time for the first [sister] to have performed yibbum, both of them should have chalitza done and not yibbum, for neither of [the remaining two brothers] can do yibbum [on both], because of the prohibition of sisters of levirate association. If they went and did yibbum each with one of the sisters, we make them leave them. Some say we don't make them leave.
If one of them was prohibited to one of the levirate associates because of the prohibition of erva [illegal sexual relationships], he is permitted to the second [sister], because the erva [sister] isn't attached to him [in particular] to do yibbum, and only one is attached to him [to do yibbum, which can be the permitted sister]. And the second [brother] is forbidden to be with either.
If one of the [sisters] was prohibited to this one because of erva, and the second [sister] was prohibited to the other on because of erva, the one that was prohibited for this one is permitted to that one, for each [brother] is only attached to do yibbum with one. But if the prohibition on them is just a negative or positive prohibition, the attachment is not pushed off, so they must do chalitza and not yibbum.
Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters. One of the sisters' husbands dies, and afterwards the husband of the second sister dies, so that the second sister also falls [for levirate marriage] before the third brother. Both of them [the widows] are forbidden to him, because they are co-wives each one to the other in the zikah [levirate connection], and he does chalitzah to them and not yibum. If he had made a maamar [pledge to marry] the first one, and afterwards her sister falls before him, he sends the pledged wife away with a get and chalitzah, and the latter one with chalitzah.
Three brothers, two of which are married to two sisters and one of which is married to a woman not related [to the sisters], and the one married to the unrelated woman dies, and one of the brothers married to the sisters brings [the unrelated] wife into [his marriage], and [then] he dies, the first wife leaves by virtue of being the sister of the wife, and the second because she is a secondary wife. If he did not bring [the unrelated wife] in, whether he did the refusal or did not do the refusal, she must have chalitza but not yibbum.
Three brothers, two of which are married to two sisters and one of which is married to a woman not related [to the sisters], if one of the husbands of the sisters divorced his wife, and [then] the one married to the unrelated woman dies, and the divorced woman is brought in to the marriage, and [that husband] died, she [the sister] is not permitted to the remaining brother. But if the one married to the unrelated woman dies before one of the husbands of the sisters divorces his wife, even if he had not brought in the unrelated woman [into the marriage] and he dies, she is prohibited to the remaining brother, because the secondary wife was an erva to her by levirate marriage, even if he had divorced the erva before he died. <i> Rem"a: And the law is the same if he had married the unrelated woman, and he had children [with her], she is prohibited to him because of the levirate connection between the wife of his brother that he had children (Hagahot Alfasi Perek Daled Achin). </i> But if a husband of the sisters brought in the unrelated woman [into marriage] and he divorce the erva, and then he died, it matters not if he divorced before he brought in the erva, it matters not afterward, the unrelated woman is permitted to the remaining brother.
If two brothers of full faculty marry two sisters who are minors or are deaf-mutes, and one [of the brother] dies, she can go free by virtue of being the sister of the wife [of the other brother], for they are both married equally.
If one of them was of full faculty and one was a deaf-mute, and the husband of the deaf-mute dies, she goes free by virtue of being the sister of the wife. If the husband of the full faculty one dies, the husband of the deaf-mute must divorce his wife with a bill of divorce, and his brother's wife with chalitza.
If there was one older and one younger, and the husband of the younger died, she is dismissed(from doing levirate marriage) because of the wife status of her sister(her older sister's marriage is valid). If the husband of the older sister died, they teach the younger one that she should refuse her husband(thereby absolving her marriage) and her older sister shall perform the levirate marriage. 
Two brothers, one of full faculty and one a deaf-mute, who are married to two sisters of full faculty, or one is of full faculty and one is a deaf-mute and the woman of full faculty is married to the man of full faculty, and the deaf-mute man who was the husband of the deaf-mute woman dies, or if the deaf-mute man had been the husband of the woman of full faculty, she goes free by virtue of being the sister of the wife. If the man of full faculty husband of the woman of full faculty dies, or the deaf-mute man husband of the deaf-mute woman dies, or [the deaf-mute man was the] husband of the woman of full faculty [dies], [the remaining brother] divorces his wife with a bill of divorce, and the wife of his brother is forever prohibited to him.
Two deaf-mute brothers who are married to two sisters who are both able minded or deaf-mute or one of them is able minded and the other is a deaf-mute, and so too with two sisters who are deaf-mutes who are married to two brothers who are both able minded or both deaf-mutes or one is able minded and one is deaf-mute, and one of them dies, one of the sisters goes free because she is the sister of (the levirate man's) wife. If the two women were strangers, they can marry them, and if afterward, they want to divorce by way of bill of divorce, they can divorce them. 
Two brothers, one able minded and the other a deaf mute, and the deaf-mute is married to two able minded women, and one of them was a forbidden relation, and the deaf mute brother died, both of them are exempt from doing the refusal service or levirate marriage. If they both were able minded and one of them was married to two women, one of them was able minded and the other a deaf-mute, and the deaf-mute was a forbidden relation to his brother, the second woman who is able minded can do the refusal service but cannot be contracted into the levirate marriage. 

Siman 176

One who betrothed one of two sisters and doesn't know which he betrothed, even if they were never known, for they were not given [to him] for relations, it is betrothal and a get is required for each one of them. If he died and had a brother, the brother performs chalitzah for both of them. If he had two brothers, one performs chalitzah and one performs levirate marriage with the second. If the two brothers acted precipitously and brought them both into marriage, they do not remove them from them. But if they consulted with the beit din and they said to them that one should perform chalitzah and they other should perform levirate marriage, and both of them went and performed levirate marraige, they remove them.
One who transgresses and performs a leverite marriage (Yibbum) with a connected sister, we remove them from the marriage.
Two men who married two sisters, and neither of them know which sister her married, and they die(the men), each of their brother performs the refusal ceremony for both of them and neither of them can do levirate marriage. If one of the men had one brother and the other, two, the one with one brother can do the refusal ceremony with both sisters and the one with two brothers, one of them can do the refusal ceremony with one sister first and then afterward, the second brother can do the levirate marriage. If the two brothers expedited the process and married the sisters after the one brother did the refusal ceremony, we don't divorce them from their hands, even if they are both priests. If both men had two brothers each, one of the brothers of one performs the refusal ceremony and the other brother performs the levirate marriage with aforementioned refused sister and the other second brother also performs the levirate marriage with the one his brother refused. If the two brothers expedited the process and performed the refusal service, the other two brothers cannot perform levirate marriage to the two women. Rather, one performs the refusal ceremony and one performs levirate marriage. If the two other brothers preceded and married the two women after the first two brothers performed the refusal ceremony, we do not remove them from their hands. 
 One who's husband goes overseas, and she hears that he died [and upon receiving that information] she remarries and [after she remarried] her husband [who was thought dead comes afterwards] and then both of them [the ex-husband and current husband] die, for this brother [of the current husband] and for this brother [of the ex husband]  brother of this one and this one preform chalitza and levirite marriage is not preformed. this is the rule for the other wife see further on in Siman 183 Seif 11.
If a woman had sons and whose daughter-in-law also had sons, and they each gave birth to a son in a [wartime] hideout, and the parentage of the two boys became mixed up, and the boys grew up and got married, and both later died, the surviving sons of the daughter-in-law should perform <i>chalitza</i> on the two widows before those of her mother-in-law, but her sons should not perform levirate marriage. After the sons of the daughter-in-law perform <i>chalitza</i>, the sons of the mother-in-law may perform either <i>chalitza</i> or levirate marriage.
[married] sons that certainly died of old age  and the [widowed] wife, it is doubtful if she is bound [to have levirite marriage/chalitza done]; The doubtful one [the widowed woman who is destined] to marry men who are older has chalitza preformed and not levirite marriage; and a woman who is of marriageable [status/age], one who is doubtful [that he will be able to have children with her]  preforms chalitza from the beginning [when she is attached to him], and the second [brother available] is made the halachic brother-in-law.
A woman who does not stay married to her husband after 3 months, and she married again[had relations ,became pregnant and gave birth] and its unknown if he [the unborn child]  in utreo for nine months from the first husband or seven months from the second husband , and she will have a child from either the first or second husband, and the paternally unknown child grew up, married a woman and died; sons of both the first and second husband preform Chalitza and don't preform Levirite marriage; and so does this paternally doubtful child, [do to his unknown biological brother and non biological brother] he preforms Chalitza  and not Levirite marriage. had the [sons of] the first marriage and second marriage died, for everyone, who is a son of another woman [they do not share the same mother], and they die [the brothers from either the first or second husband], This paternally doubtful son either preforms Chalitza or Levirite marriage for their wives. The paternally doubtful dies,and one of the two is required to preform Chalitza at first and the second brother preforms Levirite marriage.
Five women who each had one known son, and they each gave birth in secret to a boy, and the five infants were mixed together [and grew up] and married women and then died, and their wives come before the five known sons. Four of the known [sons] perform <i>chalitsah</i> to one [of the wives], after which the fifth [known son] can marry [that wife]. They do this for each one [of the wives]. If one of the known sons died, four of the doubtful sons perform <i>chalitsah</i> [to his wife], and one [doubtful son] can perform <i>yibum</i>. If some of the known sons were <i>kohanim</i>, the <i>kohanim</i> perform <i>chalitsah</i> and not <i>yibum</i> and the ones who are not <i>kohanim</i> perform <i>yibum</i>. If some of the known sons had brothers from their mother but not their father, and they also [share] brothers from their father (The brothers with a [common] mother perform <i>chalitsah</i>. The brothers with a [common] father perform <i>yibum</i>. If some of them were <i>kohanim</i> and some of them were brothers from the mother, these and these) perform <i>chalitsah</i> and not <i>yibum</i>.

Siman 177

One who seduces a virgin of Israel before she reaches majority age, which is from three years and onward (Tur, the Rosh) pays embarrassment, blemishing and a fine. And if he rapes her he also pays the pain. And if the seducer married her he need not pay the fine. 
A rapist or a seducer are judged by three judges, as long as they were ordained in the land of Israel. And now when there are no such ordained judges, we excommunicate them until they appease their fellow. And when they give an amount of money to him that is appropriate, we release their excommunication. And as for a daughter, as long as she is in her father's domain, her father get's everything (ibid). See Tur in this paragraph who discussed this matter at length, and the Shulkhan Arukh abbreviated them, for this is not common.
One who rapes a virgin must marry her, as long as she and her father so desire. Even if she is lame or blind. And he may never divorce her except with her consent. 
Therefore, he need not write her a ketubah. But if he transgressed and divorced her, they force him to remarry her. 
If she was prohibited to him, even derabanan, he may not marry her. Also, if he marries her and he finds some sexual impropriety, he must divorce her. Hagah: If an evil report goes out about her, for instance witnesses came and testify that she asked them to engage in fornication, she gets no fine. But if it is just a rumor that a bad name went out about her, she doesn't lose the fine (Tur). If he rapes her and then seduces her, it is called rape, even though afterward she agreed [to have relations] with him (Maharik, root 129). 
One about whom it has been claimed [that he had relations] with an unmarried woman, there are those who say that he shouldn't marry her because of the bad talk [that will result] for it looks like they are confirming the rumor. But there are those that say it is a mitzvah to marry her.
Hagah: The first reasoning is the main one. And if there is fear that she will go out to an "evil culture" (i.e. marry out of Judaism), he may marry her. And all of this refers to a simple rumor, but if he certainly had relations with her, it is a mitzvah to marry her, but we don't enforce that (ibid). 
But if a rumor went out concerning that she had relations with two men, the first only a rumor and the second added to her insult, the second has a mitzvah to marry her. But if the rumor is of equal strength with regard to both, one is married and one is not married, the second has a mitzvah to marry her (ibid).
See above siman 22, whether she is trustworthy in this matter.
A prostitute that was requested of one who promised to pay her a price and he denies it, he must take an oath as is true in other suits (Ribash, siman 41). This is what the Torah  obligated the rapist and the seducer to pay money, when it just happened. But a father is not allowed to give his daughter to be a harlot, and about this it is written, "Do not defile your daughter to make her a harlot" (Leviticus 19:29). And anyone who prepares herself to be a harlot, whether on her own accord or her father's  is considered a "kedeshah" and there is no distinction in this matter between a virgin and a non-virgin. And a court may fine prostitutes in order to erect a fence. 
And it happened with one who fornicated with a non-Jew, that they cut her nose off, in order to disfigure her (Responsa of the Rosh 18). 

Siman 178

One who legally expresses jealousy over his wife and she is secluded but he doesn't know if she was defiled, she is prohibited to him.  And this is true as long as the expression of jealousy and seclusion were performed as the law requires. And in such a case she loses her ketubah, even if he dies before he divorces her. 
How is jealously [legally performed]? He says to her in front of two [witnesses]: Do not be secluded with so-and-so? Even if he is her father or brother or a non-Jew or a "shahuf" (one who cannot get an erection, Tur), as long as he is of majority age.  But if he said to her: Don't be secluded with so-and-so, and he is a minor or an animal, this is not legally performed jealousy. And he may profess jealous over her whether she is betrothed or married or awaiting levirate marriage.  
A minor girl whose father married her off and she willingly fornicated, there are those who say she is prohibited. Therefore,  they can profess jealousy over her, in  order to cause her to lose her ketubah. And there are those who say that she is not prohibited to her husband unless he is a priest.  Hagah: An adult who accidentally fornicated, thinking he was her husband but he was someone else, is permitted to her Israelite husband (Rambam, chapter 24, Hilkhot Ishut). But if she thought it was permitted to fornicate, this is like one who does so intentionally and she is forbidden to her husband (Maharik, root 167).  A woman who was secluded with men on the road and she came back and said: "I was secluded and I was raped" there are those who say she is believed with a "since" argument, for [she could have said] I did not have relations.  And there are those who said she loses the ability to make such an argument, since she was illicitly secluded (both opinions are found in the Mordecai, second chapter of Ketubot). 
What is considered seclusion? When she is secluded in front of witnesses with the same man about whom the profession of jealousy was made, and she stayed there long enough to be defiled, which is long enough to roast an egg and quaff it. 
If professed jealousy about two men, saying to her: Don't be secluded with so-and-so and so-and-so, and she was secluded with both of them at the same time, even if they are brothers [her brothers] or her father and her brother, she is prohibited.
If he said to her in front of two people: Do not speak with so-and-so, this is not a profession of jealousy. Even if she is secluded with him and stays long enough to be defiled, she is permitted.  Similarly, if he says to her: Do not be secluded with so-and-so, and she speaks with him in front of witnesses, she is permitted.  And similarly if she is secluded in front of witnesses and stays with him long enough to be defiled, and he didn't profess jealousy in front of witnesses, she is permitted. For they don't prohibit a man to his wife even if they were secluded with the intent of engaging in prohibited relations, unless he professed jealousy at the outset in front of two witnesses. But in any case, a woman should not be secluded with men, and was explained above in siman 22. 
A man shouldn't say to his wife, even just between him and her: Don't be secluded with so-and-so, lest we hold like R. Yose b. Rabbi Yehudah who said: If he professed jealousy for her between him and her, it is a valid profession of jealousy.  Hagah: And not that we don't have the sotah waters, if she is secluded after a profession of jealousy she is forbidden to him forever (Tur, in the name of the SMG). And if he forgot and professed jealousy, he should forgive her immediately for the jealousy, as will be explained below in this chapter, section 12. 
If one witness comes and testifies that she was secluded with the one about whom the profession of jealousy was made, and she stayed with him long enough to be defiled, if he is trustworthy in his eyes, and he relies upon him, he should divorce her and give her the ketubah. And if not, she is permitted to him. And if he himself saw her secluded with him and she was with him long enough to be defiled, she is forbidden to him and he should divorce her and give her the ketubah.  And there is no distinction for the matter of seclusion after profession of jealousy whether her husband is in the same city or the door is open to the public domain or not (see Maharai, siman 244). And see above, siman 22. 
If the husband did not warn her, but one witness came and said that she did commit adultery, and she doesn't respond [to the accusation], if the witness is trusted by the husband, and he trusts the single witness as he would trust two [witnesses], the husband should divorce her and pay her the ketubah, if not, she is permitted to him. Hagah: This also applies if she herself said that she committed adultery as was explained earlier in chapter 115:6. There are some who say that nowadays when the ban of Rabeinu Gershom not to divorce one's wife without her consent is upheld, [the husband] can not believe her testimony or the witness's testimony [about her promiscuity], because we are concerned that [the husband] may have been keeping his eye on another woman [and that he is divorcing his wife only to marry another woman], without actually believing the wife or the witness.(Hagaot Maymoni Chapter 24 and the Maharik rule 110 in the name of 'those who say'). We ostracize the husband [in such a case] because he tried to break the ban of Rabeinu Gershom by saying that he trusted her (i.e his wife's testimony). This rule also applies to all places where the husband is not allowed to divorce [his wife] without her consent. Some [authorities] say that they force him to have relations with her [in such a case].
If one started a rumor about his wife that she committed adultery and said said that he was certain, and afterwards he admits that this is not true and it was only because he was angry that he accused her; if he gives proof for his statement, she is permitted to him, and if not, she is not [permitted to him]
You could hear the people being joyful after the purchase, and they hid the two witnesses until the women left and gave the first woman what she had gotten from the person that she had gotten it from, and it was forbidden to him, and they took it out and gave her what she was due.
If there is a husband that relinquishes what he owes, if it is before it is neutralized, it is considered relinquished and as such is no longer owed to her. If it is after it is neutralized, however, it is not considered a relinquished debt. If she gets divorced, it is as if she relinquishes it, and if she gives it back, he must return it at a different time.
If there is a woman whose husband has gone deaf, or gone insane, or is in a different country, or he is imprisoned in prison, and the Beit Din hears rumors about her, they will call and say to her: do not hide from such-and-such man. And if witnesses come after they hid her, and they delay her in order to make her impure, they can forbid her from her husband forever, and they can write her a divorce document. And when her husband comes back, or recovers from his illness, or is freed from prison, he must give her a document of divorce.
If one witness comes, and swears that she was impure when she got her property, she must leave without her money that she is owed for her divorce. Even if the witness that swore that she was impure was also one of the witnesses that hid her, and even if they are a slave or a maidservant or a woman or a relative, they are still allowed to be witnesses.
If there are five woman who hate her, and they agree with each other to say that she was impure after she receives her stuff owed to her in order to make her forbidden to her husband, but not to nullify her Ketuvah.
If it is found by way of impure witnesses, even if if they didn't see so much as a paint brush in a tube of paint, after they see them stuck one on top of the other, and they follow the ways of the adulterous ones.
All women that are married by the husband through money and [there is a] neutralization [of the money's value], she is forbidden to him [but] it is an engagement to him. And if afterwards she is married, she is divorced from him with a get, even if they have many children. But if not [they were not married] with money, and came witnesses that married [them] with this man [the husband], and it was found out a [physical feature that is] ugly, this is explained in Siman 11 
For every woman for whom comes two witnesses that swear that she was adulterous while still married to her husband, they should separate from each other, even if she has many children.
There are authorities who hold  that a married woman who commits adultery with a gentile and divorces her husband, and the gentile converts to Judaism, she is permitted to this convert, as it is not relevant to say "one who has relations" in regard to the relations with a gentile. REMA: nevertheless one who commits adultery with the sister of his wife [who is a non-jew], and she divorces from her husband [and converts to Judaism], its forbidden to have relations with her until after the death of his wife. Even though it is doubtful if it is forbidden for her to have relations with him.
A married woman that makes a claim on a man [her husband] that he is a pursuer of another [woman], and he denies the claim, she is not believed [when she intends] to torment him; but they [the sages] decree that he is excommunicated, and he will not speak with her [the other woman] at all, and not live in the same area as each other. and if he strengthens the rumor that they [the husband and the other woman] are having forbidden relations, its proper to rebuke him reprimand and make him weary that if he does not conduct himself properly he will have to separate from their [the husband's and wife's] children [due  to] abuse and we suspend him [from his family] with two hands, like our rabbis [chazal?] Z"L: we beat him on no-good we hear, similar to whats written in Rambam, Perek 24 from [hilachos] sanhedrin.
The Sages commanded that the people of Israel to be zealous for their wives. and everyone who are not meticulous with his wife, with his children and children of his house and do not order their ways always to the point that they are full of wrongdoing and sin, indeed its like he is a sinner. As the verse says  "and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and find nothing desirable" (Job 5:24). And in regard to everyone who takes a his wife, she comes to him [for relations/marriage?] in a spirit of purity. and he will not marry her from midst the market place, and not from the midst [inappropriate] conversation, and not in the midst of levity, and not in the midst of a quarrel, and impose fear on her. and if her transgresses any of these [but] he marries her before two  witnesses, indeed this is a marriage.
Its improper to be anxious and be jealous before witnesses come. Even between them he will not say to her "don't be alone with this man", as it will be explained. Rather it cause animosity between them, [it should be done] in a way of gentleness, purity and cautiousness, in order to remove the obstacle [in the relationship] and guide it straight on.

Seder HaGet

The Order of the Divorce Document: Laws of the Witnesses and the Husband, and the Scribe and the Wife, and All of its Details, and there are 101 paragraphs in it.<br> (Said the glosser: Everything written in this order in the name of the orders without attribution, know that it is from the order of our teacher Y. Margoliyot of blessed memory.) Rem"a: In the days of the Talmudic Sages they used to appoint an expert sage over divorce documents, and likewise it is found in the words of the ancestors that they would only give a divorce document before the great [sage]s of the generation (Rivash 389). Therefore no person other than an expert in divorce documents should attempt to give them. And anyone who is not an expert in the nature of divorce and marraige should have nothing to do with them. And if someone transgressed and gave divorce documents or performed halitza without obtaining permission, see Yoreh Deah 242:14. A divorce document arranged by non-experts should be invalidated as I wrote above in ch. 141:30 and 142:9.<br>Some are careful not to organize the <i>get</i> on Friday.
Invite a scribe and two proper witnesses who are not related to each other or the wife. Rem"a: And see above 141:25. Ideally one should select witnesses who have no relationship at all, even a 4th-level one (in the name of the Maharil), nor through marriage. Also there should no rumors that they are suspected of forbidden sexual relations (that is the implication of chapter "Zeh Borer" -- Sanhedrin ch. 3), nor any other invalidating matter. Nor should one select a witness who is deformed. Also be careful that the witnesses and the scribe not be related to the rabbi organizing the divorce document; but in an emergency, one needn't be careful about the scribe['s relationship to the rabbi] if he is fitting. Some say that the rabbi should say to the witnesses that they should repent in their hearts for sins that they have committed, even if they are presumed to be completely righteous, lest they committed a sin that would disqualify them in this (Mahara"m Yafe and R"Y Mintz). And one should select witnesses who understand the divorce document, and if they don't now how to read, teach them and explain to them, and to the scribe and the husband what is a divorce document for its own sake and not for its own sake (M"K). And see below shortly in paragraph 12 further laws regarding the scribe.
Be careful that the scribe is not one of the witnesses.
If the scribe or the Sage organizing the divorce document are taking a much greater fee than what they would earn from not working, some say that the witnesses must not be related to them. And our teacher Rabbi Ovadya in his commentary to the Mishnah in chapter 4 of Bekhorot yelled at the rabbis who organize divorce documents who take more money than they would earn from not working. Rem"a: But we don't act according to him. His reasoning is specious, because he compares this matter to that which they said: 'One who takes money to judge, his rulings are void.' That is no proof, because organizing divorce documents isn't judging, but generic teaching. See above ch. 130 the reason that the witnesses get paid. And the husband should equalize himself with the scribe and the rabbi and the witnesses before they begin to write (M"K in the name of Mahara"n of blessed memory).
It necessary to recognize that this is so-and-so and this is his wife so-and-so unless it is an extreme emergency.
If there is someone in the same city who shares his name, and his wife's name is the same as the divorcing husband's wife's name, he can only get divorced in front of his friend.
If the divorcer is dying, it is necessary to be careful that he be sensate at the time of the writing and the delivery. Rem"a: See above ch. 121.
If someone wishes to divorce on condition, he shouldn't mention the condition, but should tell the scribe to write the divorce document and the witnesses to sign it, and he shouldn't mention any condition until the moment of delivery. Rem"a: See above ch. 147.
Everyone is eligible to write a divorce document except for a deaf-mute, cognitively impaired person, or a child; or a servant or a non-Jew; or a Jewish apostate or someone who publicly violates Shabbat.
The husband himself should not write the divorce document when possible.
Likewise, the husband should not say to the scribe: "Write thus" or "Don't write [thus]."
The scribe should not be a relative neither of the woman nor the man, when possible.
The scribe should bring the parchment and the ink and the quill (Rem"a: and all other writing implements). The rabbi should ask the scribe in front of the witnesses if everything belongs to him, and when he says: "Yes," afterward he gives them as a present to the husband and the husband lifts them to acquire them. Rem"a: Some say that before the scribe gives him these things the husband should nullify knowing (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And they should investigate him as will be explained in 14:20, and afterwards he should accept the aforementioned things from the scribe, and that is the practice.
The Sage should ask the divorcing husband: "Are you giving this divorce document of your own free will without any duress? Have you made any self-prohibition or vow or oath that would force you to give it? Tell us and we will release you." And the divorcing husband responds: "I neither vowed nor swore an oath, nor am I under any duress; rather, I am giving this divorce document of my own free will, whole-heartedly, not under any duress or condition." And if he says that he swore an oath or vowed or made a prior agreement to give it, they should release him first, in order that it appear like duress; but if wants to give a pledge, he may, because that is not similar to duress. Rem"a: See below 23-24 that are related to this.
The husband extends the parchment (Rem"a: and the rest of the writing implements) and the pen and the ink to the scribe in front of witnesses and says to him before them: "Write for me a divorce document for the sake of divorcing my wife so-and-so and for the sake of disconnection. I am giving you permission to write from one to one hundred divorce documents until one is fitting without any error, either in the writing or in the signing according to the opinion of the Sage, Rabbi X." Rem"a: Or in the opinion of any to whom he shows it. And the scribe responds: "Thus shall I do." (All this is in the instructions.) This is only effective after-the-fact. Therefore the ideal custom is that the scribe gives the husband a lot of parchment and ink lest he write many divorce documents as he commanded him that are valid after-the-fact, but ideally if he wrote an invalid divorce document the custom is to return and for the scribe to give him everything, and the husband returns and commands him to write, and invalidates knowledge in the order he did originally. See below 54. And when the husband gives the items to the scribe, he should ideally give them himself and not via an agent. (found written in an ancient manual.)
And you and you witnessed the signing of this divorce
If they need to write two gets (writs of divorce) because of a doubt regarding a name, e.g. Gershon or Gershom or similar situations, the divorcing husband should say to the scribe that if the sage Rabbi, Rabbi so and so wants to arrange multiple gets because of doubt, so that all will be given into the hands of the woman, he gives the scribe permission to write all the gets. He should inform the witnesses likewise, and give them permission to sign them.
The scribe should not write, nor should the witnesses sign, until they directly hear the husband command the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign, but not (if they hear the command) through a messenger. Even if the husband says to three people: "Tell Ploni to write, and tell Ploni and Ploni to sign (as witnesses)" they should not write and sign, because they did not hear the command directly from the husband.
The husband pays the scribe's fee; and if the wife pays it, that is acceptable (kosher). 
The husband shall say before the witnesses: I am, in front of you, annulling a
It is necessary to have witnesses who said that the scribe who wrote them husband and wife divorce,  It is necessary that they stand at the time of the writing of the  
It is required that the divorce document is recognized as being written for the specific husband and wife. Therefore, if they want to go out after the name of the husband and the wife and the time are written, a symbol must be made on the divorce document so they will recognize it.
It is preferable that the husband be with the scribe and the witnesses until it is written, signed, and given, so that he is aware. Also so that he does not speak about the divorce document until after it is given, so he does not say things that would nullify the divorce document.
24 If he wants to send the bill of divorce by means of a messenger, the messenger must stand there during the writing of the line on which the name of the man, woman, and date appear, and he must hear that [the scribe] begins to write for the sake [of this divorce], and he also must stand there at the time of the signing of the two witnesses, and must hear that they sign for the sake [of this divorce]. Comment [of Ramo]: And some say that the messenger should also be present at the command of the husband to the scribe and witnesses, and such is the practice. And it is proper to tell the messenger before anything else that it is prohibited for him to marry the divorced woman, so that he will not be able to say afterwards: 'had I known I would not have been a messenger.' The scholar organizing [the divorce] should also tell the messenger to make a clear sign on the get, [so that] if it leaves his hand he will recognize it. But he should be careful that it not leave his hand at all, as much as is possible. 
And it is required that prior to the writing, he will make it known to him that he will be the messenger. Also, before he commands the scribe to write, before he does anything, he must appoint the messenger. And see above, paragraph 97, how he should speak. And the rabbi (wise man) should say [to the messenger]: that he should listen to how the bill of divorce is being written for the husband so that he can testify to this effect.
when a person sends a Get by a messenger, it is better that the husband (the sender of the Get) will adjure the husband in a solemn oath (Oath of the Torah) that he  raise any doubts or negate the Get retroactively. Heaga (Rama): and if he (the husband) is a non observer of Halacha, the Beith din should adjure him on his part in the after life (Olam Haba), and it should be mentioned in writing in the Letter of Appointment. and see above, chapter 141, section 59. and it's customary  to make a ceremonial acquisition (kinyan) when the husband appoints the messenger. See below in paragraph 141:26.
It is necessary to be careful that the agent and the one appointing the agent should be adults, since there is no agency of a minor and a minor can not appoint an agent. Note: it is also necessary to appoint the agent in front of two valid witnesses. See above Siman 141 Se'if 11 and 24 how are are witnesses of agency practiced:
It is necessary that the agent should not be deaf mentally-handicapped a minor, nor a slave nor a non-Jew, or one invalidated [by committing] a transgression from the Torah see above Siman 141 Se'if 33:
It is good to be careful and not divorce [one's wife] via an agent when both the husband and wife are present in the city. (Investigate above, 141:55)
If  the husband is in a hurry to go and is unable to wait until he can write a bill of divorce and and sign it, he says to a scribe: write a bill of divorce for my wide etc, like above, and he says to witnesses: you so-and-so and so-and-so are witnesses and sign on the mentioned bill of divorce etc, like above, and I appoint you so-and-so the son of so-and-so an agent to send the mentioned bill of divorce  to my wife so-and-so the daughter of so-and-so [her father's name] in any place you find her and his [the agent's] hand like my hand and his mouth like my mouth and his actions like my actions, and. I give him permission to make an agent and [that] agent [my] agent until 100 agents and even without [being] forced until the bill of divorce mentioned reaches her hand or the hand of her agent, and immediately when the mentioned bill of divorce reaches her hand or the hand of her agent from the hand of so-and-so my agent or from the hand of his agent or from the hand of the agent of his agent as said she will be divorced from me and permitted to any man. And the other laws of agency and authorization, see above Siman 141:
31 And it was already explained one must not mention any condition before the writing of the bill of divorce; and if so [that a condition was mentioned] anyone who is obligated to divorce in this topic, is not able to divorce on a condition:
32: If he doesn't want to divorce [immediately] but some time [in the future], and he is in a hurry to leave, and it is not possible to write [the bill of divorce] before he leaves, then he should instruct his power of attorney to deliver the bill of divorce to his wife, and the divorce will only take  effect after the specified time.
The 'power of attorney' need not be present when appointed by the [husband] issuing the bill of divorce, but even in his absence the [husband] can appoint him. The witnesses must record that [the husband] assigned so and so as his agent. Footnote: All the above only applies when the husband is in a hurry to leave and doesn't hand the bill of divorce to the agent and it is [therefore considered] an emergency. Otherwise, however, we do not appoint a  'power of attorney' in this way, rather, [the husband] must hand the bill of divorce directly to the agent. Look further in this section, from paragraph 97 onwards.
34: I have already enumerated above, who are ineligible to serve as "powers of attorney"
35: In addition, it has already been explained, that the "power of attorney" has to stand during the writing of the fundamental portions of the bill of divorce  and the signing of the two witnesses, and he must hear that the [bill of divorce] was written expressly on behalf of the [husband and wife whose] names [appear in the get].
36: When the scribe is about to write the get, before he begins writing, he should ask the husband [initiating] the divorce, his name and his father's name, and if he or his father have two names as a result of [a name being added during an] illness, or if he or his father have any nickname, or derivative name , or if they are kohens or levites.
And similarly, one should ask the woman and her father [their names], as with the man. Rem"a: Regarding how we customarily write the names, see above Siman 128 and Siman 129 regarding the laws of location names. And this should be asked in front of witnesses.
The scribe and the witnesses must stand in a single place. Rem"a: And there are those who say that, before the scribe cuts the sheet of parchment, he should announce in front of the witnesses that he wishes to write with the intent [that it will be used by the particular man in question to divorce the particular woman in question], as will be explained later on in Se'if 55 [(Se'if 80 in this version)]. And this is our custom in these lands.
[The scribe] should cut the sheet of parchment according to the measurements [needed to write the] bill of divorce, so that he won't need to cut off anything from [the sheet] after the bill of divorce is written.
If the scribe erred after he wrote part of it, and he begins another [bill of divorce] on the same sheet, he should first cut off the bit that he wrote.
The length of the sheet of parchment must be longer than it is wide. And "length" refers to the direction that it is read from its beginning to its end. Rem"a: And he should leave enough [space] at the bottom of the sheet so [that it could be] grabbed by a hand, or more. But ex post facto, [one] need not be concerned [about this]. 
They should carve into it thirteen rows.  And he should divide the last row into two short rows, on which the witnesses may sign, one below the other.  And he shall make the carvings and all emended writings for his sake, for her sake, and for the sake of divorce.
There are those who say that a person should write on the place of the flesh and not on the place of the hair.
One should not etch [horizontal] lines [on the parchment] with lead, and one should not etch lines from the inside, but rather from the outside. Rem"a: And he should etch two [horizontal] lines on the sides of the bill of divorce, one from the right and one from the left, in order to align the writing (Seder HaGet). And he should align the writing to be next to the lines and not on the lines themselves.
There are those who say that we should not write a get with a feather quill. 
The script should not be slanted or messy, lest a letter be similar to a [different] letter, and ultimately the meaning will be changed.
[People] have practiced with stringency to make it such that the letters are surrounded by gewil (parchment).  And if it has letters that are attached, a person may scratch off the ink that is between them to separate them.  Investigate above 125:6.
And one's needs to be careful that the letters don't intersect each other, for example, the top of the <i> Lamed </i> on the line below should not intersect in the empty space of the <i> Hey </i> or the <i> Chet </i> of the line above, and so too others like this.
The letters may not cross over to the right or to the left onto the margins (the text must be "justified"). And [it is required] to be stringent [regarding this] with even one letter. 
If a drop of ink fell into a word, and it is not recognizable, one may not remove the ink to fix the letter, because that is like etching from the inside-out. (see above siman 125 section 8)
And even if he wanted to make an Open mem, and his hand slipped and [accidentally] closed it, he me not scratch out the connecting ink to open it because that would be "chok tochos" <i>see earlier, 125:9</i>
It should have no smudges, and one must not write it over an erasure.
One must be be when writing the form part of the <i>get</i> to ensure it is written properly.
And if a <i>get</i> was found invalid, a new <i>get</i> must be written. If the husband is still around, he must (explicitly) commission a new <i>get</i>, and re-designate witnesses.
When the scribe is about to write the <i>get</i> he should say to the witnesses: {Rema: [He should prepend the following] "Listen! You two; so and so, and so and so are the witnesses"} ... Behold I am writing this <i>get</i> for so and so, for the purpose of divorcing his wife such and such so that he may divorce her with it properly on his behalf and on hers and as a Divorce. And he should immediately write the <i>get</i>. Rema: He may not write it in multiple sittings, and should find or place some identifying mark on the <i>get</i> before he releases it.
The <i>get</i> must be dry before the witnesses sign it.
After the get is dry, the witnesses sign one below the other. Rema: They must read it before they sign so they know what they're signing, and they should look for the sign that they noticed (see earlier, se'if 22).
The witnesses must sign in each others' presence.
Each witness should declare [the following] before he signs: "I am signing this <i>get</i> for so and so, so that he may divorce his wife such and such, on his behalf and hers as a Divorce," and sign immediately.
They should start their signatures at the beginning of the line so as not to leave a margin on the right before the signature.
Do not leave two blank lines between the signature and the last line [of the get]. <i>The witnesses should sign using the husband's pen and ink.</i>
Each witness must spell out his name and his father's i.e.: So-and-so son of Such-and-such, witness. Rema: They do not need to sign all their nicknames and alia. However if they are Kohanim or Leviim they do sign "So-and-so son of Such-and-Such Hakohen/Halevi, witness" but not "son of Rabbi such-and-such" or similar
The writing of the witnesses should be perfect and recognizable, the letters should not be touching (each other), like the bill of divorce itself.
The writer of the divorce document should not sign or seal the document himself.
The signatures need to be dried.
The Chacham [Rabbi officiating the divorce] and the witnesses read the bill of divorce (gett) as well as the witnesses' signatures. (Rem"a) Note: and they are precise with it [in reviewing it] as to whether a word was omitted, as well as for spelling errors and all other corrections to the gett.It is good to check the gett against another gett, because then if there is a mistake he will notice immediately (from the Seder MaHariv); also [it is good to] send it to the rest of the important people in the city to review it and determine whether it was written properly, and they should be careful not to smudge it in sending it. Afterwards the husband returns and give the leftover parchment to the scribe as well as the ink and other writing materials, as a gift, so that he [the scribe] may write other bills of divorce (gittin) (from Sedarim). They are accustomed to bring ten people to the delivery of a gett, so as to publicize the event (R"I Mintz). Relatives can be counted as part of the quarum. We take [select] two qualified witnesses to be witnesses to the delivery. They are accustomed to take the witnesses that signed as the witnesses for delivery as well. They are also accustomed that the officiating rabbi stands in the middle and the two witnesses of delivery stand one to his right and one to his left, and the scribe stands in front of him and the husband and wife in front of him. Everyone stands and does not sit (in Tikkun Yashan and in the Or Zarua in the Chapter Ze Borrair). Some say (the one should) be careful not to give the gett in the house of the officiating rabbi; and I have not seen that people are careful to do so (in the abovementioned Tikkun cited as an oral transmission). [end of Rem"a Note - the Shulchan Aruch resumes:] After they have finished reading the officiating rabbi should ask the scribe: "Is this the gett that you have written? Rem"a Note: Did he give you all the writing instruments, the parchment and the ink? [end of Rem"a note] Did you write it with the command of the husband for his sake and for the sake of divorce of is wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so?" and he says: "Yes" Rem"a Note: "Did he tell you these things before witnesses?" [end of Rem"a Note] He then asks one of the witnesses: "Did you hear that the told the scribe to write for his sake and for the purpose of the divorce of his wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so?" 
Do you recognize that it is this bill of divorce?
Did you sign with the command of the husband (Rem"a:) who commanded you to sign for his sake and for her sake etc.
Did you sign for his sake and for the purpose of divorce of his wife so-and-so.
Do you recognize your seal (signature)?
You sealed it in the prescence of your friends.
Do you recognize his signature? (Rem"a) Did you hear when the husband told him to sign?
And he answers yes to each question. The second witness is also questioned in the same manner.  Rama: He also asks the scribe and the witnesses if they stated explicitly, when they began to write the get, that they are writing it in his (the husband's) name and her (the wife's) name and for the purpose of divorce. If each party heard the testimony of the other parties and they said yes (i.e. "likewise") they are re-questioned explicitly as to how they spoke (when writing the get) (in the Sedarim). The Sage should instruct the husband, the scribe, and the witnesses not to say "yes yes" or "no no" in their answers, rather only a single yes or no (Seder of Maharam Yaffe).
...74: afterwards when he will give her the writ of divorce, he then asks if it was given with his knowledge and with his consent, as we mentioned earlier. Ramah's Gloss: ...In Sif 14. There are formats of divorce documents that contain within them a nullification of these assertions before the sage reads the divorce document, and they confer with the scribe and the witnesses, as we have explained, prior to the reading of the divorce document. It is our local custom to act this way, but it essentially makes no difference. And when the sage reads the divorce document, he should read it punctiliously; not in a manner that would be more understood in another language.
75: He should also nullify these assertions a second time, and he should also disqualify the witnesses as we discussed previously. Rama: ...in section 20. And he should inquire of the witnesses whether or not the husband annulled these assertions before the document was handed over, as we explained previously in section 20. 
76: If the husband leaves his presence between the writing and the giving of the divorce document, then the sage imposes an oath upon him, a legitimate vow, that the document has not been invalidated for any reason, and no assertions or stipulations were given, and nothing was said that would cause this divorce document to become disqualified.
77: A quorum of ten men should be assembled, in order to give it in the presence of ten men.
78: The sage should proclaim before all who are present, before the document is given over: "If anyone knows of any disqualification in this document and wishes to make the matter known, should speak up before it is handed over." Rama: And anyone with any knowledge of this sort is required to reveal it. For after it is given over we institute a ban against anyone attempting to disqualify this divorce document. See above in this section, paragraph 22 as it has relevance to our case. 
79: The sage should say: "All those present who are qualified to testify should listen and bear witness".
80: It is preferable that the witnesses who signed the document be present.
He tells the woman to remove the rings that are on her hands, and after this she should take her hands, open them and put them together, in order to receive the <i> Get </i>, and her hands should not be like a slope, allowing the <i> Get </i> to fall. Rem"a: We have the custom to cover the woman's face until the elder speaks with her and she has received the <i>Get</i> because of modesty. And he asks her if she is accepting the <i> Get </i> willingly and she says: yes. And there those who are stringent and say that they should ask if she swore so that [the elder] can annul them for her. And the elder who has arranged the <i> Get </i> says: Know that with this <i> Get </i> you will be divorced from your husband. And the Rabbi asks about the <i> Ketubah </i> [to obtain it] and that she should return the <i> Ketubah </i> to her husband or relinquish [the right to the money], so that they won't come to an argument later because of the <i> Ketubah </i> and so that the husband doesn't say: It was because of this that I didn't divorce her (This reason is brought from the Mahri Mintz).
He [the elder] should be careful that her friends or anyone else don't help her [at the time of reception of the <i> Get </i>]. And that an overall (???) or any other object doesn't come to her hand at the time of the reception.
She should be careful that she doesn't clench her hand until he says to her [the previously mentioned phrases] and that her her hands are not within three <i> Tefachim </i> of the ground (ibid.)
The husband should hand the "Get" to the hand of the women, and he should say: "This is your Get, and accept this Get. You are divorced from me because of the Get from now, and you are now allowed to be with any other man".  Rama: Before he gives it to her, the Rabbi should tell witnesses to witness the handing over of the Get. The Rabbi should also tell the husband the meaning of the words he is saying. Some have the custom to fold the Get before he hands it over, and that is our custom. Some write not fold it, rather give it to her with the writing on the outside, so everyone sees that it is a Get.
After he places the get into her hand and removes his hand completely, she then closes her hand and holds onto the get and raises her two hands upwards, and afterwards the Rabbi takes the get from her hand and reads it a second time in front of witnesses. Rem"a: Some [opinions] say we go back and ask the writer [of the get] and the witnesses all of the questions that we asked in the beginning (27, in their order).  We also [impose a] ban upon anyone who has spread a rumor about this get.
And tear it lengthwise and widthwise. Note: Today, the officiating rabbi stores it himself and does not give it to the woman, and this should not be changed. And any _get_ which was not given should not be torn so that no one should think it was given.
The Rabbi warns the woman not to become engaged until 90 days [have passed], not including that day. Rem"a: Except for the day she will become engaged.
The giving of the divorce document, according to some opinions needs to be by day specifically and not at night. (look earlier at the end of chapter 123)
And so too, if the community has  said the evening prayer, although it is still day, one may still not deliver a _get_, since it is already considered night, [and this all applies] if it is not consider a situation of urgency, [that if it is a situation of urgency] even at actual nighttime you may write it and you may give it. One needs to give the _get_ on the very same day it is written, however [if this is not possible] he sends it to another city, in the event that it is impossible for him to give it to her on the  [same] day it was written.
90: Her husband must not seclude himself with her between the writing and the giving [of the get]. And if he did seclude himself with her,  then the get is an old get, and he cannot use it to divorce her. (See above, siman 149).
A messenger who comes to bring a get[=writ of divorce] gives to her in front of two [witnesses].  If the messenger is a relative or impermissible as a witness, he gives to her in front of three [witnesses]. He [the messenger] says to her at the time of giving [the get]:   'This your get that your husband x son of y, also known as z; and behind your are divorced from him through it And you are permitted to any man. And this get was written and signed in front of me. Comment: And also for a writ of divorce from engagement; the messenger says to her: 'This your writ of divorce sent by your husband.' And then the name of the husband is written in the permission area. But in questions that the rabbi asks the messenger the name of the engaged man is mentioned, for example if he asks if this is the get sent by engaged man x. The rabbinical court in front of him the get is to be given reads it [the get] before it is given and if there is a condition regarding the get [without thich the fulfillment of the condition the get is invalid], the messenger says at the time of giving, '[this get is given] on conditions of x and y [being fulfilled].'and see above #142 about the order of the messenger giving it to the hand of the women and above # 140, 2. There are those who arrange divorces and this is how they act:  the seated [rabbis acondition. ask the messenger what he wants and he replies: 'I send x son of y to divorced my wife z, etc.' And they [the judges] ask him if the husband stipulated a time to divorce or if he did not stipulate any other condition. And he [the messager says [the condition/s] to them. Bthen they ask the women if she wants to receive the get. After this they ask about the permission and they read it to her if she fixed it and if she fulfills it as usual. After this the judges ask the messenger if the husband was healthy at the time it was sent or if he [the messenger] heard that he [the husband] died or canceled the sending and he [the messenger] answers about all of it.  Translation incomplete.
If the divorced woman is a naarah[=young woman], whether engaged or married, she is divorced when she receives the get[=writ if divorce] itself. If her father receives it [the get], if she was engaged as long as she has not reached maturity, she is divorced. However, if she reached maturity, even though she was only engaged, or if she was married while still a minor, she is not divorced through the receipt of her father.
If she is a minor, and she married, she is not divorced [with the get] accepted by her father. [I.E he receives the money on her behalf]
And if she is an engaged minor, according to all she is divorced through her father. There is a disagreement if she is divorced through herself [i.e. she does it], and it is advisable to be stringent, that she does not receives it except through her father.
A minor may be divorced only when she can tell the difference between her get and some other object, such that she will take a bundle and throw it away, or take a nut and keep it, or when she has reached the age of children, which is six or seven. But younger than that, she may not be divorced, according to Rashi, even by her father. But according to Rabbenu Tam, this ruling is specific to being divorced by herself and she may be divorced by her father, and the Ro"sh agreed with this. 
A minor who was divorced with her father as agent: we should be strict and write two bills of divorce and give them to her. One should be in the formula of all other bills of divorce and the second, "your daughter plonit that you married to etc...." Rem"a: but if the bill of divorce is passed to the minor with her father's knowledge, only one bill of divorce is needed, just like all other bills of divorce. See sections 141 and 37 above. 
If one passes his bill of divorce to a messenger to deliver to his wife, [the messenger] should be appointed in front of two witnesses. 
Afterward, the rabbi should return the get to the husband, and the husband should give it to his agent and say: "You, Ploni son of Ploni, called Ploni, bring this get to my wife Plonit daughter of Ploni, in whatever place she may be found, and let your hand be as my hand, and your mouth as my mouth, and your words as my words, and your deeds as my deeds, and your giving as my giving. I give you permission to appoint additional agents, even a hundred, without force, until this get arrives in the hand of my wife or her agent, and as soon as this get arrives in her hand or that of her agent, let her be divorced from me and permitted to marry any man as mentioned above."  Rem"a: The wife's agent should take the get as she herself would. And then the rabbi should read the get and ask all of the questions and impose a ban on anyone who has spread rumors about this get, as described in Even HaEzer 154:85. And he should fold it like a letter and give it to the agent, and after that they should write the authorization and not earlier, because the authorization says that it was written in our presence, as detailed in Even HaEzer 141:30. For the laws of a second agent, see Even HaEzer 141:40 and 142:9. And the procedure for the authorization may be found in the order of Gitin. But the precise language does not invalidate it, as I wrote above in 141:30. And when the first agent makes a second one, it seems to me that one should ask him all of the questions that they ask him when he gives the get to the woman, because the second agent says nothing else besides "I am an agent of the court." Therefore, the first court should investigate thoroughly, as described above in Even HaEzer 154:91.
If he gives her the get on a condition, he should say when he gives it to her: "This is hereby your get, and you are hereby divorced from me and permitted to any man, on the condition that I have not come to you between today and the 12th of the month, and you will have been divorced starting now. But if I come within the aforementioned time, and am seen by so-and-so, let this not be a get, and she is hereby trusted to say that I have not come and not appeased her."
If the divorcer is critically ill, he should say to his wife when giving her a get: this is hereby your get and you are divorced by it from me from now, and permitted to marry any man on the condition that if I have not died by such-and-such a day inclusive, it will not be a get, but if I have died by that day, this get will have been in force starting now.  Rem"a: See above 145:5. And afterwards, she should not be secluded with him unless another is with them, even a servant of a maid, not including her family or her minor son (Tur Siman 148).
A person should be very careful not to complicate matters concerning gittin, unless he is skilled in the laws of gittin, because the laws are full of intricacies, and a person could easily make a mistake that would cause a mamzer. And may the Rock of Israel save us from errors, Amen. Rem"a: The beginning of this siman details the wording of the get that is customary in this region, especially in this city. And this is the wording: "On Tuesday, on the third day of the month of Sivan, in the year 5340 since the creation of the world, in the city of Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers (Krakow?) and on spring water-- I, so-and-so called so-and-so, son of so-and-so called so-and-so, standing today in Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers and on spring water, willingly consent, without coercion, to release, send away, and divorce you, my wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so, who is present today in Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers and on spring water, who has been my wife until now. And I release, send away, and divorce you, such that you are permitted and have authority over yourself to marry any man you want with no interference from now on, because you are hereby permitted to any moan. This is hereby your bill of dismissal, document of sending-away, and letter of divorce from me, in accordance with the Law of Moses and Israel. Signed, so-and-so and so-and-so, witnesses"

Seder Halitzah

THE CONDENSED ORDER OF HALITZA WHICH CONTAINS FIFTY-SEVEN PARAGRAPHS:<br> 1) The commandment of halitza [requires] three judges, even if they are laypeople, as long as they are able to read. REMA: from the outset the custom is to have the wisest of the city along with two of repute from the city, and they are the judges. We also take the two that are added on from the important men of the congregation; and they should not be blind, even in one eye. And there are those that are strict that there not be any blemishes in them at all. And it is praiseworthy for them to ponder repentance in their heart lest they may have sinned and are disqualified from judgement.
2) Each of them must be Israelites; that is, that none of them have a mother or father who converted.
3) Nor should they be relatives of one another, nor of the widow or the brother in law; and even if they have married daughters of two brothers or of two sisters, or a woman and the daughter of her sister, we are strict because of false impressions. REMA: see above at the beginning of this section paragraph 1. 
4) Nor should any one of them be disqualified from judging financial cases. REMA: see above in paragraph 2 at the beginning of this section. 
5) Once the three judges have met together another two are added to publicize the facts. Even if they are simpletons who do not know how to read, or if they are close-relations, the type that would not disqualify them from being judges; but all other factors would disqualify them as it would the first three. REMA: from the outset these two should not be relations of the judges. 
6) A place for halitza should be established, the first three should say to the additional two [judges]: tomorrow we shall go to 'this' place to do halitza there. REMA: and the custom is to go to the place where they will sit the next day and sit there a bit. And the custom is for the additional two to go with the court, but this is not hinder [the halitza if it wasn't done], rather the court just informs the two where they should go and the three [judges] go (so it seems from the Haggahot Mordechai). Yet there are those that say that even the visit does not hinder, just that they say one to another - that tomorrow we will go and do halitza in this particular place (Ohr Zarua). And it isn't required that all three judges speak of it, just that the senior amongst them say it on behalf of the other two (Beit Yosef - so I found it written). Nonetheless, there are those who are strict that each of the three say it. See below in the commentary on the Order of Halitza paragraph 12. 
7) The setting of the place, needs to be on the evening of the day before the halitza. REMA: see below in the commentary to the Order of Halitza paragraph 15. 
8) If the halitza is on Sunday, we do not set the place on the  Sabbath, rather it is done on the eve of the Sabbath. 
9) The place that they set for the halitza, it needs to be at the heights of the town, that is: a well-known place.
10) On the day that they set the place, they send [a message/messenger] to the widow to inform her that on the day of the halitza she should not eat REMA: or drink, anything until she has had halitza. REMA: nor should she spit in front of the court in front of whom she will be having halitza, nor should she speak a lot, nor should she pick her teeth before the halitza. And we repeat these warnings to her on the morning before the halitza as well. And it is the custom for the brother in law to wash his leg the day before the halitza so that it will be easy to wash it on the day of the halitza. It is also good for him to cut his toenails. They [the judges] shall also check on that day if they are of majority age and fitting for halitza. Everything else that needs to be checked - it is better for them to be checked the day before the halitza. They should also teach the brother in law and the widow to read properly, in one breath (all this is explained in the Order(s)).
11) We do not do halitza at night, nor on the Sabbath or a Holy Day, nor on Sabbath or Holy Day eves REMA: but on the intermediary days of a festival we do halitza. (Beit Yosef) 
12) On the day of the halitza the five judges should come to the place they set, and the three primary judges sit on one bench REMA: the senior one sits in the middle. And the two additional (judges) sit in front of them on another bench, REMA: there are those that say they sit on the side, and so is the custom. And the brother in law and the widow stand in the middle. REMA: the brother in law and the widow should go to the judges, and not the judges to them, as it says "his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders" Deuteronomy 25:7. Nonetheless, if the judges went to them, the halitza is not negated.
13) Other people are brought in to be there at the time of the halitza, there should be at least five, along with the judges the total should be ten. REMA: therefore the custom today is to go to do the halitza immediately after the end of synagogue morning services, for at that time there are a lot of people, and the senior amongst them should say to his counterpart amongst the community members: let us go to do halitza in the place that we set yesterday. 
And all of those coming there are required to sit at a distance from the judges. (HaMapach: And no person should sit upon the benches where the judges sit when they perform chalitzah in before them. Also, they must arrange for two competent witnesses and stand them [the witnesses] next to the benches so the judges may inquire concerning the brother-in-law and the widow, to see whether it is appropriate to perform chalitzah. The brother-in-law must dress himself as a mourner, and so too the widow.)
The court should warn the yevama (levirate wife) not to spit in front of the yavam until she removes [the shoe]. Rama:  They should be extremely careful that they do not arrive at [lit.: it shall not arise in their hands] an invalid chalitza, so that she should not need to receive chalitza afterward from all the brothers (Hagahot Alfasi, end of laws of Chalitza), and see infra chapter 170. 
16 - It is necessary that neither the brother-in-law nor the widow be a minor, deaf so as to be unable to hear and speak, mute, or a simpleton. 
It is necessary that the yavam performing chalitza (i.e. undergoing the chalitza ceremony) should not be blind, if he has a brother who is not blind.
It is required that the yavam's foot should not be twisted backward or turned on its side, and also that he does not walk on his toes.
If the yavam is a convert, it is required that the court knows whether his conception and the deceased brother's conception and their birth were in sanctity (from Jewish parentage).
The court must know whether the deceased brother left viable seed. Rama: All these investigations are asked of the witnesses at the time of the chalitza ceremony, so that the matter shall be publicized. And so it is organized here in the text of the Seder Chalitza above from section 16 through section 28. They (the court) also announce publicly that they had already inquired the day before regarding the signs (sexual characteristics) of the man and woman to confirm that they are adults.
The court must know whether this yavam is the paternal brother of the deceased, and whether they "sat together" (i.e. if they ever lived at the same time) in the world. 
The court must know if this yavam is the eldest of the [surviving] brothers.
They must know if this woman was the wife of the yavam's deceased brother.
Testimony on these matters is believed from a single witness, even a woman, or [Canaanite] slave or maidservant, or a minor who is aware and wise.
Court should know whether 92 days have passed since the death of the husband. See infra in explanation of the Seder Chalitza section 39.
The court must know if he is left-footed.
The court must know if the yevama is left-handed.
They initially seat the yavam and yevama. Rama: The judges or the chief among them asks the yavam what he requests, and the yavam should tell them that he comes to release the yevama via chalitza, and judge asks the yevama is she desires to undergo chalitza (remove the shoe), and she says, "yes".  He then tells them, "Arise". The yevama stands to the right of the yavam.
The yavam and yevama stand on their feet. If the yevama desires to undergo levirate marriage, they (the court) say to the yavam, "If you so desire, release [the yevama] via chalitza, if you desire take her in levirate marriage."  He answers that he does not desire levirate marriage. If the yavam prefers levirate marriage and the yevama does not, or she is one of the women who require chalitza release, but (by Rabbinic law) may not undergo levirate marriage, they initially teach him to respond that he does not desire levirate marriage. They say thusly to him, "Do you desire to release this [woman] your yevama with chalitza?" and he answers, "Yes". Rama: Some say that they always ask whether he wants to perform levirate marriage or to release the woman via chalitza.  Even though chalitza is preferable, they nevertheless ask him so that he explicitly states that he wants to release the woman with chalitza, and they should determine that he was already satisfied with chalitza, and he says that he desires chalitza, and this is the proper custom.  Some add that if the yavam already has a wife, the court tells him that he is still permitted to "marry" (i.e. take the yevama in levirate marriage) and this would not run afoul of the excommunication of Rabbenu Gershom [against bigamy]. See also in the Seder Chalitza sections 44 and 46.
The yavam and yevama must know that with this chalitza ceremony she will permitted to marry freely.
He may not be forced into the chalitza ceremony against his will.
If he previously swore to release with chalitza or not to release, they (the court) first release him from his oath. Rama: They should warn the husband (yavam) and wife (yevama) not to answer "yes, yes" or "no, no", but rather a single yes for a positive response and a single no for a negative response. The should also communicate in the vernacular so that all understand. See also in explanation of Seder Chalitza, chapter 68.
He must first invalidate any prior disclaimers delivered regarding this chalitza. Similarly he must invalidate any witnesses who might testify that he delivered disclaimers regarding this chalitza. The sage should say to the yavam, "Say: (i.e. repeat after me) I hereby invalidate any disclaimer, and any disclaimer of a disclaimer and so on unto eternity that I may have delivered regarding this chalitza. And any words (conditions) which if they were to be fulfilled would cause this chalitza to be invalidated are hereby invalidated. Similarly I testify regarding myself that I have not delivered any item by which this chalitza would become invalidated. And I hereby disqualify any witness or witnesses who may testify that I delivered or spoke any item that would cause this chalitza to be invalidated or would weaken its strength.  
The court must take care to avoid (lit.: that there should arise in their hands) any invalid chalitza. 
[The judge] must ask the yevama if she ate or drank today.
The sage shall take the shoe in his hand and inspect it that there shall be no mud stuck on the inside -- Note: and that it is made according to halachic requirements. 
He shall instruct the yavam to carefully wash his right foot. Rama: He shall dry it well, wrap it in a cloth, and walk in it. 
The yavam shall tie the corner of his pants above his foreleg (tibia).  Rama: The judges shall inspect to see that his foot is clean of any dirt. 
The owner of the shoe shall give the shoe to the yavam as a gift -- Note: and the yavam shall make a formal acquisition by lifting [up the shoe]. 
The yavam shall put the shoe on his bare right foot, without any socks, but rather directly contacting his flesh. Note: It should be the proper size for the yavam's foot, and should not reach above the knee.
He shall put the clasps of the shoe into the loops. Rama: There are arrangements (chalitza how-to texts) in which it is written that the arranging Rabbi puts the shoe on to the yavam and ties it properly, but if the yavam is capable of doing it himself there is no reason for concern and it is acceptable. 
He shall tie the straps twice around his foreleg, from the knee and below, and insert them in the eyelets of the shoe such that the straps reach the flesh of his foreleg posteriorly. Note: He shall ascertain that the straps are adjacent one to another as much as possible (all of the above is found in various chalitza arrangement texts). And see further in the explanation of the Seder Chalitza section 58 and section 59.
He shall tie the two straps on the flesh of the foreleg anteriorly, one knot atop the other, tight, with the ends twisted (i.e. tucked and wrapped into the straps).
The yavam must walk four cubits while wearing the chalitza shoe on his foot. Note: He should walk in front of the judges so they can see which is his dextrous foot (ibid). And see also in the explanation of Seder Chalitza section 62.
They stand the yavam next to a wall or pillar so that he may support himself. Note: He should take care not to lean so much that if they removed the pillar he would fall, for this is not called standing.
In all matters of the chalitza ceremony, whether with respect to the recitation, the taking off of the shoe, or the spitting, the judges should be sitting, while the yavam and yevama should be standing. Note: The yevama should be placed facing the yavam so that her speech is directed at him, in front of the court. 
They teach her (the yevama) and the yavam to read, so that he and her will be fluent (in reading the required texts aloud) and able to recite "lo avah"  (Deuteronomy 25:7 - he does not desire) in one breath. Note: They explain the nature of the proceedings to the yavam and the yevama, that she will be released from the yavam, and permitted to marry any man, and we ask them to have this intention, and they answer, "yes".
They have the yevama recite (in Hebrew): "My yavam refuses to establish for his brother a name in Israel, he declines levirate marriage" (Deuteronomy 25:7). The words are narrated one at a time, except [the two words] "lo avah" (he declines) are read together. This recitation and the other recitations must be in the holy language. Note: if they (the yavam or yevama) in a word, he should return to the beginning of the text (Seder Maharil).
They have the yavam say, "I do not want to take her" (Deut. 25:8). And they say the word, "to take her," with a mappiq in the "he." Moreover, he must say these words in one breath.
The yavam must understand the words of the yevamah, as well as what he [says in] response.
The yavam should lean against the wall or the pillar behind him, and press his leg against the floor. Note: they should warn him not to help the yevama remove his shoe. 
"And the yevama shall approach him" (Deuteronomy 25:9), and loosens the knots of the shoe with her right hand, without the assistance of the left. She then opens the clasps, the lowest one first [and proceeding to the top]. She grasps his foot with her left hand, lifts it from the floor, removes the shoe from the heel, and takes off the entire shoe using her right hand without assistance from the left, and without assistance from the yavam, whether from his hand or his leg, and throws the shoe to the ground, at some distance. The yevama remains standing throughout this procedure, bent over but not sitting or kneeling. The Rabbi tells her to gather a large quantity of spittle in her mouth, not a yawn or a sneeze. She should not spit plain water, but only actual spittle. 
The yevama stands opposite the yavam, and shall spit on the floor a large spit in front of his face. The five judges must see the spittle as it leaves her mouth and until it lands on the ground in front of the yavam.
They narrate to her in Hebrew [and she says]: "Thus shall be done to the man who will not establish his brother's house, and it shall be named in Israel the house of the shoe removal" (Deuteronomy 25:9-10). [They repeat] "the house of the shoe removal, the house of the shoe removal".
Everyone present responds and says, "the shoe is removed" three times.
The yavam returns the shoe to the judges. The judges say, "May it be [G_d's] will that the daughters of Israel shall not come to require chalitza or levirate marriage."
I have found written in an Ashkenazic chalitza arrangement: When the yavam and yevama arise, the Rabbi says (a blessing): "Blessed are you, Lord, our G_d, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with his commandments, and charged us in the commandments and laws of our father Abraham." And the reason, as stated in chapter "Kisui hadam" (Chullin chapter 6) as reward for Abraham saying "and to a shoelace" (Genesis 14:23), his descendents merited the shoe of chalitza. It should be said without saying the name of G-d or his kingship. Rama: There are chalitza arrangements in which it is written to declare excommunication on those who slander the chalitza, but I have not seen people follow this custom.
