A fruit that became infested - but we do not know if it became infested while attached to detached - is assur. 

If one violated and cooked within 12 months without checking, if he is able to check, he checks. And if not, it is permitted. And if a bit were found in the pot, he throws them away and eats the rest, because there is no fruit that does not contain 60 against the taste of the worm that is inside it. And there is an opinion that says that these words are only if only one or two were found. But if three or four were found, everything is forbidden. Haga”h: And only a food that it is impossible to filter it and to remove the worms from them. And since it is assumed to have worms it is all forbidden. But if it is possible to filter it, he removes the worms that are found there, and the rest is permitted. And see later end of chapter 100.
