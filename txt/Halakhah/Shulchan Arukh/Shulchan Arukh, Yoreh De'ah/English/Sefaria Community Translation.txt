Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah



Siman 1

1.	All may slaughter (shecht), at the outset, even women . Rema: {There are those that say that women should not be permitted to shecht, as we have already established a custom that (women) are not to shecht, and thus the tradition (holds) that women do not shecht.} Slaves and anyone, even if you do not know that he does not faint (because of shechting), even if you do not know if he is an expert that knows the laws of shechita (kosher slaughter), it is permitted from the outset to let him shecht and it is permitted to eat from his shechita. This is because the majority of those that regularly shecht are under the presumption of being tested experts (in shechita). What situation are we talking about here? (We are talking about  a situation) where that person is not in front of us, only then is it permitted to eat from his shechita, and we rely on the presumption (referenced to above). However if he is before us we need to check him, if he is an expert and knows the laws of shechita, however we do not need to ask if he faints. Rema: {There are those that say that one should only rely on the presumption after the fact,and that initially the presumption should not be relied upon if you are in a place where you can clarify him (the Shochet's [kosher slaughterer's] abilities). All this applies to those that aren't proficient and need to know if this Shochet is proficient. But the Shochet himself shall not shecht, even if he knows the laws of shechita and is proficient, until he has shechted 3 times in front of a learned man and one that is proficient in the laws of shechita. Therefor we practice that a man shall not shecht without having obtained kabalah (ordination) from before a learned one.      And the learned one should not give kabalah until he knows that he (the Shochet) knows the laws of shechita and is proficient with his hands. Therefor we practice that all who come to shecht we trust them initially and we don't check them before or after. Because all that are found to be shechting have already received kabalah from before a learned one. And in a few places they are more stringent. That the one who received (kabalah) also gets a written letter from the learned one, as proof that he has given him kabalah. And every Shochet, even though he has recieved kabalah, it is fitting that he should return to the chapters of laws of shechita. That they (the laws of shechita) should live in his mouth and in his heart, so that he will not forget them. And like in the laws of shechita and with one that comes to shecht thus is the ruling in the laws of bedikaht hare'ah (checking the lungs for disqualifying sickness) and one that comes to check (the lungs). And their (shechita's and behikah's) rules and customs are all equal in all of this. And it is fitting for a Jewish court to investigate and the bodkim (checkers of disqualifying sickness) and shochtim (kosher slaughterers). Because large is the transgression in bedikot and shechitot, that are applicable to all. And if they checked some Shochet or bodek and it is found that he does not know, if at one time he received kabbalah we do not deem all everything he has shechted in the past to be treif (unkosher), for we say that only now did he become bad. But if one has never received kabalah, everything that he has shechted will become treif, and also all the dishes on which what he shechted was cooked would need to be kashered}...
2.	One does not need to know all of the different details of the laws (of shechita), rather if one says "concerning this matter I would be in doubt and ask (a competent authority)", such an individual is called "knowledgeable", until he calls that which is forbidden permitted. Rema: {And we check him about the laws of shechita that will be explained later in the beginning of S23 and in the rules of checking of the knife and in the rules of checking the simanim after shechita that will be explained in S25. And if he shechts and is not here in front of us to check, we none the less check the simanim to see if the majority of them was shechted, because whatever is possible to check we do. And this is all in places where there is not a custom to get kabbalah, but in places where the custom is to get kabbalah, like the sons of Ashkenaz and others that follow them, we do not customarily check after him at all, as will be explained (later)}...
3.	A person who we know that he does not know the laws of shechita, even if he shechts in front of us 4 or 5 times a proper and fitting shechita, and afterwards shechts privately his shechita is not kosher. Even if they ask him, "did you do such and such?" and from his answer it seems he shechted correctly, we do not rely on him. And even if he says "It is clear to me that I shechted beautifully." Rema: {a person who regularly faints, and we know he is not muchzak (established as not fainting), and he shechts and says "It is clear to me that I did not faint", (he is) believed. This is because he knows the laws of shechita.} And someone who we know does not know the laws of shechita, we can let him shecht if someone supervises him. This is only if he watches him from the beginning of the shechita until the end of it (the shechita). Rema: {And some are strict and forbid to let him shecht lehathila (initially). This is because he does not know the laws of schechita, and thus is the practice.}.
4.	If his goats or chickens are lost or stolen, and he found them properly slaughtered; in a place where the majority of people are Jews (and also the majority of the thieves in the city are Jews), they are permissible (to eat) - whether he found them in the market or he found them in the refuse heap of a home. But if he found them in the refuse heap in the market, they are forbidden.
5.	A person who is mute: that does not speak and does not hear; and a mentally disabled person, which is one who goes out himself at night or rips his clothes or sleeps in a graveyard or losses what is given to him… even just one of these, if he does it in the way of a crazy person; and a minor who does not know how to train his hands to shecht; we do not let them shecht lehat’hila (initially). Even if others are standing over them. And if they (none the less) shechted, their shechita is kosher if others were standing over them. But we do not allow them to shecht lehat’hila when others are not stand standing over them, even if we want to feed (the meat) to dogs. If a minor knows how to train his hands, if others are standing over him, he can shecht lehat’hila and it is allowed to eat from his shechita. Rema: { However, if he shechts for himself, than his shechita is disqualified, even if he knows the laws of shechita; he is considered a minor with regards to this matter (of shechita) until he has become bar-mitzvah, which is 13 years and 1 day [old]. There are those that are strict to not give kabalah to anybody less than 18 years old. For then he is a “man with wisdom”, and knows to be careful.}
6.	One who is: a person with hearing-loss, which speaks but cannot hear- he shall not shecht. This is because he does not hear the blessing. If he shechts, even by himself, the slaughter is valid...
7.	One who hears but does not speak, if he is skilled, he can even shecht lehat’hila if another blesses...
8.	A drunk person who reaches the drunkenness of Lot, his ruling is that of a person of cognitive incapability(a mentally-disabled person. Refer above.) If he has not reached the drunkenness of Lot, he can shecht lehat’hila. Rema: {And there are those that say that one who is drunk should not shecht, because for him to come to derasa (chopping, which is forbidden in shechita).}...
9.	A blind person, shall not shecht lehat’hila, unless others are watching him. And if he shechted, his shechita is kosher...
10.	A naked person shall not shecht lehat’hila, this is because he cannot make a blessing...
11.	If the community established a decree, that none should shecht other than a known butcher, and another shechted, there are those that say his shechita is forbidden . Rema: {If the decree was nullified than all the shochtim are in a presumption of kosher[shechita], as in the beginning.}...
12.	One who shechts, in front of witnesses, an animal for an idol worshiper, then, when a Jew comes to buy it from him, he says “don’t buy (meat) from this animal because I did not shecht it” he is not believed.  However, to himself(the Shochet) it(the meat) is forbidden , since he declared it to be a forbidden cut/slice for himself (by his statement that it wasn't kosher)...
13.	 A butcher that makes a sign on the head of the sheep that was shechted, that it should be seen that it (the sheep) is treif, and he also said that it is treif. And afterwards he said that it was kosher, and that he only said this in order that they would not take it so that he should be able to take meat from it. Because he gave a reason for his words, he is trusted... 
14.	 If one witness said that a shochet did not shecht correctly. And he (the shochet) denies it, one witness against a denial is nothing (not considered sufficient proof). And to the witness himself  it is allowed to eat from here (the shochet’s meat) and to the next. In any case, everything is according to the man...

Siman 2

The shechita of a non-jew, (the animal slaughtered has the status of a) nevilah (animal which was not shechted or shechted improperly). Even if he (the non-Jew) was a minor and even if the non-jew does not worship idols. Rema: {For example, a legal resident (a non Jew who does not worship idols and lives among Jews)} and even if others watch him. 
If a wanton sinner who eats a nevilah* and deliberately (slaughters), if a Jew first checks the knife that he is given, only then are we allowed to eat from what he slaughtered even if he slaughters alone (only) if he knows the laws of slaughter. However if the knife is not checked from the beginning, it is forbidden to eat what he slaughtered until we check the knife at the end. And if it’s not given to him in the beginning in order to slaughter, even if a trustworthy person stood over him to assist, without checking the knife from the beginning, we don’t rely that the knife was fit to slaughter.(even if you plan to check it at the end)
A wanton sinner * who intends to slaughter, even if he swears that he slaughtered with a good knife he is not believed....(*carcass of a kosher animal not killed in accordance with Jewish law and therefore forbidden for consumption.**a ”mumar leteiavon” does not mean an apostate, it means a wanton sinner who sins out of lust or desire, not out of heresy)

Domesticated animals, wild animals, and birds require ritual slaughter [to be permitted to eat]; fish and grasshoppers do not require ritual slaughter. Rama: And it is permitted to eat them dead or to cut off a limb from them and eat it, but it is forbidden to eat them alive because of the prohibition against being disgusting.

Siman 14


He extended his hand and retracted it (meaning before the slaughtering): what emerged from the limb outside is forbidden. But what remained inside and the place of the cut is permitted. If he did not retract it before the slaughtering, even the place of the cut is forbidden, but what is inside is permitted, even if it is a minority. Gloss: All this refers only to the matter of it being permitted by the slaughtering of its mother like any other fetus found within it. However, if the animal later gave birth, even the limb that emerged and was retracted is permitted, because its own slaughtering permits everything. This is the conclusion of the Beit Yosef and Rabbi Yosef Ibn Habib, and Kol Bo in the name of some authorities, and this is also proven by the Maharshal in Perek Behemah Hamakshah, Siman 1, and this is the implication of the poskim, and it is obvious.

1. One that shechts with a checked knife and (after the shechita) finds it to be nicked, Rama: {Even from the side.} behold this is a neveila (animal which was killed improperly). Even if (the knife) touched the neck bone we do not attribute it to having been nicked by it (the neck bone) after the shechita. Rather we worry that maybe it was nicked by the skin and he happened to have shechted with a nicked knife, and this is even with a chicken (whose neck skin is very soft)...
2. The measure of a nick is anything, provided that something (can) gets stuck in it, even a strand of hair...
3. One must check the knife before shechita, and if one didn't check one shall not shecht. If one transgressed and did not check beforehand, and (instead) checked afterwards and found the knife to be suitable (not nicked), his shechita is kosher

Any butcher which does not know the laws of shechita it is not permissible to eat from his shechita. And these are the laws: pausing(shehiya), chopping (drasa), covering (halada), missing Missing (cutting outside the permitted area - hagrama), and tearing (ikour).

Siman 28

One who slaughters a wild animal or a bird needs to cover its blood, whether it was just trapped now or whether it was already ready in his hand. Rema: And the covering is a commandment onto itself, but the slaughtering is valid even if [the blood] was purposely not covered.
One is obligated to make a blessing before he covers [the blood]: "... who sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us on covering blood in dirt." <i>Rema: One who slaughters for the first time, makes a blessing of "that he gave us life" on the covering but not on the slaughtering since it damages a creature.</i>
the Koy animal which is questionable if it's a wild animal, and mixed-breeds that come from domesticated and wild animals, one needs to cover their blood and there is no blessing made. And we don't slaughter them on holidays. And if they were slaughtered [on a holiday] their blood it not covered. And [after the holiday] at night, if [the blood's] imprint is recognizable, he should cover it. 
The buffalo, we have the custom to not cover its blood. <i>Rema: There are those who question if a buffalo is a "wild" ox or maybe it's a [species] of wild animal, therefore, it's good to cover [the blood] without a blessing or to also slaughter a bird and then he is able to make a blessing on the covering on account of the bird.</i>
There needs to be loose earth below [the blood]. And one needs to designate it verbally, and there are those that say that there is no need.
One covers it with his hand or with a knife or with another utensil, but not with his foot so that the commandments aren't denigrated on account of it.
If one slaughtered and there was no earth below, he needs to scrape off the blood [from the knife] and put it on loose earth and cover it with loose earth.
The one who slaughters he is the one who should cover. And if he didn't cover and someone else sees [the blood, the other person] is required to cover it.
If one slaughters a hundred wild animals or a hundred birds or he slaughtered a wild animal and a bird in the same place, he does one covering for all of them.
One who slaughters and the blood got absorbed into the ground, if the imprint is recognizable he is required to cover it.
If the wind covered it he is exempt from covering it; but if after [the wind covered it] it returned and uncovered it, he is required to cover it. But if he himself covered it and it became uncovered, he is not required to cover it again.
Blood that fell into water or if water fell into the blood, if there is still the appearance of blood one is required to cover it, but if not he is exempt.
If the blood became mixed with red wine or the blood of a domesticated animal, we view the wine and the blood of the domesticated animal as if it were water, and if [the blood] would have mixed with that amount of water it would have still have had an appearance of blood one is required to cover it.
If one slaughtered a bird or a wild animal and then slaughtered a domesticated animal on top of it he is exempt from covering the blood, but if he slaughtered a domesticated animal and then slaughtered a bird or a wild animal on top of it he is obligated to cover the blood. <i>Rema: If one slaughtered a bird or a wild animal and afterward while slaughtering another one it became a carcass (invalidly slaughtered) in his hand, if he knows that the latter's blood covers the former's blood he is exempt from covering, but in the simple situation he is obligated to cover it.</i>
Blood that sprayed and that's on the knife, if there is no other blood but it one is required to cover it, and he scrapes it off and covers it in order that there should also be earth below it. However, if there is other blood there one does not need to cover it because there is no need to cover all the blood. Therefore, there is no need <small>to wait</small> to cover until all the blood comes out. <i>Rema: However, he should wait until [the blood] starts dripping down in order that he should cover some of the life-blood.</i>
One who slaughters for a sick person on <i>Shabbat</i> he does not cover, even if he has a shovel already stuck in the ground. And [after <i>Shabbat</i>] at night, if [the blood's] imprint is recognizable, he should cover it. And there are those who say that if he had ash set aside to cover dung there is something to covering the blood even on <i>Shabbat</i>.
One who slaughters and it became a carcass (invalidly slaughtered) in his hand or one who slaughters and finds [that the animal] has signs that make it unfit, he is exempt from covering it. And so too, if a deaf person or   a mentally challenged person or a child slaughtered and there was no one watching them, there is an assumption that the they had a botched slaughter and it is exempt from being covered. 
One who slaughters, even if he only wants the blood, he's obligated to cover. How should he perform [the slaughtering instead?] He should stab or tear out [the organs] in order to be exempt from covering.
One needs to check the signs and the knife before the covering in order that one doesn't come to make a wasted blessing.
One who slaughters a wild animal does not cover [the blood] until he checks the lungs, and if he finds a questionably invalid signs, he covers without making a blessing. And this is the law for all invalidations that arise from a questionable status, for example that [case] where we're worried that maybe [the knife] became notched while [cutting] the skin, and so too all similar cases. <i>Rema: But anything that according to the law is valid [and] it's only [ruled invalid] because we're strict on it, for example if one cut the entire neck, and similar cases, one is obligated to cover [the blood].</i>
One who has no earth to cover with should not slaughter. <i>Rema: Rather, he should wait until he has earth. And if he is travelling in the desert or on a ship, and the bird is not worth the loss of a garment that he would [need to] burn for its ashes [to cover with] or the gold that he would [need to] grind [to cover with], the sages enacted to slaughter and to keep the blood in a garment or a sandal and make a blessing, and when he reaches a place with earth, he should wash the garment or the sandal so that the blood comes out, and cover it without a blessing, and this is the custom.</i>
One who slaughters a wild animal or a bird and blood did not come out of it, it is permitted.
All things that if one plants seeds in them they would sprout, they are included in "earth" and one may cover [blood] with them. And if they don't sprout, if they are called "עפר" ("earth") one may cover with them. Therefore, one may cover with dung, and with very fine sand, [fine] enough that the potter doesn't need to crush it at all, and with lime, and with an earthenware shard and brick and barrel stopper of earthenware that was crushed, and with ground stones and ground earthenware shards, and scraps of fine flax, and sawdust, and with food or garments that were burnt until they were made into ash, and with powdered coal, and with stibium, and with millstone dust. But one may not cover with coarse dung, and not with sand that a potter needs to crush, and not with flour and bran-flour, and coarse bran, and not with ground metal if it's not burnt [to ash], except for ground gold which is called "עפר" ("earth"), as it is written <b>"and it has earth of gold"</b>. And ash is called "עפר" ("earth"), as it is written <b>"And they should take for the impure from the earth, the burnt [ashes] of the sin-offering"</b>.
One may not cover with desert earth because it's damp earth and [seeds] don't sprout in it. <i>Rema: And therefore, one may not cover with earth that's damp from water, for example swampy earth. And one may not cover with snow.</i>

Siman 29

There are eight types of terefot, and their signs are D"N (final), HN"K (initial), N (initial), P"Sh: attacked (derusah),  perforated (nekuvah), missing (haserah), removed (netulah),  torn (keruah), fallen (nefulah), severed (pesukah), and broken (sheburah). 

Siman 30

If in a behemah (domesticated animal) or chaya (wild animal), most of the bone of the head is crushed, either most of its vault (gab) or most of its circumference (hekkef), the animal is a trefah, even though the membrane is intact.  
If it was reduced, and there's missing from it [a piece] the size of a <i>selah</i> coin, it is an invalid animal. And if there punctured holes that are [big enough that there are pieces] missing, if between all of them [there's missing] the size of a <i>selah</i> coin, which is one third of a handbreadth, it is an invalid animal. <i>Rema: But, less than this there is what to say it is valid even in our days since we're not worried in a domesticated animal for puncturing the membrane of its brain.</i> And in a sea-bird, such as a goose <small>and a duck</small>, even if the bone is punctured any amount, it is an invalid animal. And a dry land bird  that a weasel bit with its teeth [the bird's] head, or it became damaged on a tree or a stone, one places his finger on the side of the hole and sticks his finger there, or he puts in finger into its mouth and presses there, if the brain doesn't ooze out of the hole it is known that the membrane of the brain is not punctured, and it is valid, and if it comes out, it is an invalid animal. <i>Rema: And we are not experts in checking for invalidations in animals, and therefore there's what to rule invalid if the bone of the skull has any hole at all in a bird, even for a dry land bird.</i>

Siman 31

The brain has two membranes one on top of the other. If the bottom one was punctured with a hole that goes all the way through, it is an invalid animal. But, if only the top one was punctured, it is valid. <i>Rema: There are those that invalidate the animal even where only the top one was punctured, and this is the custom if it is not a case of great loss.</i>
If a small part of the brain itself was rotted, or it was crushed but the membrane is intact, it is valid. And if it can be poured like water or hot wax, it is an invalid animal. And if one finds water inside the membrane, and there's [a piece] missing from the brain of the same measurement as the water, if the brain completely surrounds the water so that there is nothing exposed, even to the membrane, it is valid, and if not, it is an invalid animal. And this too is the law if the water is resting inside a small blister (meaning: like a pouch), that if the brain surrounds it so that it isn't exposed even to the membrane it is valid, and if not, it is an invalid animal. <i>Rema: And so too if the blister is resting between the membrane and the skull it is an invalid animal. If there is doubt if it is covered by the brain or not, it is an invalid animal. Therefore, there are those that are careful when opening the head that they open it in a way that they're able to see if the brain surrounds it, if they find water there or not, and nevertheless, there is no need to check [for the invalidation] after this because we rely on the majority, and he's able to throw away the head or sell it to a non-Jew without opening it.</i>
If one found a worm in the membrane of the brain, and the brain is still intact, and there is no imprint or blood spot on the lower membrane, it is valid. And there are those who say that we aren't experts at checking [for invalidations], and [therefore] it is an invalid animal <small>and this is the custom</small>. But, if one found [the worm] outside of the cranium, for example in the nose, it is valid because we can rely on the assumption that it never reached the brain.
The bone, that the brain rests inside, has a large cavity like a pot, and there are what looks like two bean shaped protuberances at its opening by the neck; and everything that is from the brain inside the pot until the protuberances, including the protuberances, are judged like the brain and [invalidate the animal] with any size hole [in them], and from there and onward are judged like the spinal cord.

Siman 32

If most of the skin that surrounds the marrow of the spinal cord was severed, the animal is invalid, even though all of the marrow is intact. And if most of the skin was not severed, even if all of the marrow inside was severed, it is valid. 
If the skin split lengthwise, it is valid. And so too, if the spine broke but the [spinal] cord was not severed, or if the marrow that is inside the [spinal] cord was crushed and it wobbles, since the skin is still intact it is permitted.
If the marrow decomposed and it can be poured like water or melted wax to the extent that the [spinal] cord, when one holds it in his hand, the part that extends out from his hand bends over and is not able to stand by itself, the animal is invalid. And so too, even though the inside didn't soften, but rather it became thick and heavy, if when one stands it up it is not able to stand because of its heaviness, it is an invalid animal. 
If part of the marrow was missing, and a cavity formed, it is valid.
This invalidation of the spinal cord is [from anywhere] until the opening of the third branch [nerve], including it. And if one of the two cords of the first or second branch were severed, it is an invalid animal. But, if the cord of the third branch was severed, it is valid. And in a bird, the invalidation of the spinal cord is until [the location] opposite the wings, the beginning of the place where they are attached to the body. <i>Rema: And there are those that invalidate in a bird until the place at the end of where the bone, which is attached to the body, rests. And this is the custom if it's not a [case of] great loss.</i>
An animal that one hits on the spine with a stick, and the stick went across the entire length of the spine, the animal is valid, and we are not worried that maybe the spine was severed. And if the stick has knots, we are worried [that the spine was severed] in the place of the knots. And so too, if the stick did not reach across the entire spine, we are worried that the head of the stick, at the place where [the stick] ends, hit with force, and so too, if one hit [across] the width of the spine, we are worried that maybe the spine was severed.
An animal that drags its legs, we are not worried that maybe it severed its spine. <i>Rema: Rather, we say that shigrona, which is a disease of the legs, took ahold of it. And so too is the law by a bird that we also rule like this.</i> When do we say this reasoning? When one did not know if [the animal] had fallen, but if one knew that it fell, we are worried.
When do we say this reasoning? When one did not know if [the animal] had fallen, but if one knew that it fell, we are worried.

Siman 33

If the lower jaw was removed, it is valid, and this is if [the animal] is able to survive by means of having food stuffed all the way down its throat and having food stuffed partially down its throat. <i>Rema: And so too by a bird whose beak was removed, and it is able to survive by means of having food stuffed all the way down its throat and having food stuffed partially down its throat, it is valid.</i>
If the upper jaw was removed, according to the Rambam it invalidates the animal. And it is fitting to be concerned for his words.
The gullet or the entrance to the gullet, that was punctured [until it reached] its [inner] cavity, if [the hole] is any size, it is [considered an] improperly slaughtered animal.
The gullet has two skins. If one of them is punctured, it is valid. If both of them are punctured, it is forbidden, and even if a membrane formed [on the hole] and closed it up, and even if the holes are not opposite each other, it is forbidden. And that is when the two [holes] punctured from the same side [of the gullet], since then it is possible that they happened together <small>(meaning: that they might align together)</small>. <i>Rema: And all this is only dealing with a case where it's apparent that the hole came on account of an illness, but if there is concern that the hole is on account of a thorn, even if only the inner [skin] was punctured, it is an invalid animal since we're worried that maybe also the outer [skin] was punctured, and the gullet can not be checked from the outside.</i>
These skins, the outer one is red and the inner one is white, and if they switched so that the outer one is white and the inner one is red, the animal is invalid. And so too, if both [skins] are red or white, the animal is invalid. <i>Rema: And all the more so, if there are two gullets or two windpipes that the animal is invalid.</i>
The gullet can not be checked from the outside in [a case where the animal] was mauled, which requires checking, because since [the outer skin] is red, the red of the venom [from the mauling] can not be recognized. What can he do? If it is a bird, he can check the windpipe from the outside and then slaughter it, and afterward he can invert the gullet and check it from the inside. And if it is an animal there is no solution. <i>Rema: And for us, since we are not experts at checking, even by a bird there is no solution.</i>
And also regarding [checking for] a hole in the gullet, one can not check from the outside but rather [needs to check] from the inside.
If a bird comes before us and its neck is dirtied with blood, we are not concerned for a possible case of being mauled [to require] to check the entire cavity [of the gullet], rather we are concerned for a possible hole [to require] to check the dirty spot. <i>Rema: And there are those that forbid all birds and animals whose necks are dirtied with blood because we are concerned for a hole in the gullet and we are not experts [at checking]; and so is the custom.</i>
If one finds a thorn in the gullet, [whether it was lying] lengthwise or widthwise, and [the thorn] was not lodged in [the gullet], it is valid <small>if there is no bloodspot on the outside of [the gullet]</small>. But, if it is lodged in [the gullet], it is forbidden, even if there is no bloodspot [on the outside], since we are concerned that maybe the gullet was punctured and it healed and became healthy and [now the hole] can not be seen. <i>Rema: And there are those that validate the animal if there is no bloodspot on the outside because we are not concerned that it might have [had a hole which] healed. And so too the custom is to be lenient in our cities by the geese which we overfeed to make fat, that there is a a way to fix [the fobidden animal] in the city by checking after the gullet was punctured because we are more concerned for [the case of] the lungs sticking [to each other]. And our custom is to be lenient where the thorn is lodged in the gullet if there is no hole on both sides or if there is no bloodspot on the outside. And there are those who are very precise with this because it is forbidden from the Torah; and it is much better to not check at all and rely on the majority [case] instead of checking and [needing to rely] on a leniency in a case where there is an imperfection.</i>
If the gullet and windpipe separated and hang loosely from each other in the majority of the measurement of their lengths, the animal is invalid.
If the roof of the crop was punctured with a hole that goes all the way through of any size, it is an invalid animal. And what is considered the roof? That which is drawn with the gullet when the bird stretches its neck. But if the rest of the crop is punctured, it is permitted. <i>Rema: If the crop was removed, the animal is invalid, even if there remained enough that the food is able to pass from the gullet to the gizzard. If the flesh between the crop and the gizzard was punctured, the animal is invalid.</i>

Siman 34

A windpipe that was severed [to the extent of cutting through to] most of its cavity inside, [and the cut was] in an area that's fitting for slaughtering or above this [area], this would be forbidden.
If [the windpipe] was punctured with a hole that creates a deficiency [the size of] an <i>issar</i> [coin], it is forbidden. And if a strip was removed from it lengthwise, if [the area of the strip is such that] if we were to make it into a circle it would be [the size of] an <i>issar</i> [coin], it is forbidden. And there are those who say that we are not experts in the measurement of an <i>issar</i> [coin], therefore we [instead] measure it against the majority of the width of the windpipe's cavity. <i>Rema: And according to what we explain nearby that the measurement of an issar coin is less than the majority [of the width of the windpipe's cavity], if so, whoever is not an expert will come to [incorrectly] rule leniently. Therefore, it appears it wants to say the majority of the width of the windpipe's cavity of a bird, which is less than [the measurement of] an issar [coin]. And whoever is not an expert should [rule that the animal] is invalid in this entire topic.</i>
If it was punctured around the circumference small holes near each other like the holes of a sieve, if [the holes] don't create a deficiency, they combine to [make the animal invalid if they encircle] the majority of [the windpipe's] cavity. And if they do create a deficiency, they combine to [the measurement of] an <i>issar</i> coin, that if there is [the measurement of] an <i>issar</i> coin with [all of the] holes and the complete [part of the windpipe] between them, it is forbidden; and this is when the holes are very close together that there isn't between one hole and the next the size of a hole, but if there is between [each hole] more than this measurement [then] what [part of the windpipe] that is between them does not combine.
By a bird, if [the windpipe] has holes like a sieve, one cuts out the place that has holes like a sieve and places it on the opening of the windpipe's cavity; if there is enough [of the cut out piece] to cover most of the [cavity of the] windpipe, it is forbidden. <i>Rema: And if [part of] the windpipe of a bird is missing, there are those that say that we measure it like [the measurement of the case a windpipe with] holes like a sieve. And there are those that say we measure it, a large [bird] according to its large [size] and a small [bird] according to its small [size], according to the calculation of the [relative] measurement [based on what] an issar [coin would cause to be invalid] in a [larger] animal.</i>.
There are those that say that if [the windpipe] became deficient like a door, that the deficiency wasn't removed, rather it hangs and stands and is erect there like a door on the mouth of an opening, since the door closes the hole, the deficiency needs to be greater [to render the animal invalid] to the extent that an <i>issar</i> [coin] can enter and exit from it, and this [measurement] is greater than [the regular measurement of] an  <i>issar</i> [coin].
There are those that say that if [the windpipe] was punctured with holes that go all the way through from both sides, even though the hole only is [large] enough so that an <i>issar</i> can enter widthwise, which means the thickness of an <i>issar</i>, it is forbidden.
If [the windpipe] was entirely split lengthwise, even though nothing from [the windpipe] is missing at all, it is forbidden. And if there remains [unsplit] from it anything at all above and below the place that's fit for slaughtering, it is valid, because whenever the neck is drawn out the crack continues to close, therefore it will return [to normal] and be healed.
If it was punctured below the place [that is fit] for slaughtering, even a little bit, it is an invalid animal.
If one finds the windpipe that was severed or [has parts] missing and one does not know if it happened during [the animal's] lifetime, <small>and he is unable to ascribe it to [the possibility] that this happened on account of the slaughtering since [maybe] it was slaughtered in two places,</small> [the recommendation for this case is] he severs [the windpipe] in a different place and sees if the [two places] look the same, then it would be valid, and if not, it is forbidden. And we only compare from one band [of the windpipe] to another band or from a sub-band to another sub-band, but not from a band to a sub-band and not from a sub-band to a band. <i>Rema: And we are not experts in checking, and [therefore] there is what to rule that the animal is invalid for all [cases] in this topic. And all of these laws about punctures and deficiencies in the windpipe, they are precisely when one knows that these [came about] on account of illness, but if they happened on account of a thorn or needle, for us who are not experts in checking the gullet, the animal is invalid for all [cases] in this topic because we are worried that maybe the gullet became punctured, since [these cases] are no worse than [the case of] if the neck was dirtied with blood as we explained above in chapter 33.</i>
The windpipe at its end, when it enters beneath <small>the chest</small> it branches out, and from there it separates and becomes three heads. One goes towards the heart, and one to the liver, and one to the lungs, and all three [are invalid] with a hole of any size. <i>Rema: However, with the pipe of the heart which is the fat that goes down between the grooves of the lung and the heart, it is normal that it has thin small holes, and this is how it grows, and they are not called holes [that invalidate the animal], and it is valid.</i>

Siman 35

If the lung was punctured, the animal is invalid.
There are five minor lobes <small>(definition: [parts that] are similar to ears)</small> in the lungs, three to the right and two to the left when the animal is suspended by its feet and its innards are facing the butcher such that the right side of the animal and the right side of the butcher are the same. And there is one additional small lobe on the right side which is called the small roselike lobe and it doesn't stand in line [of the other] lobes, rather, it's distanced from them towards the front side. And if one is missing from the right or the left, or if there are two on the right and three on the left, the animal is invalid. <i>Rema: The shapes of the right minor lobes are not similar to [the shapes] of the left [minor lobes], and if the shapes are switched, the animal is invalid. And so too, if the middle minor lobe on the right is larger than the one below it, the animal is invalid. And if the upper minor lobe on the left is larger than the upper minor lobe on the right, the animal is invalid. And so too, if the major lobe on the right is larger than [the major lobe] on the left, all of this is called switched, and the animal is invalid.</i> And the roselike lobe, if it's missing, or if there are two of them or if it's found on the left side, it is valid. <i>Rema: And in our countries the custom is to rule invalid whether two roselike lobes were found or if it was missing or if it's place was changed, and this should be the custom because there are great people who hold like this and one shouldn't change the custom. And so too, if its normal appearance or shape changes, the animal is invalid. If one found in it two roselike lobes that have a singular base, the thickness of a finger even though that they have a crack, it is valid. And if one is inverted and the second one is not inverted, we go after the one that's greater, and if it's not inverted it is valid. The [normal] way of the roselike lobe is to be in a pocket, and if it's not found in a pocket or if it has two pockets or if there is a pocket but [the roselike lobe] is not placed in it, and even if we would place the [roselike lobe] into [the pocket] it would return and go out from it when the lung inflates, the animal is invalid. And all of these laws are only [applicable] in places where the custom is to rule invalid an animal that has two roselike lobes or doesn't have a roselike lobe at all. But in places that [rule those cases] valid, also all of these distinctions are valid. If part of the roselike lobe is missing there is [reason] to check [for it] in the minor lobes or the major lobe on the left side. If the missing piece is found there are those that say it is valid because it is also found like this sometimes in goats and lambs. And so too there are those that rule valid if there is the appearance of a rose at its base, the thickness of a finger, even though there is no appearance of a rose at the head, as long as it is not inverted and has not changed its place. And in all of these things there is what to be lenient after many who rule valid in this entire topic.</i>
If the number of lobes increased, if the extra lobe was on the side of the [other] lobes or in front of the lungs, which is on the side of the heart, it is permitted. And if it was on its back, which is on the side of the ribs, this is an invalid animal; and this is when it's [the size] of a myrtle leaf after it's inflated, but if it's less than that, it is valid. <i>Rema: And there are those who rule stringently and forbid all extra [lobes] that aren't in the row of lobes. And so too is the custom in some places to forbid an extra [lobe] even on the front side, and we don't differentiate whether it's on the front side or the back side. However, if [the extra lobe] stands in the row of lobes, and when it's inflated it leans toward the front side, it is valid. And if it leans toward the back side it is an invalid animal. And in our countries the custom is to validate an extra [lobe] on the front side, and one shouldn't change the custom.</i>
If one finds an extra lobe at the end of the bottom edge of the major lobe, it is valid <small>because this is called in the row of the lobes.</small>
The right minor lobe which is close to the windpipe, in the narrow [part] of the chest, truly next to the neck, on the bottom which is the top that's next to the neck, if it is found on the back side like [the size of] a myrtle leaf, it is valid because it is its way to split. And this is precisely with the [lobe] on the right, but not [for the one] on the left. And there are those that say that this is precisely when it is in the upper half, but if it's in the lower half, it is invalid. <i>Rema: ...</i>

The Laws of Checking Lungs (25 sections) 1) One need not proactively check (without cause to assume there would be an injury) any part of the animal for treifot (specific terminal injuries) except the lungs of domesticated and wild species of mammals to see if there are any sirchot (strands of connective tissue). Anyone who "breaches the fence" to eat meat without checking the lungs should be bitten by a snake.  Rema- We have the custom to also inflate every lung, even if there is nothing wrong with it. In some places they are lenient and don't inflate the lungs unless there was a sircha removed by rubbing, and this is the main understanding.
2) If one opened the abdomen of the animal and, before the lungs were inspected, a dog or an idol worshipper came and took them, it is permitted to eat this animal and we are not concerned that they may have been punctured or had sirchot. Rema- There are those who are strict in the case that the lungs were lost and the animal should not be permitted in such a case except if it will be a major financial loss or if the animal were a kid, lamb, or a wild species, as sirchot are uncommon amongst them. 
3) If an idol worshipper or a Jew came and removed the lungs before they were checked and they are still available, one inflates them.
A minor lobe connected to another minor lobe or to the major lobe, whether slightly connected or connected along the entire lobe, if they are connected "out of order" it is treifah and if it is connected "in order" it is kosher, even without checking (the lung for a hole). Beit Yosef- However, if he inspected the sircha that was "in order" and one found a hole the animal is treifa. The sircha is not considered "in order" except when it is connecting two lobes one next to the other from chituch (flat side overlapped by the neighboring lobe) of one to the chituch of the other, even if the sircha is diagonal or penetrates into the neighboring lobe. However, if the sircha goes from the back of a lobe to the back of the neighboring lobe or even from the chituch to the back of the neighboring lobe, or from the outer edge of the lobe to the outer edge of the neighboring lobe or from the edge of the lung to chituch of the other, or even from the point of one to the point of the other that is next to it, or even from the point of one the chituch of the other that is next to it, it is called "out of order." Rema- There are those who say that even when the sircha is "in order" it needs to be checked to make sure there is no hole in the lung. Because we are not experts in checking for things that can be problems one should consider any sircha (including "in order") treifa, and there are those who say it is kosher if the sircha extends from the origin of the lobes up to the middle of them (by width) even if it is open on both sides. This is indeed the custom to permit it if it is "in order" in this way. Similarly, if there is a membrane connecting a minor lobe to a minor lobe or a minor lobe to a major lobe spanning from the origin of the lobes until the middle of them we do not consider it treifa, as it is normal to find it like this and it is not a sircha. This membrane is only normally found between minor lobes or between the major and minor lobes but not in other places, and if a membrane is found connecting a lobe to another place it is a sircha (and forbidden). Anywhere (on the lung) that the sircha is permitted, even if there is another sircha connected to that same sircha it is called a "folded sircha" and it is permissible. 
5. If one is uncertain as to whether (the sircha) is on the back of the lobe or in the chituch and when the lungs are inflated a lot it appears that (the sircha) is in the chituch but when the lungs are not fully inflated the sircha appears to be outside (the chituch) the animal is kosher.
6. A sircha connected from the varda lobe to anywhere is treifah, even to its own pouch and even if the whole lobe is connected to it. This is the law for any extra piece of lung, that any sircha makes it a treifah. Rema- However, if the varda is connected below from its source (point of attachment) to its pouch it is possible to say it is kosher, since this is the majority (of the varda).

A sircha which extends from the lung and is hanging, unconnected to anywhere else, (the animal is) kosher and (the sircha) does not require checking. Rema- but an unconnected sircha that extends from a bubble (renders the animal) treifah. From a pustule/granuloma it would be kosher.

There are types of birds that do not have bile, such as doves and pigeons, and they are not prohibited because the entire species is like this. The deer does not have bile in its liver, but it has it below, near its tail." Gloss: If a person comes before him with a bird whose species he does not recognize, and no bile is found in it, it is not said with certainty that this species does not have bile. Rather, it is assumed that it has bile until it is known that this species does not have bile (Responsa of the Rashba, section 108).

What is this talking about, that if [a predator] cut off the head of one of them, we are not concerned about the other [animals or fowl that it can prey upon]? Specifically when it went into [the cage or pen] and is standing with them. But in a case like that of those cats that climb onto a chicken coop and insert their paws inside and maul [the chickens] — even if one has cut off the head of one of them, its anger does not subside with this. As since [the others] flee, he will be angered by this as well.

A limb from a live animal is forbidden from a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or fowl.
A limb that separates from a live animal is forbidden. And flesh that separates from a live animal is forbidden because of "And the flesh in the field Treifah." And even what separates from the animal [but] is still inside it - such as [where it was] cut from the spleen or from the kidneys and the piece was left inside it - it is forbidden.
A limb or flesh that is minced (Injured) and can not be reattached back into the animal, even if it was separated after the shechita, It is forbidden (to eat it). Hagah: in Siman 55 states, the Yeteret (an extra piece of meat on the animal that does not cause the animal to no longer be considered kosher) is still on the animal. The animal is still kosher. Additionally, we do not say that a removed Yeter is considered like a minced limb (and forbidden). The Yeter can even be eaten. Nevertheless, the Rashba (שו"ת הרשב"א חלק א סימן פט) says that the minhag (tradition) is to be stringent (and not eat the Yeter meat).
An animal's male organ that has been detached but is still covered (the flesh and skin still covers the organ), is not forbidden by the Torah, because the organ is not considered without life (not considered dead tissue) and has not rotted. Even though this organ is not forbidden to eat, the minhag (tradition) of (Klal) Yisrael is not to eat it because it looks like a limb from a live animal.

Siman 63

Meat that was found spread out in the market, one goes after the majority, because a part goes after the majority of parts. If the majority of the sellers [of meat] are non-Jews, it is forbidden. And if the majority of the sellers are Jews, it is permitted. And this is the case with meat that was found in the hand of a non-Jew and it is not known from whom he purchased it. If the meat sellers are Jews, it is permitted. This is the law [according to] Torah. And the Sages already forbade all meat that is found, either at the market or in the hand of a non-Jew, even though all the sellers and all of the slaughterers are Jews. And furthermore, the one who buys meat and places it in his house and it disappears, it is forbidden [to eat it]. Rather, if there is a sign or there were recognizable rings [on the meat], and he definitely recognizes it that it is the [same meat] or it was bound and stamped, [then the meat is permitted]. 
If one hung up a container full of pieces of meat, and the container broke and the pieces fell to the earth, and one returned and found the pieces without any sign or recognizable features, it (the meat) is forbidden, because one might think that the meat that was in in the container was dragged away by a beast or vermin, and this is other meat. But if one hung it up on a nail or something like this, where it would be impossible for vermin to take it off and and put another one in its place, it is permitted. And some permit meat that was unobserved if it was found in the same place that it was left. [Comment of Rema: And the customary practice is to be lenient, in accordance with the last opinion, and even if it was in an idolater's possession, in a place where all the sellers are Israelites who sell kosher meat. And see below 118.]

Siman 64


One who slaughters an animal and finds an eight or nine month fetus whether it is alive or dead, its helev and sciatic nerve are permitted. A nine month [fetus] is specifically only permitted if it hasn't walked on the ground. However, if it walked on the ground, it is forbidden. There are those who say that if it completed its gestational period and was found alive, even though it did not walk on the ground, its helev and sciatic nerve are forbidden and [consumption] is punished by karet and we remove [from the animal] all the sinews and membranes that are forbidden in all animals. Rema: A prohibition descends on the helev if the animal is aborted.

Siman 65







We are not accustomed to doing this [removing the forbidden fats and sciatic nerve] on a fetus that does not require shechita. There are those who say we should do it if it completed gestation and was found alive. Rema: our custom is to be strict like the second opinion. 

Siman 66

The blood of a domesticated or wild animal, whether it is a pure or impure animal, is forbidden. This includes the blood of an embryo (shalil), but the blood of fish and locusts is permitted.
Egg blood, if it is know that it is from a developed embryo (meaning, one that has begun to take on the form of a chick), one is liable. But if one does not know that it is from a developed embryo one is not liable, but the sages prohibit it.
If a pinch of blood is found, toss the blood and eat the rest, if it is found in the white. But if it is found in the yolk, the whole of the egg is forbidden, <small>The Rema comments: And some say that blood found on the egg white lining and outside of it — that is, that has spread from the lining — makes all the egg forbidden (the Rosh, and Rashba, and Rashi, and the Tosafot, and more. And the Rosh and the Tur and R. Yeroḥam wrote that some are stringent on both measures) and some are more stringent that any that is found on the white linging, even if not spread, makes all the egg forbidden (Issur v-Heter ha-Arukh, Resh Klal 42, and the Maharai 304). And from this the custom of these lands has spread to forbid the entire egg that has blood, and not to distinguish between the white and the yolk. And in the place where the custom is to be lenient, to toss the blood and save the egg, in the place where it is permitted one must take a small amount of white (the thickness of a shell) with the blood when tossing it (Arukh there in the name of the Sefer Mitzvat Gadol) </small>
Eggs that are scrambled in a bowl, and blood is found on the yolk of one of them, even if the yolk with blood on it is tossed, are forbidden, because since they are scrambled in a bowl the white is flimsy and it mixes together, so all of it is forbidden. But eggs that are broken together in a bowl and not scrambled, if blood is found on the yolk of one of them, take out the kosher yolks one at a time in its place, and they are permitted, and leave the one which had blood in the egg with the remaining white and toss them. <small> The Rema comments: And all this that we know that if the blood was in a forbidden place, but if there was doubt if it was in a forbidden place or not then it is allowed to mix (as explained in the commentary of the Rosh) — whereas even if it had not happened one of the two is nullified, but the egg is alone is forbidden. And thus, if it is boiled or roasted and we don't know if it is in a forbidden place (entirely from Issur v-Heter ha-Arukh, and see also the Ta Ḥazi 62, law 3). </small>
If the blood is found in an egg in a place where the whole is not forbidden, and the blood is not tossed but forgotten, and the egg is torn with the blood, it seems to me to be permitted.
If the blood is found in an egg that has been put in stew to shrink <small> [translator's note: a preparation still found in Sephardic kitchens, known as huevos ḥaminados] </small>, since there is no sauce in the egg's place the entire stew is permitted.
Strange eggs (that is, eggs which are non-viable, and formed like a web), even if the hen sat upon them for many days, are permitted to eat, as long as one tosses the blood.
It is permitted to eat roasted eggs even though they cannot be checked. <small> The Rema comments: and thus there is no need to check the eggs if there is blood in them, for we rely on the majority of eggs which don't have blood in them (Hagahot Maimuniot and Arukh), and nevertheless it is customary to be stringent, that when you make a dish with eggs, on that day you look in them to see if there is blood in them.</small>
Fish blood, although it is permissible if gathered in a container, is forbidden on account of looking bad. Thus, if it is apparent that it is from fish — for instance, if there are scales in it — it is permitted.
Human blood, if departed [from the person's body], is forbidden on account of Mar'it Ayin. Thus, if one bites a loaf with his teeth and finds blood from his teeth on the loaf, he needs to wipe it off, but if it is between his teeth he can suck it. <small> REMA: and all blood of fish and of humans, since the law permits it, it is not forbidden to mix them. (Maimuni 87 on forbidden foods, in the name of the Rashba in Torat haBayit 3:5)</small>

One is not permitted to scald kids and lambs and chicken in a kli rishon [first vessel] unless the fat has been removed and the meat has been salted. And likewise, one may not pour onto them from a kli rishon, and if you do pour, it is enough [to remove] a klippah [outer layer] of the skin. And if the head of the chicken is above where the pouring occurred, a klippah is not even required.  Rema: It is not considered 'pouring' unless there was no stopping of the stream from the kli rishon when it was touching down, but if there was a break it is already not considered a pouring and it is not forbidden. 

Siman 69

Meat needs to be washed before it is salted. (if the butcher washed it, there is no need to wash it in the house, tur). If, after washing, the piece was cut into two or three (or the hooves were removed after washing, aruch), returning and rewashing is necessary. 
If it was salted but not washed first, rinse it and salt it again. There are some who forbid this practice. Rema: This is our custom, even if it was only salted a little bit, like the amount of salt used before it is roasted, and even if it was not salted for a shiur melicha (aruch, sharei durah, and semag). One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari). If one salted an unwashed piece of meat with other pieces of meat, the other pieces are acceptable and the unwashed one is forbidden (aruch).
Don't use salt that is as fine as flour, and don't use salt that is too thick because it will fall off the meat. Rema: and if one only has salt that is as fine as flour, it is acceptable to use it.
One should scatter salt so that no place remains without salt. And, one should salt so that it [i.e. the meat] won't be fitting for eating with the same amount of salt. There is no need to add more salt than this. It should be salted on both sides. Birds need to be salted also on the inside. If they are only salted on the inside or on the outside, and likewise with pieces [of meat] that are only salted on one side, these are permitted. Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.]. But if the meat hasn't been cooked, one should not cook it as is, but if it's within 12 hours of having been salted should instead salt the second side that hasn't been salted and then cook it afterwards. If it has been after 12 hours of being salted then one should roast it on the fire, and the fire certainly draws it [i.e. the blood] out, and the side that was salted won't absorb [blood] from the side that wasn't salted.
After you salted the piece of meat, if you cut that piece, there is no need to return and salt the place where the meat has been cut.
The length of salting the meat is not less than the length it takes [in time] to walk a mile, and this is approximately a third of an hour. Gloss: And this is authoritative after the fact, or even from the outset [if the meat is needed in order to] to honor guests or for the needs of Shabbat. But, without this [need] the custom is to wait with the meat being salted for the length of an hour, and this cannot be changed.
Before one places the meat in the vessel that it will be washed in, one should shake off the salt that's on it or wash it in water and afterwards place the meat in the vessel that it's being washed in and wash it several times. The vessel should be washed between each and every rinsing [of the meat]. Gloss: And there are those who say that the meat needs to be washed three times and this is the custom from the outset, therefore if one washes or shakes off the salt from among it and washes it twice, this is like washing it three times. Or one places the water in the vessel and afterwards places the meat in it and washes it three times. And this is the custom from the outset, that one gives lots of water in the first rinsing in order to nullify the strength of the salt that's in the brine. It's permitted to wash the meat in fruit juice, and water is not required. 
If one did not shake off the salt that is on [the meat] and did not rinse it [off], the [meat] is not forbidden because the water in the vessel will negate the strength of the salt. Rema: Even a small amount of water will negate the strength of the tzir. (Aruch, klal 6 and Mahari). There are those who permit [the meat] even if there was no water in the vessel when the meat was placed there since we aren't concerned about the short amount of time while the person is washing the meat. (Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy. As long as there is a little water in the vessel to negate the strength of the salt so that it is not cooking, even if the vessel is dairy or non-kosher, or dirty with forbidden things. (Aruch).
Meat that was salted and then cooked without a final washing must  have a sixty ratio (19) [34] against the salt that is upon it.  Rema: (20) [35] And the entire pot is included in the sixty, [36] and if  there is a piece of meat in the pot of equal size to this piece that was  not washed off, everything is permitted for there must be sixty times  the amount of salt on the piece (21), for the piece is certainly at least  sixty times it's salt, and if there is not sixty times against the salt  [37], even if only placed in a kli sheini everything is forbidden (23)  since [38] there is salt and tzir, it has cooked somewhat.  [39] Dried meat can be permitted even in a kli rishon, for it must  certainly be sixty times the size of the salt that is upon it since it has  dried. However, initially one must be careful even with dry meat that  it should not be cooked or even washed in hot water without being  first washed of it’s salt. All this is referring to a case where meat has  not been washed off of it's salt at all, however if even only slightly  washed once, and then cooked, it is permitted, post facto , for post  facto one washing is sufficient. Salt used once, [40] may not be  used again, [41], and it goes without saying that it is forbidden to eat  used salt.   
[42] A non-Jew who works in Jew’s home, who is cooking a piece of  meat that we’re not sure if it was washed off is subject to the following  halacha: If the non-Jew knows Jewish customs, we may believe to say he  washed it off if there was an adult Jew occasionally walking in and out, or  if there was a knowledgeable child. Rema:  One of these is sufficient (24) [43] either mesiach Ifi tumo that he washed  it well, or a Jew, even a child was around walking in and out for he has  some respect for Jewish customs. However if he told the non-Jew not to  wash meat without permission, and the non-Jew went and did so, it is  forbidden for we see that he has no fear and he should not be relied on.   
[44] Meat that has been cooked without having been salted is permitted if  there are [45] sixty times (26) that piece in the pot, (27) and all the other  meat is permitted as well. Rema: (28) [47] Some forbid that piece even if  there is sixty against it, and that is how we are to act if not for a great need  (2) as in honour of Shabbos or [47] guests when we may rely on those  who are lenient. If a piece of meat was not salted (30) properly it is as if it  was never salted. Any meat that stood for three days without having been  salted remains forbidden even if salted and if it is [48] cooked we require  sixty against it.
Meat that was left for three full days without having been salted can no  longer be saltedbecause the blood has dried and will no longer be  released through salting. Therefore it [49] may not be cooked [50] only  roasted (31) and after it is roasted [51] it still may not be cooked (32) but if  it was it is permitted. [52] Meat should not be left for three days for fear  that it may be cooked.   
(33) [53] If the meat was soaked in water within three days, it may go  another three days (34) (54) less half an hour. Meat that we are not sure if  it was salted within three days is permitted. 
Meat that was left unsalted for three days [55] and was then mixed up with  other pieces is [56] nullified [57] among the permissible majority, and [58]  all the pieces may be cooked (35) [59] even if it was a chaticha ha’ruya  I’hischabed. This is also the rule for pieces cooked without being salted,  and then mixed with others.  
(36) [60] Meat covered in blood that was sitting in water for twenty four hours is  forbidden by some unless it is roasted (37) [61] or unless there is sixty in the  water against it, [62] Some even forbid it to be roasted, and this is how we should  act. 
We perform the salting only in a vessel with holes or upon straw or shavings or in  a diagonal position insuring that if water was spilled onto it, it would flow off  immediately. Rema: An especially smooth surface that water would flow from  need not be placed in a slanted position. however if it’s not this smooth it must be placed slanted so that the water flows out. Even in a vessel with holes, one  should be careful to make sure the holes are open, therefore it should not be  placed on the ground, for then it is as a vessel without holes. As a result of this  some people are stringent and place straw or shavings because even the meat  can close up the holes. (38) Post facto, one need not worry about all this. If one  performed the salting in a vessel without holes (39) [63] it is forbidden to use the  vessel with very hot items. Rema: [64] And if it was used then one must take off a  klipah for a dry item, and if it was a liquid we need sixty against the klipah of the  vessel. [66] Some say that even with cold items it is forbidden to use the vessel  unless it is washed down well, and if it was used without first being washed off,  the item used should be washed off. (40) [67] However, it is permissible to re-use  this vessel for salting once holes are made in it (41) [68] or even without holes if  meat has been salted and washed off. 
(42) But if it has holes [69] it is permissible to eat boiling hot food from it, and there are some that forbid boiling hot [70]One should be careful  initially (43) but post facto, it is permitted. 
Meat [71] that was salted in a vessel without holes [72] and was left for as  long as it takes for water to begin boiling is subject to the following rules:  Anything in the tzir is forbidden even for roasting, and what is outside the  tzir is not forbidden [73] expect for a klipah’s worth, even if it is fatty.  Rema: (44) [74] Some forbid the entire piece, even that which is outside  the tzir, even if only salted slightly as is done in preparation for roasting  [75] and even if it was not left for the required salting time rather only for a  little while allowing for tzir to be seen [76] this is the custom, and it should  not be changed. Nevertheless, only the actual piece that is touching the  tzir is forbidden (45) [77] but the other pieces that are upon it and salted  with it are permitted, and this is indeed the custom. 
After meat has been salted and washed, it may even be placed in water that is not boiling [78] and there are those that require it to be placed in boiling water. Rema: The custom is to follow the first opinion. 
Meat that was salted for as long as required and then placed in a vessel without holes without being washed off [79] and then filled up with tzir is permitted. (46) According to this, meat that fell into tzir that came out of the meat (47) after the required salting time is permitted. There are those who forbid it no matter what, and they should be followed initially. Rema: [80] And some forbid even post facto (48) [81] a klipah and this is the custom, regarding that which is in the tzir. However, anything outside the tzir is permitted. (49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) 
In a place where salt is not easily found, one should roast the meat (54) until its blood has come out, and then one may cook it. 

Siman 70

One may salt many pieces, one on top of the other. Regardless of the fact that the bottom piece finishes its excretions before the top one, we don't say that [the bottom piece] absorbs from the blood of the top one. This is because [the bottom piece] excretes gravy for a lengthy amount of time, and the entire time that gravy is emitted, [the piece] does not absorb. [This is true] even when much gravy gathers and stands inside of a depression between the pieces of meat - it is permitted. In what case is this dealing? In a case when he salts meat on meat, and even ox meat with kid or lamb meat, and even with chicken - [because] it is impossible for them to finish all the excretions of their gravy before the ox meat finishes excreting its blood. {RMA - in any event, we are accustomed to being strict in the first instance, that each piece which has a depression, as in [the case of] of a complete side of meat, to turn it over, in order that the blood should run off. However, one must not worry post factum. A piece which was salted twice is permitted - we don't worry that the secondary salt causes the blood from the first salting to be reabsorbed.} However, meat with fish, even chicken with fish, is forbidden to salt together. This is because the fish ceases excreting all of its gravy before the chicken finishes excreting its blood. If one did salt fish and chicken together, the chicken is permitted but one must take a peeling off the fish. However, if the scales were not removed when it was salted, it is permitted. {RMA - and there are those who forbid the entire fish [not just a peeling] if there wasn't 60 times [the volume] of the chicken, as we estimate in salting 60 times the volume, and such is the custom. And this is specifically referring to an instance where the scales weren't present, as fish skin is a soft membrane and excretes immediately. However, where the scales were present, it is permitted, as they do not excrete [all of their fluids] immediately and [thus] do not absorb from the chickens, because the entire time that they are busy excreting, they will not absorb, as we say about two pieces which were salted together.

[1] The head (1) is cut into two pieces and salted well on the inner side, [2] and is salted on its hair, for the hair is not a blockage from allowing blood to be released by the salt. 
(2) [3] The hooves are slightly slit at the bottom, salted, and laid out so the slit is face down. The hair is also salted. [4j See earlier section 68. 
The membrane surrounding the brain has many veins, and the brain itself  has much blood which will not come out through simply salting the head,  because the skull is blocking it, not allowing for the blood to flow.  Therefore, one who wants to salt it must cut the skull and remove the  brain, cut the surrounding membrane and salt it. [5] If one wants to salt the  head with the brain inside, then a hole must be pierced throughout the  skull and membrane, salt it, and place the hole face down as to allow the  blood to flow. It is then permitted even to be cooked. Rema: [6] And see  earlier in section 68 how one should act initially. If one salted the whole  head without making a hole in the skull then the [7] membrane and skull are forbidden, (3) [8] but the head is permitted along with any other meat  that is with it. The thigh bone, as well as other bones that have marrow  inside of them [9] must be salted [10] and the salting of the bone suffices  for the marrow as well. The bone need not be pierced. [11] Nevertheless,  ideally one should not salt it along with other meat, only alone. Post facto it  is permitted.

ША. Нет крови в «бней меаим» (1) [1], например, в рубце, сычуге, привратнике [2] и в кишечнике (это трубка до кольца), если нет жира на них. Поэтому, если сварили в кастрюле без засолки, разрешено [3], если только они не покраснели. Рамо. И если их засолили в сосуде без дырок, разрешены. (2) [5] Но лехатхила нужно солить их в сосуде с дырками и сначала мыть, как любое мясо. Есть кто отделяют рубец и говорят, что есть в нем кровь [6], и даже бедиавад запрещают рубец и сетку, как любое мясо. ША. Однако для жира на них закон как для любого другого мяса. Поэтому, когда солят кишечник и другие меаим [7], их не солят изнутри как еду, (3) а только снаружи, где жир прикреплен. Рамо. Если кишечник засолен изнутри, а не снаружи, это как если не засолен вообще, [8] если сварили так, это трефа [9], если есть на нем жир снаружи. Но если еще не сварили (4) [10], снова солите снаружи [11], и тогда разрешено. Яйца в птице после шхиты, если не закончен белок, только один желток, нужно солить как любое мясо, (5) [12] и можно солить с другим мясом. И если закончен даже белок, даже скорлупа на нем твердая, как на яйцах, что продают на рынке, обычай солить. Только осторожно, чтобы не солить их с мясом, но бедиавад не опасаемся. И весь жир, даже птиц, по закону любого другого мяса для засолки и мытья.
ША. Бней меаим без жира, хотя и не содержащий крови (6) [13], может быть засолен с другим мясом. Рамо. И есть кто запрещает его солить с мясом {Тур}, (7) и таков обычай лехатхила, но бедиавад это разрешено {Мордехай, Ор Заруа}.
ША. Жир тонкого кишечника полон мелких сосудов с кровью, поэтому есть кто запрещает его варить, даже если он нарезан и засолен [только жарить]. Но сейчас обычай разрешать, а кровеносные сосуды знаток может резать и вытаскивать хорошо, пока не останется ни одного из них.

<b>The Signs of Pure Beasts and [Wild] Animals - 3 Paragraphs:</b> The signs of beasts and [wild] animals are explained in the Torah, and there are two signs: It regurgitates its cud, and its hooves are split. And any beast or animal that does not have teeth in its upper jaw nor protrusions (<i>nivim</i>), which are mounds of flesh-like teeth that protrude from the jaws - and some say that protrusions are two teeth above, one from here and one from there (canines), at the end of the mandible - it is certain that it is pure (kosher). That is when one recognizes that it is [not] a young camel that does not have protrusions until it grows. And anything that regurgitates its cud has a split hoof except for the camel, the hare, and the daman, as they regurgitate their cud but do not have split hooves; so with them, we do not concern ourselves if they teeth above or protrusions. Hence, if one was walking in the wilderness and found an animal but does not recognize it and its hooves were cut, such that he may surely not inspect them, he may inspect it [thus]; if it has no upper front teeth, it is certainly pure. And that is if he knows it is [not] a young camel. And anything that has split hooves regurgitates its cud except for the swine. Hence, if one found an animal and its mouth was cut, such that he may surely not inspect it, he may inspect its feet. If it has hooves that are split, it is certainly pure. And that is if he knows it is [not] a swine. If it has horns, there is no longer a doubt that it is a swine, so it is pure. And there is no impure animal, the flesh of the edges of the tailbone of which runs like warp and woof (part of it stretches vertically and part of it horizontally), to whichever side it is cut beside the <i>arod</i> (wild donkey). Hence, if one finds an animal whose mouth and hooves are cut, such that he may surely not inspect them, he may inspect the flesh of the edges of the tailbone after he slaughters it. If it runs like warp and woof, it is pure. And that is if he knows it is [not] a wild donkey. (It is forbidden by the Torah to eat human flesh - Ran in the chapter [entitled] Af Al Pi; Rambam, Laws of Forbidden Foods 22:3 with the Maggid Mishneh; Korban Aharon, Chapter 8 64d; not like it is implied from Tosafot in the chapter [entitled] Af Al Pi and the Rosh, that human flesh is not forbidden by the Torah. And see, Bach.)

That which is born of a treifah is permitted.

The signs of a kosher bird are not explained from the Torah, rather it only enumerated the non-kosher types, and the permitted types of birds. And the prohibited types, 24 were mentioned in the Torah (See: Rambam Forbidden Foods 1:14)
Anyone who is an expert in those types and their names, behold he eats all of the birds that are not from them, and he doesn't need checking. (Ibid.) And a kosher bird is eaten according to tradition, and that is the clear thing in that place that it is a kosher bird. And the hunter is believed saying: This bird, my hunting rabbi permitted for me, since that hunter is known to be in an expert in non-kosher types that are mentioned in the Torah and their names. Someone who does not know them and does not know their names, he should check the signs: every bird that is a bird of prey and he eats [it], and it is known that it is of non-kosher types. And if he does not know if it is a bird of prey or not, if, when they stand it up with wire, split along its legs, two fingers here and two fingers here, or it is [a bird that] clutches from the air and he eats [it], it is known that it is a bird of prey. If it is known that it is not a bird of prey, there are three signs of [its] kosher [status]: an extra finger, a crop [digestive pouch near gullet], and its gizzard is peeled by hand, excluding if it was only peeled with a knife. (See the Mechaber) If it hardened and was attached, and he placed it in the sun and it healed and then it was peeled by hand, behold this is a sign of [it being] kosher. And even though it has these three signs, it should not be eaten, because we are concerned lest it is a bird of prey, rather, unless they have a tradition that was transmitted to them by their ancestors that it is kosher. (See Rambam Forbidden Foods 1:18).
There are those who say that all birds that have a wide beak and the palm of its foot is wide like a goose, and it is known that it is not a bird of prey, and is permitted to eat if it has the three signs on its body. <i>Gloss: And there are those who say that we don't rely even on this, and one should only eat a bird with an accepted tradition that it is kosher (in the Arukh...) and we are accustomed to this and it should not be changed.</i>
One who is from a place that they are accustomed to a prohibition with a single bird because they do not have a tradition, and he went to a place where they do have a tradition, he is able to eat it in the place where he went, even if his intention to return. And if he went from a place that does have a tradition and he went to a place that does not have a tradition, it is permitted for him to eat it.
If the rest of the places that do not have a tradition are able to eat it relying upon the place that does have a tradition, there is one who forbids and there is one who permits. And there is [a reason] to be concerned regarding the words of the one who prohibits.

Siman 83

The signs of fish are explicit in the Torah: All that have fins and scales, kosher. And fins, it is what it swims with. And scales, they are hardened skins on it. <i>Gloss: Specifically when they are peeled by hand or with a utensil, but if it is impossible to peel them from the skin of the fish, it is not called scales (HM''M 1:41)</i> And even if it only has one fit and one scale, it is permitted. And if it does not not, and in the future when it grows after a time or when it has scales while in the sea, but when it emerges it sheds its scales, it is permitted. (Rambam Forbidden Foods Chapter 1 and the Rif and the Ran and this is the law) <i>Gloss: And there are those who say that one does not permit with one scale, only when it stands on its jaw or tail or fin (the Tur and the Rosh according to the Beit Yosef and the Ran and this is the law in the name of the Ramban), and it is good to be stringent.</i>
There are types of fish that their scales are very thin and are not recognizable [as scales], if they are wrapped in a garment or placed in a vessel full of salt water and scales are found, it is permitted.
Everything that has scales has fins, and there are [fish] that have fins but not scales. Therefore, if one found a cut of fish that has scales, one does not have to go after fins. If one found fins, one should not eat it until he knows it has scales.
If one found cuts of fish and one of them has scales, if the cuts are suitable, all of them are permitted; the presumption being that it came from one fish. And if none of them are suitable, those that have scales found on them, they are permitted, and the rest are are prohibited, even if all of them were salted together. <i>Gloss: And if one found there a fish that has a wide head and spine, it is permitted to eat, specifically if it had scales. But if the fish is whole, and we do not see scales on it, we cannot rely on the head and spine.</i>
Non-kosher fish brine, is only rabbinic. Therefore, it is permitted to purchase salted fish from a non-Jew, [that are] kosher, even though they were placed with non-kosher [fish] in the same vessel, lest they were not salted together. <i>Gloss: There are those who prohibit, if they were placed with non-kosher [fish] in one barrel. We are accustomed to not purchase them, even if we see that it was only placed with [other] non-kosher salted fish in a mixture on the table that they are being sold on. (Trumat HaDeshen 174 and Hagahot Sh''D, Sh''D Siman 20, and Or Zarua and Arukh Klal 13 and Mordechai in the name of the Tosafot Rabbi Israel), except for herring and markrish which are permitted in every circumstance, and definitely when they are not salted with non-kosher [fish], because it is not the way to salt them with them [the other types of fish] (Mordechai). Even regarding the rest of the fish, one should not be stringent to rummage and check if there are non-kosher fish among them. If one sees that non-kosher fish are being soaked in the water with kosher [fish], even herring there [is what to say] to prohibit it (Hagahot Sh''D in the name of MaHaRA''I and Rabbi Yerucham). But there is no concern lest it is being soaked, the whole time that we don't see [them] (ibid.). All of this is from the outset, but after the fact, when has already purchased them, there is [what to say] to permit them in every circumstance, because fish brine is rabbinic, and we say lest they were not salted together in the beginning, and we are not concerned after that of it absorbing from one to the other (Arukh). And specifically when suspended in oil, and just salted fish do not have oil, but if there is oil, it is prohibited by the Torah, and doubt [regarding Torah law we lean towards] stringent (ibid.). And in the case that the fish are salted dry, it is permitted in every circumstance, after the non-kosher [fish] also are dry (MaHaRA''I BT''H). And we are accustomed to be stringent also with this from the outset, if they are placed among them (ibid.).</i>
Non Jews that bring a barrel of water full with fish brine, if one Kilkit [type of fish] (explanation: a prepared non-kosher fish, this is what Rashi explains, and others explain that it is a kosher fish) is in it, it is permitted, because this is a sign that it is from kosher fish. If not, it is prohibited. And this applies when there is a single Kilkit, in a sealed barrel, but if it is open, it did not jump regarding less than two, but regarding one we are concerned lest it never came. And there is one who says, if there were many barrels, all of them are open, and a Kilkit, since it is a kosher fish, one among them, all of them are permitted. If they were sealed, open one of them and if one found a Kilkit, it is permitted. A second, if one found a Kilkit in it, all of them are permitted. There is one who says, it is permitted as a result of the Kilkit, this applies when there is not a fish or cut [of a fish] that does not have scales, but if there are [fish without scales], all are prohibited. 
Aggressive fish are only taken by an expert, unless a Jew says, <i>or a non-Jew (Ran and this is understood from the Rashba)</i> that is selling them: I salted and took from kosher fish. But if he says: They are kosher, he is not believed, rather unless he is a proven [expert] regarding kashrut. 
Eggs of a fish, if there were two round sections (explanation: spherical and wide like jugs) or they were clear, non-kosher. <i>and it is law regarding aggressive [fish], also the law applies here (Tur).</i> One round and one clear, ask the Jew who sold [it]. If he said: I salted, and took [them] from a kosher fish, eat according to his word. If he said: they are kosher, do not believe him, rather unless he is a proven [expert] regarding kashrut. Now it is the simple custom to purchase just fish eggs, whether whole or soft, even from non-Jews, provided they are red. But if the [eggs] are black, do not eat them at all.
A kosher fish that is found in the intestines of a non-kosher fish, if found either in the secretary channel, or the swallowing channel, or it went out, it is kosher.
A non-kosher fish that was found in the intestines of a kosher fish, it is prohibited (see Rambam in Forbidden Foods 5).

Siman 84

Insects that grow in water that is in house vessels, pits, and caves, that don't have fountain in them, are permitted, even though they don't have fins and scales. Therefore, one can lean over and drink from them, and not to be concerned with them, if they happened to come into his mouth. <i>But it is forbidden to draw [water] in a vessel and drink from them (Ashiri and the Arukh Klal 41 and the Kol Bo)</i> And if they left their place where they grew, like outside pit or on side of vessel, even though they came back, they are forbidden. And presumably, there is no place of concern that they left. But if they did not leave but are on side of vessel, on inside, they are permitted.
Those that grow in water that is in furrows or ditches, (explanation: slits, long and short ditches, wide like made for fish inclosures, Rashi), they are withdrawn and not flowing, there are those who forbid and there are those who permit.
The one who filters water, or the rest of liquids, if it had worms or gnats or mosquitoes in it, even though they returned inside, it is prohibited, because they had already left. Therefore a drink that worms normally grow in them, and similar situations, one does not filter it with wood slivers and straw, at night, lest they will return or fall inside the vessel, and one comes to drink them. <i>Gloss: But it is permitted to filter through a garment or sieve, for behold they are not able to fall through there into the drink, also it is permitted to pour a liquid from one vessel to another vessel, since they always are with a liquid, this is sanitary treatment (Beit Yosef).</i>
Worms that grow in fruit, in picked [fruit], they are permitted. The Torah only forbade crawling things that crawl on land. To what are we referring, when they did not leave the fruit. But if they left the fruit, even if it did not reach the land rather it dead in the air before it reached the ground, even if it did not entirely leave the fruit, only a little, or it only left onto the fruit, or on the seed that is inside, or if it left from fruit to fruit, it is forbidden. And there are those who say even if it died within the fruit and left afterwards. Any time that it is found within the fruit, even a hole bored to the outside, we are not concerned lest it left and returned. <i>There are those who forbid if the hole bored to the outside (Moredechai PA''T and Sh''D in the name of RAB''N and Rabbi ABI''H in the name of Rabbi Yoel Huvah BT''H Siman 171) and this is how we are accustomed (Terumat HaDeshen ibid. and Hagahot SH''D.</i>

All types of fruit where it is their norm to be wormy while they are attached, he may not eat until he checks the fruit from the inside. Maybe there is a worm in it. And if the fruit waited after it was picked, for 12 months, he may eat without an inspection, because any creature that has no bone in it does not survive for 12 months. Nevertheless, he needs to check them to throw away the worms that are found between them on the outside, or on top of the fruit. And even after he throws away those that were found on the outside, there is concern that maybe when he puts them in water in the pot, they will exit and crawl in the water or in the walls of the pot or on the fruit. Therefore, one who comes to cook after 12 months, wormy fruits, he should put them in cold water. The wormy and pierced ones will rise to the top. And afterward he should put them in boiling water, so that if a worm remains it will die immediately. And it does not help with them if he checked the majority. Rather he must check all of them, because it is a prominent minority.


If one violated and cooked within 12 months without checking, if he is able to check, he checks. And if not, it is permitted. And if a bit were found in the pot, he throws them away and eats the rest, because there is no fruit that does not contain 60 against the taste of the worm that is inside it. And there is an opinion that says that these words are only if only one or two were found. But if three or four were found, everything is forbidden. Haga”h: And only a food that it is impossible to filter it and to remove the worms from them. And since it is assumed to have worms it is all forbidden. But if it is possible to filter it, he removes the worms that are found there, and the rest is permitted. And see later end of chapter 100.

Kosher signs for locusts: All that have 4 legs and 4 wings, and its wings cover most of the length and circumference, and has two legs to jump with, even if it doesn't have now, but is destined to grown them after a time. And even if it has all these signs, it is not permitted unless its name is "chagav", or they have a tradition that its name is "chagav."
Locusts do not require slaughter.
Oil of non-kosher locusts is permitted.

Siman 86

1. <b> Identifying characteristics of eggs, and their laws. Containing 10 sections. </b> Identifying characteristics of eggs, to recognize if they are from a "pure" bird species: If the two ends [of the egg] are both round, or pointed, or if the egg yolk is on the outside and the egg white on the inside, this is known to be the egg of an "impure" bird, and even if the seller says that they come from a "pure" bird, we do not rely on them. But if one end is convex and round, and the other end is pointed and round, and the egg white is on the outside and the egg yolk on the inside it is possible that it is the egg of an impure bird, but it is possible that it is the egg of a pure bird. Therefore, one must ask the Israelite <i> (Or idolater) (citations)</i> who is selling them. If they say, "It comes from such-and-such a bird," and we recognize that species of bird to be pure, one can rely on them. But if they say, "It comes from a pure bird," but cannot name the species of bird, one cannot rely on them. Therefore, one may not purchase eggs from the idolaters, unless one recognizes them, and they are visually identifiable to be the eggs of a pure bird. And we need not worry about the possibility that they might be eggs of a mortally ill [bird] or one who died of natural causes. 
2. Currently the common practice is to purchase unmarked eggs from anyone, because eggs from impure birds are uncommon amongst us. <i> RAMA: This is specifically about the ordinary type of eggs, that is, eggs of chickens or geese or similar ones to these. But one must not purchase eggs from birds that are not as common as those of impure birds, unless one observes the identifying characteristics, as will be explained. (Aruch, klal 42) </i>
3. The egg of a mortally ill [bird] or one who died of natural (ie. non-slaughter) causes, even if it was so completely formed that similar ones are sold in the marketplace: it is prohibited. And even if it mixed with a thousand, they are all prohibited. But there is doubt whether the egg comes from one [bird] who died of natural causes, or by proper slaughter, it is permitted, even without being mixed [with permitted eggs]. But if there is doubt about whether it is the egg of a mortally ill [bird] or one who died by proper slaughter, it is prohibited. <i> RAMA: And if the chicken was slaughtered and then found to be mortally ill, the rule for the eggs is like the rule for milk which was milked form an animal (B"Y) and see above section 81. </i>
If one hit a chicken on her tail and she miscarried her egg before it was fully completed, it is permitted, and there is no concern here for the prohibition of limbs from living animals. This is true as long as it [the egg] is not enveloped in tendons.
5. An egg from an impure bird, which has been cooked with others: if it is in its shell, it does not prohibit them, but if it is shell-less, it prohibits them <i> (and if it is punctured, this is considered shell-less.) (citations) </i> And one needs 61 parts permitted eggs parallel to it [the impure egg] to nullify it <i> (and even if it is not whole, but rather scrambled.) (citations) </i> But if it was cooked in a permitted dish, one only needs sixty parts of the dish to nullify it. And an egg that contains a chick or blood: it prohibits whatever is cooked it it, even if it is not shell-less. <i> RAMA: And the shells of the prohibited one combine as well with the permitted material to nullify the prohibited material. And how much more so the shells of the permitted ones. (citations) and see below section 99. </i> 
6. An egg from one [bird] which was mortally ill or died of natural causes: its law is the same as the law of an impure bird, in that as long as it is not peeled, if it was cooked with others, it does not prohibit them, as it is [as insignificant as] egg water. <i> RAMA: And some say that all eggs have the same law, and do prohibit [other eggs that were cooked with them] even if they were not peeled. (Tur citing BH"T and most poskim) And it is right to practice this way, in a situation when there is not a great loss. But if there is a great loss, it is right to rely on the lenient ones. </i> 
7. A chick born out of an egg from a mortally ill [bird] or one who died of natural causes: it is permitted. <i> RAMA: And some say that we do not practice this way (in the Aruch) and ideally one should be cautious. </i>
8. An egg from an impure bird in which the bird had begun to take form: they used to be dealt lashes for it on account of the prohibitions on flying vermin. But an egg from a pure bird in which the bird had begun to take form: if one ate it, they would deal them lashes for "rebelliousness" [ie. violations of Rabbinic-level laws.]
9. A mortally ill animal cannot give birth. For this reason, a bird which is possibly mortally ill: if it laid eggs, we impose a holding time on it while it lays all the eggs that it was already carrying. If it carries eggs again, it is kosher. And we will know this after it has been held between the end of one birthing session to the start of the next birthing session for 21 full days, as this is the duration of her gestation. And this rule applies the same to a chicken which has never birthed before, in which there arises doubt about mortal illness: that if she gives birth 21 days after the time that the doubt arose about mortal illness, she and the eggs are permitted. 
10. We must not sell the eggs of a mortally ill [bird] or one who died of natural causes to an idolater, in case they come back and sell it to an Israelite. How should one act? One should scramble it up into a dish, and sell it to an idolater, because then certainly an Israelite will not buy it from them. In what cases is this said? When one sees it scrambled in their hand, because one should be concerned that an Israelite has sold it to them because it is from a mortally ill animal. But it is permissible to purchase from them bread that was kneaded using eggs in places where the custom is to eat bread of idolaters, since one does not see it scrambled in their hand. <i> RAMA: And some say that currently, when people are not cautious about bread of idolaters, one should not sell an idolater a prohibited egg, even scrambled, as we must have concern for the possibility that they will mix it with bread and sell it to an Israelite. (citations) And this is how the custom is practiced, in places where it is customary to make the bread with eggs, and the custom is to permit buying it. But in other places, one does not need to worry. </i> 

Siman 87

It is written in the Torah: "you will not cook a kid in the milk of its mother" three times (Exodus 23:19; Exodus 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21); once for the prohibition of cooking, once for the prohibition of eating, and once for the prohibition of receiving benefit [from the cooked meat and milk products]. The prohibition of eating is presented in the language of cooking, to say that there is no prohibition from the Torah [in regard to meat and milk] unless it is in a manner of cooking, but rabbinically it [the mixture of meat and milk] is forbidden in every way. <i>All meat and milk [mixtures] that are not forbidden from the Torah are permitted to benefit from.</i>
[The word] "kid", is not specific, it is the same rule with ox, sheep and goat. There is no difference if it is the milk of the mother, or of another [domesticated] animal.  Rather, the verse refers to the common case. 
The law only applies with meat from a pure [kosher] animal and milk from a pure animal, but meat of a pure animal in milk that is impure, or meat from an impure animal in pure milk, is permitted to cook and benefit from.  Meat of a wild animal and of fowl, even in milk which is pure, is permitted to cook and benefit from; and even eating is only prohibited rabbinically.  Fish and grasshoppers are not prohibited [with milk] even rabbinically.  <i>RAMA: We make milk from almonds and place bird meat in it, since [milk and bird meat] is only rabbinically [forbidden].  But with meat from a domesticated animal, place almonds next to the milk, so that people don't misunderstand.  This is as we said above, in chapter 66.</i>
It is forbidden to cook [meat] with the milk of a woman, because of appearances. If woman's milk fell into [meat] food, it is nullified and there is no need to measure.  <i>RAMA: It seems according to this, all the more so that it is forbidden to cook with impure milk or impure meat with pure milk, in the case of domesticated animals. But with rabbinical prohibited fowl, there is no need to be concerned. </i>
Eggs that are found inside chickens, if they are complete - i.e. they have white and yolk - even though that it is bound with sinews -  indeed it is complete and it is permissible to eat it with milk. If the egg only has yolk, it is forbidden to cook with milk.  If he eats the eggs alone, it is permissible to eat cheese or milk afterwards.   
A person who [Cooks meat and milk together by] smoking and or cooking in the hot springs of Tiberius does not receive lashes for transgressing a lav. Similarly,cooking meat in "mai chalav" (milk water) or chalav maisa ("dead milk") or chalav zachar or cooking blood  and  milk  together  is  exempt (from lashes) and one  who  eats  it [milk  cooked with blood] does not receive lashes for [transgressing the lav of] meat and milk. <i>RAMA: Chalav zachar is not called milk at all and if it fell into a pot of meat it would not be forbidden. However [if ]chalav maisa or mai chalav [fell into a pot of meat] the food is forbidden because they  are  comparable  to  milk.  It  is  even forbidden to  cook [chalav  maisa  or  mai  chalav  with  meat] initially. There are those who say that it is forbidden to stoke the fire under the pot of a non-Jew because they use the same pot sometimes to cook milk and sometimes to cook meat. Therefore by stoking the fire under the non-Jew’s pot one may come to cook meat and milk [together]. Furthermore, one should not mix together the water that was used for washing milk dishes with water that was used to wash meat dishes and then give it to an animal because the water becomes forbidden for use. And furthermore, the container that is used to make shampoo should not be used [for anything else] because the  ashes  on  the  stove that  are  used  to  make  shampoo  are mixed with milk and meat. Therefore it is forbidden to use the pots that are usually on the stoves in the winter lodges because sometimes milk and meat splash on them from the cooking going on in the oven itself. After the fact, we do not worry about the above laws, and furthermore even initially they are only a chumra b’alma (stringency of the world). One who is lenient will not lose. </i>
One who cooks an embryo in milk is liable, and one who eats them cooked together is liable. But cooking the placenta, skin, tendons, bones, ikari karnaim (The part of the horn that is found below the skin) ,or soft hooves [in milk] is exempt [from the Torah] and one who eats them is exempt.
There are those that say that the whey of the milk <small>(meaning the milk that's extracted from the curdled cheese)</small> is not included in [the category] of "milk water" and it is forbidden from the <i>torah</i>. Rather, this is what "milk water" is: after they make the cheese they cook the whey, and the foodstuff floats to the top, and the only thing that's left is mere water; this is what's called "milk water".
Milk that was found in the stomach [of the animal] is not called milk, and it is permitted to cook meat in it, even in the liquidy part. And there are those that forbid it, <i>and so is our custom.</i>
Milk that was found in the stomach [of the animal] <i>from the outset one should not leave it in the stomach until the milk that's in the stomach cools off, but after the fact, there is nothing to worry about until</i> it was salted in the stomach, or it stood in it for a full day, [then] it is forbidden to curdle milk with it. <i>RAMA: And if one did curdle milk with it, if it was liquidy, the entire cheese is forbidden unless there was sixty times the amount of [permitted] milk that one made curdled with against the forbidden [milk] from the stomach. And if there was sixty times the milk it is all permitted. And if the [milk in] the stomach was solidified, it does not forbid [the cheese] at all even if there wasn't sixty times the [permitted] milk against the [milk in] the stomach. And if the [milk in] the stomach was liquidy at first and became solidified, it has the law of liquidy [milk]. And there are those that are lenient in this matter, and in a case of monetary loss, there is room to be lenient. The skin of the stomach, sometimes they salt it and dry it out and it becomes like wood and they fill it with milk, [in this case the milk is] permitted, since after it was dried out it is like mere wood, and it has no moisture of the meat in it.</i>
If one curdled cheese in the skin of the kosher stomach, if there is the taste of meat in it, it is forbidden, and if not, it is permitted. But if one curdled in the skin of the stomach of an invalidly slaughtered animal or an invalid animal or a non-kosher animal, it is forbidden with any amount. <i>RAMA: Because something that's intrinsically forbidden, and one [used it] to curdle milk, even in a thousand parts it's not nullified. And this is precisely if there was nothing else that was used to curdle except the forbidden item, but if there was something else that is permitted that was used to curdle, then both this and that caused it [to curdle] and it would be permitted if there was sixty times [the permitted] against the forbidden.</i>

Siman 88

Even with meat of a wild animal and a bird it is forbidden to put them on a table where one is eating cheese, so that he doesn't come to eat them together. But [to put] on a table that's meant for arranging cooked foods, it is permitted to put one next to the other.
That which is forbidden to put together on the same table, that is precisely only with two men who recognize each other, even if they insist on not sharing food with each other. However, by guests who don't recognize one another, it is permitted. And even by those who recognize each other, if they make any sign, such as if each one eats on his own tablecloth, or even if they eat on a single tablecloth but they place bread between themselves as a sign, it is permitted. <i>Rema: And this is precisely if they don't eat from the bread that's placed between them as a sign, but if they eat from it, it is no longer considered a sign, because even without this purpose, bread from which they eat from is placed on the table. But if they placed a drinking vessel between themselves, and if not for this purpose it is not normal for it to be on the table, it would be a sign even if they drink from the vessel. And of course if they place on [the table] a candelabra or other items on the table that they are [valid] signs. And they should be careful not to drink from a single vessel because food sticks to the vessel. And of course they should not eat from the same bread. And so is our custom to have individual salt-vessels for each person themselves, because sometimes when they dip into the salt there remains leftovers of the food in the salt.</i>

Siman 89

One who eats meat, even of a wild animal or fowl, does not eat cheese afterwards until he waits six hours.  Even if he waits that period, if he has meat between his teeth he has to remove it.  One who chews food for a child has to wait. <i>If afterwards he finds meat between his teeth and removes it, he has to wipe his mouth out before eating cheese (Ran chapter 25).  There are those that say that he doesn't have to wait six hours, but rather immediately if he finishes the meal and says the concluding blessing, it is permissible after wiping and rinsing his mouth (Tosafot Hullin 105a - "At the next meal", Mordechai chapter 25, Haga'ot Ashri, Haga'ot Maimoniot chapter 9 of forbidden foods, and Ravya).  The simple custom in our countries is to wait after eating meat one hour and to eat cheese afterwards, but you have to say the concluding blessing after the meat (HaAruch, Haga'ot Shaarei Dura) because then it's like a new meal and permissible to eat according to the lenient view.  But with no blessing, waiting alone does not good.  It doesn't matter if you waited before the blessing or afterwards (his own reasoning, from the Mahari, as opposed to the Issur v'Heter).  If he finds meat between his teeth after the hour, he has to pull it out (his own reasoning, from the Ran above).  And there are those that say not to say the concluding blessing in order to eat cheese (Aruch in the name of Maharach) but we're not careful about this.  And some are careful to wait six hours after eating meat before eating cheese, and it's proper to do so.</i> 
If one ate cheese it is permissible to eat meat immediately afterwards as long as one examines one's hands, so that one should not have any pieces of cheese attached to them, and if it is night and one is therefore unable to examine them thoroughly one must wash them. One must clean one's mouth and rinse it out. One cleans it by chewing bread, thereby thoroughly cleaning his mouth with it, and one can do this with anything that one chooses, except with flour, dates, or vegetables, because they attach to the palate (the area above the esophagus close to the teeth) and do not wipe well. Afterwards one should rinse one's mouth with water or wine. This was all stated in regard to meat of domestic or wild animals, but if one wishes to eat poultry after cheese there is no need for cleaning or rinsing.       Comment (Ramah): some are stringent (to wait six hours) even with meat after cheese (Mordechai in the name of the Maharam and Bet Yosef, Bach siman 173) and so is the custom with hard cheese, we do not eat afterwards even poultry, like with cheese after meat (and so it is in the Zohar). Some are lenient, and one should not protest against them, but they should do cleaning, rinsing, and washing of the hands, and it is better to be stringent. 
If one ate a cooked dish made with meat, it is permitted to eat afterward a cooked dish made with cheese, and washing between them is only optional. <small>And there are those that require washing.</small> But if one comes to eat cheese itself after a cooked dish made with meat or [to eat] meat itself after a cooked dish made with cheese, it is an obligation to wash his hands [between the foods]. <i>Rema: And fat of meat has the law of meat itself. And our custom now is to be stringent to not eat cheese after a cooked dish made with meat just like after eating meat itself, and one should not change this and break this fence. However, if there is no meat in the cooked dish, only that it was cooked in a pot used for meat, it is permitted to eat cheese afterward, and there is no custom to be stringent. And so too is the custom to eat meat after a cooked dish that has cheese or milk in it. However, there is [reason] to wash one's hands between them, and this is even [in a case where] one didn't eat actual meat but rather only a cooked dish made with meat after a cooked dish made with cheese if he touched them with his hands. A servant that prepares the meal and touches the food is not required to wash because we only require washing for those eating.</i>
One who ate cheese, and wants to eat meat, needs to remove from the table leftover bread that he ate with the cheese. And it is forbidden to eat cheese on the tablecloth that they ate meat on. (And vice-versa is similarly forbidden.) (So is implied in the Aruch.) And all the more so is it forbidden to cut cheese, even cold, with a knife that they usually use to cut meat. And not only that, but even the bread that they eat with the cheese is forbidden to cut with a knife that they use to cut meat. <i>And vice-versa is also similarly forbidden. However, via stabbing into hard ground, it is permitted. (Beit Yosef, quoting A"Ch and Kol Bo). But, all of Israel already is accustomed to having two knives and to mark one of them, so it is distinguished, they are accustomed to marking the dairy one, and it's not right to change a custom of Israel.</i> 

Siman 90

The udder <small>(meaning, the breast of the animal)</small> is forbidden according to the word of the Sages, because meat that is cooked with milk from a slaughtered animal is not forbidden from the <i>torah</i>. Therefore, if one tears it and empties the milk inside it is permitted to roast it and eat it. And if one tore it lengthwise and widthwise, and pressed it against a wall until there no longer remains the moisture from the milk, it is permitted to cook it with meat. And an udder that was not torn, whether it was from a young [cow] that did not nurse or whether it was from an adult, it is forbidden to cook it. And if one transgressed and cooked it by itself <small>and of course if he roasted it</small> it is permitted to eat it. And if he cooked it with other meat we measure it against sixty times [the other meat] and the udder is included in the count. How so? If the entire [food] including the udder is like sixty times the udder, the udder is forbidden but the rest is permitted. And if it is less than sixty, the entire thing is forbidden. Whether it is [sixty times the amount] or not, if it fell into another pot it can cause it to become forbidden and we measure it for sixty times like originally; because the udder itself when it is cooked becomes like a piece of forbidden food, and we only measure it like it was at the time when it was cooked and not like it was at the time when it fell [into the other pot]. <i>Rema: and there are those that say that if it originally fell into a pot that did not have sixty times as much, and the udder made it forbidden, if it then falls into another pot the udder is not included in the [count of] sixty times; and this is the main part.</i>
We have the custom to not cook [an udder] with meat at all. And to cook it without meat, in oil or in a pastry dough, we need it torn lengthwise and widthwise and pressed against a wall. And roasted, [we need] tearing lengthwise and widthwise. <i>Rema: And if one transgressed and cooked it, if he tore it lengthwise and widthwise and pressed it against a wall, there are those that permit it after the fact in a case of great loss, but without this it is not permitted. And that which we have the custom to tear it and to cut it many times lengthwise and widthwise across the entire thing, that's preferred and works better than pressing it against a wall. And by roasting, we have the custom that from the onset one should tear it lengthwise and widthwise and press it against a wall. However, if one transgressed and roasted it, even without tearing, it is permitted if it was roasted alone without any meat with it. And if it was roasted with meat, if it was torn lengthwise and widthwise and pressed against a wall, both of them are permitted, and if not, the top one is permitted and the bottom one is forbidden. And we don't forbid both of them [from the concern] that maybe the spit flipped, because after the fact we don't make it forbidden. But, from the onset we don't roast it with meat at all. And [to cook it] in a pot without meat, our custom is that it is forbidden from the onset. And so too is the law by frying it, even with meat and even if the udder was dried out. And if one transgressed and cooked it in a pot alone, after the fact it is permitted if it was torn lengthwise and widthwise and pressed against a wall. However, if it was dried out, which is after thirty days, if one transgressed and cooked it, even with meat, it is permitted after the fact. And to make it an udder in pastry dough, without meat, the custom is to permit it if the pastry dough is not baked in a frying pan. But, in a frying pan the law is similar to cooking in a pot. And there are those set individuals that are strict by all pastry dough if the udder is not dried out first. There are those that are strict to not bake a pastry dough of udder with one of meat in a small oven, rather, he should place one by the entrance of the oven. And it is better to be careful from the onset because this is only a mere stingency.</i>
It is permitted to cut a hot udder with a knife that was used to cut meat <small>and for sure [this applies to] a raw udder even though it is filled with milk</small>. And so too, it is permitted to cut meat with a knife that was used to cut an udder. And so too is the law [that it is permitted] to eat one in a utensil that the other one was eaten in. <i>Rema: And so too is the law [that it is permitted] to roast one on the spit that the other one was roasted on. And so too is the law that it is permitted to leave [an udder] on a plate together with roasted meat, even if they are both hot, because after the udder was roasted according to its law, it is considered like other meats for all purposes. And the is precisely if it was roasted according to its law, which is that it was first torn lengthwise and widthwise and pressed it against a wall, but if one transgressed and roasted it without tearing it, or [only] tore it slightly, all of these cases are from the onset forbidden, but after the fact they are all permitted. And if it was torn according to its law and roasted, even though afterwards one found in it holes full of milk, there is no need to be concerned. And so too, if one leaves it complete, before roasting it, together with its milk for a complete day, it is permitted; and we do not say that soaking it is like cooking it in this case.</i>
To roast an udder or to salt it with meat, its law is the same law as roasting or salting a liver with meat. And there are those who permit salting an udder on meat. <i>Rema: And one shouldn't salt it with meat; but after the fact, in every matter, it's permitted. The skin of the stomach, after its milk is removed from it and it's rinsed, it has the same law as other meat and it is permitted to salt it with other meat, and it does not have the law of an udder at all.</i>

Siman 91

[Cold] Meat and cheese that touched each other, they are permissible [to be eaten], but it's necessary to rinse the place where they touched.  And it is permissible to wrap them in one handkerchief, and we don't worry lest they touch.
Anything that requires rinsing, for example placing permissible cold meat on a cold non-kosher plate, is prohibited <i>ab inicio</i>, lest you eat it without rinsing.   This applies particularly to cooked meat, since it is not generally rinsed, but something that is generally rinsed, like raw meat and similar things, is permitted <i>ab inicio</i> [to place on a non-kosher plate.]  <small>NOTE: This applies particularly to something that is a bit moist; but things that are entirely dry, and the plate only absorbed from cold things, it is permissible to place a dry thing on it without any rinsing at all (his own reasoning) see chapter 122.</small>
It's necessary to be careful that meat doesn't touch bread, because if it touches it, it's forbidden to eat it with cheese. Also be careful that cheese doesn't touch it [bread], because if it touches it, it's forbidden to eat it with meat.
Hot meat and milk that are mixed together, and even cold meat that [falls] into hot milk or cold milk that [falls] into hot meat, everything is prohibited, because the bottom item determines [the status].   But hot milk that fell on cold meat or hot meat that fell into cold milk - peel off [the outer layer of] the meat and the rest is permitted, <small> NOTE: In a case where the meat needed to be peeled, if it wasn't peeled, but cooked as is, it is permitted after-the-fact. (Aruch klal 29)</small> and the milk is all permitted <small>(Rambam, Rabbenu Hananel, R"i, and others). </small> If one fell into the other [and both are] cold, rinse the meat and they're permitted.  
Salted food, that one is unable to eat because of its salt, which is the amount of salt that [is required] to salt [meat to cook] in a pot, and it stays there the amount of time [required] to salt [meat to cook] in a pot, as long as it is not rinsed, it has the status of food that one is unable to eat because of its salt. <i>Rema: And there are those that say that after it stays in the salt the amount [of time necessary] for salting it is afterwards not called hot food. And for a great need, for example in a case of great loss and it is needed for a feast made for a mitzvah, there is what to rely on the lenient [opinions]. But without this, one shouldn't be lenient at all. Even if the meat was not salted on both sides, only on one side, as long as it was salted [to the point of] salted food that one is unable to eat because of its salt, it is considered hot food. But anything that's not salted so much is considered cold, even if it was salted on both sides. And there are those that say that we are not experts in the matter and we should consider even [the amount needed] to salt for roasting to be like heated. And is is good to be stringent in a case where there is no great loss.</i> And a salting that's similar to the salting [one would do for food] that he needs to take for a long trip, even after it's rinsed it's considered food that can't be eaten because of its salt, and as long as it's not soaked in water it has the law of hot food which forbids [when touching certain other foods] up to [an amount] that needs to be peeled away. And there's no difference whether the salted food is on top and the unsalted food is on the bottom or whether the salted food is on the bottom and the unsalted food is on top, always the salted food imparts taste to the unsalted food and it does not absorb taste from it. Therefore, meat and cheese that were both salted that touched each other, one is required to peel away the place from both of them where they touched. And if one of them is salted and the second is unslated, the salted food is permitted with a rinsing and the unsalted food requires peeling away. <i>Rema: And there are those that say that with all salted foods we require a measure of sixty times [in order to permit the foods], and see later on in chapter 105 how we are accustomed to rule. And that which we said that if the salted food was pure and the unsalted food was impure that [the pure food is] permitted, that's where the impure food was dry, but if it's a wet item it forbids the pure food, for after it's [salted to the extent of a food that] one is unable to eat because of its salt, it absorbs from the forbidden food that's near it and they both become forbidden. And this is precisely where the pure food is [at least] slighly moist, but if it's completely dry it does not absorb from the moist food near it.</i> And if they are both dry, even if they are both salted, or if they are both moist but not because of salting, it is enough [to permit them] with rinsing. <i>Rema: Al meat juices from meat that was salted, even if it was only salted [to the extent required] for roasting, it's considered like hot food. And therefore, if meat juices fell on cheese or onto a vessel, it forbids it. Even in a case where the meat wouldn't forbid because it's not considered like hot food, nevertheless, the meat juices are considered like food that one is unable to eat because of its salt. And meat juices of meat that forbids that fell onto a vessel, [the vessel] requires being immersed into boiling water. And if it's an earthenware vessel, it requires breaking it. And if it only fell onto one area, and the vessel is wood or something similar, one can peel away that area and that's enough.</i>
Where do we say that it's only forbidden up to [an amount] that needs to be peeled away, that's where neither of the pieces are fatty, for if there is fat the entire item is forbidden. And so too the accompanying [food] is entirely forbidden because the fat diffuses <small>and see later on in chapter 105</small>.
That which we distinguish between between [food] that one is able to eat with its salt and [food] that one is unable to be eat because of its salt, this is referring to raw meat, but hot roasted meat that fell into salted food, even if it can be eaten with its salt, it requires [a layer] to be peeled away. And if there are cracks, or if it's spiced with spices and it's entirely hot and roasted, it is forbidden. <i>Rema: And so too is the law by baking and cooking. And there are those that say that even if they are cold that this is also the law, and so too this is what one should follow if there's no great loss.</i>
Milk and meat is only forbidden, in the case of salting or in the case of soaking, to eat it, but it isn't [forbidden to] derive pleasure from it.

Siman 92

An olive-worth of meat that falls into a pot of boiling milk: let a non-Jew taste the dish. If he says that there is a taste of meat in it, it is forbidden. If not, it [the milk] is permitted, even in less than sixty, and that piece [the meat] is forbidden.  When is this true?  When one quickly removes the piece before it exudes the milk that it absorbed, meaning before the pot rests from its boiling.  But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, (Rama) it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> 
Milk falls into a pot of meat: [let a non-Jew] taste the piece that the milk fell on.  If it does not taste of milk, everything is permitted.  If the piece does taste of milk, then that piece is forbidden. <i>For us who don't rely on a non-Jew, we need sixty in the piece, and if there's not sixty then it's all forbidden.</i> And we measure it [the original piece of meat] against the whole [pot].  If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.  In what situation are we speaking? When the pot was not stirred at the beginning when the milk  fell in, but only at the end, and the pot wasn't covered.  But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   
When a piece of meat becomes forbidden due to milk it is prohibited completely. If it was cooked with others, sixty is needed to negate it all. If you recognize it, take it out and the others are acceptable. If you don't recognize it, the sauce is permitted but all the pieces of meat are forbidden if the initial piece was rih-ooya lih-hitchabeid (too important to be considered part of a mixture)
We only say the rule of "the piece itself becomes just as forbidden as a <i>neveila</i>" by milk and meat, but not by other prohibitions, like an olive's bulk of forbidden fat that was absorbed by a piece of meat, and there isn't sixty times [the meat] to nullify [the fat], and it becomes forbidden, and afterwards it was cooked with other meat we only require [the new total] to have sixty times the olive bulk of the fat, and if so, then even the [original] piece of meat itself returns to become permitted. <i>Rema: And there are those that say that we apply to all prohibitions the rule of "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila", and this is the regular custom and it should not be changed. And this is precisely if the forbidden item is attached to the permitted piece of meat, or if the piece of meat is entirely outside of the sauce and the forbidden item fell onto it. But, if part of the piece of meat is inside the sauce and the prohibitted item is not attached to it, we do not say "the piece of meat becomes just as forbidden as a neveila" and the entire pot would combine [to sixty times the forbidden] to nullify the forbidden item. Nevertheless, there is what to be stringent about and to forbid that piece of meat. And all of this is regarding other prohibitions, but by milk and meat, even though there is no forbidden item attached and part of the piece of meat is inside the sauce, we say that "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila". There are those that say that we don't say "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila" if a forbidden liquid became mixed with a permitted liquid, and afterwards the entire thing became mixed with another permitted item; and we would only require sixty times against the [original] forbidden [liquid] that fell [in order to nullify the forbidden part of the mixture]. And there are those that rely on this in other prohibitions if it's needed in a case of great loss, but not by milk and meat. And if a dry item became mixed with a dry item, we don't say by any prohibition that "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila". And see above in chapter 99 according to the law of "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila". A vessel that became forbidden by absorbing a forbidden item, we do not say by it that "the piece becomes just as forbidden as a neveila", and we only need sixty times against the prohibitted item that was absorbed [in order to nullify it], and see above in chapter 98.</i>
A drop of milk that falls on the outside of a pot that is on the fire, if [the drop] falls opposite the food [in the pot] one only needs [the amount of food in the pot to be] 60 times [the amount of milk] in the drop that was absorbed within [the walls of the pot], this is as if [the drop] fell into the food [itself]. But if [the drop] fell [opposite] a place [in the pot] where there is no food, it spreads out within the walls of the pot until it is next to the food such that there is not 60 times against the drop, that spot on the pot is prohibited, and if one stirs against the prohibited spot on the pot, the food is prohibited. This is how to fix it: do not touch it until it has cooled off. [Isserles:] This applies specifically to an old pot [one that has been used within the last 24 hours]. If [the pot] is new [has not been used within the last 24 hours], in any case one needs 60 times only against the drop that fell on it, as it says later in section 98, concerning the spoon.  
The prevailing custom is to forbid when [a drop of milk] falls on the [outside] of the wall [of the pot] not opposite where the sauce is. And this is precisely when it falls on the side [of the pot] that is not near the fire, but if it fell [on the side] near the fire, it is permitted, because the fire burns it and dries it out, <small>and then, the pot would also be permitted</small>. And this is precisely when dealing with a small amount, such as a drop, but if a large amount fell, it is not permitted even if it fell [on the side] near the fire unless it was opposite the sauce and was sixty times the amount. <i>Rema: And then, the pot would be forbidden even if there was sixty times the amount in the cooked food against the drip that fell, and one should immediately pour out the cooked food from it on the other side, not near the drop. And if one cooks in that pot another cooked dish, its law is the same as the first time.</i> 
There are those that permit it in extenuating circumstances, for example, on the eve of <i>shabbat</i>, even if [the drop] is not opposite the sauce, even not on the side of the fire, as long as there's sixty times the amount. <i>Rema: And this is the custom. And if milk spilled, or any other hot forbidden food, on the ground, and you put on top of it a hot pot [of meat], if what spilled is not near the fire, it's only a secondary vessel [of heat], and therefore, the pot is forbidden, because it absorbs a bit, and the cooked food is permitted because the bottom item determines [the status]. And a stream from a boiling pot that went to [another] cold pot, if the stream was cut off from [the bubbles of] the boiling pot before it reached the cold [pot] it's also considered like a secondary vessel [of heat], and if it's not cut off it's like what's poured [from a primary vessel] and the cold pot is forbidden if the stream that's touching the pot is [as hot as] "when the hand retracts". And the cooked food that's inside it is permitted because what's poured only forbids up to [an amount] that needs to be peeled away. But if the [other] pot is hot, and it's a primary vessel, and certainly if it's standing near a fire, even if the stream is cold, it's all forbidden because the bottom item determines [the status]. And it's like cold inside of hot where it's all forbidden like we explained above in chapter 91. A drop that fell onto the lid of a pot, its law [is like if] it fell on the pot opposite the sauce. And this is if the pot has already begun to boil because then the steam constantly goes up and reaches the lid and goes down from there to the sauce.</i>
A pan of milk, placed in an oven, underneath a pot of meat - the steam rises, enters into the pot, and renders it forbidden. <i>Rema: If there was actual milk in the pan, then we require sixty times its volume in the meat. All of this is when the pan is open, and the steam rises up from the food itself, to the pan that is above it, and also if the two are so close to each other that the steam that rises is so how that it would make your hand retreat rapidly. If not, then everything is permissible. Therefore, we hang meat (slabs) over dairy pots, and we don't worry about the steam that rises. And if something is covered, then everything is permissible, since it is like two pots that touch each other, which do not make each other forbidden, and all the more so with mere steam. But ideally (lechatchila) one should be strict on all this.</i>
A tallow candle made like a wax candle from which falls a drop [of hot, liquid tallow] on a pot, one only needs to scrape it off. However, if a drop of [hot] molten tallow fell on a pot, it requires [kashering by] immersion in boiling water. 

Siman 93

A pot in which meat was cooked, one may not cook in it milk. And if one cooked [milk] in it within 24 hours, it is forbidden on account of “giving taste.” And one needs to measure [for negation by 60] against the entire pot. But if it sat for 24 hours before one cooked in it, [it is a case of] “giving detrimental taste,” and the food [cooked in it] is permitted, but the pot is forbidden to cook in either meat or dairy. <small>NOTE: But other things are permitted. And the rule for a pot lid is like the rule for the pot itself. And there are those who are [more] stringent for the lids, saying that even when it isn’t <i>ben yomo</i> [meaning it hasn't been used in the past 24 hours] its rule is like it was <i>ben yomo</i>, and so they act in a few places. And this is how I behave according to the custom, and it is a restriction without reason. And in any event, in a place where there is some reason, like it is a Shabbat need or a [potential] loss, there is [reason] to permit [the cooked food] if [the lid] is not <i>ben yomo</i>, like the pot itself. And if they took a boiling-hot lid from a meat pot and put it on a milk pot, and if both of them are hot, both of them are forbidden if there is food in the pot of meat and milk. And if the lid is cold and the pot is hot, still both of them are forbidden if it began to sweat under the lid, for “the bottom dominates.” And if the lid is hot and the pot is cold, everything is permitted, just the food requires taking a <i>qlippah</i>, if it is possible to take a <i>qlippah</i>, and if not, everything is permitted. And if there wasn’t food in the pot, everything is permitted, for this is like two pots that touched each other.</small>

Siman 94

If one inserts a dairy spoon into a meat pot, or the opposite, we measure against all [the portion of the spoon] that was inserted into the pot (food itself) <small>if the spoon was a <i>ben yomo</i> which is that it was used with a primary vessel [of heat] in the last 24 hours</small>. And there are those who say that if the spoon is metal that we measure using the entire spoon because if part of it gets hot the entire thing gets hot. <small>And the first opinion is the main one, and so too is our custom, and see above in chapter 98.</small>
If one inserted a spoon into a cooking vessel two times and did not know in the meantime, they need 60 times twice (the amount of food versus the spoon). There are those who say that it is sufficient to have 60 times (the amount) once. This is the custom. 
If there is 60 times [the volume displacement of the spoon in the food] to negate [the taste in] the spoon, the vessel and the food are permitted but the spoon is prohibited, whether [the] spoon [is a] meat [spoon] or [a] dairy [spoon], since it [the spoon] has absorbed [the prohibited taste of] meat and milk. And even ex post facto it [the spoon] is prohibited, if one inserts [the spoon] again [into the food], whether in meat or in dairy, the entire time [that] it [the spoon] has been used within the past 24 hours. And if there is not 60 times [the volume displacement of the spoon in the food], everything [the spoon, the food, and the vessel] is prohibited [and one is prohibited] from deriving benefit [from the spoon, the food, or the vessel], even the vessel, although it is permitted to place within it [the vessel] fruits or cold [food items], since they do not benefit [i.e., absorb taste] from the prohibited body [i.e., the prohibited vessel]. 
If the spoon has not been used in the past 24 hours, the vessel and the food are permitted and the spoon is prohibited a priori, whether with meat or with dairy. Nevertheless, ex post facto, it [the spoon] is not prohibited, since it has not been used within the past 24 hours.
If one cooks water in a new pot and dips a dairy spoon into it, and thereafter returns and cooks water again [in the pot] and dips a meat spoon into it, and both spoons had been used within the past 24 hours and neither time was there 60 times in the water against the spoons, it is prohibited to use the pot for either meat or dairy, but it is permitted to cook other [i.e., pareve] things [in the pot] {?} [Isserles:] However, if one proceeds to cook in the pot meat or dairy, it is permitted, since it is a case of secondary transfer of taste (Hagos Maimoni 8:9 {ch. 9?}). A pot in which one cooks vegetables or water and into which one dips a spoon which has been used within the past 24 hours, and the pot has not been used within the past 24 hours, or the opposite [i.e., the spoon has not been used within the past 24 hours and the pot has been used within the past 24 hours], or there is 60 times within the food [against either the spoon or the pot, respectively], everything is permitted. (Aruch, rule 37), It is our custom to be strict to eat the food that is within a vessel that has been used within the past 24 hours, and to prohibit the vessel that has not been used within the past 24 hours but this is only a stringency, according to the letter of the law, all of these cases are permitted.
 Onions or vegetables that have absorbed meat taste and one cooks them in a dairy pot, if one knows how much meat [taste has been] absorbed by the onions and the vegetables, one only needs 60 times against the [taste of] meat [in the onions and the vegetables]. [Isserles:] It is not appropriate to say [that the onions and vegetables] are inherently, entirely not kosher; they are still entirely kosher, and similarly one only needs to [have 60 times] against that which was absorbed [by the onions and the vegetables]. The same applies to a dairy pot in which one cooks water within the past 24 hours, and thereafter cooks [in the pot] meat, one does not say that it is necessary to have 60 times against all of the water, only against the dairy that was absorbed by the pot. (From that which is implied by the Tur and Beis Yosef).
Hot meat that one has sliced with a dairy knife, all of the slices are prohibited if there is not 60 times [in the meat] against the place on the knife that sliced the meat. But if [the knife] has not been used within the past 24 hours, the slice is not prohibited except for a thin, outer layer. [Isserles:] All of this applies to meat cooked in primary vessel, further if the knife has been used within the past 24 hours and there is not 60 times in the meat against the knife, all [of the meat] is prohibited, further the knife requires [kashering by] immersion in boiling water. But if the meat is in a secondary vessel, a thin, outer layer needs to be removed from the meat; and the knife [requires kashering by] inserting it into the ground ten times (Aruch, rule 36), and this is the custom. And even if the knife is has not been used within the past 24 hours, there are those who remove a thin, outer layer from the meat a little bit because of fatty material of [on] the knife (Tur and Beis Yosef in the name of the Sefer Mitzvos Katan).   
If cheese falls on a meat pastry  in the oven, even wet, and similarly hot cheese in a meat pot that has been used within the past 24 hours, only a thin, outer layer is prohibited.
[If] one cooks honey in a meat pan that has been used within the past 24 hours and empties it [the honey] warm into a dairy vessel that has been used within the past 24 hours, [the honey] is permitted, because this is a case of the secondary transfer of taste between two permitted things [i.e., kosher meat and kosher dairy]. 

Siman 95

Fish that were cooked or roasted in a well-washed meat pot with no fat stuck to it are permissible to eat with kutach [a milk based food], because they [the fish] are two degrees removed from a permissible taste.  If the pot was not well-washed, if there is more than 1/60th the fish worth of substance on the pot, it's forbidden to eat them [the fish] with kutach.
An egg that was cooked in water in a dairy pot - it is permissible to put it into a chicken, even before the fact.  But if it was cooked in a pot with meat, even in its shell, it is forbidden to eat with kutach. <i>There are those that are strict with roasting and cooking and prohibit second-degree taste (Rivan in the name of Rashi, Aruch 34 quotes the Mordechai and ...) and the custom is to prohibit it before the fact.  After the fact, it is permissible in every way (Aruch).  This [prohibition] is only eating it with milk or meat itself, but it is permissible to serve it on their dishes  before the fact (Issur v'Heter, Aruch) and that is the practice. Also, if they weren't initially cooked or roasted, rather they were just on a meat plate, it is permissible to eat them with milk, and the inverse (his own reasoning). Also, if the vessel that they were cooked or roasted in was rancid - meaning it was not used for cooking food within 24 hours - we are lenient even before the fact to eat them with the other type (Aruch, ibid). All of this is assuming that the food is not sharp, but if it was sharp - e.g. you cooked sharp things in a meat pot even if it has not been used that day, or you crushed spices with a meat pestle, if you [cooked] it in milk, it's prohibited even after the fact, until there is 60 times the meat that is absorbed in them. ... And in any event, [this is not with regards to] an instance of sharpness on account of a small [amount of] spice in it, only if it is entirely sharp.</i>
Plates used for meat that were washed in a dairy pot with water so hot that one's hand recoils, even if both the plates and the pot had been used within the day - all is permitted because they are "nat bar nat" - a second degree impartation of taste of permissible foods and tastes. And this is only if one can say " I am certain that there was no fat stuck to the plates or to the pot." And if there was fat stuck to them then there needs to be 60 times the volume of water to nullify the volume of the fat that is on the plates. REMA: And some forbid even if there is no fat stuck to them unless the pot or the plates had not absorbed the taste within 24 hours. Then the plates and pot are permissible and the water - we are strict before the fact. But if both the plate and the pot had both been used for 24 hours and they were both washed together with piping hot water, then all is forbidden. And this is our practice and we should not change. But this is the case only if they were washed together in a "primary pot" that was on the stove (or heating element).  But if dairy and meat dishes are washed one after another or if they are washed together in a secondary vessel, then all is permissible. And if water is poured from a primary meat vessel onto a dairy vessel then its status is like a primary vessel and the dairy vessel is prohibited if it had been used for dairy within 24 hours. But if boiling water, (that was heated in a pot) that is neither dairy nor meat is poured on meat and dairy dishes together, even if there is oil stuck to them, all is permissible since the heat of pouring is not comparable to the heat of a primary vessel such that the vessels that water is poured over can swallow substances one from another. And if one finds a dairy plate among meat plates we are not concerned that they may have been washed together in a way that renders them prohibited. 
It appears to me that if one places ash in the hot water in a large pot before washing dishes in the pot, even if there is grease stuck to the plates, it is permissible because the ash mixes with the grease to impart a rancid taste.
One should not place a utensil that has <i>kuta<u>h</u></i> [i.e. dairy] on it near a bowl with salt in it, but one may place [a utensil that has <i>kuta<u>h</u></i> on it] near a bowl with vinegar.  <small>NOTE: And this is really if the utensils are uncovered, and even if [they are uncovered] if it happened and one put them together, it is permissible, and we do not worry that [the dairy] fell into the salt.</small>
It is permissible to put within [one] cupboard a vessel for meat with one for milk. <small>NOTE: And there are those who are strict <i>ab inicio</i>. And it is good to be careful <i>ab inicio</i> in a place where one does not need [to create possible confusion].</small>
Salt that was placed in a meat bowl, it is permissible to put it in milk. <small>NOTE: And [for] the person who is strict about this, blessing will come upon him for being strict <i>ab inicio</i>.</small>

Siman 96

1) Radish or beets that were cut with a meat knife, used that day or that was not cleaned off are not allowed to be eaten with dairy, until a slice is removed from the location of the cutting that is an "amount to be taken." This amount is equivalent to the width of a thumb. Or let it be tasted, and if it does not have the taste of meat it can be eaten with dairy with mere rinsing. There are those who say that this is also the rule with a knife that was not used that day and was cleaned off. And if you did not take the "amount to be taken" and you did not taste it and you cooked it with Milk, you need 60 times the amount that the knife touched, and this is the rule for something that was cut with a knife of a Non-Jew.  Rema: If one cuts [a radish] very finely [i.e., dicing], one needs 60 times against the entire radish.And some say the same is true if it is cut with a meat knife the entire radish is prohibited with dairy. And this is our practice ab initio, however after the fact only an "amount to be taken" is rendered forbidden. And this is only true if the radish itself was cut, but if the radish greens were cut there is no cause for concern. And if there is doubt if the radish was cut with a non-kosher knife, we are lenient. And so too we purchase radishes that were cut on their tops for we can assume they were cut with garden tools.And in a place where only knife-cut radishes can be found, the practice is to permit them through removing an "amount to be taken."
(2) If one cut garlic, onions, kerishin, and tamcha (known as krayn) and other things that are similarly sharp, or pickled fruits, or salted fish, they all have the same laws as one who cuts a radish. Rema: And it is nonetheless permissible to eat spice mixtures made by gentiles like ginger since they use special tools to prepare it our pull it out of the ground without cutting.
(3)Spices that are ground in a meat mortar that had been used within 24 hours should not be eaten together with dairy. Rema: And some say even if it was not used within 24 hours.
(4) Lemon juice made by gentiles and cut pieces of salted fish that are brought by gentiles in barrels are permitted. Rema: Because they bring large quantities at once and even if some of them are prohibited, for they were cut first with a non-kosher knife, they are nullified amidst the others that are subsequently cut, for the ones cut later do not become prohibited for the taste in the knife was nullified in the first items cut and so the entire group is permitted. And so too all cases of this sort. Therefore in some places they eat cabbage called kompast, even though it is cut open and chopped. And there are some places where they are strict about that and one should not change the practice. But other things that are not sharp, like apples or dry turnips, the practice is to permit just like lemons and one should not be strict at all.
(5) If one cuts squash with a meat knife can eat it with dairy if he merely scrapes away the place of cutting. And if he cuts a turnip, even that scraping is not required, rather mere rinsing suffices. Not only that, but even a radish cut after a turnip can be eaten with dairy after mere rinsing just like the turnip itself because the taste of the turnip changes and nullifies the taste absorbed from the knife. Rema: This is only true about turnips for its taste is changes, but vegetables or bread or other things do not accomplish this. And even after cutting a turnip one should not cut a radish more than once, unless he cuts turnip between each cut of the radish.

Siman 97

One may not knead dough with milk, lest one come to eat it with meat.  If one did knead it that way, the whole loaf is prohibited even to eat alone.  If it was a small quantity that can be eaten in one sitting, or its shape is unusual so it will be recognizable that it shouldn't be eaten with meat, it is permitted. One may not bake bread in an oven that was smeared with fat, and if one did, the rules are as for a dough kneaded with milk. <i>Rema: Thus we are accustomed to knead bread with milk for Shavuot, and also fat for the honor of the Sabbath, because all of this is considered a small amount.  Also, its shape is distinct from other bread. And all the more so [pastries made with meat like] phladan or pashtida are permitted (Hagahot S.D.) One should not bake bread with any [pastries made with meat like] phladan or pashtida in an oven, because it is considered possible that fat may leak onto the bread, and if it leaks under the bread it is as if the bread was kneaded with it (Beit Yosef in the name of the Hagahot Ashiri).</i>  The custom is to put the secondary (here: pareve) near the mouth of the oven (Beit Yosef in the name of the Hagahot S.D). <i>And even if the food is in a pan (which would prevent the leaking problem) we are accustomed to be strict in the first instance.</i>
An oven the was smeared with fat, we don't bake bread in it until it's heated from within until it turns white. And even if it's a tiled pan (<small>meaning, an earthenware vessel that's heated from below and one bakes cookies on it</small>) it is not permitted if heated from the outside. 
Bread that was baked together with roasted meat, and fish the was roasted in a single oven together with meat, it's forbidden to eat them with milk. And this applies to a small oven, but with a large oven that holds twelve measures of <i>esronim</i> and has an open mouth, it is permitted. And if the roasted meat was covered, and so too a meat pie that whose hole was covered, it is permitted even in a narrow oven. <small>And see later on in chapter 108 what the custom is.</small>

Siman 98

A non-permissible [food item] that was mixed with a permissible item that is not of its type, for example prohibited fat that was mixed with meat, a non-Jew should taste it, if [the non-Jew] says that it has no fat taste or if he says that it has taste but the taste is "pagum" (somehow not good), permitted. And this is that it is not for the ends of improving. And it must be that [the non-Jew] doesn't know that he is being depended upon. And if there is not there a non-Jew to taste it, we measure it against 60. And likewise, if it is a [mixture of two things which are] of the same type, because one cannot really upon taste, it is measured against 60. {REMA: It is not done now to trust a non-Jew, and we measure against 60.}
If it is was mixed with something of the same type and it was spilled, in a case where one can not deal with it to measure it, if it is known that it was majority permissible, [it is] permissible. And if it is not known that it was majority permissible,  [it is] forbidden. <i>Rema: And in the matter of "being of the same type" we follow the name, if it is the same then this is "of the same type," but we do not follow the taste if it is the same or not.</i> But if was mixed with something that is not of the same type and it spilled in a case where one can not deal with it to measure it, even it is known that it was majority permissible, [it is] forbidden. And if it was mixed with "of its kind" and with "not of its kind" and it spilled in a case where one can not deal with it to measure it, and it is known that it was majority "of its kind", one views the "not of its kind" as though it were not [present], and the rest, "of its kind" is greater and negates it.
When do we rule this way? When it spilled. But a forbidden food that mixed with a permitted food, and it is before us, and it is impossible to deal with it to measure it, even though it's [a case] of rabbinic prohibitions, it is forbidden.
Something Asur that was cooked with something Mutar, even if it is recognisable and complete and was thrown out - x60 [Mutar] is needed corresponding to the entire Isur - because we don't know how much "went out" of [the Isur]. Therefore someone that cooks in a Bat Yoma Asur pot or inserts an Asur spoon into Mutar food, x60 is required corresponding to the entire pot/part of the spoon that was inserted - because we don't know how much [Isur the pot/spoon] "swallowed" (irrespective if they are made of earthenware, wood or metal). Rama: and [the pot/spoon] must swallow through hot fire (circumstances in which the swallowing occurs throughout the entire Kli). But if the swallow via salting - doesn't permeate entire Kli, only Kdai Klipa (so only need to evaluate Kdai Klipa). Some are strict with a metal spoon to require x60 corresponding to the entire spoon (even if only part entered) because the heat on part heats the entire spoon. Rama: We act according to the 1st logic. And any Isur that becomes Batel with 60, if it is recognisable, it must be thrown out even if its taste is Batel by x60. Therefore if [Asur] fat falls into a meal and its taste is Batel by x60, cold water must be added and the nature of the fat is to congeal and to float above the water. The fat must be removed. Since it is able to be removed it is as if it is recognisable (and so it must be removed). Isur that was Batel in a pot and removed and then falls into another pot [the food in the pot] must be Batel by x60 the entire [Isur]. And so too indefinitely. But if it fell into the same pot twice - x60 is only needed once 
If the amount Issur is known, for instance: an new spoon or one that hasn't been used in the last 24 hours. which only absorb an olive's worth via mixing a dairy dish and then subsequently a meat dish, the amount of nullification needed to negate the prohibited mixture in the spoon is only in relation to that one olive's worth absorbed in the spoon. (We don't apply Haticha Naaset Neveilah to utensils, even one used to mix prohibited foods).  However, an old spoon that has been used within the last 24 hours requires a nullification of the total volume of the spoon (We assume that everything it abosrbs is prohibited and we don't know how much it absorbed).  There are those that say even in this case nullification of 60 is only needed for the olive's worth of prohibition. Rama: The first line of reasoning is authoritative as I explained earlier with regards to a drop of milk that fell on a pot.  There are those that don't differentiate between the ages of the spoon unless it is made of clay (Mordechai Perek Gid Hanashe).  They say: since immersing clay in boiling hot water doesn't remove the prohibited substance the clay utensil itself becomes a piece of Neveila/Issur as opposed to other materials.  It's better to be concerned about the stringent opinion.  See above Siman 92.
...Half a כזית of something that's prohibited that was mixed with something permitted, needs 60 half זיתים of permitted food to mixed with it for it to be nullified.
...An egg that has a chicken in it or a drop of blood that was cooked with other eggs, needs 61x more to nullify the prohibited taste that it emits. 
...An udder is nullified when mixed with 59 pieces of meat (The 60th piece of meat is the meat of the udder itself) Rema- Everything that's prohibited in our days is nullified in 60x more. Except for chametz on Pesach and wine that was libated for an idol as is explained in the proper place. That which everything is nullified in 60x more, is as long as it doesn't add taste to the dish. But if it adds taste to the dish, and it's prohibited because of it's self (As opposed to if it's only prohibited based on the principle of חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבלה, see siman 92 for details), then even if there's 1000x more, it will not be nullified as long as one can discern the taste. Therefore salt and spices from things that are made for giving taste, if they are prohibited because of themselves, they are not nullified when there's 60x more.
If there is a pot that has 59 כזיתים of התיר and two additional כזיתים fell in, one of blood and one of prohibited fat, each one combines with the 59 כזיתים of התיר to nullify the other one. Similarly, if one כזית of prohibited fat falls into 29 כזיתים of התיר and in another pot of 30 כזיתים of התיר one כזית of blood falls in, and then the two pots (one containing 29  כזיתים of התיר plus one כזית of prohibited fat and the other containing 30 כזיתים of התיר and 1 כזית of blood) are mixed together by accident, it's permitted. Rema- And all the more so with 2 כזיתים, and one is of cheese and the other is meat and each one nullifies the other.

Siman 99





We may not intentionally nullify a prohibited food item. Even in a case where the prohibited item falls into a mix where there is not quite enough to nullify it - we may not add additional permitted food in order to nullify it.  If someone violated this and did, in fact, nullify it, or added to the permitted material: if they did so unintentionally, the food is now permitted. But if they did so intentionally, the food is prohibited to themselves, and to those for whom they may have nullified it, but is permitted to others (Remah: it is also prohibited to sell it to another Jew, lest one derive benefit from having improperly nullified the food).
A forbidden item <i>midderabbanan</i>, one does not mix it by hand to nullify it. And if one did so intentionally, it is forbidden to eat it. But if it fell on its own, and there is not enough to nullify it, one may add to it and nullify it. <small>NOTE: And there are those who that one many not nullify an item that is forbidden <i>midderabbanan</i> or to add to it like an item forbidden from Torah law. And this is how it is practiced, and it should not be changed. A forbidden item that was nullified, for example if there were 60 parts against it, and afterwards more of the forbidden items was added, one returns and is awakened [that is, counts all of the forbidden added even that which was already nullified and if it is now too much to be nullified than it is] forbidden. It does not matter whether it is “of the same type” or “of a different type” or whether it is dry or moist, or whether he knew in the meantime or whether he didn’t know in the meantime. A <i>kazzayit</i> of milk that fell into water and was negated by 60, and afterwards some fell from the water into a meat pot, permitted, even if there is not in the meat 60 against the milk, for behold it was negated by the water. And other things like that.</small>

Siman 100

A creature (that is, something like an ant or an unkosher bird, or a sciatic nerve, or a limb of a living animal, or an egg with a chick inside, and such things) is never nullified even in 1000 times. Something will not be considered a "creature" in this context unless it is something which has had life, thus a single grain of forbidden wheat would not count. It must also be something which was forbidden at its creation (thus excluding a kosher bird which died a a natural death [and is thus unkosher only because it had no shechita], and an ox which was put to death under a court ruling). Also it must be a whole thing, such that it would be called something different were it to be split apart (thus excluding forbidden animal fats). And it must also be whole. NOTE: The main forbidden sciatic nerve is only on the /kaf/ , and it is about 4 fingerbreadths wide, and if it is whole it *is* called a "creature".If the [beriah] fell into a pot of soup and was lost, it is all forbidden.
Something which is a [beriah] which was cooked with [heter], if it is not recognizable: all of the solids are forbidden and the liquid would be subject to the laws of [noten taam]. If it is recognizable: throw out the piece and the rest of the solid and liquid combined require 60 times the amount.(except the gid hanashe which does not give off a taste strong enough to forbid. however its' oils do forbid and would require 60 times to permit the liquid). Therefore the [yerech] which was cooked with its nerve if it is recognizable: throw the piece  away and the the rest is permitted if there is 60 times the amount the oils. If it is not recognizable: all of the pieces are forbidden. If there is in the pot 60 times the oils the liquid is permitted and if not it is forbidden. If the nerve was dissolved [nimuach] and is not recognizable you would require 60 times the nerve to permit it. 
Regarding a pot of soup that had a [beriah] fall into it and was lost in the mixture, everything becomes forbidden. ...
If one found [3 tolaim] in cooked vegetables, the vegetables are forbidden. However the liquid from the soup would be permitted once it is filtered. Similarly, meat can be rinsed and checked and then it is permitted.  

Siman 101

1. A piece of meat that is large enough to serve as an entree is considered food. And even a 1:1000 ratio is not enough to nullify. And even if it is prohibited for benefit, it is still prohibited since if it is nullified it would be permitted and permissible to serve as a single piece. Rema: And even if it is only prohibited by a rabbinic prohibition, we do not nullify, and if it is doubtful whether it is of a great enough size or not, we prefer leniency, and even if it is prohibited biblically. 
It will not classify as a Chaticha Hare'uyah Lehitkabed unless the item itself is prohibited, like treifa meat or milk and meat together. If, however, it is forbidden because it absorbed flavor from some forbidden food, and it did not have the required 60:1 to nullify the flavor,  then,  even according to those who hold that the entire contaminated piece becomes a prohibited item it still would not classify as Chaticha Hare'uyah Lehitkabed. Rema: Thus, even a piece of meat that had not been salted could be nullified, since its prohibition is not from itself but from the blood absorbed into it (ibid and Toras Habayis 170). Any item whose outer layer became prohibited (due to a shallow absorption of prohibited flavors) cannot be considered Re'uyah Lehitkabed, since the volume of just the outer layer is not large enough. 
A chicken with its feathers is not considered Ch.H.L because it is not fit to be served to guests as it is, even though after it was lost in a bunch the feathers will be removed. Similarly, an item will not be considered a Ch.H.L. unless it is cooked. Similarly, a complete lamb or a portion that is far too big would not be a Ch.H.L. because one does not served guests complete lambs or portions that are far too large. There are dissenting views on all of this. Rema: But this is our custom.

Siman 102


There are those who say, that it should not be said a thing will be permitted (d'var sheyesh lo matirin) except when it is inevitable or it can be made permissible without [monetary] loss. But if it is not possible to make or inevitable that it will become permissible, it is not judged to be a thing that will become permissible (d'var sheyesh lo matirin). Therefore, if there is a doubt [regarding] an egg [from] a sick (trefa) [chicken] which gets mixed with other [eggs] it does not have the ruling of a thing that will be permitted (d'var sheyesh lo matirin) since it is neither inevitable nor possible to make it permissible.

Siman 103

Any forbidden thing with a rancid taste cannot render a mixture prohibited. And even a case where the item's taste is not rancid by itself, but rather tasty and enhancing, but if it is rancid in this mixture, the mixture is permitted. Rema: However, important things, like a biryah (complete organism) and other similar things, if they do not themselves have a rancid taste, even if they make the mixture taste worse, they are not nullified, even in a thousand times their volume. 
Rancid – this does not to be so disgusting that one stops eating it, just even a little disgusting [and] it does not forbid its being mixed. And there is he who says that this is really when the forbidden item mixed in is small compared to much of the permissible item, but if the forbidden item is much within a small amount of permissible item, and even when it is half and half, we do not say that “giving a rancid taste is permissible” until it makes [the mixture] totally rancid [such] that it is not fit as human food. And if there are not there any substantial pieces of the forbidden item, but rather its taste alone, even if there is a much of the forbidden item and a little of the permissible item, it is permissible if it is only a little detrimental. And there is one who <i>hokheikh</i> (the meaning is [this <i>posek</i>] hopes to be stringent, and he forbids) to say that if the forbidden item has raised the measurement of the permissible one until it is better when it is eaten in its measure than how much it worsens in missing its flavor, forbidden until [the point at which] is becomes unfit for human consumption. About what things do we speak, those that make detrimental from beginning to end, but those that [initially] improve [the flavor] and at the end make it worse, or [a food that] makes worse [initially] and at the end makes better, [these items are] forbidden. <small>NOTE: There are those who say that even though the forbidden item gives a taste [that is] detrimental and the food is permitted, in any event the pot is forbidden, and if one cooked in it within 24 hours a food that the original forbidden item will got a positive taste, the second food is forbidden if there were not 60 parts against the first forbiddenness. But if one stirred the first mixture with a spoon, and afterwards thrust the spoon into the second mixture that it will also be detrimental to that, then the pot is not forbidden. And likewise, for a thing that does not have any taste at all, for example the cauldron in which one melts honey, even if there are bees’ legs in it, the cauldron is not forbidden and other things like this.</small>
Even [if] the forbidden food does not have the power to give a negative flavor by itself, but rather it requires another thing to assist it, for example if the forbidden item fell into a pot that has in it salt or a powdered spice and were it not for the salt or the spice which is in it [the forbidden item] would not have the strength to give a detrimental flavor, even in this case it is permitted.
Oil and honey of a non-Jew, even though they are cooked, they are permitted because the meat gives a negative flavor to the oil and makes it stinky, and likewise for honey. <small>NOTE: And there are those who say that meat does not give a detrimental flavor itself, only the drink that is made from the honey; and in a place where there is not a great loss, it is worth being stringent. Milk or meat in wine, this is detrimental, and it is permitted.</small>...
Any pot which is not <i>bat yoma</i> is considered [that] its taste is detrimental and it is does not make forbidden [food cooked in it]. And it is called "<i>bat yoma</i>" all time that it has not sat from one moment to another moment that the forbidden thing was cooked in it, and once “from one moment to another moment that the forbidden thing was cooked in it” has passed [i.e. it has sat for 24 hours since the forbidden food was cooked in it] it is not called <i>bat yoma</i>. And if one cooked in it when it was not <i>bat yoma</i>, the cooked food is permissible for this will be a “giving a detrimental flavor” and this is [only] that [the pot] is rinsed such that there isn’t any residue on the inside, and if one did not rinse it, it makes things [cooked in it] forbidden and this is like a piece of forbidden [food] that is not detrimental. And there are those who allow even [the food that] one cooked in it before rinsing it. <small>NOTE: And if there are 60 against that which was stuck to its inside, everyone [agrees that this is] permissible from when the pot is not <i>bat yoma</i>. And this is how one acts.</small>

A pot that has absorbed from meat and milk that were cooked in it together or one after the other, and before a night had passed water was heated in it, it is considered <i>bat yoma</i> until it will have sat 24 hours from the time that the water was heated in it. <small>NOTE: But if a night has passed, [it is] permitted. And likewise if a night passed between cooking meat and milk, even though water was heated immediately afterwards, the law is likewise thus. And this is the law for all forbidden items according to what is established for us regarding all forbidden items [that] a piece is transformed to non-kosher [meat]. And look above at <i>siman</i> 92. And in a place of loss it is worth permitting this behavior for all forbidden items in all matters, so long as there are 24 hours from the time of cooking the forbidden item.</small>

Siman 104



Siman 105

A forbidden item that was soaked with a cold permissible item for 24 hours, as in pickling, behold this is like it has been cooked and it is forbidden in its entirety. But less than [24 hours], rinsing is enough [to then eat the permissible item]. <small>NOTE: And wherever we say “pickled is like cooked”, even what was outside of the pickling is forbidden, for on account of the pickling below it wells up above, as with cooking. And there are those who are lenient on what was outside. And possible pickling, this is forbidden, except for meat with milk that we go with a leniency, since from the Torah it is only forbidden with actual cooking. </small> And if it were pickled in a brine or in vinegar, if it sat long enough that if it was on a fire it would boil and begin to be cooked, behold this is like it is cooked; and with less than this length, it is only forbidden through the thickness of a "peel" [which is the minimum thickness of the meat that can be removed in one continuous peel].
The heat of a “first” utensil [i.e. one which is directly exposed to the heat source] from which the hand shrinks back from it, it cooks and it makes everything forbidden. But the heat of a “second” utensil [i.e. one which is not directly exposed to the heat source] does not cook. And there are those who say that it likewise does not emit or absorb. And there are those who say that in-any-event it does emit and absorb, and it makes things forbidden to the taking of a <i>qlipah</i> [that is the thickness of a <i>qlipah</i> is forbidden, but the rest of the meat is still permissible]. And it is appropriate to be concerned to be careful in [this] matter <i>ab inicio</i> but <i>post facto</i> it is permissible without <i>qlipah</i>, and with mere rinsing is sufficient.
If a hot forbidden item fell into a hot permissible item in a “first vessel” [i.e. the vessel directly in contact with the heat source], or even if a cold forbidden item fell into a hot permissible item, everything is forbidden, for “the bottom dominates over the top” and [the “first vessel”] heats [the forbidden thing] until it emits into the bottom. And one does not [need] to mention a cold permissible item into a hot forbidden item, for the entirety is forbidden. But if the top is hot and the bottom is cold, [the forbidden food] does not make [the permissible food] forbidden except for a "peeling" [i.e. one must remove the amount of meat that can be peeled off the outside of the entire meat in one continuous piece], even if the hot top is the forbidden item. <small>NOTE: And all this is only said with regards to the heat of a “first vessel”, for example immediately as one removed it from the fire one placed it with the permissible item. But if it were already placed in a “second vessel”, and afterwards the permissible item were placed on it, the [forbidden food] does not make [the permissible food] forbidden at all, for a “second vessel” does not make things forbidden, as is explained. And if one placed this with that, if both are hot with the heat of a “first vessel”, the entirety is forbidden. And if the permissible food is cold, the permissible food required "peeling" in the place that it touched. A forbidden food that one placed in a permissible vessel or the opposite, we say of it, too, “the bottom dominates” as with two pieces… </small>
4. Until now we were talking about a case when the piece fell into a tavshil because the gravy will transfer the taste of issur and mix it into the entire tavshil. However issur, whether it is hot or cold, that fell onto [a chaticha] during tzli (being roasted) by the fire is only forbidden to a thumbnails worth, which is the width of a finger. Therefore, if a hind leg that is roasted with its gid (sinew) or a forbidden piece that is roasted with a permitted piece and they touch [during roasting] a k’dai n'tila must be removed from around the gid, and from the area of the piece that touched the forbidden piece. Similarly if issur fell on a piece that is outside the gravy and the pot was not stirred or covered, it is only assur k’dai n'tila (forbidden a thumnail's worth). However if the piece was in the gravy – according to Rashi [all] [according to the R”Y] even partially - or even it is completely out of the gravy and the pot is stirred or covered the gravy will spread the taste and mix it into the entire mixture.
5. The law the roasting is only forbidden a n'tila applies in cases like a sinew roasted with the hind leg, because the sinew is lean (or thin) and therefore it does not have the strength to spread to the entire piece. However, a fatty sinew that is roasted with its fat, if there is not in the entire sinew 60 against all the fat, it is forbidden to eat even from the tip of its ear, because shuman is spread completely (until 60). But if it is lean, even though there is not 60 against all the fat, it is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth since the fat of a lean animal is also lean. Even if the forbidden piece is lean and the permitted piece that is roasted with it is fatty, the issur (forbidden) will be spread throughout. Anything that has the ability to spread, and we know the exact place it fell during roasting, even though there is 60 to nullify the issur, that area is (still) forbidden a thumbnail's worth. (Mordechai in the name of several sages, and the Smak, and the Issur v'Heter Rule 14 and iggur in the name of the Maharil). <i> Rama: Anything cooked without gravy or baked has the law of roasting (Tur and Beis Yosef). And there are those who say that we are not experts in knowing what is lean and what is fatty, therefore we forbid in all cases until 60. Even if there is 60, the area of contact is forbidden a thumbnail's worth (Aruch) and this is the custom. This (law) is specifically (applied to) fats, or other issurim that can be considered fatty. However, in a case where the issur is not at all fatty, and without question it is lean, the area of contact is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth. (See Seif 9) (This is what is stated in the Beis Yosef).</i>

Do not roast kosher meat with non-kosher meat or meat of an unclean animal in the same oven, even if they do not touch one another. But if you did roast them, this is permitted - and even if the piece of forbidden meat was very fatty and the piece of permitted meat was lean. But if the oven is large enough to hold 12 <i>esronim</i>, and its mouth is open, then it is permitted to roast them in it as long as they do not touch one another. And if one of them is covered with a bowl or with dough or the like, it is permitted to roast them, even in a small oven with a closed mouth. <i>Comment: The same is true for meat with milk - the ruling is also thus. And it is customary to be strict before the fact, even with a large oven, and after the fact to be lenient even with a small oven. But, if one baked a loaf of bread with meat, it is forbidden to eat it with milk if he has another loaf. And thus if an idolator baked a loaf of bread with something prohibited, it is prohibited to buy that loaf if he has another loaf - because all this is an instance of "before the fact." But if he has no other loaf available, both are permitted, because this is an instance of "after the fact." There are some who say that we do not permit on the basis of smell not being an issue, even after the fact, unless the oven is open from the side or above where the smoke can escape. But in a case of financial loss we are not stringent after the fact, even if the oven is completely closed. If the prohibited thing is pungent, and all the more so if the permitted thing is pungent, smell is an issue and even after the fact it is prohibited, if the two of them are uncovered. But if one of them is covered, even as is common with dough, it is permitted. If they baked or roasted a prohibited thing and a permitted thing under one (covered) frying pan, uncovered (from one another) this is prohibited even after the fact. The same is true if they baked a loaf of bread with meat in such a manner, it is prohibited to eat it with milk. But one after the other there is no concern, unless there was sweat from the pan in both of them, because this is like the cover of a pot. There are some who say that any time we say smell is an issue and prohibit after the fact, that is specifically because there is not 60 times as much of what is permitted as what is prohibited. But if there is 60 times what is permitted, even among everything that is in the oven, the prohibited thing is nullified. And for the sake of loss this is the custom. Three are some who say that a prohibited thing that prohibits something, for example leavening on Passover, smell is an issue and it prohibits even after the fact, if the oven is small and closed, and the prohibited thing and the permitted thing are uncovered within the oven. There are some who say that we do not differentiate. And in a case of loss it is possible to rely on the words of those who are lenient. </i>

1. Two pots, one of permitted food and one of forbidden food, and before it two pieces [of food], one permitted and one forbidden; if the piece of forbidden food is [forbidden] Rabbinically, such as the fats from the Gid [Hanasheh], and these [pieces of meat] fell into these [pots of food], they are permitted, as we attribute saying, the prohibited food fell in the prohibited food, and the permitted food fell into the permitted food. And even if the permitted food in the pot is not a majority [of the food] in front of him. And this is also the ruling if there was only one pot of [Kosher] slaughtered meat, and one of these two pieces fell into it, and we do not know which [piece] it was, we attribute that the permitted piece fell in, even if the permitted food in the pot is not a majority [of the food] in front of him. Or if there was only one piece of Rabbinically forbidden food, and two pots, one of permitted [food] and one of prohibited [food], and he doesn't know into which pot it fell, even here we attribute leniently.
2. When do we say this [i.e. the above], where we attribute everything leniently, even if the permitted [food] isn't a majority over the prohibited [food]? When the prohibited [food] is is not greater than the permitted [food]. But if there is more prohibited [food] than permitted [food] we do not attribute leniently.
3. If the prohibition is a Biblical [prohibition], we do not attribute leniently to say that the prohibited [food] fell into the prohibited [food], until there is more permitted [food] than prohibited [food], so that it will be nullified inside it [the pot] according to the Torah.
4. There was more permitted [food] than prohibited [food]...

Bread of a Jew that a non-Jew baked without the lighting of the fire by a Jew, and without a token [distinctive sign], is forbidden. And [it is] forbidden to sell it to a non-Jew, lest it comes to be sold to a Jew. But if the bread is split into two, it is permitted to sell it to a non-Jew. Rema: And the same [law applies] to all bread of a non-Jew that is forbidden. Therefore, the custom is not to buy pieces of bread from a non-Jew, because we suspect that it might be forbidden bread and a Jew sold it to him as such. (Mordechai and Aruch).

He should wash his hands between meat and fish, and eat dipped bread in between, to wash his mouth. <small>Hagahah: And some says that there is no concern for this unless he cooks and eats eats them togther, but to each them one after the other there is not concern. And the custom is not to wash ones mouth and hands between, but still one should eat and drink something. Since this fulfills kinuach and hadachah</small>
One needs to be careful from human sweat, since all human sweat is deadly poison, except for sweat of the face 
One must refrain from putting coins in one's mouth, lest it's covered with dried saliva of those afflicted with boils. He should not put the palm of his hand in his arm pit, lest his hand touched a <i>metzorah</i> or a harmful poison. He should not put a loaf of bread under his armpit, because of the sweat. He should not put a cooked item or drinks under the bed, since an evil spirit rests on them. He should not stick a knife in an esrog or a radish, lest one fall on its edge and die. <small>Hagah: Similarly, he should be careful of all things that cause danger, because danger is stricter than transgressions, and one should be more careful with an uncertain danger than with an uncertain issur. They also prohibited to go in a dangerous place, such as under a leaning wall, or alone at night. They also prohibited to drink water from rivers at night or to put one's mouth on a stream of water and drink, because these matters have a concern of danger. It is the widespread custom not to drink water during the equinox, and the early ones wrote this and it is not to be changed. They also wrote to flee from the city when a plague is in the city, and one should leave at the beginning of the plague and not at the end. And all of these things are because of the danger, and a person who guards his soul will distance himself from them and it is prohibited to rely on a miracle in all of these matters.</small>
It is prohibited to eat food and drinks that a persons soul is disgusted by, such as drinks and food that have vomit or feces mixed with them, and rotten moisture and things like this. It is assur to eat and drink from dirty vessels that a person's soul is disgusted by them, like bathroom vessels and glass vessels that they let blood into. And he should not eat with dirty hands and on dirty vessels, since all of these fall into the prohibition of "Do not make your souls abominable"
An animal that is in danger of dying, even though it is permitted to eat when slaughtered, people who are careful are strict on themselves not to eat it. Hagah: An animal that a rabbi ruled to [permit] out of logic,but the law is not explicitly found [in books] to permit that it is permitted, and person who is careful for his soul will not eat from it.

...One who acquires from an idol worshipper a meal vessel of metal or glass or vessels or covered in lead from the inside - even though they are new one must dunk them in a mikvah or a stream that is forty se'ot. <small> GLOSS: There are those who says that vessels that are covered in lead even on the inside are dunked in a mikvah without a blessing, and this is how we act. </small>
The vessel must be loose in your hands at the time of dunking, for if it is tight in your hands it is an interposition, and if you dampen your hand in the water at the outset there is no need to worry <small> (GLOSS: and specifically that you dampened your hands in the waters of the Mikvah but not in water that is detached). </small>
Bless "on the dipping of a vessel", and if there are two or more bless "on the dipping of vessels".
Tripods upon which we set upon them large pots do not require dunking but parillas [barbecue grills] require dipping because the actual food is placed on them.
A shechita [ie ritual slaughter] knife <small> (GLOSS: or a knife for skinning) </small> - there are those who say that it does not require dunking. <small> GLOSS: And there are those who disagree, and it is good to dunk it without a blessing. The iron [rack]s upon which Matzot [unleavened breads] are fixed up do not require dunking. And so too a covering which we place over the bread to bake it. But a covering for a large pot requires dunking. </small>
A wooden vessel which has iron hoops on the outside for holding it up does not require dunking.
A silver cup which is connected to a wooden vessel requires dunking. <small>GLOSS: And so too pepper millstones which within the wood there is iron affixed for grinding require dunking. And so too iron funnels or tappings of iron and other metals - all of them require dunking. And specifically that the essence of the vessel is metal, but if the essence of the vessel is wood only if some iron is affixed to it since in order to use it without the iron dunking is not required, but a vessel which is repaired with iron rods, and without the rods one would not be able to use it, and they are on the inside - dunking is required.</small>
One who borrows or rents a vessel from an idol worshipper does not need to dunk, but if an Israelite acquires it from an idol worshipper and lends it to a friend it requires dunking as [dunking] was already required by the first person. And there are those who say that if the first person did not take it for the purpose of a meal, rather only for cutting parchments and the like, he is not required to dunk it. <small>GLOSS: But it is forbidden for the first person to use it for the needs of a meal, even on a temporary basis, without dunking although he acquired it the purpose of [cutting] parchments. And so too if the second Israelite acquired it from the first for the purpose of meals the second must dunk it. </small>
If an idol worshipper provides a vessel as a loan guarantee to an Israelite [ie as collateral] - if it appears in the mind of the idol worshipper that it is permanent in his hand, dunking is required, and if not, dunk without a blessing or acquire a different vessel and dunk. <small> (GLOSS: and if in the end it becomes permanent in his hand, dunk without a blessing). </small>
...An Israelite who gave silver to an idol-worshipping artisan to make a vessel from it does not require dunking. <small>GLOSS: And there are those who disagree and say to dunk without a blessing. And if some of the silver used to make the vessel was owned by the idol worshipper, dunking is required. And thus an Israelite artisan who makes a vessel for an idol worshipper and acquires it from him shall dunk, also without a blessing if the idol worshipper gave him the metals, but if [the Israelite artisan] makes it himself and only acquired the metals from the idol worshipper or if he gave some metals of his own, dunking is not required. </small>
An Israelite who sells a vessel to an idol worshipper and returns and takes it from him - dunking is required. But if [the idol worshipper] holds it as collateral and [the Israelite] returns and redeems it, it does not require dunking. <small>GLOSS: An Israelite and an idol worshipper who acquire a vessel in partnership - it does not require dunking. An Israelite whose vessel was robbed or stolen and returned to him - dunking is not required. But a minister or governor who forced an Israelite and took his vessel and returned it to him, dunking is required because it already became permanent in the hand of the idol worshipper.</small>
One must dunk the handles of the vessel.
One must remove the rust before dunking, and if one did not remove - if he is particular about it, it is a separation. And if he rubs and puts it on coals and there remains there a bit of rust which is not removable this way, It is considered a minority that [the owner] is not particular about and it is not [considered] a separation.
One may not believe [ie rely on] a child regarding dunking of vessels. <small>(GLOSS: But if [the child] dunks before an adult, it is considered a dunking).</small>
If one dunked vessels alongside an idol worshipper, it is a dunking <small>(GLOSS: But one may not believe [ie trust] [an idol worhsipper] regarding dunking).</small>
If one forgot and did not dunk from the eve of the Sabbath or the eve of a holiday, give it to an idol worshipper as a gift and afterwards borrow it from him and one may use it. <small>GLOSS: And this is how it's done even on regular day in a place where there is no mikvah. And if one mistakenly uses the vessel without dunking - the food he used it for is not forbidden, and he shall dunk it thereafter.</small>

Siman 121

One who takes old (ie used) vessels from one who worships idols [lit. stars] - the way in which the idol-worshipper used them, this is how he kashers them. Therefore, one who takes a used old vessel which was used for cold, such as cups and plates and others like that - he washes them and he must scrub them well in water at the time of washing in order to remove and polish the issur (forbidden matter) which is on them, and afterwards rinse them in water and dip them (in a mikvah). GLOSS: There are places where the custom is to permit placing wine in vessels (ie barrels) where the planks of wood are smeared with fat because the nature of wine is to separate itself from the fat, and the fat congeals and stands by itself and does not touch the wine at all (Ribash 149).
[He] took from them [the idol-worshipper] vessels which were used with heat, whether they were made of metal, wood or stone, he dunks them in boiling hot water and afterwards dips them in a mikveh (if they are made of metal) and then they are permitted. If you dipped them [ie metal vessels] in a mikveh [first] and then dunked them in boiling hot water - they are permitted. And there are those who say that they must be dipped in the mikvah again. GLOSS: This is also the rule regarding a vessel made of bones, see the laws of Passover 451. One should not dunk a vessel in boiling water when the vessel has been used within the past 24 hours (see the Tur) and one should not use the water from the boiling (Aruch). Every instance in which dunking in boiling water is required it doesn't help if you scrape them with a tool. And see above 108: The Law of a Bread Paddel which is Issur.
The laws of [making kosher through] boiling and heating until it turns white are written in the Laws of Passover. 
A pan which was fried in, even though with regards to chametz on Passover it is enough to dunk in boiling water, with regards to other forbidden matters we require whitening through fire. 
If one dunks in boiling water a vessel which requires whitening by fire, the vessel may not be used with hot food even if it is not next to the fire. GLOSS: But it is permitted to use for cold food, even from the outset [without dunking in boiling water either], through washing and scrubbing well, and all the more so with regards to a vessel which requires dunking in boiling water. And this can only be done in temporary circumstances such as when he is in the house of an idol-worshipper or it is after the fact. But if he wants to use these vessels on a regular basis, there  are some who are stringent and say that even to use it with cold, dunking in boiling water or whitening through heat is required. It is decreed lest once come to use it with hot, and this is our custom. And even vessels which were used for cold, if there is a concern that they were used to heat wine such as a vessel made of silver, our practice is to dunk in boiling water and it should not be changed. And even chests and tables which were acquired from idol-worshippers, it is our custom to dunk them in boiling water, for they may have spilled something hot on them, and this is specifically from the outset, but after the fact there is no need to worry about all of this. And an earthenware vessel which was used for cold, which is impossible to dunk in  boiling water, we consider 'after the fact' and we say that it is enough to empty it and scrub it well, and it is permitted to place in it afterwards even sharp foods like vinegar and others like that. And all the more so hard things like spices and others like that, and see above 91.
Metal vessels - even though there are those who that say that if it is used only partially for forbidden foods, the entire vessel is forbidden, because something on part of it is like something hot on all of it, but with regards to kashering it, it doesn't have the effect unless you kasher the entire thing whether it is through dunking in boiling water or whitening by fire. GLOSS: And specifically if the entire vessel was used, but if you know that it was not [all] used, only partially, as it is absorbed is where it emits.
An old [ie used] knife, whether it is big or small, which is acquired from an idol worshipper - if you want to use it to cut something cold - if it doesn't have dimples/holes - thrust it into hard ground 10 times. And every single thrust must be into hard ground. Therefore one may not thrust into a place where there was already another thrust. And even if you cut a sharp food like a raddish this is sufficient (REMA: And to use it regularly don't diminish that which is done for other vessels, for which we dunk in boiled water even for cold). (As it was explained) if there are dimples (or) you want to cut something hot or slaughter [with the knife], whiten it through fire, or sharpen with a whetstone of a blacksmith well on every surface. GLOSS: There are those who say that sharpening this way is only to cut something cold, not something hot, and this is the custom a priori. And if you are not able to whiten the knife through fire well because of the handle, whiten it through fire and dunk in boiling water after. However, if you whitened but did not dunk in boiling water, even if there are dimples, or if you dunked but did not whiten and there are not dimples and you cut something warm it won't be forbidden even if the knife has been used in the previous day, and if you sharpened it well with a whetstone in every place, and dunk it in boiling water afterwords it is effective like whitening through fire if you are able to clean the dimples in it.

1. The Laws of "Noten Ta'am Lifgam" - Giving a Bad Taste - in Vessels, 12 Seifim: Noten Ta'am Lifgam is permitted. [If something gives a bad taste it is permitted].
2. A vessel which is not bat yoma, meaning that the vessel has sat for 24 hours since prohibited substance was cooked in it, this gives a detrimental taste, but even so, the sages forbade cooking in it initially. This is a decree on account of a bat yoma [vessel], whether it absorbed [taste] from a forbidden substance and one wanted to cook something permitted in it, or whether it absorbed some dairy and one wanted to cook meat in it, or the opposite [it absorbed some meat and one wanted to cook some dairy in it].
3. There are those who say that the negative taste created by the passing of 24 hours is only relevant when the utensil is washed well and all unwanted residue is removed, however if it was not washed well and the unwanted residue is present (be-en),  24 hours does not make the food stale (pagum). Rashba, Tur, and Raavad: Rama: Nevertheless if there is 60 times the food which is present (be-en) the mixture is all permitted because that which was swallowed in the walls of the pot became stale (pagum) and does not require bitul. (this is also implied in siman 95) There are those who say when cooking  sharp food, we don't say the food swallowed in the wall has a status of stale as explained above in Siman 95 and 96. Therefore if you cooked in a forbidden pot a dish which is mostly vinegar or spices  or other sharp foods, it is forbidden. However we don't consider the dish sharp if it only contains a small amount of spices. (Mordechai 81:40 and Rashba Siman 449) And this is the custom. Look above in Siman 95 and 96. However if the forbidden food was sharp and the pot rested for 24 hours and you cooked something permitted in it which is not sharp, the food is permitted because the first sharp food doesn't revitalize forbidden taste. (Aruch klal 38)

HEADER: Several laws of 'Yayin Nesech' (and which wine is forbidden because of 'Yayin Nesech') and there are 26 paragraphs in it: [1] The wine of the nations (non-Jews) is prohibited to derive pleasure from, and the same applies to their contact with our wine. [RAMA: this is because of a decree regarding wine that was poured as a libation to idols. Nowadays, when it is not common for nations to make libations to idols, some say that the touch of a non-Jew to our wine does not prohibit its use for pleasure, only for drinking. Similarly, ordinary - non-sacramental - wine of theirs is not prohibited for deriving pleasure from it, and therefore it is permissible to collect a debt from a non-Jew with ordinary wine, as it is considered as saving it from their hands (Tur in the name of Rashbam, the Rosh and Mordechai). And the same applies to other losses, such as if he went ahead and bought or sold, but initially it is forbidden to buy it and sell it in order to profit from it (Commentaries of Maimonides, Chapter 8 of Forbidden Foods, and comments of Ashiri and Mahar"m of Padua, Responsa 46). However, there are those who are lenient even in this, but it is good to be stringent. See Siman 132 (there in the name of Semag and Agur in the name of the Geonim).

Law of Idols and Images of Idolatry (Eight Sections):  All images of idolators found in villages are forbidden, because it is assumed they were made for the sake of idolatry. And those found in cities are permitted, because they were certainly made for decoration (this is the language of the mechaber). Unless they stand at the entrance of the city (this is the language of Rambam, Chapter 7 of Hilchot Avodat Kochavim), and the image is holding a staff, bird, ball, sword, crown, or ring. Rema’s Gloss: An image that is worshiped has the status of an idol and is forbidden unless nullified. But those that are hung around the neck as a reminder are not considered an idol and are permitted (Mordechai, Chapter "All Idols," in the name of Raaviah).
One who finds fragments of images cast aside, or among fragments of copper, or even fragments of idols themselves, they are permitted.  But if one finds the form of a hand or a foot and it is standing on its base, it is prohibited.
One who finds vessels and upon them are images of the sun or the moon:  Gloss: meaning, images made for the sun and moon, like the astrologers make images for the stars, for example, images associated with the sun—they depict a crowned king sitting on a chariot; similarly, with regard to the moon, they have a special image (Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah and Bartenura there), or a dragon, resembling a snake, with fins of sorts between the sections of vertebrae in its neck.  If the vessels are respectable (valuable), they are forbidden, for certainly they were made for the sake of idols; but if they are contemptible, they are permitted, for they were made only for ornament. And these are the respectable ones: those on silks, rings, and a ring (jewelry), and the contemptible ones (coins) (Hagahot Ashri, Mordechai, Agudah, Rosh, Sefer Mitzvot Gadol, prohibitions section 92, Ba’al Halachot Gedolot, and so I found in Tosefta, first chapter, section 7)—pots, kettles for hot water, and cups from which they drink, whether they are below the waterline or above the waterline.  And all this is in cases where we don’t know whether these vessels were worshipped, but if it is known that these vessels were not worshipped, even those that are respectable are also permitted (the opinion of the Ran).  And there is one who says that any image that is worshipped, even on contemptible vessels, is forbidden, even though we don’t know that these vessels were worshipped. And according to this, at this time when they engrave engravings on vessels and depict idols on them, one who finds vessels with idols on them, they are forbidden.  Gloss: and the custom follows the first opinion, and at this time, when idolaters don’t worship these images, they are permitted in benefit if one finds them, but one should not keep them (Terumat HaDeshen 56).  And there are those who are stringent with all the images mentioned, even at this time, even though we know that they are not worshipped (this is implied in the Tur and Tosafot in the chapter on "All the Images").  And a dragon image is permitted to make, but it is forbidden to keep it with him due to suspicion (Beit Yosef, Maharash, and the Tur).
It is forbidden to depict forms found in the Divine abode, such as the four faces together, and likewise the forms of the Seraphim, Ophanim, and ministering angels, as well as a human form alone. All of these are forbidden to make even for decoration, and if a gentile made them for him, it is forbidden to keep them.  Gloss: However, if one finds them, they are permitted, except for the sun and moon, which idol worshippers commonly serve, or if there is evidence that they were made for worship, then they are forbidden like all images, as explained at the beginning of the section (Tur). In what case is this said? Only when they are protruding. But if they are recessed, such as those woven into fabric or painted on a wall with dyes, it is permitted to make them. As for images of the sun, moon, and stars, they are forbidden whether protruding or recessed. If they are for learning purposes, to understand and teach, all are permitted, even if protruding (and some permit them in a public place where there is no suspicion) (Tur in the name of the Rosh).
A ring with an engraved human form: if the form is protruding, it is forbidden to wear it, but it is permitted to seal with it. If the form is recessed, it is permitted to wear it, but forbidden to seal with it, since the seal would produce a protruding form. (This is the language of Rambam, Laws of Idolatry 3:11.) Even if a non-Jew sealed with it, it is forbidden to keep it (this is implied by the Mordechai in chapter 25 and Tosafot). The same law applies to other forbidden forms (according to the Tur, and similarly noted by the Ran in the name of the Rif, and this is implied by all the authorities).
Images of domestic beasts, wild animals, birds, fish, and images of trees, grasses, and similar things are permitted to make, even if the image is protruding.
There are some who say that there is no prohibition with the form of a man or a dragon unless it is a complete form with all it’s parts.  However the form of the head or the body without a head has no prohibition- not in finding it and not in making it. (and this is the common practice). 
One should not make a house in the form of the Temple, with the same proportions for its height, length, and width; nor a portico in the form of the Temple's Ulam (entrance hall); nor a courtyard in the form of the Temple’s courtyard. Likewise, one should not make a table in the form of the Temple’s table or a lamp in the form of the Temple’s menorah. However, one may make a lamp with five branches, or six, or eight, but not one with seven branches, even from other types of metals, and even without cups, knobs, or blossoms, and even if it is not 18 handbreadths high.

A city in which they (idol worshipers) are making a fair on the day of their festival, and the idol worshipers are gathering from a number of places and are traveling there for the honor of idol worship, it is permitted to travel on its outskirts and it is forbidden to enter it. If (the fair) is on its outskirts, it is permitted to enter it. One who is traveling from one place to another place, it is forbidden to pass through it if the path is specific to (that city) (That is, that one does not pass [through that path] from that city to another city.)

Shulchan Aruch: All of the transgressions which are in the Torah, with the exception of idolatry, sexual prohibitions, and murder: If someone is told to transgress them or he will be killed, so long as he is in private, he should transgress and not be killed. If he wants to be stringent upon himself and be killed, he may do so if the idolater intends to make him violate his religion. Rama: If he can save himself with all he has, he must give it all rather than transgress one of the negative commandments (Ran in Sukkah, Perek Lulav haGazul, and Rashba and Raavad and Rivash Siman 387). When they [Chazal] said that anyone who has the ability to protest and does not, he is seized in the same sin - here, where there is a chance of danger, he does not need to give up his money over this (Mahariv Siman 156). Shulchan Aruch: If he is in public - that is, in front of ten Jews - he must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress, providing the idolater intends to make him violate his religion (even if this is over a minhag such as the way one ties one’s shoes) (Beis Yosef). But if he [the idolater] intends only for his own benefit, he [the Jew] should transgress rather than be killed. If, however, it is a time of legislation (only against Jews) (Beis Yosef in the name of the Nimukei Yosef), even about the strap of one’s shoes he should be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only if they wish to make him violate a negative commandment; if they made a law that one should not fulfill positive commandments, however, he does not need to fulfill it if he will be killed (Ran Shabbos Perek BaMeh Tomnin and Nimukei Yosef Sanhedrin Perek Sorer uMoreh). Nonetheless, if the hour requires it and he wishes to fulfill it and be killed, he may do so (Maharik Shoresh 88). Shulchan Aruch: And by idolatry, sexual prohibitions, and murder, even in private and not a time with legislation and even if the idolater intends it only for his own benefit, he must be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only when they tell him to do an action: for instance, if they tell a man to transgress a sexual prohibition or he will be killed. If they force a woman to have sex or throw him over a child to murder it or he is already erect and they force him to have forbidden sex, he need not be killed (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosfos and Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah). All prohibitions of idolatry and sexuality and murder - even if they are not punishable by death, just prohibitions without explicit punishment - he must be killed rather than transgress. On the prohibition of “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind” he may transgress rather than be killed (Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah and Sanhedrin Perek Ben Sorer uMoreh). An idolater sleeping with a Jewish woman is not included as a sexual prohibition (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ramban and the authorities cited above). Idolaters who told a Jew, “Give us one of you so we may kill him” - they may not give him over unless they [the idolaters] singled him out and said, “Give us Ploni” (Mishnah Trumos 8, Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5). There are those who say that even in this case, one should not give him over unless he is already liable for death like Sheva ben Bichri (Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi and the Ran). Likewise, women who were told by idolaters, “Give us one of you so we may rape [lit. make impure] her” - they must all be raped rather than hand over one Jewish life (Rambam ibid). Any place where it is said, “Be killed rather than transgress,” if he transgressed and was not killed, even though he has desanctified the Name, nonetheless he is considered forced and is not liable. This is only where he could not have fled - if he could have fled, and did not do so, he is like a dog sitting on his vomit and is considered to have transgressed deliberately (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5).
Shulchan Aruch: It is forbidden for a man to claim that he is an idolater so that they will not kill him; if, however, so that they will not know he is a Jew, he changes his clothes during a time of legislation, this is permitted, since he does not say that he is an idolater. Rama: Even if he must wear shaatnez (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second one)). Even though it is forbidden to say that he is an idolater, nonetheless he may say things that can be interpreted multiple ways (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel) and the idolaters will understand that he has said that he is an idolater while he means something else. Likewise, if he can trick them so that they will think he is an idolater, this is permitted (Trumas HaDeshen Siman 197). In the same vein, one who desires another man’s wife - if his wife can sleep with him such that he will believe he is sleeping with the forbidden woman, this is permitted (ibid in the Nimukei Yosef). All of this is permitted only where there is a danger, but where there is no danger - for instance, he wears idolaters’ clothes so they will not recognize that he is a Jew so that he can avoid the tax or suchlike - that is forbidden (Hagahos Ashiri and Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second) and Trumas haDeshen Siman 196 and other authorities).
Shulchan Aruch: One who is liable for the death penalty may run to an idolatrous house of worship to save himself (some say that at a time of legislation this is prohibited (Kol Bo). See above Siman 150).

Siman 158

Idol worshipers, with whom there is no war with us, and Jewish shepherds of thin animals ["behemah dakah" - a category of animals, including sheep and rams, which one is forbidden to raise in the Land of Israel due to the fact that they consume every creature in their way, thus hindering the mitzvah of settling the Land -translator's note] in the Land of Israel, at a time when most of the fields belong to Jews, and [consequent laws that] derive from this [apply], one may not allow the [idol worshipers] to die, but it is forbidden to save them if [the rescuer] is likely to die [trying to save them], such as [a case where one] saw one of them who fell into the sea, one does not pull him out even if he will be paid. Thus, one must not heal them, even for payment, unless there is reason [to save them] on the grounds of [preventing] hatred [of Jews]. Rema: for then [under those circumstances] it is permitted even for free [without payment] to save them, if he will not be able to be dropped even for free. (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ramban). And thus it is (Rema: it would be) permitted to attempt to heal a Cutite [non-Jew] if one is so inclined (Tosfot and the Mordechai Pe"m and in the Sma"g). Which things are being discussed, regarding a Jew with sins and who stands by his wickedness consistently, such as the shepherd of a thin animal [behemah dakah] who unload stolen wares ["parku b'gazel] and they go in their foolish ways. But a Jew who has sins, [but] who does not stand by his wickedness consistently, [and] rather does sins for personal benefit, such as one who eats forbidden foods to satisfy his appetite, it's a mitzvah to save him and it's forbidden to let him die (literally: stand by his blood).
The heretics, and those who practice idol worship (literally: worship of the stars), or who do sins for the sake of provocation, [and] even one who ate carrion flesh, or wore shatnez in order to provoke, behold, this person [has the status of] a nonbeliever. And the heretics, and those who deny the Torah and Jewish prophecy -- they had the custom during the times of the Holy Temple to kill them. If one's hands were strong enough to kill them with a sword, in public, he would kill him [in that way], and if not, he would develop a plan in order to bring about their death. How so? [If] he saw one of them that fell into a well, and [there was] a ladder in the well from before, he would take it and say [to the person who fell], "Behold, I am going to take my son down from the roof [with this ladder], and I will return it to you," and [other plans] similar to this. <i>Rema: And refer to Choshen Mishpat, Siman 425: Jewish apostates who attach themselves to idol worship, or defile themselves among idolaters to worship idols like them, behold, they are [considered to be] like apostates who provoke anger. And they would lower them down and not raise them up </i>(Tosafot פא"מ)<i>, for it is an eye for an eye. [But] if he came to repent, they were not stringent on him, as it is difficult to break free from [idolatry], and there is a concern that he will return to his apostasy [if he is subjected to disgrace].</i>

Siman 159

That it is permitted to lend to gentiles and apostates with usury, in three parts:  The Law declared it is permitted to lend to gentiles with usury, but the Sages proscribed it except for one's living or by a scholar or if it is only rabbinical usury. And nowadays it is permitted. 
Usury to apostates is permitted, but borrowing from them usurily is proscribed. GLOSS [RMA]: And some are strict even re usury to apostates (the Mordechai and the Haga'os Maimonios citing RABIH and RSHI and SMG and in MHRIL) And it is good to be strict if it is possible to elude it.
Samaritans have the status of apostates. Karaites do not have the status of apostates, and usury to them is proscribed, and it is not necessary to say that it is proscribed to borrow from them usurily. GLOSS [RMA]: And see the laws of the immured. An infant which fell into the captivity of gentiles and doesn't know any Law is like a Karaite and usury to them is proscribed. And also an apostress with a child from a gentile, for the son is — behold — like her and an apostate, usury to him is proscribed, for he is like an infant captured by gentiles.

1. Not To Dress Like A Non-Jew, 3 Seifim: One [i.e., a Jew] should not follow the customs of non-Jews (nor should one try to resemble them) (Tur in the name of the Rambam). One should not wear clothing that is particular to them [i.e., their culture]; one should not grow forelocks on one’s head like the forelocks on their heads; one should not shave the sides [of one’s head] and grow one’s hair in the middle of one’s head [like they do]; one should not shave the hair in front of one’s face from ear to ear and let one’s hair grow [in the back] [like they do]; one should not build places [i.e., buildings]—like the non-Jews’ temples—so that large groups of people will enter them, like [non-Jews] do. <i> RAMA: Rather, one [i.e., a Jew] should be distinct from them [i.e., non-Jews] in one’s manner of dress and in all of one’s actions. But all of this [i.e., these restrictions] apply only to things that non-Jews do for the sake of licentiousness. For example, they are accustomed to wearing red clothing, which is official/princely clothing, and other clothing that is similarly immodest. [These restrictions also apply] to things that they are accustomed to doing because of a custom or rule that does not have a[ny underlying] reason, out of concern that [a Jew who does such things will follow the] “ways of the Amorites,” and that it has the blemish of [i.e., is tainted by] idol worship inherited from their ancestors. But things that they are accustomed to doing for a useful purpose—such as their custom for expert doctors to wear particular clothing so that the doctors will be recognized as specialists—one is permitted to wear [such clothing]. (Maharik Shoresh 88) Similarly, things that are done out of respect or another reason, it is permitted [for one to do such things]. And therefore they said one may burn [the items of deceased] kings, and there is not in this “the ways of the Amorites.” (R"an, Chapter of the Laws of Non-Jews) </i>
2. One [i.e., a Jew] who is close [i.e., works closely] with the [non-Jewish] authorities and is required to dress in their clothing and to be similar [in appearance] to them, is permitted in all respects [to do so].
3. One who eats and on his table, does not bring a full loaf and place it on the table. RAMA: There are places to set the table and place upon it some (types) of food at night for the next day...

<b> Not to do magic, necromancy, or divination. Containing 19 sections. </b> We do not make inquiries to astrological seers, nor to the fates. [Comment of Rema: Because it is said, "You must be wholehearted with the LORD your God." (Deuteronomy 18:13) (B"Y citing Tosafot (???) and citing Sifrei) And certainly it is prohibited to make inquiries to magicians, diviners, and sorcerers. (Piskei Mahara"i 96)]
We have the custom to not begin things on the second or fourth days of the week (Monday or Wednesday) and we only take wives during the full moon. [Comment of Rema: And therefore, we have the custom as well to begin study on Rosh Chodesh, because even though there is no divinatory benefit, there is a symbol (SM"K 136). What a person knows to be inauspicious, they should not do, and they should not rely on miracles. However, one must not investigate this matter, because one should be "wholehearted" (Responsa of Ramba"n 286) as will be explained.]
One who says, "My bread has fallen from my mouth!" or "My staff from my hand!" or "My child calls from behind me!" or if a deer stopped before them on the road, or a snake passed on their right, or a fox on their left- someone to whom these things have happened, and they derive divination from it, not to go on a trip, or not to begin a project; or similarly, those who do divination by rodents or by birds or by the stars; or similarly one who says, "Do not begin asking me for payment, as it is morning" or "as it is after Shabbat" or "as it is after Rosh Chodesh;" or similarly one who says, "Slaughter that hen, as she cried out like a raven!" or "this hen, as she cried out like a rooster!" These are prohibited. [Comment of Rema: Some say that if one does not say the reason why they are directing to slaughter the hen, but simply says "slaughter this hen" then it is permitted to slaughter it, if she did cry out like a rooster (B"Y citing R"A in the Responsa of Mahari"l 118) and this is how the custom is practiced.]
A child's or a woman's house: even if there is no divinatory benefit, there is a symbol. [Comment of Rema: If one has succeeded afterwards three times, or not (B"Y citing Rashi). And similarly one may say to a child, "Tell me your verse (of current study)" (Tur). Some say that one may make a sign about something that is still to happen, like Eliezer, Abraham's servant did, or Jonathan (Tur and R"D Kimchi) but some forbid it (Rambam and SM"G). But one who proceeds wholeheartedly and trusts in Hashem will be surrounded by kindness.] 
"A spell-caster" (Deuteronomy 18:11) is someone who gathers animals or snakes or scorpions or mosquitoes or flies with whispers.
Someone who has been bitten by a scorpion: it is permitted to whisper spells for them, even on Shabbat, and even though this thing is completely ineffective, because the person is in danger, they permitted it in order that their mind should not be torn apart (made insane).
Someone who is being chased by a snake or scorpion: it is permitted to whisper spells in order to prevent them from harming one. 
Someone who whispers spells over a wound, or over someone ill, and then spits, and then reads a verse from the Torah: this person has no portion in the World to Come. But even if they do not spit, however, it is still prohibited. But if there is danger to life, then anything is permitted. [Comment of Rema: And some say that all this is only forbidden when one reads the verse in Hebrew but not in a foreign language (Rashi citing his teacher). However, it is best to be careful about spitting, as much as possible, especially if one is reciting the Divine name, as this person has no portion in the World to Come (as is indicated by the Tur in the R"I's opinion).]
A child who has been wounded: we may not recite verses over them, or place a Sefer Torah upon them.
A healthy person: it is permitted to recite verses over them, in order to protect them from the damaging forces. 
To measure a belt (of a person who is ill) and to whisper spells over it is permitted, even on Shabbat. [Comment of Rema: And see OC 306, and the rule is the same for other whispered spells. And see OC 301 for which whispered spells and which amulets are forbidden.]
It is permitted to by healed by an amulet, even if it has Divine Names inside. And it is similarly permitted to carry amulets that have verses inside. This is specifically for protection, not to become ill, but does not permit someone who has a wound or an illness to be healed by them. But it is forbidden to write verses in the amulets. 
"A necromancer" (Deuteronomy 18:11) is someone who starves themselves and sleeps in the cemetery in order to have unholy spirits rest upon them. 
To make someone ill swear an oath to return after death to tell one whatever they ask: this is permitted. [And some permit even after death, if one is not making an oath with the body of the deceased but only their spirit. (As is indicated by Hagahot Maimoniot citing R"AM, which does not accord with the Beit Yosef.)]
Illusion-making is prohibited, but it is permitted to do so using the Sefer Yetzirah. [Even if this includes actions (Tur).]
Demonic work is prohibited, but some permit inquiring of them about stolen items. [Comment of Rema: And derived from this (B"Y and Hagahot Maimoniot 11 in "Laws of Theft") And to force them to swear oaths using Divine Names, some permit in any situation. (B"Y citing N"Y and citing that comment) But in any case, most of the practitioners of this do not get out of it peacefully, so one who wants to protect their soul will distance themselves from them (demons) (B"Y).] 
Those who customarily set a table with various types of foods on the night of a circumcision and say that it is auspicious for the baby: this is prohibited. [And see above at the end of 178)
To smudge the house using herbs with good scents: some forbid unless one is doing so in order to remove bad scents. 
One who burns incense for a demon, to connect with it and force it to do one's will is guilty of worshipping idolatry. One who studies from a sorcerer, even words of Torah, is worthy of the death penalty. 

Siman 180

<b> The Prohibition of tattooing, and balding for the dead. Contains 12 sections. </b> Incised writing is defined as cutting one's flesh and filling the place of cutting with kohl [following the emendation of Biur HaGra YD 180.2] or ink or any other dye that leaves a mark.
If he does this on his friend's flesh, the one to whom it was done is exempt unless he aided in the matter.
One is permitted to place ash on their wound. 
One who marks their slave lest they escape is exempt (But it seems that, in the first place, it is forbidden).
One who cuts their flesh is not culpable unless they are doing it for their deceased, or for idolatry. However, for their deceased, one is culpable whether one did it manually or with a tool, while for idolatry one is only culpable if it was with a tool. 
Scratching and cutting for the deceased is prohibited, even outside the presence of the deceased [But it is permitted to do so because of another source of pain. (B"Y based on Tur)]
Some say that specifically cutting is forbidden but hitting with the hand on the flesh until blood flows is permitted, and some forbid it. 
One who makes five cuts for one deceased person, or one cut for five deceased people has five culpabilities. 
Balding is is defined as removing the hairs from one's head over a death, from any place on the head, whether by hand or with a potion, and at its minimum size, a bean-size area of one's head must be visibly empty of hair. And some say: two hairs. And some say that a prohibition even extends to one hair. 
If one created one bald area for five deceased people, they are only culpable once, but if they created five bald areas for one deceased person, they are culpable for each one. 
One who creates a bald spot on a friend's head, or cuts a friend's flesh, while the friend supports it: if they both do so intentionally, they both receive lashes. If one did so by accident and one intentionally, the intentional one receives lashes. 
Women are also cautioned against balding. [Comment of Rema: And how much more so against cutting (Tur). And it is right to caution them not to remove their hair by the deceased person, so that they do not come to violation of the prohibition on balding (Tur citing Yerushalmi) and likewise with cutting.]

Siman 181

<b>The Issur of Shaving the Pe'ot, 12 Seifim:</b><br> There are two pe'ot/corners of the head. [Where the] head ends is where it joins with the jaw, on the right and on the left.
Whether one shaves the pe'ot only, or whether he shaves the whole head with the pe'ot, he is liable.
He is not liable unless he uses a razor. And there are those who forbid scissors that shave like a razor; and their words should be regarded.
The person whose pe'ot are shaved off is also liable if he assists in shaving, leaning his head to him so that he shaves his pe'ah, but there is prohibition even if he does not help, therefore it is forbidden to have one's pe'ot shaved off even by means of an idolater.
One who rounds [the head of] a minor male is liable. (But it is permitted to round [the head of] an idolater or a woman -- Beit Yosef, in the name of the RoSh). But there are those who have doubt regarding this (Beit Yosef in the name of י"א). A minor is permitted to be rounded by an idolater (Ran, in the perek Eilu Hen Hagolin).
A woman is not included in the mitzvah of rounding, but there are those who say that although she is permitted to round the corner of her head, she is forbidden to round the corner of the head of a man, even if he is a minor.
Slaves are obligated regarding rounding the head, just as [free] men.
A tumtum or androgynos is forbidden to round the head.
The extent of the pe'ah [of the head] is from the hair on [i.e. by] his forehead including up to below the ear, where the lower jaw emerges and separates [from the head] there, and no hand should touch the entire width of this place.
One is not liable in destroying the corner of the beard except by means of a razor, however by scissors it is permitted, even cutting so close as a razor. <small>Rem"a: But in any case we are cautious when trimming with scissors to do the shaving motion with the upper piece of the scissors and not with the bottom piece, lest one does it all with the bottom piece and it be as a razor (See Siman 395). Anyhow, it seems that under the throat there is no concern about this, since it is not the main location of the pe'ot.</small>
There are five corners of the beard, and there are many opinions on them, therefore a God-fearing man should fulfill all of them and not pass a razor over any of his beard at all. <small>(And even under the throat (Beit Yosef in the name of the Iggeret R"Y and the Smag)</small>
A woman who has a beard is permitted to destroy it; and the law for her in destroying the beard of a man is the same as in rounding the head of a man.

Siman 182

One who removes the hair of the armpit or pubic area, even with scissors in a similar manner to a razor (i.e. close to the skin) receives lashes of rebellion. About what were these words said? In a place where only women remove it, so that he should not improve himself as women do. In a place where men, too, do so, however, if he does so they do not beat him. (Rama: Even initially this is permitted (Ran in Avodah Zarah). Only exceptionally scrupulous people refrain in all places (ibid and in Beis Yosef in the name of the Nimukei Yosef). See above Siman 156.) It is permitted to remove the hair of other limbs with scissors in any place.
One who shaves all his body hair, from his head to his legs, there are those who say that it is permissible for him to also shave his armpits and pubic hair.
It is forbidden to rub the hair of the armpit and pubic area in order to remove it, but it is permitted to rub with one's garment to remove it.
One who has sores on his armpit or pubic area, and the hair there causes him pain, he may remove it.
A woman may not clothe herself in men's clothing, e.g. put on her head a mitre or helment, or wear armor, and so on (Rama: from that which men wear in accordance with the local custom (Tur)) or shave her head like a man. A man may not clothe himself in the clothes of a women, e.g. wear colored clothing or golden ornaments in a place where only women wear those things. (Rama: Even wearing just one of the garments is forbidden, even if it is apparent by his other garments that this is a man or a woman (Beis Yosef).) A tumtum and an androgynos are forbidden to dress like women.
It is forbidden for a man to pluck even one white hair from among the black because of "A man shall not wear" (Devarim 22:5). It is likewise forbidden for a man to color (Rama: the white hairs so that they will be) black hairs, even one hair. It is likewise forbidden for a man to gaze at his reflection. (Rama: See above Siman 156.)

Siman 183

A woman who has a discharge of blood from her uterus, whether due to outside factors or purposefully, is tameh (impure) if she felt it flowing out. If she felt the discharge she is tameh even if the blood did not flow out of her body, and even if she only saw a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed; she must observe seven clean days for it {Rema: as will be explained in Siman 196. And there is no distinction between a married and an unmarried woman with regards to the laws of niddah (Rivash in Siman 425 as brought by Bet Yosef), because all who have intercourse with a niddah are liable for karet.}

Siman 184

Most women have vestot (meaning, a fixed time to experience menstruation) to see [menstrual blood] at a known time, for example every twenty days or every thirty days, and any woman who has a consistent veset may have relations at a time which is not her veset and does not need to perform a check prior to relations. (Rambam) <i>RAMA: And she also should not be stringent to check herself before or after relations, lest [her husband] worry and withdraw from her. (Tur; Mordechai; and the majority of Poskim)</i>  However, at other times, she is praiseworthy the more she checks.
During her veset, [her husband] must separate from her for one onah, not from all contact but only from marital relations. If it is daytime, separate from her for that entire day, even if the veset is at the end of the day, and it is permitted immediately the following evening. Similarly, if [the veset] is at the beginning, separate the whole day and it is permitted the entire preceding evening. And such is the law if it is at night, separate during the night and it is permitted the preceding and following days. This applies whether she has established her veset three times or one time. <i>RAMA: and all of this is discussing a veset dependent on counting days and not on a veset dependent on bodily changes, see later Siman 189. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ra'avad).  A woman whose veset changes and occurs two or three days earlier or later each month, should separate those two or three days before or after. (Hagahos Maimoni) See also Siman 189. </i>
3. When does the above apply? When she reaches the age of majority. But regarding a minor who has not entered into the days of the young women and does not have signs, she need not separate due to her veset, as long as the veset has not occured three times. This is also the law regarding older women, whose blood has left them.
4. If she normally sees [blood] with daybreak, and they are not certain whether [she saw] before daybreak or after it, she is only forbidden in the day.
5. If she normally sees [blood] from before daybreak until after daybreak, she is forbidden during the portions of night and day that are adjacent to it (daybreak). 
6. If her cycle lasts two or three days, during which she is emitting or has flows [of blood] she only needs to separate for the first onah [at the recurrence] of that veset, and once that onah has passed without her seeing [blood], she is permitted.
7. If a veset occurs during her pregnancy after she knows she is pregnant, or during her lactation which extends 24 months from the birth of the fetus, even if the fetus dies: one is not required to separate close to her veset, and even during her veset, she is permitted without inspection. (See below Siman 189.)
8. If she was in hiding out of fear, and the time of her veset arrives, she should disregard it. <i> RAMA: And some say that this is only if the veset has already passed and she she did not inspect and did not feel a sensation- then she is pure without inspection. But ideally, she requires inspection. (As is indicated by B"Y) </i> 
9. The rest of the women must inspect themselves when their veset comes. If the time of the veset passes, and she has not checked, and she has not felt a sensation - she is pure without checking. There are those that say that she is forbidden until she inspects, if she has a set veset or if it is the 30th day even if it is not her set veset. <i>RAMA: This is how the custom is practiced. Similarly, see Siman 189.</i>
10. One who wants to leave for a journey must "visit" his wife, even if it is close to her veset. <i> RAMA: And even intercourse is permitted (Tur, citing Y"A and B"Y citing Rashi and Raavad and Rashba and R' Yerucham) and in any case, if one is stringent and only "visits" her in things that appease her, may they be blessed. (B"Y citing SM"G) And it was already explained that all types of intimacy and love are permitted, except for intercourse. But if one is leaving for a mitzvah journey, he does not need to "visit" his wife. And some say that if one wants to leave for a journey and his wife is a niddah but she will immerse within one onah, he must wait. (N"Y ch. "Haba al yevimto") </i>
11. A woman who only has a veset by number of days, and the time for her veset has arrived- it is prohibited to have sex with her until one asks her [about her nidda status]. And if she does not have a veset, the 30th day from her sighting [of blood] functions as the time of the arrival of her veset. And if she has waited after the veset long enough for her to count and immerse, he may have sex with her and does not need to ask. 
12. If she had a veset by number of days (Tur citing Rashba) and a veset by body cycles (B"Y citing Hagahot Maimoniot ch.4 citing Ramban) such as jumping etc., since the veset is dependent on the activity, one can say that she has not jumped and has not seen [blood]. But she must pay attention to the ordinary cycle length, which is 30 days. (B"Y citing Rashba and Tur below S. 189)

Siman 188

Every shade of red, even very light or dark, is tameh.  As is every kind of black.  White and green are tahor - even the color of wax or gold [i.e. what we call today "yellow"] and all the more so the color of plants [i.e. "green"], even if it has the consistency and thickness of blood (so too "blue" is like green) and even if she felt her womb open and checked herself immediately and found these colors she is tehora.  (RAMA: Agreed.  And not like those who are stringent regarding everything which has the consistency and thickness of blood.  If she felt her womb open and checked herself immediately and found nothing, see Siman 190.)
A woman is relied upon to say "I saw a stain like this, and it got lost." If it was white or green, she is tehora.  But if she brings us the blood, and we render it tameh, or are even just in doubt if it is tahor or tameh and she says "Rabbi so-and-so told me an identical stain was tahor" we do not rely on her.
If she inserted a [thin] tube and removed the blood  through it, she is tehorah.  And so too if she saw blood in a chunk, even if the chunk has blood in its crevices such that it [the blood] touches her flesh, she is tehorah because this is not the normal way of seeing blood.  So too a woman who's womb is displaced and pieces of flesh fall into her "outer chamber" is tehorah (RAMA: even if she [also] sees blood.  As long as there are pieces of flesh in her "outer chamber" she is tehorah because we ascribe the blood to those pieces, given that she knows full well that her womb has been displaced and this is all the result of her injury.) This is so if she placed the chunk in lukewarm water and it did not dissolve and only regarding small chunks resembling a [thin] tube.  But larger chunks are tameh even if she saw no accompanying blood because it is not possible that the womb should open without blood, even in the case of an unformed fetus.
All blood which emerges from a woman, be it liquid or dry, is tameh.  And even if it has the shape of peels, or hairs, or red gnats, it is tameh so long as it disolves within 24 hours in lukwarm water which maintains its teperature for the entire 24 hour period.  The required temperature is that of water drawn in the summer from a river or a stream which was then left indoors to warm.  And even in the winter the water must be this same temperature. (In general, lukewarm water does not rise above the temperature of spit) And if [these shapes] are so hard that they do not dissolve within 24 hours, she is tehorah even if they can be liquified by crushing them with one’s fingernail.  (and if they cannot be liquified by crushing them with a fingernail, she is surely tehorah and there is no need to even check them in lukewarm water.)
When do we say that she is tehorah so long as [the shapes] do not dissolve?  Only when they emerge completely dry and there is no [liquid] blood with them at all.  But if there is even a bit of [liquid] blood on them, she is temah.  (RAMA: She is likewise tameh in a case where only a part of them dissolved, and the other part stayed solid.  And it seems to me that if she checked what emerged from her on three separate occasions and it did not dissolve at all, she need not check identical items which emerge from her thereafter because she has already established that these things are not blood, rather they originate in an internal wound.  But this only applied to a woman who has an established veset and not during her veset, as was explained regarding wounds in siman 187
When do we say that the lukewarm water test is required?  When she discharges shapes like peels or hairs.  But a shapeless chunk of blood, even if it is hard and does not dissolve, is tameh.  And some say that even this requires the lukewarm water test, if it is a chunk as small [in diameter] as the thinnest reed tube.

Siman 189

A woman with no established veset must keep the 30th day since her last period, since this is the "middle veset" for women in general.  But if she has an established veset of 20 or 25 days, she only keeps this day [and not the "middle veset."]

Siman 190

According to Torah law, a woman is not rendered teme'ah and is not forbidden to her husband until she feels a sensation that blood left her body, but the sages decreed that upon seeing a blood stain on her body or clothing that she is teme'ah and forbidden to her husband even though she did not feel the blood leave her body, and even if she examines herself [afterwards] and finds herself clean. She requires a hefsek tahara to examine herself and find she is clean, and afterwards to count seven clean days from the day of her examination, as though she had certainly seen [niddah blood] as will be explained later in section 196. And if she felt that her uterus opened to release blood but checked herself afterward and did not find anything, there are those who say she is still teme'ah.  


















One who is wont to emit blood by way of his penis, and blood is found on the woman after sex -- we blame the husband.

It is unknown if she passed through a butcher's market or if she sat next to dye-workers -- we do not blame them. Of what do we speak? In a city that the butchers or the dyers sit in a known place, but if their way is to work here and there we blame them even because it is unknown if they were working where she passed and she did not feel.


Two women who work with one bird which contains only one sela of blood, and on each is found a sela of blood -- they are both impure.

A woman giving birth: even if she has not seen blood, is ritually impure as though she were a menstruating woman; whether she delivered a live child, or whether she delivered a stillborn child and even if she miscarried. And how many are the days of her ritual impurity? Now, in this time, all of the childbearers are considered as those delivering in a flow and require to count seven clean days; it follows to say that one who delivers a male sits seven for the birth and seven clean (day)s for the blood-flow, and one who delivers a female sits two weeks for the birth and seven clean (day)s for the blood flow. The days of birth, which are 7 for a male and 14 for a female, if she did not see (any blood) on them, they count for the accounting of her blood-flow; and if seven clean days are completed within the 14 for a female child, such a woman is forbidden until the night of the 15th (day); and if she had immersed prior to that, the immersion does not count for her. <small> Rema: And after 7 for a male and 14 for a female, she is permitted to her husband immediately, on account of the fact that she had counted seven clean (day)s and she did not further see (blood-flow). Nevertheless, there are places where the custom is that they do not immerse within 40 (days) for a male and 80 for a female (Beit Yosef citing the Mahari"k, who brought the tanya, and in the Agudah ch. A"P (Arvei Pesachim?) and in the Mahari"l), and one ought not be lenient in a place where they were accustomed to be stringent (Riv"sh); but in a place where there were no set custom, one ought not be strict at all - just as soon as she has not seen blood after the seven for a male and fourteen for a female, and has counted seven clean days, she is permitted to her husband (T"H - Torat haAdam? - section 255). But if she has once again seen, even a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed, she is ritually impure - even though according to biblical ruling it is pure blood - the custom has already spread throughout all of Israel that we do not engage in sexual relations over pure blood (Beit Yosef, and Agur, and Tur, and decisors citing the geonim), and its ruling is like the other cases of blood in every way. <small></small></small>
One who miscarries within (the first) forty (days of pregnancy) - she should have no concerns for (status of delivering) a birth but does have concerns as regards menstruation, even if she has not seen (blood). <small>Rema: Since there opening of the "grave" without blood is by definition impossible, and we derive from this that immediately after she has counted seven clean (day)s, she is permitted, and she need have no concern for delivering  (d"'a).<small></small></small>
One who miscarries (a fetus with an appearance) like some sort of animal, beast or bird; like fishes or grasshoppers or creeping or crawling things, and any appearance of delivered child, whether amniotic sac or placenta or a piece that when they tore it there was a bone inside - now that we are not expert in (varied embryonic) forms, she should be concerned that it was a (potentially viable) delivered child; and if seven clean days were completed within fourteen days, if she had immersed prior to the night of the fifteenth, the immersion did not count for her.
She delivered a quick child and afterwards she delivered a placenta, she need not be concerned regarding an additional delivered child, but rather accounts it to the child that she had already delivered - until 23 days (have passed). But if she miscarried a fetus first, she does not consider to be related to it any placenta that she may deliver after, and she must be concerned for that placenta to give her the days of ritual impurity for (delivering) a female.
If the placenta came out first, we do not account it for the child which she will deliver afterwards, even if it is viable, and we are concerned for the placenta that it gives her days of ritual impurity for (delivery) a female.
If a bit of the placenta came out on the first day, and did not finish coming out until the second day, she is concerned as of the first day but does not begin counting other than from the second day.
One who miscarries (a fetus with the) appearance of an animal, a beast or a bird, and it had the placenta attached to it, need not be concerned for any further childbirth; and if it is not attached to it, must be concerned for a further birth; and even though the child appeared to be male, we are concerned to give her days of ritual impurity of a female on account of the placenta.
If one should deliver a child with no visible sex organs, or a hermaphrodite, we give her the days of ritual impurity of a female child.
If she felt that she was miscarrying and she did not know what, even if she was not considered likely pregnant - this is (nonetheless) the ritual impurity of birth, and she must be concerned as though it had been female.
If the child were dismembered within her and came out a limb at a time, whether it came out in order of the limbs (such as that the foot came first, then the thigh, then the hip) or whether it came out of order, she is not considered ritually birth-impure until most of it has come out; and if the entire head came out as a unit, this is considered as "most of it"; and if had not been dismembered, and came out naturally, once its forehead has emerged it is considered as born even though it may be dismembered thereafter. And the final matter is not that is actually emerged (from her body), but that even if it emerged from the birth canal.
Once the fetus put forth its hand and drew it back, the mother becomes ritually birth-impure.
If the mother was in difficult childbirth and she heard the cry of the baby, it is considered as a born child, because it would be impossible if the baby had not brought its head outside of the birth canal.
If a woman gives birth to twins and one of the babies delays after its fellow is born, such as when one was born before the sun set and the other after the sun set, once the first has emerged - she (the mother) is ritually impure and counts impurity-days from when the last one emerged; and if the first is recognized to be male and the second is recognized to be female, or that it is not recognizable whether the second is male or female, she counts starting from when the second emerged the ritual-impurity days for a female.
A Caesarean birth - if no blood emerges, even through her uterine wall, its mother is pure from birth-impurity and from menstruation-impurity and from blood flow-impurity.

Siman 195

Matters that are prohibited during her time of menstruation, including 17 paragraphs: A person is obligated to separate from his wife during the days of her impurity until she counts and immerses (even if she waits a long time to immerse).  She is always in her Niddah status until she immerses (Beis Yosef in the name of halakhic authorities). He should not joke or engage in levity with her (even with words) (Tur and Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba from Avot d'Rabbi Nasan) lest he become accustomed to sin.  However, he is permitted to be alone with her since once he has had intercourse with her one time, his urger will no longer overcome him (his own language).
He may not touch her, even with his little finger, nor may he pass anything from his hand to her hand, nor may he accept from her hand, lest he touch her flesh (similarly, by throwing from his hand to hers or vice versa, is also prohibited).
He may not eat with her at the table unless there is some difference, that there is something separating between his plate and her plate, bread or a pitcher, or that each one eats on their own tablecloth. Rama: There are those who say that the requirement of separation between his plate and her plate is specifically when they don't eat from the same plate when she is pure. However if they normally eat from a single plate when she is pure,  it suffices if she eats from her own plate, and they don't need another reminder (Hagahot Ashiri in the name of R"i and Hagahot Alfasi) and this is the practice.  There are those who say that it is prohibited for him to eat what remains on her plate (found in a commentary on the laws of Niddah) just as it is prohibited for him to drink what remains in her cup, as will be be explained.
He may not drink from what remains in a cup from which she drank.  Rama: Unless someone else drank in between them (Tur in the name of the Smag) or it was poured from this cup into another cup, even if it was returned to the first cup (Hagahot Maimoniot in the name of the R'em and the Rokeach 318 and Mordechai and Aguda on the first chapter of Shabbos). If she drank and he didn't know, and he wanted to drink from her cup, she doesn't need to tell him not to drink (ibid), and she is allowed to drink from a cup from which he drank (ibid). If she drank from a cup and left, there are those who say he is permitted to drink from what remains since after she has already gone, there is no obligation (in the commentary mentioned above).
He should not sit in a bed that is specifically meant for her even in her absence. Rama: It is prohibited to sit on a long bench that wobbles and is not attached to the wall when his wife in Niddah is sitting on it (Mordechai first chapter of Shabbos, Tzaphenas Paneach in the name of Rashi) but there are those who permit when a another person sits in between them (Agudah on Chapter Hatinoket and Torat Habayit 251). Similarly, he should not go with his wife in a single cart or on a single boat if they are going just for a pleasure trip, for instance to go to gardens and orchards or the like. However, if he is going from one city to another out of necessity, it is permitted, even if he and his wife are alone, as long as they sit in such a way that they do not touch each other (all this is in Torat Habayit 251).
He may not sleep in bed with her, even if each one is in their own garment, and they do not touch each other.  Rama: Even if each one has their own sheet (Beis Yosef contrary to Rabbeinu Yorucham), and even if they sleep in two beds but the beds touch each other it is prohibited (Mordechai on Chapter 1 of Shabbos in the name of the Ram).
He may not gaze even at her ankle, nor at any of her covered places. (However, he is permitted to gaze at her revealed places, even though he takes pleasure in the sight) (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam).
It is fitting that she should have special garments for her days of Niddah so that they both remember constantly that she is in Niddah.
With difficutly, they permitted her to adorn herself during her days of Niddah, only so that she should not be repulsive to her husband.
All labors that a woman does for her husband, a Niddah may do for him, except mixing his cup, for it is prohibited to mid the cup (in front of him) (Beis Yosef and similarly is implied in the Mordechai on the first chapter of Shevuos and several places in the words of the halakhic authorities), or setting on the table before him unless she makes a reminder, for instance that she sets it on the table on the left side or that she sets in on a cushion or pillow, even on his right hand side.
She is prohibited to make his bed in front of him, specifically spreading sheets and blankets, which is in the way of affection, but setting out the pillows, which is labor and is not the way of affection, is permitted. In his absence it is all permitted, even if he knows that she is making the bed.
She is prohibited to pour water for him to wash his face, hands and feet, even if she does not touch him, and even if the water is cold.
Just as she is prohibited to mix for him, so, too, he is prohibited from mixing for her.  Not only that, but even to send her a cup of wine.  It doesn't matter whether it is the cup of blessing or another cup, if it is designated for her. However, if they are drinking out of that cup, and she drinks after him, we need not be concerned.
All these distancing measures must be practiced both during her days of menstruation and during her "whitening" days, which are all the days of her counting, nor is there a distinction in any of these, between one who experienced a flow and one who found a stain. Rama: There are those who say that we need not be stringent during her whitening days in the matter of the prohibition on eating with her from a plate (note in the Mordechai in the name of the Raavya), and thus the practice is to be lenient in this, but one should be stringent.
If he is sick and has no one to attend him besides her, she is allowed to attend him, but she should be as diligent as she can be to avoid washing his face, hands or feet, or making the bed in front of him.
A woman who is sick and menstruating, it is prohibited for her husband to touch her in order to attend to her, for instance to help her stand up, or lie down, or to support her (there are those who say that if she has no one else to attend her, he is permitted to do everything and this is the practice if she really needs it).
If her husband is a doctor, he is prohibited to touch her in order to take her pulse.  Rama: According to what I have written, that our custom is to permit him to attend her if she needs him, all the more so, it is permitted for him to take her pulse if there is not another doctor, and she need him, and there is danger in her illness (thus specified the Beis Yosef from the language of the Ramban 127), and see in Orach Chayim Ch. 88 if a menstruant is permitted to enter a synagogue to pray.

Siman 196

The seven days which the Zava counts start from the day after she stops seeing blood. Likewise, the law is that if she sees blood for 2 or 3 days and subsequently stops seeing blood, she should do an internal examination on the day she stopped seeing blood in order to establish her tahara status. This internal examination should be done just prior to the onset of halachic twilight (ie. just before sunset). [And this is the way one should ideally act; but if, after the fact, even if she only did an internal examination in the morning and found no blood, that would suffice.] A person should always teach his wife to [be stringent for the ideal ruling and] do internal examination on the day she stops seeing blood using a compressed wad of cloth which should be inserted for the entire time of halachic twilight, because this type of internal examination frees us from doubt. [Gloss: There are authorities who say that if the local community has prayed the evening prayer while it is still early in the day, a woman is no longer able to do an internal examination and begin counting and wearing her white garments the following day, because of the fact that the local community has already established it as nighttime. There are also authorities who say that she would be permitted to do so even if the local community had accept the Sabbath; our practice is to ideally be stringent, but after the fact one does not have to worry about the stringent opinions. There are some women who act as follows: If she did an internal examination before the Chazzan says "Barchu" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime), but then during the course of her days of counting she saw some blood (and had to start her count over with a new internal examination) in that situation she would be able to do an internal examination even after the Chazzan says "Barchu" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime) if this blood was seen close to the onset of nighttime. This practice is not considered ideal, but one should not protest women who behave this way as they have received this ruling from a sage who ruled this way for them, and it is an old custom.]
If a woman saw blood for just one day, and she stopped seeing blood on that same day, she must do an internal examination with a compressed wad of cloth which should remain inserted for the entire duration of halachic twilight. [Gloss: But, after the fact, if she did a standard internal examination just before the onset of halachic twilight and found no blood, even though the wad was not inserted for the entire duration of halachic twilight, it is sufficient. However, in this case an internal examination done in the morning would not suffice because of the fact that she only saw blood for one day.]
(On the day which we have been discussing, ie.) the day she stopped seeing blood and did an internal examination, she should wear a garment that has been checked and found free from stains, and at night she should make her bed with sheets which have been checked and found free from stains. On the following day she begins counting her seven blood-free days. [Gloss: It is an upright practice that before a woman does the internal examination that she wash herself and wear white garments. Even if she only washes her genital area, that is enough. This is the way our communities act and one should not depart from this practice; however, in a dire situation, such as a woman who is going on a trip and doesn't have (white) clothing, she is still able to begin counting her seven blood-free days. She should, however, do her best to wear clothing which have been checked beforehand and found free of any blood stains. (Although this last line does not follow the seeming literal translation, based on commentaries this seems to be the position of the Rama)]
During all of her seven blood-free days a woman should, ideally, do internal examinations twice a day, once in the morning and once just before the onset of halachic twilight. But, if she did not do any internal examinations over the course of the entire seven blood-free days except once - irregardless of whether that single internal examination was done of the first day, the seventh day, or on any of the other day - because of the fact that she did an internal examination on the day before the seven days began (ie. the hefsek tahara) this (internal examination that she does during the seven blood-free days) suffices for her. But, if she didn't do any internal examinations during the entire seven days but only did an internal examination on the eighth day and found it to be clean from blood, she can only begin counting from the eighth day (ie. the eighth day becomes the first day). There are authorities who say that a woman must do an internal examination on the first and seventh day, and one should not be lenient. [This internal examination should ideally be done by daylight and not by candle light, but after the fact even candle light is acceptable.]
If she does an internal examination on the day which she stops seeing blood and finds that it is not clean, and then she checks after three or four day and finds that it is clean, she is still presumed to be bleeding until she establishes otherwise through an internal check as outlined above. A woman may never begin counting her seven blood-free days until she checks to ensure that she has indeed stopped bleeding and then she can begin counting on the next day.
All of these examinations, both the hefsek tahara and the internal examinations which are conducted during the course of the seven blood-free days, must be performed with an old, white linen piece of fabric, or with cotton, or with wool which is clean, soft, and white. It should be inserted into the vaginal cavity to the depth which a man's reproductive organ enters during intercourse, and it should make contact with the crevices and openings, in order to see if there is anything which is reddish in appearance. It is not sufficient for her to merely wipe herself and enter the vaginal cavity slightly. If she finds it very difficult to insert the cloth to such a depth, at the very least she should do so for the internal examination of the day on which she sees her bleeding stop and the internal examination on the first day of her seven blood-free days. [Gloss: But, if she did not do so for the internal examination on the first day of her seven blood-free days, she should do so for at least one of the internal examinations of the remaining days. However, after the fact, if she didn't do any internal examinations to such a depth, but she did check the crevices and openings within the vaginal cavity well as deep as she is able, even though she didn't reach the depth that the male organ reaches during intercourse, it is sufficient.]
A blind woman should do an internal examination and show the cloth to another woman.
A mute woman or a deaf woman who can speak, they are considered mentally fit, but a deaf-mute who cannot speak or hear, and similarly a woman who is mentally unfit, or a woman who has temporarily lost her mind because of an illness, require a mentally fit woman to perform internal examinations and establish their presumed sighting days on their behalf in order that they be permitted to their husbands. One who establishes presumed sightings for these women, should do so according to the rules for all other women. If they do not have an established day of presumed sighting, they must be careful for the 30th days from the previous sighting and be examined by mentally sound women.
A woman who checks more often than necessary, whether during her seven blood-free days or during days when she doesn't see blood at all, is praiseworthy even if she has an established day of presumed sighting.
The seven blood-free days must be consecutive days on which she does not see blood. If she saw blood even at the end of the seventh day, all the previous days are cancelled and she must do a hefsek tahara to re-establish her status and start counting a full seven blood-free days again. [Gloss: There are authorities who say that during the first three days of her seven blood-free days if she finds a stain we do not attempt to hang it on an outside source in order to be lenient in the way that we attempt to hang other stains, because the first three days should be completely clean, but on the subsequent days stains which are found may be treated like all other stains, and this is the way we behave. And this is specifically referring to a stain which is larger than the size of a "gris and more", but a stain which is smaller than this size can be blamed on a louse even within the first three days. This is also true if she has a wound on her body which she knows is actively bleeding, in this case she would be able to blame a stain which is larger than a "gris and more" on this wound. During the first three days, however, we would not blame a stain on a wound which she is not sure whether it is actively bleeding or on other things which we would normally attempt to blame a stain on, as is outlined in Section 190 above.]

(17) Coloring/makeup/dye that women put on their faces and hands and the hair on their heads is not an interposition.  And also, one who uses dyes (or paints) and their hands are dyed/colored, this is not an interposition. Re’ma – and also one whose occupation is a shochet or a butcher and their hands are always dirty with blood, the discoloration is not considered an interposition. Because the majority of butchers are not particular about this. **** שרוב בני אומנות זו אינן מקפידים - Most people in the profession do not care about this. **** Similarly, one whose profession is to be a slaughterer or ritual slaughterer and whose hands are always stained with blood is not a barrier because most people in this profession are not careful.

Laws of Mikveh and its water. Containing 75 sections: The woman does not rise up from her impure status through washing in a bathhouse, and even if all the waters in the world passed over her, she is still in her impurity, and those (who have sex with her) are deserving of spiritual excision, until she immerses her whole body at once in the waters of a mikveh or spring which has the volume of 40 se'ah, with a size of one amah by one amah and a height of three amot square, where an amah equals six tefachim and half an etzbah. And if it is wider but not as tall, that is valid, as long as she is able to get her whole body covered by them (the water) at once. And the geometric values must add up to 44,118 and a half etzba'ot in size. And the container where the water is located must be larger than this size, so that the immersee can enter and and when the water is displaced, 40 se'ah will still remain. 
Spring water purifies even when it is flowing. Rain water only purifies when in a still body, but when it is flowing, it is Biblically invalid, if it is detached from a spring. If the flowing water from a spring mixed with downflow which derives from rain, then the whole mixture has the status of the spring for all purposes. But if the downflow is greater than the spring flow, or similarly if rain water makes up the majority of the water in a river, they do not purify while flowing but only while still. Therefore one must set up a barrier or something like it in the mixed river, until the water gathers together and one can immerse in it. [Comment of Rema: And thus it is correct to teach and to be stringent. But some permit immersion in rivers all year round, even during rain and snowmelt season, when the downflow is greater than the spring flow, because the essence of the river's size is from its source location. This is the practice in most places where there is no mikveh, and we should not reprimand those who have the custom to be lenient, because they have authorities to rely on. However, one must be careful not to immerse in a river that appears entirely through rain, and when there is no rain it stops completely. Even if other rivers pour into it during the rainy season and it appears through them, in any case, since it stops entirely during the season when there is no rain, it is forbidden to immerse in it while it is flowing, until the waters are gathered together. But a river that does not stop, even even if during the rain it swells and and expands over its banks, it is permissible to immerse in it in any case, according to the lenient opinions and the common practice.]
The forty se'ah that is prescribed must not be drawn water, for if they are drawn, they are invalid. [Comment of Rema: And if the whole mikveh was drawn water, it is Biblically invalid, and when in doubt we must be stringent. But if the majority of the mikveh is valid and a minority is drawn, this (disqualification) is only Rabbinic and when in doubt we must be lenient.]
A mikveh that belongs to idolaters and they get fees from it- we should not trust the idolaters about it unless there is a fixed volume of (at least) 21 se'ah. [Comment of Rema: Since the majority of it is valid, the doubt must be resolved leniently. If we observed a partly empty mikveh, and then came and found it full, and we do not know who filled it- if it was already mostly valid, meaning that 21 se'in were present (of the necessary 40) we proceed leniently. And if the majority was not valid, then now we have a Biblical-level doubt: whether we should suspect that the idolater filled it up for bathing, and it is invalid, or whether rather an Israelite filled it up for immersion in it, and it is valid. Since most of the people who are around a mivkeh and work to make it valid are experts, certainly they have filled it properly. And even more so, if the Israelite is before us and says that they filled it properly, they are trustworthy, given that they have the ability to fix it. Similarly, one witness can be relied upon to determine forbidden status of objects, as above in Section 127 and below at the end of this section regarding rules for doubt about drawn water.]
All seas are considered springs, in that they purify even while flowing. Therefore, if a wave separates from the sea and has a volume of 40 se'ah and falls on a human or onto objects, the immersion counts for them. But if one immersed in a wave while it was in the air before it fell to the ground, even if it has a volume of 40 se'ah, or if one threw objects into the middle of the wave when it is shaped like a dome, the immersion has not counted for them. 
The mikveh's 40 se'ah must not be in a container, as we do not immerse inside containers. 
If one takes a large container like a big barrel or big tub and punctures it with a puncture that would render it insusceptible to impurity, (and some say the opening must be as large as the tube of a waterskin, and there is reason to be stringent) and installs it in the ground, and turns it into a mikveh, this is valid. And similarly if the plaster or building has cracks, this does not invalidate it, and the water that is collected inside is a valid mikveh. If one sealed it with plaster or gypsum, it still invalidates the mikveh until it is installed in the ground, or built-in. And if he dragged it across the ground or across plaster and the mud smooths (itself onto the container) from the outside, this is valid. [Comment of Rema: It is permissible to make it on a roof, as long as it is not inside a container or one stone that was first carved out and then installed. But a collection of many stones is not considered a container.]
A spring that pours into a container- immersion is invalid in it, whether in the water inside the container or after it has exited the container. And if the container pours onto the edge of a container, and from there to the inside of the container- inside the container one may not immerse, but outside of it one may, even if the majority of the water is inside. 
An impure container which one placed other containers into and then immersed- the immersion counted for all of them, even if the container has a very narrow mouth such that the water enters through it. And since immersion counts for the large container, it counts for the containers inside it. But if one tipped it onto its side and immersed it, the immersion only counts for them if the mouth is as wide as the tube of a waterskin. Similarly, if the container was pure, and one put impure containers inside it and immersed them, the immersion only counts for them if the mouth is as wide as the tube of a waterskin. [Comment of Rema: And it is permissible to immerse vessels in a basket or bag, because they do not hold water which is superior to an opening as wide as the tube of a waterskin.]
A spring that one extended into a pool of waters which are gathered and standing- it has the status of a spring. And if the intake of the outflow stops, it goes back to having the status of a mikveh. And if one went back and extended the spring's outflow into it, it goes back to the status of a spring. 
A mikveh of drawn water into which one extended the waters from a spring- even if the waters from the spring are the minority, the minority of spring waters purify the majority of drawn waters, whether the spring waters preceded the drawn or the drawn preceded the spring. [Comment of Rema: As will be explained below. But in any case, one should not immerse in it, but rather in an area of still water, as this should not be more favorably regarded than rivers where there is more outflow (from rain) than flowing water (from springs).  
A spring that was passed over the backs of containers and drawn to another location returns to the status of a mikveh, as long as one does not immerse on the actual backs of the containers. 
A spring that descends from a mountain drop by drop discontinuously has the status of a mikveh unless it descends as a flow and not discontinuously. 
Drips that became flowing water, for example, if one placed an earthenware slab close to the place that is dripping, and the waters flow and drop on it, they are valid. But any item that can become impure, even on a Rabbinic level, we may not use to create a flow. And flowing waters that pours through nut leaves are valid. 
A mikveh that (already) contains 40 se'ah or a spring of any size- one may draw as much as desired to be added inside it, and they will be valid, even if they are greater than the waters that were inside at first. (And there is no distinction between whether the spring preceded the drawn water or not, as was explained.) But any time that the mikveh does not (yet) contain 40 se'ah, even if it is only missing a small amount, if 3 lugin of drawn water fall inside, they have invalidated it, and it makes no difference if they were drawn in a container or squeezed from one's garment and held up so the water in it would fall from many locations. Likewise if one pours from the jug and drips from many locations into it, or if one threw them with the palms, and even if they fell in from two or three containers, a bit from one and a bit from the other, they combine (to comprise a volume of 3 lugin). In which circumstances is this stated? When (water) begins from the second container before the first container has stopped. But if the first one stopped before the second one started, they do not combine. And if the second start before the first stopped, specifically up to three vessels, but they do not combine from four. In which circumstances is it stated that (water) from four cannot combine? When one's original intention was not to add all three lugin. But if originally one intended to add all three lugin, even if they only added it little by little from several containers that add up to 3 lugin, it is invalid. [Comment of Rema: But if one manually passed 3 lugin over the ground, or if they splashed from an animal's feet, this is valid. And some say that an animal's feet are like a human's feet, and that neither one is valid except when passing (water) over the ground, which is like drawing it, but not when splashing, see below in this chapter in Section 39.]
A sponge that has absorbed within it 3 lugin, and when it fell into the mikveh the absorbed waters mixed with the mikveh's waters, or likewise a bucket whose mouth is narrow which contains 3 lugin of drawn water and it fell into the mikveh and not all the water inside it came out, but rather it mixed with the mikveh's water- they have not invalidated it, because they (the Sages) only discussed 3 lugin that fell and entirely mixed with the mivkeh's waters. 
Drawn waters which were at the side of the mikveh, even though the waters touch the mikveh's waters, they have not invalidated it. 
Two pools, one above the other, with a wall in between them, where one is full of valid waters and its companion is full of drawn waters, and there is an opening between them- if there are three lugin of drawn water opposite the opening, it has become invalid. How large will the opening be to have 3 lugin in it? One part out of 320 of the (size of the) pool. 
Two mikvaot, of which neither contains 40 se'ah, where one and a half lugin fell into one and one and a half lugin fell into the other, and the two mikvaot were mixed- they are valid, because neither one attained a status of invalidation. But a mikveh that did not contain 40 se'ah into which 3 lugin of drawn water fell, and which was afterwards split into two and had valid water added in, these are invalid. 
A cistern full of drawn water, which the aqueduct enters and exits- it remains perpetually invalid until it can be calculated that less than three lugin remain of the drawn waters that had been in the cistern.
A mikveh into which drawn waters fell, invalidating it, and then later one added valid water until there were 40 se'ah- it remains invalid until all the water in it leaves and the drawn water is lessened below 3 lugin. Likewise, if one made a mikveh containing 40 se'ah of valid waters and mixed it with this invalid mikveh, these have purified those. (The same rule applies to a spring of any size, which one drew to the drawn water- they have been purified as was detailed above.)
If the mikveh was missing 3 lugin, and 3 lugin of drawn waters fell into it, it remains perpetually invalid until rain waters overwhelm it or until valid waters pour into it to the point that it can be assessed that the original full volume has fallen in and more, because the incoming waters push out the waters that are inside, and remove them. If the mikveh was less, even a kortov, and less than 3 lugin of drawn waters fell into it and completed it, they have not invalidated or validated it. How is this? It remains invalid until rain falls into it or until (waters of) about the volume of water that it is missing pours in. If the right volume of rain water falls in, it is valid. If it was missing even a kortov and 3 lugin of waters fell in, they have invalidated it, and it remains invalid until its full volume and more leaves. [Comment of Rema: We specifically validate 3 lugin of drawn waters in this fashion, but if the whole thing was drawn, even if one added to it until the full volume and more leaves, it does not work, but rather we calculate the water that is leaving based on the value of both the valid and invalid waters.]
3 lugin only invalidate (the mikveh) when they are made of water and look like water. Therefore, 3 lugin of water into which wine fell, which look like wine, which fell into a mikveh have not invalidated it. Likewise, 3 lugin minus a little bit into which some milk fell, completing the volume, which fell into an incomplete mikveh have not invalidated it. 
Water from pickling, vegetable broths, and not-yet-fermented grape pomace and, similarly, dyed waters invalidate the mikveh when at (a volume of) 3 lugin. But any other liquids, fruit juices, fish pickling liquid, and fermented grape pomace do not invalidate the mikveh which is missing 3 lugin, and they also do not complete it to make it valid. So if it had 39 se'in and one se'ah of these (liquids) fell in, they do not complete it. But if it had 40 se'ah and one se'ah of these (liquids) fell in, and one took out one other se'ah, this is valid even if one did this 19 times. But with drawn waters, if one se'ah fell into 40 se'ah of valid waters, and one took out one other se'ah, and one se'ah of valid water fell in, even if one did this forever, it would be valid. 
Dyed waters have the status of waters for invalidation of the mikveh which is missing 3 lugin, even if their appearance is unusual compared to the appearance of water. But a complete mikveh- even if dyed waters fell in and changed its appearance, is not invalidated. Likewise, if one washed dishes in it and its appearance changed, or steeped herbs or foods in it and its appearance changed, it is not invalidated. But if wine or olive juice fell in and changed its appearance from what it had been, it is invalidated. What should one do? If it is missing volume, one should wait until rains fall and fill it and its appearance goes back to the appearance of wate. And if it contains 40 se'ah, which means it cannot be invalidated by drawing water in, one should fill it up manually and add to it until its appearance returns to the appearance of water. 
If it contained 40 se'ah and wine fell in and changed the appearance of half of it (the mikveh), if it does not have 40 se'ah that have the appearance of water, then one should not immerse in it. 
A mikveh in which the waters have changed appearance due to their own reasons and nothing has fallen in- this is valid. 
A changed appearance only invalidates rain waters that have formed a mikveh, but a spring cannot be invalidated by a change of appearance. Not only this, but even if the mikveh has (already) been invalidated, if one drew waters from a spring towards it, the spring purifies it, even if they (the waters) have not returned to their appearance. 
If three lugin of wine fell in, it is as if they did not fall in (and permissible to immerse) whether in the area of the wine or the area of the water. If it contains drawn water and one connected it (to a mikveh), if it connects at the area of the wine, neither one is purified. If it connects at the area of the water, the area of water is purified, the area of wine is not purified. [Comment of Rema: An incomplete mikveh into which wine fell, changing its appearance, and then 3 lugin of drawn water fall in, they do not invalidate it, and when one returns and completes the mikveh with valid waters, and it returns to the appearance of water, it is valid.]
The action of drawing only invalidates water. But snow, hail, ice, salt, somewhat thick mud, even if it is soft enough to pour from one container to another- drawing does not invalidate them, so that if one drew these into an incomplete mikveh, they have not invalidated it. Not only this, but even if one made the entire mikveh from snow or ice or hail which was brought in a container, and made a mikveh out of it, this is valid. [Comment of Rema: And when one assesses the volume of the mikveh using snow, they must first condense its hollow spaces, and then it is permissible to immerse in it as-is. And some are stricter, immersing in all of these only after they have melted and turned to water, and ideally it is good to be strict.]
A drawn mikveh that has frozen is pure from concern of drawn water. If it melts, it is valid for immersion. 
A mikveh that contains 40 se'ah of water and soft mud that a cow might bend and drink from, if the water floats on top of the mud, we may immerse even in the mud. If the water does not float on top of the mud, we may not immerse in the area of mud, but we may immerse in the water, even if it only contains 40 se'ah when the mud is included. 
Anything originating within the water, like red gnats- we may immerse in it. And we may immerse in the eye of a large fish where the fat of the eye has melted inside the socket.
A container is only considered to invalidate the water in it by reason of "drawing" if it was suitable as a container before it was installed, and it was deliberately filled. Then it invalidates (the water), whether it is a large container that holds 40 se'ah liquid measure, which would be 2 kurim in dry measure, or whether it is an extremely small container. And even if it is a container made from dung, a stone container or an earthen container. 
One places a board under the pipe near the mikveh so that the waters will fall from it to the mikveh. If it has four rimmed edges so it suitable to contain the waters, it invalidates (the mikveh), but if not, it does not invalidate. One stands (the board) up on its side to rinse it, even if it has rimmed edges, it does not invalidate, since it is not positioned in a way that is suitable for containing. This is in a situation where the waters are eligible to enter the mikveh without it (the board). But if the waters were not eligible to enter the mikveh without it, even if it was stood up on its side or flipped onto its mouth, it invalidates (the mikveh). 
A pipe that does not have four rimmed edges is not considered a container, and it is suitable for bringing water through it to the mikveh. And if one carved out a hollow, even a small one, inside (the pipe) before installing it, if it is wooden, then even if the hollow only holds a tiny amount, the whole thing becomes a container because of it, and all the waters that pass through it are considered drawn. But if it was made of pottery, the hollow only invalidates it if it holds a revi'it. And if clumps of mud or dirt fell in the hollow, it cannot be considered sealed off enough to nullify the (pipe's) container status unless they adhere inside it. A spout that narrows on both ends and is wide in the middle is not considered "containing" enough to invalidate the mikveh. [Comment of Rema: And therefore it is permitted to make mikvaot by means of wooden pipes and spouts that bring the water from a river or some other spring to the mikveh, or pipes from the roofs. And we do not need to worry that perhaps the force of the moisture has made hollows in them and they are containing, because even if there is a hollow in them, it is not considered a container, since it was not made intentionally by anyone. And if the waters come into the pipe by way of containers that are fixed on a wheel, which are punctured in a way that makes them not considered containers, it is permissible to immerse in them if the mikveh contains 40 se'ah. But if it does not contain 40 se'ah, one must not immerse there, since it is not considered connected to the river by this. See OC159.]
Tiles that we cover roofs with- even though they have hollows and carved portions, they do not invalidate the mikveh, because they were not made to contain (anything) in them. 
One places fabric or wicker under the pipe- the waters that are drawn down them do not invalidate the mikveh. 
The rule they stated - Anything that is not made for containing water does not invalidate the mikveh - they only said about the case where they (the waters) fell of their own accord into the mikveh, on their own. But if a human put them into the mikveh, then this invalidates it, as any thing a human does manually, even splashing with their hands and feet, and even passing through waters which flow on their own down their legs into the mikveh, invalidates it. In which cases is this said? When they flow down their legs. But if one was riding on the back of an animal and the waters flowed down the animal's legs, they have not invalidated it, even though they flowed from the animal that one is riding on, this is not considered the same as flowing down one's own legs. (It has been explained already that some disagree with this, see above Section 15.)
A container that has a puncture in its base, even a very small one, is not considered a container enough to invalidate the mikveh. But in any case, one should not be lenient and in an ideal case make the mikveh with water brought in punctured containers like this. And if the puncture is on the sides, it does not nullify the status of a container until the puncture has a width of the tube of a waterskin, which is approximately the width of the first two fingers from the parallel portion of the hand, folded over, within the opening of the puncture, whether it is square or round. And it must be close to its base so that it cannot hold any water from there downward, but if it can hold any water below it, its status as a container has not been nullified. And if one mixed plaster with clumps of mud and sealed the puncture with them, it is not considered sealed enough to return it to the status of a container. Or if one set it on the ground or even on plaster or gypsum, it is not considered sealed. However, if one mixed plaster and gypsum and sealed it, it is considered sealed. Therefore, if one wants to draw water from the mikveh to clean it, but fears dripping 3 lugin back from the container used to remove the water into the mikveh after less than 40 se'ah remain and invalidating it, one should puncture the utensil in its base a little bit, so then the waters within it will not be considered drawn. But if the waters are flowing, there is no need for this, as a spring is not invalidated by drawing. [Comment of Rema: But in any case, they have customarily been strict even about a spring, because some disagree even about a spring and say that drawing does invalidate it, and therefore, ideally, we should be stringent and puncture the container that we are drawing water with, even in a spring. And if they did not do this and drew the water with a complete container, and 3 lugin of drawn waters fell in and the mikveh was invalidated and they now want to clean it and make it valid, if the dripping punctures can be easily stopped up, it is best to be stringent and to do so, but if this is a very difficult task or after the fact if they did not do it, we should rely on the lenient opinions, who think that drawing water does not invalidate a spring, because this is the basic rule. And even in a mikveh that does not have a spring, if the container is not so large that it will certainly drip 3 lugin of drawn waters, but we might suspect that the drips are sequential etc., we follow the lenient opinion because a doubt about the 3 lugin of drawn water is a doubt about a Rabbinic-level rule, and we do not need to be suspicious after the fact.]
One places containers under the pipe to catch the waters that will fall from them into the mikveh- if one placed them when clouds were gathering and it rained before the clouds dispersed, and they fill up, they are considered intentional and become "drawn." But if the clouds were not gathering at the time that one placed them (the containers) and they (the clouds) then gathered and filled them, or even if one placed them while clouds were gathering but they scattered, and they (the containers) remained there until they (the clouds) gathered again, and filled them, this is not considered intentional, and they are not invalid. This is only when one breaks the containers or flips them without raising them off the ground, because if one raises them from the ground with the water, they are considered "drawn" and invalidate the mikveh. 
One places jugs on top of the roof to dry them, and rains fall on them and fill them- even if it was the rainy season, one may break the jugs or flip them and the water that had been in the jugs is valid for immersion, even if all the water had been in the containers, because one has not filled them manually. But if one lifted the jugs and poured them out, then all the waters in them become "drawn."
The plasterer who forgot a pot in the mikveh, and it filled with water- even if only a little remains in the mikveh and the pot has the majority of the mikveh's volume, one may break the pot in its place and the whole mikveh will be valid. Likewise, one who placed jugs in the mikveh to strengthen them and they filled with water, even if the mikveh has absorbed its waters and there is no water remaining except the water that is inside the jugs, one may  break the jugs and the collected water in them is a valid mikveh. 
Drawn waters of 3 lugin do not invalidate the mikveh until they fall into the mikveh from a container. But if the drawn waters were dragged outside the mikveh and flowed so they fell into the mikveh, they do not invalidate the mikveh until they constitute a half-and-half fraction, but if the majority is the valid portion then the mikveh is valid. How (does this work)? A mikveh contains 20 se'ah plus a small amount of valid waters, and one fills and draws (water) up outside the mikveh, and the waters flow and fall into the mikveh. Whether they flow over the earth, or inside a pipe etc. made of things that do not invalidate the mikveh, it is valid, even if in total they comprise a thousand se'in. Because drawn water that has been made to flow is valid if most of 40 se'ah of valid (water) was already present. Similarly, if a roof had 20 se'ah plus a small amount of rain waters, and one filled it manually and added less than the 20 that were present - the whole thing is invalid - and then opened the pipe and the waters all flowed to one place, this is a valid mikveh. Because drawn water that has been made to flow is entirely valid, therefore a majority of the water present is valid. [Comment of Rema: But if one first made the invalid waters flow, and then after brought to them the majority of valid water, this was not effective.]
The length of this flowing portion must be no less than three hand-widths.
Causing the flow does not work unless it is over the earth or a pipe that does not have a separate container. But if one made it flow over containers, even containers made of dung etc. this does not constitute flowing. [Comment of Rema: And some say that making it flow only works specifically on the earth, which is able to absorb it, but if one made if flow over stone flooring which is not absorbent, and even more so over a board or container, even one that does not invalidate a mikveh, this does not work. And ideally it is good to be stringent.]
A mikveh that flows that dried out in the summer, and the cistern was somewhat far from it, and one filled it (the cistern) with drawn water and the mikveh filled up from under the ground with those same drawn waters, the mikveh is just as valid as if it was flowing. 
One trying to cause waters to flow to the mikveh must not use an item that can contract impurity. So for example, if one wants to make rain waters flow to another place to make a mikveh, they must not grab a board by hand and pass them over it. Instead, they should place the board on the earth and take their hand off of it before the waters pass over it. And similarly, it is forbidden to cause the waters to flow through a metal pipe into the mikveh, because it can contract impurity. This is when the waters fall directly from the item that can contract impurity into the mikveh. But if they fall on its (the mikveh's) edge, outside, and flow into it, or if one connects a small tube of wood or pottery to the lead pipe, through which the water cascades into the mikveh, this is valid. And if the metal pipe is connected to the earth, even if it cascades directly into the mikveh, it is valid, because it cannot contract impurity, because it is rendered insignificant by the earth. [And it does not make a difference whether it is buried under the ground or not.]
In what cases was this said? When one causes regular rain water to flow. But if one is causing it to flow from a spring or a mikveh, even using something that can contract impurity, it is valid. Because we consider this mikveh that is receiving the flow as if it were connected to that spring or to that mikveh that is originating the flow of waters. And some do not differentiate between these. 
A rain water mikveh that had one of its walls break, and the waters are exiting through the crack- if 40 se'ah are left after the portion next to the crack exit, it is valid, but if not, it is invalid. Because it has become flowing, and a mikveh does not purify while flowing. [Comment of Rema: And some are stringent, even if 40 se'ah will remain until the crack is reached, and ideally one should be sensitive to their concerns, and seal the cracks. And all this is specifically in a mikveh that does not come from a spring, but if it comes from a spring, one does not need to worry about its flow. And waters' exit is not considered 'flowing' unless they do not return to the mikveh. But if they go out a little and come back there, it is not considered flowing.] And if one tries to seal the crack so that 40 se'ah will remain, they must not seal it manually, or with anything that can contract impurity. And some permit sealing with any item that can contract impurity. 
If the mikveh is punctured and its waters drip little by little, or are absorbed into the earth little by little, it is valid, because their flow is not identifiable.
One trying to mix an invalid or too-small mikveh with a valid mikveh to make it valid, or when both are too small and one is trying to mix them to make them valid- the opening between them must be as wide as the tube of a waterskin (and the stream of water must be as wide as the opening) and after the invalid has been mixed with the valid, even for a moment, it remains valid forever, even if the puncture is later sealed up. Anything located near the waterskin-tube-width can reduce its size, even materials originating from the water. If it is doubtful whether the opening is as wide as the tube of a waterskin or not, it is invalid. If it has many small punctures, they combine to add up to the width of a waterskin tube, if the one mikveh is complete and the second is too small. [Comment of Rema: And it is permissible to dig a mikveh next to a river and to immerse in it, even if there are not 40 se'ah, since the soil is continuously percolating, and since it is close to the river and we can observe the percolation between them, in which the waters come from the river by way of percolation, meaning, through tiny openings in the earth, this is considered a connection.] But if both are too small, the small punctures do not add up to the width of a waterskin tube. (And the rule is the same if a part of the mikveh is in a basket or bag, if neither side has enough volume, it is invalid.)
One trying to validate a mikveh of drawn water with a full, non-drawn mikveh- even if one only connects them by a hair's breadth, it is valid. And even if the waters at that connection do not contact the surface. [Comment of Rema: This is specifically relating to the invalidation of drawing water, which is Rabbinic-level. But a Biblical-level invalidation requires the width of the tube of a waterskin, as was explained. Even the invalidation of drawn water is disputed, and it is proper to teach it this way.]
A wall between two mikvaot that has cracked from one side to the other, even a very small amount, if it is in "warp thread" direction, they combine to mix the two mikvaot and make them valid. But if it is in the "weft thread" direction, they do not combine until one area has the diameter of the tube of a waterskin. And if the wall was split at the top between one and the other, with a height of a garlic peel and width of the tube of a waterskin, it is valid. [Comment of Rema:  And it would be the same rule if there was a pile of dirt between the two mikvaot- if one removed a little from the height of the pile until they flow into each other with a width of the tube of a waterskin and the height of a garlic peel, this is enough, since we only require the full diameter of the tube of a wineskin for a puncture.]
Three mikvaot, where two of them have twenty se'ah each of valid waters and one has twenty se'ah of drawn waters, and they are standing side by side, and three people descend and immerse in them, and through this, they fill up and overflow and mix together- all three of them become valid, since at one point 40 se'ah of valid water were connected together, and those people who immersed in them are purified. But if the drawn water was in the middle, so the two valid ones could only mix through it, they have not become valid, but rather remain as they were originally, and those people who immersed in them have not been purified. 
Two mikvaot, of 20 se'ah each, where one is drawn and one is valid- if two people descended in and connected them and immersed in them, even if they (the waters) started off red and became white (through mixing), or started off white and became red, the mikvaot are just as they were before, and the immersees are just as they were before. 
Everything that is mixed with the mikveh has the status of a mikveh, and one may immerse in pits close to the mikveh's mouth, and in places where animal hooves have stepped, if the water in them is mixed with the mikveh's water by the width of the tube of a waterskin, they may immerse in them. [Comment of Rema: And therefore, for a utensil placed on the edge of the mikveh, one may splash their hand in the mikveh to make a wave in the water, which will pass over the utensil, and the immersion has counted for it. However, one must not disconnect the wave from its place, and it must rather be attached to the mikveh.] 
Niches in caves, and crevices in caves- one may immerse in them even if the water in them is only mixed with the mikveh's water by a very small amount. 
A lower chamber (meaning, an excavated area) within the mikveh- if the earth that separates between the lower chamber and the mikveh is sturdy and can support itself, one may not immerse in the waters in the lower chamber until they mix with the mikveh's waters by the width of the tube of a waterskin. But if it cannot support itself, even if they are only mixed a tiny amount, one may immerse in them. 
Three pits along a riverbed, where the bottom and top are of 20 se'ah, and the middle is of 40, and a flood of rainwater passes through the riverbed- even though it enters and exits them, this is not considered mixing, and one may only immerse in the middle one, as flowing waters do not mix unless they stand still. 
One gathers their arms and legs, and positions themselves at the water spout- if water covers all of them, they are pure. 
A mikveh that contains 40 se'ah exactly- a person who immerses in it must not jump in, so as not to reduce the water by their jumping in, and must not immerse twice in a row. If two people immersed one after the other, even if the feet of the first are still touching the water, the second remains in their impurity, as the water has been reduced from 40 se'ah. 
If one immerses a thick fabric that absorbs water- the whole time that the fabric is touching the mikveh, it is valid, even if three lugin have flowed back into the mikveh. If one removes it (the wet fabric) from it (the mikveh), it is invalid, as it has been made "drawn" by the waters that flow from the fabric into it. And if one immerses a kettle or other utensils, they should lower it into it by the mouth, so that the waters will not splash when they enter it, making it (the mikveh's volume) reduced, and they should raise it out by the sides, so that the water will not stay in it and be missing from the mikveh. [Comment of Rema: All the water that is in the utensil. Also the water in the utensil becomes drawn, and if it falls after this into the mikveh, it can invalidate it, since there is no longer the necessary volume for a mikveh.]
One immersing a pillow or cushion in the mikveh that has exactly 40 se'ah, as soon as its lip is lifted out of the water, the waters inside it become "drawn." How should one proceed? Immerse them, and raise them by their edges. But a basket or a fabric bag- one can immerse them and lift them in their normal way without concern. 
A mikveh where it is known that its water volume grows smaller and ultimately will have less than 40 se'ah- (and one has already immersed in it) they must return and immerse, any time that we do not know for sure that at the time of their immersion there was 40 se'ah. But if it is not known that the water volume grows smaller to that degree that it will ultimately have less than 40 se'ah, even if its waters sometimes rise and sometimes fall, they do not need to return and immerse. But in any case, the proper thing is to check before immersion if there are 40 se'ah in it. ...
A mikveh where the waters are shallow and one cannot cover themselves in it- one may place on one edge stones or bundles of wood so that its waters are gathered to one place, and they will rise up to a level where one can cover themselves in it, as long as it does not totally divide the mikveh. But if one did this with utensils, it is invalid. [Comment of Rema: And even if one could cover themselves with water- if the water is not one fingerspan higher than the immersee's navel, ideally one should not immerse in it, in case they do not immerse nicely. However, if there is no other mikveh, and it is not possible to fix it, even if one needs to lie down flat on their face because the waters are not deep enough- if they can cover their whole body in this way at once, they may immerse there.]
Water that is doubtfully drawn is pure. What does this mean? A mikveh where doubts arise about whether drawn waters fell in or did not fall in, or even if it is definitely known that they fell in, there is doubt about whether they consisted of 3 lugin or not, or even if it definitely known that they consisted of 3 lugin, there is doubt if the mikveh they fell into had 40 se'ah already or not- this is valid. 
Two mikvaot, where one has 40 se'ah and one does not, and 3 lugin of drawn water has fallen into one of them, but it is not known into which one they fell- its doubt renders it pure, because there is "something to hang it on." If both were smaller than 40 se'ah, and it fell into one of them but it is not known into which, then each of them is invalid, because there is "nothing to hang it on." 
A mikveh that was empty when one left it, but one has arrived and found it full- this is valid, because this case is doubtfully drawn water in a mikveh. (And see above, at the beginning of this section what I wrote about this.)
A pipe that spills into the mikveh and has a hollow in its side, so that doubt arises about whether (the water comes) from the pipe to the mikveh or from the hollow to the mikveh - this is invalid, because the invalidation is obvious. But if the mikveh already contains a majority of valid waters, this is valid, because this case is doubtfully drawn water, since there is already a valid mikveh established there. 
One who is impure who descends to immerse, and doubt arises about whether they immersed or did not immerse, and even if they immersed, there is doubt about whether there were 40 se'ah or not, or (if there were) two mikvaot, where one has 40 se'ah and one does not, and one has already immersed in one of them and it is not known in which one- they are impure, because the impure one remains in their established status until it is known that they have immersed appropriately. And similarly, a mikveh that was measured and found to be too small, whether that mikveh is in the public domain or the private domain, all the purifications that were done through it are retroactively impure, until the last known time that it was measured and found to be complete. (And see above 65) 
Two mikvaot, which do not contain 40 se'ah, had three lugin (of drawn waters) fall into one of them, and we know which one they fell in, and then a second volume fell in, and we do not know which they fell into- I can "hang it" and say that the location where the first (waters) fell, the second also fell. But if it is not know which one the first fell into, but it is know where the second fell, one cannot "hang it" and say that the place where the second fell, the first also fell. If one mikveh contained 40 se'ah and one did not, I can say that they fell into the one that did contain 40. If one was drawn and one was not drawn, I can say that it fell into the drawn one. 
Two mikvaot which do not contain 40 seah, and three lugin (of drawn waters) have fallen into one of them, and it is not known into which one they fell and then afterwards rain came and they were filled, one must not ideally immerse in any of them. 
All mikvaot that are found are invalid, as their assumed status is that of "drawn." 
Some prohibit pouring a kettle of hot water into the mikveh to heat it, and likewise, to fill the mikveh with hot water and to connect it to a river by a waterskin's width. [Comment of Rema: But some are lenient, and permit pouring hot water into the mikveh in order to heat it. But in any case, on should be stringent unless one is is in a community that customarily is lenient, in which case one should not discourage them. But in hot springs, like those of Tiberias, it is permissible according to all opinions. And after the immersing in valid waters, one may enter the bathhouse in order to warm themselves, but some prohibit returning to wash afterwards, and this is how the custom is practiced.]

Siman 202



Siman 203

[Which things are praiseworthy, and which of them are degraded. And following: 7 subsections] Do not become accustomed to making vows. Anyone who vows, even if they keep them, is called evil and is called a sinner.
A person who delays their vow, their notebook is opened.
One who vows is considered as if they built a forbidden altar, and one who fulfils the vow is as if they sacrificed a forbidden sacrifice, for it is better to annul the vow. This is the case in normal vows, but in the case of <i>hekdesh</i> vows it is obligatory to fulfil them, and one should only have them annulled in extenuating circumstances. RAMA: This is the case, too, when one makes an oath, that they should only seek annulment in extenuating circumstances.
One should be careful not to vow in any matter. Even <i>tzedaka</i> should not be vowed; rather, if one has what to give, they should immediately give it, and if not, they should not vow until they have it. And if one is part of the <i>tzedaka</i>-distribution process, it should be done while stating "This is not a vow!"
In a time of distress it is permitted to vow.
A person who says "I will learn this <i>perek</i>, and is afraid lest they become negligent in this matter, it is appropriate for them to vow in order to quicken themselves. And so, if one is afraid that their [evil] inclination will attack them and they will transgress any commandment of the negative commandments, or become negligent in the fulfilment of a positive commandment, it is a commandment for that person to vow in order to quicken themself.
One who vows in order to straighten their mind and repair their actions, such a person is eager and praiseworthy. How so? A glutton who forswore meat for a year or two; or a drunkard who forswore wine for a significant amount of time, or forswore drunkenness forever; or one who chased bribes and then felt regret, and forswore gifts or benefits from people of that land; or a person proud of their good looks who swore to be a Nazirite. All such vows are ways of serving God, and it is of such vows that the sages said "Vows are a guard for abstinence" (Avot 3:13). Nonetheless, even though these are service of God, one shouldn't become accustomed to them, rather, one should abstain from what is worthy to be abstained from, without making a vow.      

Siman 204

The essence of the vow referred to in the Torah is to attach it to another consecrated item. For example, one says: "This bread is to me like a sacrifice" or "This bread is to me a prohibition". So too if one prohibits one loaf of bread by attaching it to a consecrated item, and then says of another loaf: "That too!" - it is now forbidden. This can apply even to a hundred loaves. If one vows to fast on a certain day, or not to eat meat, and says of another day: "Like that one!" - it is forbidden [to eat]. RAMA: There are varying terminologies for vows, and the Rabbi did not mention them all.

Siman 205



Siman 206



Siman 207

Synonyms for vows are like vows. How so? If one said "Konam", "Konach" or "Konas" is this loaf of bread to me, it is forbidden [as if one said "Korban", sacrifice]. In every place, one follows local terminology, and if there is a local phrase for a vow, it is truly a vow. RAMA: So too, if one does not understand the language of the Rabbis and uses them for a vow, it is invalid. But synonyms of synonyms, or a word that sounds very distant from the language of a vow, is not a vow. RAMA: And a vow can be made in any language where forbidding something to oneself is called 'vow'.

Siman 208



Siman 209



Siman 210

A vow is invalid unless one's heart and lips (intention and speech) are aligned. Therefore if one intended to say 'wheat bread' and actually said 'barley bread', both kinds are permitted. If one, however, intended to say 'wheat bread' (RAMA: or barley bread) and just said "bread", they are only forbidden to eat wheat bread. (RAMA: or only barley bread.) And if one vows according to the intention of others, the definitions follow those of the other, and the vow applies to these.
One who vows in their dream, it is meaningless and they don't need it to be annulled. However, there are those who say that it has to be annulled by ten literate judges (RAMA: And they find a point of regret, as if they had vowed awake.) And this [second] opinion should be heeded. RAMA: However, if it is difficult to find ten literate judges, one can then do it with three, as usual.

Siman 211

One who states: "The vows I wish to vow shall not be vows", and then vows - this is no vow. This is only the case when one expresses the condition verbally, but if one merely thought of this, it is a matter of the heart, and cannot cancel the vow that was spoken. There are those who say that even if one whispers such a condition, it is like a mater of the heart. RAMA: As for us, when we say <i>Kol Nidrei</i> on the eve of Yom Kippur, it is as if we are making this condition. Nonetheless, we do not rely on this to permit things without asking the rabbis, except for urgent cases.
One who makes the condition: "All vows that I vow until the following  time shall be void," and then vows within this time - if they remember the condition at the time of making the vow, then the vow is valid, since the condition is annulled by the vow. If they did not remember the condition at the time of the vow, the condition remains valid and the vow is annulled. There are those who say that the condition cannot annul the vow unless one mentions quickly (<i>toch k'dei dibbur</i>) after the vow that it is being done according to the condition - and one should heed to this opinion.

All this applies only to vows and oaths one makes alone. However, for a vow or an oath concerning someone else - these conditions make no difference.

Siman 212



Siman 213

Vows do not apply to intangible substances. For example, if one says: "<i>Konam</i> that I speak to you!" or "serve you" or "go for you" or "sleep with you" - this is no vow. So too, if one phrases it this way: my speech, my servitude, or my going is forbidden to you, or sleep is forbidden to me - this is no vow. However, on a rabbinic level one should have these annulled. Therefore, if Reuben forbids himself from hearing Shimon's prayer, on a rabbinic level this should be annulled. Yet if he says "<i>Konam</i> is my mouth from speaking to you", "<i>Konam</i> is my hand from serving you", "<i>Konam</i> are my feet from walking for you", "<i>Konam</i> are my eyes for sleep" - these are all absolute Torah-level vows. All the more so if one says: "Forbidden to you is my mouth for my speech", "my hands for my work", "my feet for my walking". RAMA: There are those who say that the phrases: [<i>Konam</i> is] "The speech of my mouth to you" or "The lifting of the stone is to me" are a vow, since one has mentioned the [tangible objects] mouth and stone.

One who took a neder [sic: vow] and regrets it, can rectify the acceptance of the neder by having remorse. Even if one took a neder with the name of G-D. What should that person do? They should go to a wise [Torah Scholar] who is an expert, who [is well versed in] learns logical inferences and deductive (talmudic) reasoning. If there is no expert, one should go to three average people. These should be people who study with logical inferences and deductive reasoning, and who also know how to find loopholes; and they will release the vow. Nowadays there is no one considered to be an expert who is able to release a vow solely by themselves.
A person cannot nullify [another person's nederim] in an ideal way in-front of his rabbi or in a place in which there's a great person unless they give you permission. Rama: And you can nullify two or three nederim at once and you can nullify two or three people's nederaim at once.  
How can you nullify a never? You say three times "mutar lach" or "mochal lach" (you can say this in any language). Even if the people are standing, are relatives, it's night time, and it's Shabbos, even if the vow was taken yesterday (before Shabbos), as long as it is necessary for Shabbos, for example a vow not to eat,  to avoid participating in oneg shabbos. And (if one vows) to distance oneself from the congregation, we say you can nullify the vow even it isn't necessary for Shabbos. 










Prior to annulment, [one] must state the vow explicitly and the reason the vow was taken. If the vow was not stated, the nullification is not [considered] a nullification. However, if one states the vow to one [of the people] that are nullifying the vow, then it suffices.

(55) These are the vows that a husband cancels: vows that bring bodily affliction [lit. afflictions of a soul] and (vows) that involve things that come between him and her. Vows that bring bodily affliction that are permitted to her, she has a permission for all times. And (vows) that involve things between him and her he only permits for himself, and while he has benefit from it, (that is) during the time she is under him. And after she divorces, during all the time she still could come back to him, but if she remarries all these are cancelled. And anything that has no affliction and does not come between him and her he cannot cancel.
(56) The husband becomes a proxy to those who ask about the vows of the wife provided that he found three joiners [to dissolve the vow] but he cannot join them.
(57) The husband does not join another two men to release his wife's vow with the formula of release, but the father does release the vows of his daughter with the formula of release if he is a wise man.
(58) There are those who say that the father cannot cancel the vows in which there is no bodily affliction; there are those who permit (him to do so); and there are those who make a distinction if she is betrothed: before she is betrothed, he can cancel all her vows, but once she is betrothed, (even when) the intended has died and she returns to her father's home, he is unable to cancel her vows, unless they involve bodily affliction.
(59) What are the things that involve bodily affliction? Washing oneself, and donning adornments, painting the eyes and the cheeks. For example, if she vowed not to have a bath or to adorn herself, or said that I forbid myself the pleasure of bathing and adorning even for that day, since it is possible that she won't do those things and not be betrothed, those are things involving bodily afflictions, even though the vow is valid only for one day. And there are those who say that bathing and adorning are (also) things that come between him and her. Gloss: and all that only applies for beautification of the face, but adornment of below (ie, feet) everyone agrees that these are not things that come between him and her.

<b>What is honor and what is fear, and their laws. And there are 25 paragraphs in it.</b> One must be very careful concerning his father and mother's honor and fear. <i>Gloss: But nevertheless, the court does not enforce the honor of father and mother; since it is a positive commandment the reward of which is alongside it, such that the court does not enforce it (Beit Yosef in the name of the Gemara; Toledot Adam VeChava, Netiv A).</i>  
What is fear? He should not stand in the place designated for him to stand in the consultation of the elders with his colleagues, or the place designated for him to pray, nor should he sit in the place designated for him to recline in his home, nor contradict his words nor determine his words in his presence - even to say, "Father's words appear [correct]." And he should not call him by his name, neither in life nor in death, but rather say, "Father, my teacher." If his father's name was like the name of others, he changes their names if it is an unusual name that not all of the people call [their offspring] with. <i>But it is permissible to call others with a name that is [common], not in front of him (Tur).</i>  
To what extent is their fear? Had the son been dressed with fine clothing and sitting at the head of the  community, and his father and mother came and ripped his clothes, hit him on his head and spit in front of him - he should not shame them, but rather remain silent, and fear the King of kings of kings, who so commanded him.
What is honor? He feeds him and gives him drink; dresses and covers him; and brings him in and takes him out - and he does so with a pleasant countenance. For even if he feeds him fattened fowl every day, yet does so with an angry face, he will be punished for it.<i>Gloss: And likewise the opposite: If one makes him grind with a millstone, but his intention is for the good - in order to save his father from something harder than this - and he speaks [with] appeasement to the heart of his father and shows him that his intention is for the good until his father agrees to grind with the millstone, he acquires the world to come (Gemara and Rashi, Chapter 1 of Kiddushin and Yerushalmi). And he serves him in other ways in which a servant serves his master.</i>  
And that which he gives him food and he gives him drink - that is from [the resources of] the father and mother, if he has. However if the father does not have and the son does have, we force him and he sustains the father according to what he can [afford]. But if the son does not have, he is not obligated to [knock on] doors to feed his father. <i>Gloss: And some say that he is only obligated to give to him that which he is obligated to give to charity. (So wrote the Beit Yosef - that it appears to be so from the words of the Rif and the Rosh. And so too did the Ran write in the first chapter of Kiddushin.) But nevertheless if he has the wherewithal, a curse will come to one who supports his father with his charity monies (Hagahot Mordechai on Bava Batra; Hagahot on Bava Metzia; and Chiddushei Aggadah). And if he has several sons, they calculate [their obligation] according to their money. And if some of them are rich and some of them are poor, only the rich ones are obligated (Teshuvat Maimoni, Laws of Rebels, in the name of Mohoram [Maharam of Rothenberg] - and brought by the Beit Yosef).</i> But he is obligated to honor him with his body, even though he [becomes] idle from his work through this, and [then] becomes required to [knock on] doors. And [that is] specifically when the son has sustenance that will sustain [himself] that day. But if he does not have [it], he is not obligated to be idle from his work and to [knock] on doors.
If he needs anything in the city and he knows that they would fulfill his request for the sake of his father - even though he knows that they would also fulfill the thing for his sake, nevertheless, he should not say, "Do this one thing for my sake," but rather, "for the sake of Father," in order to attach the honor to his father. 
One is obligated to stand before his father. But if the father is a student of his son, each one must stand before the other. <i>(Tur in the name of the Rosh) Gloss: But if the son wants to forgo his honor [so as] to serve his father, he is permitted. For behold, a teacher who forgoes his honor; his honor is forgiven. But that is specifically in private; or even in public when he is known in his city, such that everyone knows that he is his father. But if the son is a great Torah scholar and his father is not known in his city, we should be concerned about the disgrace of the Torah - if the son is disgraced before the father. So they should distance themselves from one another, such that neither one should reduce his honor before his fellow. ([This is] all the understanding of the rabbi, according to the opinion of the Beit Yosef.) And so did Moharam do with this father.</i>
Up to where (how extensive) is the honor of father and mother? Even if [the parents] took his purse full of gold coins and threw it to the sea in front of him, he should not embarrass them, nor be distressed before them nor get angry towards them; but he should rather accept the written decree and be silent. <i>Gloss: And some say that if he wants to throw the son's purse to the sea, he may prevent him. For behold, he is only obligated to honor him from [the resources] of the father, but not from [those] of the son (Tur in the name of the Ri). And there is no distinction between honoring him and causing him distress (Terumat HaDeshen, Section 40). And [that is] only before that they threw it; as it is possible that he will be prevented and not do [it]. But if they already threw it, it is forbidden to embarrass him; but he may make a claim against him in court (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And [this is] only when he wants to throw his purse to the sea, since there is financial loss. But if he just wants to take profits away from him, it is forbidden in any manner (Ran, Kiddushin, Chapter 1). [In the case of] a son that has a case with his father and the father is the claimant, the son must go [to] the father - even though the son is the defendant and he lives in another city. For this is the honor of his father. However the father is obligated to pay the expenses to the son, since the son is not obligated to honor him from the his [own] resources (In the Maharik, Root 58), as will be explained.</i>
One is obligated to honor him even after his death. How is that? If he says a matter he heard from his mouth - if it is within twelve months [of his death] - he should say, "So said Father, my teacher, may I be an atonement for his resting." But if it is after twelve months when he mentions him, he says, "May his memory be for a blessing." <i>Gloss: And there is no difference between the father and mother in all of this (Maharil, Section 27). Some say that if he writes something within twelve months and mentions his father, he does not need to write, "May I be an atonement for his resting," but rather, "May his memory be for a blessing" - as behold, his writing will endure after twelve months (Hagahot on Rif, Kiddushin, Chapter 1). But there are some that are stringent even with writing ([as] in the Nimukei Yosef and other writers; and so is it implied in Beit Yosef, Section 242 at the end in the name of Rashbatz and [in] in the Responsa of [Yaakov] Ibn Chaviv, 264), and such is our practice.</i>
If one's father or mother has become mentally insane, he should make an effort to behave toward them according to their state of mind, until they will be shown mercy. But if it is impossible for him to stand [it] because they have become utterly insane, he may leave them and go away, charging others to take proper care of them.
If one saw that his father was transgressing a Torah matter, he should not say to him, "You transgressed a Torah matter." Rather, he should say to him - "Father, such and such is written in the Torah" - as if he is asking him, and not warning him. And he will understand on his own and will not be embarrassed. And if [the father] said a mistaken teaching, he should not say to him, "Do not teach it thus."
If his father said to him, "Give me water to drink," and there was another passing commandment before him to do, such as burying the dead or a funeral: If it is possible for the commandment to be done by others, he should occupy himself with the honor of his father. <i>But if he began the commandment first, he should finish it; as one who is occupied with a commandment is exempt from [another] commandment (Beit Yosef in the name of the Ran).</i> But if there are not others there to do [it], he should occupy himself with the commandment and leave the honor of his father. <i>(However if the time of the commandment is not passing, he should occupy himself with the honor of his father and do the commandment afterwards [Rabbenu Yerucham, Netiv A, in the name of the Rosh]).</i>
Torah study is greater than honoring father and mother.
If his father said to him, "Give me water to drink," and his mother said to him, "Give me water to drink" - he leaves his mother and occupies himself with the honor of his father. But if she is divorced from his father, they are both the same, so he can make first whoever he wants.
If his father said to him to transgress a Torah matter - whether a negative commandment or a positive commandment, and even a [rabbinic] commandment - he should not listen to him. 
If a father commands his son not to speak with x and not to forgive him until a set time; whereas the son wants to appease him immediately were it not for his father's command - he should not be concerned about his father's command. 
Both a man and a woman are the same regarding the honor and fear of father and mother. However a woman does not have [the wherewithal] in her hands to do [it], since she is bound to her husband. Therefore she is exempt from the honor of father and mother while she is still married. But if she is divorced or widowed, she is obligated. 
A <i>mamzer</i> (someone born of a forbidden union) is obligated in honoring his father and in his fear. Even if his father is wicked and sinful, he must honor him and fear him. <i>Gloss: And some say he is not obligated to honor his evil father unless he repented (Tur; Mordechai, Chapter Keitzad; and Hagahot Maimoni, Laws of Rebels, Chapter 6).</i>
It is forbidden [for the parent] to make his yoke heavy upon his children and to be exacting with them about his honor, so as not to bring them to an obstacle. Rather he should forgive and avert his eyes from them; since a father who foregoes his honor, his honor is forgiven.
They would excommunicate someone who strikes his adult son; as behold, he is transgressing, "you shall not put an obstacle in front of the blind" (Leviticus 19:14). <i>But regarding this, he is only called adult after he is twenty-two or twenty-four years old (In the Kuntrass, Kiddushin, Chapter 4; and Beit Yosef 334 at the end).</i>
A person is obligated to honor the wife of his father - even though she is not his mother - so long as his father is alive; and he is obligated to honor his mother's husband, so long as his mother is alive. But after [the blood relative's death], he is not obligated in their honor. Nevertheless, it is a proper thing to honor them, even after the death.
A person is obligated to honor his older brother, whether he is his brother from his father or whether he is his brother from his mother.<i> (And even if the younger one is a Torah scholar and greater in Torah than the older one.) (And so was it understood by him from the Responsa of the Rosh in the paragraph after [the one discussing the law above].) (B. Z.)</i>
An older brother who cursed and disgraced his brother who is a Torah scholar but younger than him; and the younger one excommunicated the older one, he did well to excommunicate him. For since he does not show favor to the Torah, 'he does not do the deeds of your people,' such that he is not obligated to honor him.
A person is obligated to honor his father-in-law. <i>Gloss: And some say that a person is not obligated to honor his grandfather, but this does not appear correct to me. Rather he is obligated in the honor of his father more than that of his grandfather (Maharik, Root 44). (And the proof is from the midrash regarding [Gen 46:1], "and he offered sacrifices [to the God of his father, Yitzchak]"). </i>
If a father wants to serve his son, it is permissible to accept [it] from him, unless the father is a Torah personality (<i>ben Torah</i>). A student who wants to go to another place since he is sure that he will see a sign of blessing in his learning in front of the teacher who is there - but his father protests to him, since he is worried that the idolaters in that city libel [the Jews] - does not need to listen to his father about this.<i>Gloss: And likewise, if a father protests [his] son marrying a certain woman whom the son wants, he does not need to listen to the father (Maharik, Root 167).</i>

18. If an outstanding young Chacham is with a very old moderate Chacham, regarding sitting in judgment or Torah, we seat the younger, greater Chacham at the head and he speaks first. At a drinking feast or wedding feast, we follow seniority and seat the oldest at the head. If the younger is an outstanding Chacham, and the elder is not so old, the Chacham always comes first. If the elder is exceedingly old, and the Chacham is not so outstanding, the elder always comes first, since he is somewhat Chacham. If neither is so Chacham or so old, the elder is first in every case.

<b> The Laws of Teaching Children Torah.</b> It is a positive commandment (mitzvas aseh) for a man to teach his son Torah. And if his father did not teach him, he is obligated to teach himself. <small>And see Siman 246, Se'if 6.</small>
If he himself needs to learn, and he has a son to teach, and he does not have the means to provide for both of them, if they are equal [in intellect], he precedes his son. But if his son is perceptive and comprehends what he learns more than he [the father] does, his son precedes him. Nevertheless, he should not neglect [his own studies]
Just as it is a mitzvah to teach one's son, so too it is a mitzvah to teach one's grandson, as it is stated: "And you shall make them known to your children and your children's children" (Devarim 4:9). And not only one's grandson, but it is a mitzvah upon every wise man in Israel to teach students, for they too are called "children." However, it is a mitzvah to give precedence to one's son over one's grandson, and one's grandson over the son of one's fellow.
One is obligated to hire a teacher (melamed) for his son, to teach him. But for the son of his fellow, he is not obligated to hire [a teacher].<small> [Rema]: And they compel him to hire a teacher for his son. And if he is not in the city, and he has assets, if it is possible to inform him, they inform him; and if not, they take possession of his assets and hire a teacher for his son. <small>(Hagahos Maimoni, Chapter 1 of Hilchos Talmud Torah, in the name of  Maimonides).</small> </small>
From when does one begin to teach his son? From the time he begins to speak, he begins to teach him, "Torah Tziva Lanu Moshe..." (Torah was commanded to us by Moshe…) (Devarim 33:4), and the first verse of the Shema (Devarim 6:4), and afterward he teaches him little by little, until he is six or seven years old, and then he takes him to a teacher of children (melamed tinokos).
 If it was the custom in the city that the teacher of children takes a fee, he is obligated to teach him for a fee until he reads the entire Written Torah (Torah Shebichsav). And he is not obligated to teach him, for a fee, Mishnah and Gemara (Talmud). And this only applies when it is not possible, for he is hard-pressed for time, but if it is possible for him, it is a mitzvah to teach him Mishnah and Gemara, Halachos, and Aggados.
 They establish teachers of children in every city. And any city that does not have a teacher of children, they excommunicate the people of the city until they establish a teacher of children. And if they did not establish [one], they destroy the city, for the world only exists because of the breath of the mouths of children in the schoolhouse. <small>And see Choshen Mishpat Siman 163, Se'if 3.</small>
 Children are brought in to learn at five full years of age, and fewer than that they are not brought in. And if he is weak, he is brought in at six full years of age. [Rema]: And nonetheless, immediately when he is three full years of age, they teach him the letters of the Torah, so that he will accustom himself to read in the Torah. <small>(The Rav Abarbanel (Rabbi Don Yitzchak ben Yehudah Abarbanel) in his commentary to Avos).</small>
  Even a child who does not understand how to read, they should not remove him from there but he should sit with the others; perhaps he will understand.
 The teacher should not strike him a blow of an enemy, cruel discipline, not with whips and not with a stick, but rather with a small strap.
  He sits and teaches them all day and a bit of the night, in order to train them to learn during the day and at night.
  They do not dismiss the children at all, except on Erev Shabbos and Erev Yom Tov at the end of the day.
  They do not dismiss the children, even for the building of the Temple.
  The children are not to read on Shabbos for the first time, something that they did not learn, due to the exertion of Shabbos. But what they read once, they may repeat it to them on Shabbos.
  Twenty-five children suffice for one teacher. If there were more than twenty-five, up to forty, another is appointed to assist him in their instruction. [Rema]: And even if the community hired a teacher for all the children without specification, he appoints another to assist at their expense, and they give him his fee. <small>(Nimukei Yosef, Perek Lo Yachpor).</small> And some say that if there are not twenty-five children in the city, the people of the city are not obligated to hire a teacher for them. <small>(Hagahos Maimoni, Chapter 2 of Hilchos Talmud Torah, and Tosafos (The Medieval commentaries on the Talmud) and Rabbi Yerucham).</small> And some say that even with fewer than this, they are obligated. <small>(Ibid. in Nimukei Yosef).</small> If there were more than forty, two are appointed.
  They take the child from one teacher to another teacher who is quicker than he, whether in Scripture (Mikra) or in grammar (dikduk). In what case is this said? When both of them were in one city and there is no river separating them. But from city to city, or from one side of the river to the other side in the same city, he is not taken, unless there was a bridge, a sound structure, that is not likely to fall quickly.
  A teacher of children who leaves the children and goes out, or who does other work with them, or who is lax in his teaching, he is included in the statement: "Cursed is he who does the work of Hashem deceitfully" (Yirmiyahu 48:10). Therefore, a teacher should not be appointed unless he is G-d fearing, quick to read, and precise in teaching. [Rema]: And a teacher should not stay up too late at night, so that he will not be lazy during the day to teach. And similarly, he should not fast, or abstain from food and drink, or eat and drink excessively, for all these things cause him not to be able to teach properly. And anyone who deviates, his hand is on the bottom and he is dismissed. <small>(Mordechai, Perek Ha'umanin from the Yerushalmi (The Jerusalem Talmud)).</small> And the rest of the laws of a teacher, see in Choshen Hamishpat Siman 334 and 335.
  If there is a teacher here who teaches children, and another comes who is better than he, they dismiss the first on account of the second.
  If there are two teachers here, one reads a lot and is not precise with them to make them understand properly, and one does not read so much, but is precise with them to make them understand, they take the one who is more precise.
 One who does not have a wife should not teach children, because their mothers bring their sons. And the teacher does not need his wife to be present with him in the schoolhouse, but rather she is in her house and he teaches in his place.
 A woman should not teach children, because of their fathers who bring their sons.
  One of the residents of a courtyard or the residents of an alleyway who sought to become a teacher of children, his neighbors cannot object to him. And similarly, a teacher of children whose colleague came and opened a house to teach children beside him, in order that other children should come to him or in order that the children who are with this one should come to that one, they cannot object to him, as it is stated: "Hashem desires, for the sake of His righteousness, that the Torah be made great and glorious" (Yeshayahu 42:21). [Rema]: A rabbi who sits in the city and teaches the masses, another sage can come and teach there as well, even if he somewhat cuts off the livelihood of the first, such as when the community accepted the first as their rabbi and takes a fee from them for this, even so, the second can come to reside there and to maintain authority in every matter, like the first, if he is great and fit for this. <small>(Mahari"v, Siman 151 and Mahara"i in his Psakim, Siman 158, see there the responsa of the great ones).</small> But if a visiting sage came to the city, he may not cut off the salary of the rabbi who resides there to perform weddings and to collect the fee that comes from them, since it is the salary of the resident rabbi; but he is permitted to perform the wedding and to give the fee to the established rabbi. And similarly, he is permitted to judge between two litigants in the city who come before him to judge, for perhaps the rabbi in the city is not suitable for them. But he may not teach matters of prohibition and permissibility, or to preach to act with authority, in the place of his fellow. <small>(Mahari"k, Shoresh 170 and Mahar"d in a responsa 22).</small> One who was established as a rabbi in the city, even if he established himself in some authority, he may not be removed from his greatness even though another came there who is greater than he. <small>(Rivash, Siman 271).</small> Even his son and his grandson forever precede others, as long as they fill the place of their fathers in piety and they are somewhat wise. <small>(Rambam, Chapter 1 of Hilchos Melachim).</small> And in a place where there is a custom to accept a rabbi for a set time, or that it is customary to choose whomever they desire, they have the authority, <small>(Kol Bo).</small> But anyone whom the community accepted upon themselves, and all the more so if they did so with the consent of the authority, no great one in the world may usurp authority over him and remove him. <small>(Ibid. in Rivash).</small>

Siman 246

<b>That Every Person is Obligated in Torah Study, and How One May Study for Payment. Containing 26 Sections:</b><br>Every Jewish man is obligated in studying Torah, whether poor or rich, whether completely healthy or suffering, whether young or very old. Even a poor man who frequents doorways (to beg) and even one with a wife and children is obligated to set a time for himself to study Torah, by day or by night, as it says, "And you shall meditate in it day and night." (And in a pressing time, even if he only read Shem"a in the morning or evening, it is called "It shall not be moved..." (HG"M 1 &amp; SM"G Asin 12). And one that it is impossible for him to learn because he does not know how to at all or because of troubles that he has, should support others who study. Haga"h: And it will be considered for him as if he learned himself (Tur) And a person is able to make a condition with his friend, that he will study Torah and he will support him, and he will split the reward with him. But if he already toiled in Torah, he is unable to sell him his portion for the money he will give to him. (TA"V? path 2  from Bavli Sotah)
A person should learn Torah first and then marry a woman, because if he married a woman first, it would be impossible for him to study Torah after with a millstone hanging around his neck. But if it is impossible for him to live without a wife because his inclination overpowers him, he should marry a woman first. 
Until when is one obligated to study? Until the day of one's death, as it is stated: "Lest they be removed from your heart, all the days of your life" (Deuteronomy 4:9). <small><small>(Deuteronomy 4:9)</small>.</small> And any time that one does not engage in Torah study, one forgets.
One is obligated to divide his learning schedule into thirds: one third in Written Torah; that is, the twenty-four [books of the Tanach]; one third in Mishna, that is, the Torah She'b'al Peh, and the explanations of the Written Torah are included herein; [and] one third to Talmud, that is understanding and conceptualizing the end of a matter from its beginnings... When does this apply? At the outset of ones learning; however, when one grows in Torah and no longer needs to learn the Written Torah nor needs to constantly review the Torah She'b'al Peh, he may read as fixed times the Written Torah and the words of Torah She'b'al Peh, so that he doesn't forget one thing from the laws of the Torah, and avail the rest of his days to Talmud alone, to the extent of his abilities and ability to focus. [Rema gloss]: There are those who say that through Talmud Bavli, which combines Written Torah, Mishna, and Talmud, one fulfills his obligations for all [of the above].... 
 In a place where it is customary to teach the Written Torah for payment, it is permitted to teach for payment. However, the Oral Torah is forbidden to be taught for payment. If one could not find someone to teach him for free, he should learn for payment. Even though he was required to learn for payment, he should not say, "Just as I learned for payment, so too will I teach for payment," rather, he should teach others for free. And the current custom to teach everything for payment is permitted if one does not have anything to support himself, and even if he does, if it is clear that the payment is for lost time, that one ceases all of his business and dealings, it is permitted. <small>And all innovations of the scribes, meaning what was instituted from the Rabbis, it is permitted to take payment to teach it. <small><small>(Hagahot Maimoni, Chapter 1)</small>.</small> </small>
A woman who studied Torah receives a reward, but not like that of a man, because she is not obligated yet performs the commandment. And even though she earns a reward, our rabbis have commanded that one should not teach his daughter Torah, because the majority of women are not intellectual prepared to be taught, and remove words of Torah to words of emptiness due to their intellectual limitations. The rabbis said: One who teaches his daughter Torah is as if he taught her frivolity. When is this stated? In regard to the oral Torah. However, in regard to the written Torah one should preferably not teach her, but if he did so it is not comparable to frivolity. Rema: Nonetheless, a woman is obligated to study laws that are relevant to her. And a woman is not obligated to teach her son Torah. Nonetheless, if she assists her son or husband to study Torah, she receives reward along with them. 
One should not teach a student who is not fit; rather, one should return him to the good, guide him in a straight path, and examine him, and afterward bring him into the study hall (beit midrash) and teach him.
 A rabbi who does not walk in a good path, even though he is a great scholar and all the people need him, one should not learn from him until he returns to the good.
How do we teach? The rabbi sits at the head, and the students are before him, surrounding him like a crown, so that they all see the rabbi and hear his words. The rabbi should not sit on a chair with his students on the ground; rather, either everyone is on the ground or everyone is on chairs. <small>[Rema]: And some say that this is specifically when the students have reached the level of ordination. <small><small>(Haran, Chapter 2 of Megillah)</small>.</small> And a rabbi who teaches through an interpreter, his rulings will be explained later, and they were not written by the rabbi because they are not common.</small>
 A rabbi who taught, and the students did not understand should not be angry with them; rather, he should review and repeat the matter many times until they understand the depth of the halacha. The student should not say, "I understand," when he does not understand; rather, he should ask and repeat and ask many times. If his rabbi is angry with him, he should say to him, "Rabbi, it is Torah, and I need to learn, and my understanding is limited."
A student should not be embarrassed before his fellow students who learned the material the first or second time when he did not learn it even after many times, for if he is embarrassed because of this, he will be found entering and exiting the study hall without having learned anything. Therefore, the Sages said, "The bashful one cannot learn, nor can the impatient one teach." What are these things referring to? When the students did not understand the matter because of its depth or because their understanding is limited. But if it is apparent to the rabbi that they are negligent in the words of Torah and are lax about them, and therefore they do not understand, he is obligated to be angry with them and to shame them with words in order to sharpen them. Regarding this, the Sages said, "Throw bitterness among the students." Therefore, it is not proper for a rabbi to engage in levity before the students, nor to joke before them, nor to eat and drink with them, so that his fear will be upon them and they will learn from him quickly.
One should not ask the rabbi immediately upon his entrance to the study hall until his mind is settled. The student should not ask upon his entrance until he sits and rests. Two people should not ask at once. One should not ask the rabbi about a different topic, but only about the topic that they are dealing with, so that he not be embarrassed. The rabbi is permitted to mislead the students with his questions and with the actions that he does before them in order to sharpen them and in order to know if they remember what they are learning. It goes without saying that he has permission to ask them about a different topic that they are not dealing with in order to motivate them.
One should not ask while standing, and one should not answer while standing. <small>And some say that when one asks a matter of halacha, one needs to stand. <small><small>(Tosafot, Chapter Pesulei HaMukdashin, in the name of the Yerushalmi)</small>.</small> </small> One should not ask from a high place, nor from a distance, nor from behind the elders. One should only ask about the topic at hand. One should only ask out of fear. One should not ask more than three halachot about the topic.
If two people asked, one asked about the topic at hand and one asked not about the topic at hand, we address the one about the topic at hand. [If one asked about] a practical matter and [one asked about] a non-practical matter, we address the practical matter. [If one asked about] halacha and midrash, we address the halacha. [If one asked about] midrash and aggadah, we address the midrash. [If one asked about] aggadah and a kal vachomer (a fortiori argument), we address the kal vachomer. [If one asked about] a kal vachomer and a gezeirah shavah (verbal analogy), we address the kal vachomer.
If the ones asking were one a sage (chacham) and one a Torah scholar (talmid chacham), we address the sage. [If one was a] Torah scholar and one an am ha'aretz (ignoramus), we address the Torah scholar. [If] both were sages, both were students, both were amei ha'aretz, [and] they asked two people about two halachot, or about two questions, two answers, two practical matters, the prerogative is in the hand of the one answering; to whomever he wants, he may give precedence. <small>A mamzer (a child born of an illicit relationship) who is a Torah scholar takes precedence over a High Priest who is an am ha'aretz. <small><small>(The language of the Tur in the name of the Sages)</small>.</small> </small>
One should not sleep in the study hall. Anyone who dozes in the study hall, his wisdom becomes torn into pieces, as it says, "Slumber will clothe one in rags" (Proverbs 23:21). <small><small>(Proverbs 23:21)</small>.</small>
One should not converse in the study hall except about matters of Torah. Even one who sneezed, one should not say to him, "Refuah" (Bless you), in the study hall. The sanctity of the study hall is more stringent than the sanctity of a synagogue.
Torah study is weighed against all the commandments. If one has before him the performance of a mitzvah and Torah study, if it is possible for the mitzvah to be performed by others, he should not interrupt his study. If not, he should perform the mitzvah and return to his Torah.
The first judgment of a person is regarding Torah study, and afterward regarding his other actions.
A person should always engage in Torah, even if not for its own sake (shelo lishmah), for from not for its own sake comes for its own sake (lishmah).
The words of Torah are not upheld in one who makes himself lax about them, nor in those who learn amidst luxury and amidst eating and drinking, but rather in one who kills himself over it and constantly afflicts his body, and does not give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids. <small>[Rema]: A person should not think to engage in Torah and to acquire wealth and honor along with the learning, for one who raises this thought in his heart will not merit the crown of Torah; rather, he should make his Torah fixed and his work occasional, and minimize business and engage in Torah. He should remove the pleasures of the time from his heart and do work each day as much as he needs to sustain himself if he does not have what to eat, and the rest of the day and night he should engage in Torah. There is a great virtue for one who supports himself from the labor of his hands, as it says, "If you eat the labor of your hands" etc. <small><small>(Psalms 128:2)</small>.</small> Anyone who resolves in his heart to engage in Torah and not to do work and to be supported by charity, this person profanes the Name and disgraces the Torah, for it is forbidden to benefit from the words of Torah. Any Torah that is not accompanied by work leads to sin and in the end he will steal from people. <small><small>(The language of the Tur)</small>.</small> All of this is regarding a healthy person who is able to work in his craft or in some other way to sustain himself, <small><small>(Rabbeinu Yonah and Rabbeinu Yerucham, Nativ 2, and so wrote the Rama)</small>,</small> but an elderly person or a sick person is permitted to benefit from his Torah and to be supported. <small><small>(According to everyone)</small>.</small> And some say that even a healthy person is permitted. <small><small>(Beit Yosef in the name of a responsa of Rashbatz)</small>.</small> Therefore, it is the custom in all places of Israel that the rabbi of a city has an income and support from the people of the city so that he will not need to engage in work before people and the Torah will be disgraced before the masses. <small><small>(Abarbanel in his commentary on Tractate Avot)</small>.</small> And this is only regarding a sage who needs this, but a wealthy person is forbidden. And some are even more lenient, saying that it is permitted for a sage and his students to receive support from those who give in order to uphold the hands of those who study Torah, for through this they are able to engage in Torah with ease. However, one who is able to support himself well from the work of his hands and to engage in Torah, this is the way of piety and a gift from God, but this is not the way of every person, for it is not possible for every person to engage in Torah and to become wise in it and to support himself. <small><small>(This is also in the aforementioned responsa)</small>.</small> And all of this that is permitted is when one takes a stipend from the community or a set support, but one should not accept gifts from people. And regarding that which we say, "Anyone who brings a gift to a sage, it is as if he is offering first fruits," this is regarding small gifts, for it is the way of people to bring a small gift to an important person, even if he is an am ha'aretz. <small><small>(Rabbeinu Yerucham in the name of Rabbeinu Yonah)</small>.</small> It is permitted for a Torah scholar to taste something from his ruling in order to clarify his ruling, but to take a substantial gift because of what he permitted is forbidden. <small><small>(Hagahot Ashri, Chapter 1 of Avodah Zarah)</small>.</small> "One who makes illicit use of the crown (of Torah) passes away." <small><small>(Hagahot Maimoni and Semag)</small>.</small> And some say that this is one who makes use of names (i.e., performs miracles with Divine Names). <small><small>(Ibid. in the name of Avot D'Rabbi Natan)</small></small> It is permitted for a Torah scholar to make himself known in a place where they do not know him <small><small>(In Nedarim 62a, Semag, Hagahot Maimoni ibid., and Responsa of Rashba 84)</small>,</small> if he needs to do so.</small>
 There is a covenant that anyone who learns in a synagogue does not quickly forget, and anyone who toils in his studies in private becomes wise, as it is said, "Wisdom is with the modest" (Proverbs 11:2). <small><small>(Proverbs 11:2)</small>.</small> Anyone who raises his voice during his studies, it is upheld in his hand. But one who reads silently quickly forgets.
One who wants to merit the crown of Torah should be careful in all of his nights and not waste even one of them in sleep, eating, drinking, conversation, and the like, but rather in words of wisdom and Torah study. <small>[Rema]: For a person does not learn most of his wisdom except at night. <small><small>(The language of the Tur from Rambam)</small>.</small> A person should begin to learn at night from the 15th of Av onward, and one who does not add, will cease. <small><small>(Noda BiYehudah, Chapter Yesh Nochelin, Talmud and Rashbam there, 121b, and the end of Ta'anit, see there)</small>.</small> </small>
Any house in which the words of Torah are not heard at night, fire will consume it.
Anyone who is able to engage in Torah and does not engage, or who read and learned and then turned to the vanities of the world and abandoned his studies and left it, this person is included in "For he has despised the word of the Lord" (Numbers 15:31). <small><small>(Numbers 15:31)</small>. <small>It is forbidden to speak idle chatter.</small> <small>(Hagahot Maimoni, Chapter 4, in the name of the Sages)</small>. <small>See Orach Chayim, Siman 307, Se'if 16.</small> </small>
Anyone who abandons the Torah due to wealth, in the end will abandon it due to poverty. Anyone who fulfills the Torah in poverty, in the end will fulfill it in wealth. <small>[Rema]: When one completes a tractate, it is a mitzvah to rejoice and to make a meal, and it is called a seudat mitzvah (a meal associated with a mitzvah). <small><small>(Noda BiYehudah, Chapter Yesh Nochelin, and a statement of Abaye, Chapter Kol Kitvei)</small>.</small> It is forbidden to engage in words of Torah in filthy places, and therefore they said that it is forbidden for a Torah scholar to stand in filthy places, lest he contemplate words of Torah. <small><small>(Clearly, Chapter Mi SheMet)</small>.</small> However, it is permitted to enter a bathhouse even while thinking about a halacha that is not a verse, <small><small>(Terumat HaDeshen 41)</small></small> and we are not concerned that he will contemplate, for in the bathhouse he guards himself from contemplating Torah. <small><small>(The opinion of the rabbi, and not like the conclusion of Terumat HaDeshen, which is uncertain about this)</small>.</small> </small>

Siman 247

It is a positive commandment to give tzedakah according to the achieving hand [within reach, how much you can afford], and a few times we were commanded about it in the form of positive commandment. And there is a negative commandment in one who turns his eyes away, as it is said: “You shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand” (Devarim 15:7). And all who avert their eyes are called wicked, and it’s as if their worship is idol worship. And much so one is to be cautious about it, because it is possible that it will lead to bloodshed, that poor person who asks will die if there is none giving to his hand, like the story of Naham Ish Gamzu. 

All the ones that are merciful to the poor, the Holy One Blessed Be He is merciful to them. RaMA Note: And the man should take it to heart that he should request every hour of his livelihood from the Holy One Blessed Be He, and like that he requests of this from the HKBH, so should he hear the pleas of poor men. Also he takes it to heart that what goes around comes around in the world, and end of the man that will come him or his son or his grandson are the ones in this state, and all the mercy he has shown to others, the Merciful one will have upon him. 
Charity dispels harsh decrees and famine (&amp;) saves from death as happened at Zarephath: Gloss: (RAMA) This is referring to tithing and one should not test God except in this regard as it was said {Malachi 3,10} "And try Me now herewith" [with tithing] (Tur from the last chapter of Gemara Tanit), and there are those who say that specifically in regards to giving tithes [on produce from Israel] is it allowed to test the Holy One Blessed be His name, but not in regards to other forms of charity. (The Bais Yosef seems to hold this way from Shas there):

Siman 248

Every person if obligated to give charity, even a pauper who is reliant on charity is obligated to give from what is given to him. One who gives less than what is fit for (him) to give, the court would force him and whip him lashes of rebellion until he gives what they evaluated he should give. They go to his property in his presence and take what is fit for him to give. 


The enforcer of Tzedakah doesn’t receive from the women, and from the slaves and from children, only a little thing, but not a big thing because the assumption is that it was robbed or burgled from others. And even many little things were there, everything according to the tithes of the owners and their poor. And where do these words derive anonymously, but if the owner protests, even all that he is forbidden to receive from him. 

A son that eats next to his father and a slave that eats with his master, gives a slice a bread to the poor or to the son of his close friend and he doesn’t worry about thieving, such has been the behavior of the owners of the house. 

Siman 249

The amount one should give [is as follows]. If one can afford it, he should give according to the needs of the poor. If one can not afford so much, he should give up to a fifth of his wealth - that is the best [way of performing] the mitzvah. A medium way is to give a tenth. Less than that is stingy. Giving a fifth that was referred to, means from one's overall assets the first year, and from then on giving one's profits annually. NOTE: "A person should not give more than a fifth so he should not be dependent on others. This is during his lifetime, but when he is about to pass away he can give as much charity as he wishes. A person should not use his charity to perform mitzvot such as [giving] candles to the synagogue etc., but he should give it to the poor."
A person should never give less than a third of a shekel annually. If he gives less than that he has not fulfilled the commandment of charity. 
Charity should be given with a pleasant countenance, with happiness and good-heartedly, sympathizing with the poor person over his plight and speaking comforting words to him. If someone gives with an angry and scowling face he has lost his merit.
If a poor person requests [charity] and he has nothing to give him, he should not rebuke him and raise his voice, but say appeasing words and show good-heartedly that he would like to give but that he just can not afford to. NOTE: "It is forbidden to turn away a request empty-handed. He can even give the smallest amount, as it says 'Do not let the oppressed retreat disgraced.'"
Someone who can make others give has greater reward than someone who [just] gives.
There are eight ascending levels of charity. The highest possible level is to support a fellow Jew who is descending into poverty by giving him a present, or loan, or by making him a partner, or by finding him work so he should not need other people's help and does not have to request. About this it says "You should support him."
A lower level than this is to give charity to a poor person whereby the giver unaware of the [identity of the] recipient and the recipient is unaware of the [identity of the] giver. Similar to this is giving to a charitable fund. A person should only give to a charity fund if he knows that the trustee [responsible for the fund] is reliable and knows how to run it properly. 
A lower level than this is when the giver knows to whom he is giving, and the poor person does not know from whom he is receiving. For example the great sages would walk around concealing themselves and deposit money at the entrances of the poor . It is fitting to act this way and it is a good practice if the trustees of charitable [funds] do not act responsibly.

Siman 250

How much do we give to the poor person? As much as his lack which he is lacking. How is this? [If] he was hungry, he should feed him. [If] he was needing clothing, he should clothe him. [If] he does not have household items, he should buy him household items. And even if it was his way to ride on a horse and [had] a servant to run in front of him when he was rich - and he became poor - he should buy him a horse and a servant. And so [too] with each and every one, according to what he needs. To the one to whom it is fitting to give bread, we give bread; to the one to whom it is fitting to give dough, we give dough;  a bed, we give a bed; to the one to whom it is fitting to give warm bread, warm bread; cool [bread], cool [bread]; to feed him into his mouth, we feed. If he doesn't have a wife and wants to marry, we [help] him get married - and we rent him a house and set up his bed and the vessels that he will [need] to use, and then we [help] him marry. Gloss (Ramah): And it appears that all of this is with regards to a charity administrator or the [whole] community together; but an individual is not obligated to give to a poor person as much as his lack. Rather he makes known his trouble publicly; and if there is no community with him, the individual gives if he has the ability (Beit Yosef, and not like the implication of Tur), and as is elucidated in Section 249.

Siman 251



One who gives his non-minor sons and daughters, whom he is not obligated to feed, in order to teach the sons Torah and to direct the daughters on the straight path, and so one who gives gifts to his father and they need them, behold this is in the category of tzedakah.  And not only that, but he is required to give [the relative] precedence over others.  And even if it is not his son or father, but a relative, he must give him precedence to all others.  And his paternal brother takes precedence over his maternal brother.  And the poor of his household take precedence over the poor of his city; and the poor of his city take precedence over the poor of another city.  (so is found in the Sma”g and Sma”k and Tur) <small>Gloss:  Those who are fixed in a city are called the poor of that city, and they take precedence to other poor people who come there from elsewhere (Tur, unlike R”Y son of Baruch).</small>  The residents of Israel take precedence to the residents of the diaspora. <small>Gloss:  Supporting himself takes precedence over everyone, and he is not obligated to give tzedakah until he has his own sustenance, and afterwards he prioritizes the support of his father and mother, if they are poor, and they take precedence to sustaining his sons.  And afterwards, his sons, and they take precedence to his brothers, and they take precedence to other relatives, and relatives take precedence to neighbors, and neighbors to the people of the city, and the people of his city to the people of another city.  And the same is true if they were taken captive and he needed to redeem them  (This is all in the Tur)</small>



One must prioritize feeding the hungry over clothing the naked.
A man and a woman who came to ask for food, we give precedence to the woman over the man.  And so if they came to ask for clothing.  And so if male and female orphans came to get married, they give precedence to the female orphan to marry her off..

One who comes and says, 'feed me,' we don't check whether they are being deceitful, rather feed them immediately. If there was someone naked who came and said, 'clothe me,' we do check whether they are being deceitful. But if we know them,we clothe them immediately.

Siman 252




One is not to obtain the release of captives using money more than their value, to keep a normal state of matters, so that the enemies [=the government officials] do not kidnap more so as to gain more money. However, a person may redeem <b> himself </b> with as much money as he wants. A scholar  of Torah and even a sharp student who is only destined to become a scholar of Torah may be redeemed [even with over paying.] <i> (And for if one's wife counts as a separate individual: see the Tur Even Haezer 78.) </i>

Siman 253


There are this who say that these amounts were only stated for their own day, however, at this time a person may receive until they have enough that a person and his family can be sustained on its profits. Thee words are sensible.

A person should not give all of his charity (lit., monies) to just one poor person.
One who distributes charity must take care not to favor (lit., increase towards) his relatives more than other people. Rem"a: [This law applies] particularly to a <i>Gabbai</i> [distributors of communal charity], but everyone may give their charity or their <i>Ma'aser</i> to whomever from their relatives, and they take precedence as was explained above in Siman 251 (Mordechi First Chapter of Bava Batra)

Siman 264

א Everyone is kosher perform circumcision even a slave, a woman, a child and an uncircumcised Jew whose brother had died from circumcision. But if there is an adult male Jew that knows how to perform circumcision he gets precedence over them all. And there are those who say that a woman does not circumcise סמק והנהות מרדכי and this is our custom to beautify with a male but an Idol worshiper even if does the circumcision the circumcision is not a circumcision. But if an Idol worshiper circumcises, one does not need to go and perform the circumcision a second time. 

How do we circumcise? We cut the foreskin, all of the skin covering the crown, until the crown is revealed. Then we split the soft membrane below the skin with the fingernail and bring it back to this side and to that side until the flesh of the crown is revealed. And then we suck the circumcision until the blood leaves the extremities in order that it not present a danger. And we relieve any mohel (ritual circumciser) who does not do the sucking. And after he has sucked, we put a compress or a bandage on it, or  medicinal powder that stops the blood. <i>Gloss</i> But he must be careful if the compress has a rim that he turn it outwards, and not inwards, so that it not stick to the wound and present a danger. (Rabbenu Yerucham, Section 1)

Siman 265



Siman 266

<b>What circumcision overrides Shabbat and Festivals. And it has 14 sections:</b> <br>Circumcision, whether at the proper time or not, overrides the concern for a tzaraat (leprosy-like) affliction. Even if there is a bright spot on the skin of the foreskin, and cutting that spot would violate the prohibition of "You shall not make a cutting in your flesh," it is still cut together with the foreskin. However, if after the circumcision, flesh grows over the circumcision wound to the point that it no longer appears circumcised, and that new flesh needs to be cut away - if there is a bright spot on that new flesh, it is forbidden to cut it, since the child no longer needs to undergo another circumcision except by rabbinic decree.
Circumcision overrides the festival and Shabbat when done at the proper time, but not when done at an improper time. Even when done at the proper time, only the circumcision itself, the uncovering, and the tearing away of the remaining membrane are permitted to override Shabbat. Even if the mohel only partially removes the remaining membrane that covers most of the crown in one area, which renders it invalid, he may return to complete it. However, any remaining membrane that does not invalidate the circumcision - if he did not initially remove it, he may not go back, but they may apply an adhesive bandage. <small>Note: It is permitted to move the circumcision implements after the circumcision to store them in the courtyard shared by multiple dwellings, even though they are no longer needed that Shabbat, since they were not set aside as muktzeh before Shabbat, having been needed on that Shabbat. (This permissibility of moving them is written in the Toldot Adam VeChava, Pathway 1, and the reasoning is that of the author of the Shulchan Arukh, contrary to Maharil).</small>However, the implements themselves do not override Shabbat since they could have been prepared beforehand. Therefore, one may not make a knife for circumcising, nor bring it from place to place, nor even take it out of the house [and bring it] through rooftops, courtyards and alleyways that were not included in the eiruv. However, if the knife was forgotten on a roof or courtyard, it is permitted to bring it from one to the other, even if the courtyards were combined with the houses in an eiruv.
One may not grind spices, nor heat water, nor make an adhesive bandage, nor mix wine and oil. If no cumin was ground before Shabbat, he may chew it with his teeth. If no wine and oil were mixed before Shabbat, he may place them separately for himself. One may not make a garment for the child, but may wrap it in a rag. If nothing was prepared before Shabbat, he may wrap it in a piece of cloth from his garment and bring it, even from another courtyard that was not included in the eiruv.
If a child was circumcised on Shabbat and then the bandage scattered, it may be re-bandaged on Shabbat due to the danger to the child. (Regarding bathing the child before or after circumcision, see Tur Orach Chaim 331).
If a knife was forgotten and not brought before Shabbat, one may instruct a non-Jew to bring a knife on Shabbat, provided he does not carry it through a public domain. In general, anything whose performance on Shabbat is prohibited due to shevut (rabbinic prohibitions), we may instruct a non-Jew to do in order to perform a mitzvah at its proper time. But anything whose performance on Shabbat is prohibited for us due to a biblical prohibition of labor, we may not instruct a non-Jew to do on Shabbat.
All the preparations that do not override Shabbat also do not override the festival, except for grinding cumin on the festival since it is fit for a pot, and also mixing wine and oil.
A person who has never performed a circumcision should not do so on Shabbat, lest he make a mistake and end up desecrating Shabbat. However, if he has already performed a circumcision once before, he is permitted to do so on Shabbat, even if it is his own son (Terumat HaDeshen 245, disagreeing with Rabbi Eliezer cited in the Tur).
8. Someone who was born at twilight where it is doubtful [if it is still] day and doubtful [if it is already] night, we count from the night and do the Bris on the 9th, which is Safek the eighth day. And if he is born Erev Shabbos at twilight it does not supersede [the laws of] Shabbos because we do not supersede Shabbos because of a doubt. And likewise we do not supersede Yom Tov because of a doubt, and even the second day of Yom Tov in Galus [outside Israel]. (Tur, this is in the name of the Teshuvot HaRosh). Even if his only his head emerged at twilight and the rest of him emerged on Shabbos we do not perform the Bris on Shabbos. 
Seif 9 – About the measuring of twilight, the Tannaim and the Amoraim disagree at the end of the chapter “Bameh Madlikin” [the second chapter of Shabbat]. The Ba’al HaIttur wrote that there is doubt for us regarding whom the halakhah is like; therefore, if the head of the child was coming out from sunset, there is doubt until twilight according to R. Yose is completed, and the child is circumcised on the 10th day. If the child was born Saturday night from sunset on, we follow the stringency of Rabba. 
A child born already circumcised, someone with two foreskins, an androgynous person, an unusual birth, and a child born to a mother who did not immerse before giving birth - even though they are circumcised on the eighth day, they do not override Shabbat. (A tumtum - an intersex individual - who is found to be male after being examined, is circumcised on Shabbat according to Maimonides and Rosh, though some prohibit it) (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rif and Rabbi Yerocham).
One born in the seventh month is circumcised on Shabbat even if his hair and nails are not fully developed. But one born in the eighth month is not circumcised on Shabbat unless his hair and nails are fully developed. The same applies to a doubt whether he is seven or eight months - he is not circumcised on Shabbat unless his hair and nails are fully developed. <small>Note: Some say we do circumcise him since he may be seven months old, but we do not violate Shabbat for anything else related to his care (Semag, and this seems to be the view of the Rif, Rosh and Tur). And this seems to me to be the proper ruling.</small>
A Jew who converted and had a son from a Jewish woman - the son is circumcised on Shabbat.
A Jew who had a son from a non-Jewish woman - the son is not circumcised on Shabbat.
One must be careful that two mohels do not perform one circumcision on Shabbat, where one does the cutting and the other does the uncovering. Rather, the one who circumcises should also do the uncovering himself. <small>Note: I did not find a source for his words, and on the contrary it seems permissible to me, since circumcision overrides Shabbat like the Temple service where multiple kohanim would perform labor and violate Shabbat. Since Shabbat can be overridden, it is considered like a weekday for this purpose. I also found this explicitly permitted in an ancient manuscript of the Sefer HaTerumah written on parchment at the end of the laws of Shabbat. However, I found in a anthology that there is an opinion to prohibit it, and therefore it is good to be stringent initially, although according to the law it seems to me as I have written. (Contrary to the Beit Yosef).</small>

Siman 267



A Slave that was purchased from an idolater, we tell him: Do you wishe to enter and join the slaves of Israel and become acceptable or not? If he agrees we inform him of the fundamentals of the faith, some of the minor commandments and some of the more severe ones and punishments and rewards, like we do with a convert. Then we immerse him like we do with a convert and inform him while he is in the water. [And the slave recites the blessing over the immersion, not the master.]

Siman 268

A convert that enters to join to [the] jewish people is obligated in circumcision. If he was already circumcised when he was a Idol worshipper <i> or he was born circumcised (the Tur quoting the Rosh)</i>, its necessary to draw blood from it and not bless on it (the circumcision).And If the organ was destroyed , [the fact that] there isn't circumcision [does not prevent him] from converting and its enough for him [to convert] through immersion [alone]. <i> [If] he immerses before he is circumcised, it is effective, that afther the fact he was immersed</i>  and there are those who say that he [the convert] doesn't have to immerse [due to the circumstances].
When a person comes to convert, say to him, "What did you see that motivated you to come to convert? If you know that Israel, in this time, that the Jewish people are oppressed, eroded, <i>(The words are from "Why is your strong one overthrown?" -Jer. 46:15)</i> insane, and suffering. If he says, I know this and I will still become a part of your people, receive him immediately and tell him the principles of the faith, that God is one and idol worship is forbidden, and tell him a lot about this, and teach him a few of the lighter mitzvot and a few of the more stringent mitzvot, and teach him about some of the punishments of the mitzvot, as it says, "Before you came to learn this, if you ate the forbidden fat, you would not be punished with excommunication, you transgressed Shabbat and you were not punished with stoning; but now, if you eat forbidden food, you will be punished with excommunication; and if you transgress Shabbat you will be punished with stoning." Don't say too much about this, and don't get too specific either. And when you teach him about the punishment of the mitzvot, also teach him about the rewards of the mitzvot and teach him that in the doing of certain mitzvot that will merit life in the world to come. There isn't a complete righteous person, rather a master of wisdom, that does the mitzvot and understands them. And say to him: "You should know that the world to come is hidden from the righteous, who are Israel. As for what you see that Israel is in distress in this world, because it is not granted them to receive the abundance of good things in this world like other peoples, lest their hearts should be indulged loftily and they should go astray and squander the reward of the world to come. But God didn't bring to them too much destruction, so that they would not observe. Rather, all of the idolators stand. And you explicate this idea so that he feels the dearness of it. If he receives this, circumcise him immediately and wait until he is fully healed, and afterwards, immerse him without a barrier. <i>(Some say that you cut or shave his hair and you cut his fingernails and his toenails before immersion.)</i> And three learned scholars stand at his back and teach him some of the light mitzvot and some of the more stringent mitzvot a second time, and he stands in the water. And if it is a woman, women sit her in the water up to her neck and the beit din is outside and they teach her some of the easy mitzvot and some of the more stringent mitzvot and she sits in the water and afterwards, she immerses before them and they turn their faces and leave in order that they do not see her when she is getting out of the water, and they bless the immersion after she comes out of the water. And once he has immersed, it is as if he is a Jew, but if he goes astray, he is like an apostate Jew - he is still sanctified, and his marriage is sanctified.
All matters of the convert from making known to them the mitzvot, receiving them, the circumcision and the immersion, it must be with three who are fitting to judge, and during the day. But after the fact if he only was circumcised or immersed at night or in front of [the convert’s] relatives [which is invalid], or even if one did not dunk with the intention of conversion, rather a man who dunked for a seminal emission, or a woman who dunked for menstruation, they are still converts and he is permitted to [marry] an Israelite woman. So this all applies to the immersion and the circumcision but it does not apply to receiving the mitzvot, which prevents [conversion] unless it was during the day and in front of three [witnesses]. However, the Rif and the Rambam [say that] even after the fact [one who] immersed or was circumcised before two [witnesses] or at night prevents [conversion], and [marrying] an Israelite woman is forbidden. But, if he is married to an Israelite woman and she has borne him a son, we do not invalidate him [the son].
Since the ritual of immersion of a convert needs a beis din of three, do not immerse him on Shabbat and not on yom tov and not during the night. But if he immerses [during these times], indeed this [individual] is a [proper] convert.
One who circumcises a convert blesses, “Blessed are You, Eternal our God, Ruler of the Universe, who sanctifies us with Your mitzvot and commands us to circumcise converts.” And afterwards bless, "Blessed are You, Eternal our God, Ruler of the Universe, who sanctifies us with Your mitzvot and commands us to circumcise converts and to draw from the blood of the covenant.” Were it not for the blood of the covenant the heaven and earth would not be able to stand, as it says “Were it not for my brit, day and night, I would not have placed the laws of heaven and earth.” (Jeremiah 33:25)
[If] a non-Jewish woman comes to convert and she is pregnant, her child does not need to be immersed [after the child is born].
A minor who is an idol worshipper, if he has a [living] father, the father can convert him [i.e. present him to be converted]. And if he does not have a father and he comes to convert, or if his mother brings him to convert, a beit din can convert him, because it’s a merit to him, and we can give a merit to [the child] outside of his presence [because he is a minor and has no legal capacity]. Whether he is a minor who is converted on behalf of his father, or whether he was converted by a beit din [in the absence of a father], when he is older he can protest his conversion - we don’t treat him the way we would treat an adult convert- he is not like an apostate Jew, rather like an idol worshipper.
And what is this talking about? [A converted minor] may not act in accordance with the practices of Israel until they become an adult; but as soon as one becomes an adult and acts in accordance with the practices of Israel, he can no longer protest [his conversion].
An idol worshipper who comes to cut his foreskin due to an affliction or due to boils that appears out of nowhere, it is forbidden for Israel to cut, because there is no intention towards it as a mitzvah. If, rather, the idol worshipper intends for this to be a circumcision, it is a mitzvah for Israel to circumcise him. <i>(And there are some places in which it is allowed for one to heal the idol worshipper, then it is permitted in every circumstance. - Nivukei Yosef)</i>
[One who was previously known to have been] a male or female non-Jew, who comes and says, “I was appropriately converted by a beit din of So-and-So," they still should not be believed to come to the congregation [get married] until the witnesses [of the beit din] come. But if you see them behaving in customs worthy in the way of Israel and they do all of the mitzvot, they are presumed to be righteous converts, in spite of the fact that there were no witnesses to bear witness about who converted them. And if this is the case, if they come to mix [marry] into Israel, do not marry them until the witnesses come, or until they are immersed before us, since they initially had a known status as idol worshippers. However, one [whose status was never known] who comes and says that she is an idol worshipper and was converted by a beit din, believe her, for the mouth that forbids [and admits, “I am an idol worshipper” when she didn’t have to] is the mouth that permits [and says “but I was converted by a beit din.”]. And the Rambam writes that this ruling only applied in former days, and even then, only in the land of Israel, but outside the land one needs to bring evidence before he can marry an Israelite - because [the Sages] enhanced the strictures when it came to lineages [in Jewish communities outside Israel]. 
A man who is presumed to be Jewish and says, "I converted myself, alone”: if he has children, his testimony is not believed about his children [to annul their Jewish status], but you do believe the father to confirm his own status as a "forbidden portion," and [by dint of his own admission] he becomes forbidden from marrying an Israelite woman until he is immersed before a beit din.
When a [potential] convert comes to convert check after him, perhaps it is because of money he took, or because of power she will gain, or because of fear that [the pontential convert] is coming to enter the religion.  And if he is a man, check after him perhaps he placed his eyes on a Jewish woman.  And if she is a woman, check after her perhaps she placed her eyes on the single men of Israel.  And if you do not find to them [such] a cause, inform them of the weight of the yoke of the Torah, and the  difficulty of fulfilling it on the nations of the world in order that [the potential converts] leave.  If they accept and do not leave, and you see them that they are returning out of love, accept them.  And if you did not check after him or you did not inform him of the rewards of the commandments and their punishments, and he was circumcised and immersed before three ordinary people, this is a convert.  Even if you are informed that it is because of some thing (like those discussed above) that he converted, since he was circumcised and immersed he has left the category of Idol Worshippers (i.e. Non-Jews), and we are worried for him until his righteousness is clarified.  And even if he returns and serves Idols, he is like an apostate Israelite that his marriages are marriages.  [Rama]: An apostate Israelite that repents does not need to immerse.  Just that rabbinically he should immerse and accept words of joining (strict observance) before three. 

Siman 269

It is biblical law that it is permitted for a convert to marry his mother, or his sister from his mother that converted. Yet the sages prohibited this so that they wouldn't say: we came from stricter holiness to lenient holiness. So too a convert who slept with his mother or sister and she is still a gentile, it is as if he slept with an Aramean. 

Siman 270

1) [There is] a Positive Commandment on every Jewish man to copy a Torah Scroll for himself. Even if his ancestors bequeathed one to him, he is still commanded to copy [a scroll] of his own. He is not permitted to sell it [a Torah Scroll] even if he owns many Torah Scrolls.  ([This stands] even if he does not have what to eat.  [A Torah Scroll can be sold] only under the most dire circumstance)(Haghoth Maimoni Chapter 6). Even selling an old [Torah Scroll] in order to buy a new [Torah Scroll] is forbidden. However [if the scroll is sold in order to acquire funds] to study Torah or to marry a woman the sale is permitted if the seller has nothing else to sell. Note: For redeeming Jewish captives it is permitted to sell [a Torah Scroll] (See Tosfoth Bava Bathra chapter 1 beginning with "ואגודה שם", and Orah hayim 153). [If] he hired a scribe to copy a Torah Scroll for him or [If] he bought [a Torah Scroll] with copying errors and he proofread it, it is as if he copied [the Torah Scroll] himself (Beith Yosef quoting Nimukei Yosef).  However [if] he bought it as is [with errors] and did not proofread it at all, it is like he abducted a Mitzva from the market and he does not fulfill his obligation [of copying a Torah Scroll] (Tur quoting Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from Menahoth chapter 2)   
2) Nowadays the commandment is to copy the five books of Moses, the Mishna, and the Talmud with its commentaries.  [These books] can only be sold [in order to gather funds] to study Torah or to marry a woman. 

Siman 271

The Skin that it is written upon, the lines, and the laws of the ink.  There are seven sections:  [We] do not copy a Torah scroll on the hide of a wild animal, an impure bird, or a fish even a pure [fish].  Rather [we] copy on the hide of a wild animal (it should read: domesticated animal)(the translator), and a pure bird, even the hide of corpses and sick animals of them [the permitted sources of hides]. The hides must be tanned by a Jew for the purposes of a Torah Scroll, that he [the tanner] will say at the beginning of the process, when he places them [the hides] into the lime, "I am tanning these hides for the purposes of a Torah Scroll". Note: If the tanner is a Non-Jew, a Jew should help a little (Tur quoting Rabbeinu Barukh) in the beginning [of the tanning process] when [the hides] are placed in the lime, he [the Jew] says that he is doing [this] for the sake of the holiness of a Torah Scroll (Beith Yosef) [then] he [the Jew] marks those hides [that he helped make] so that the Non-Jew[ish tanner] does not mix them up. We do not suspect after the fact that the Non-Jew[ish tanner] mixed them [the hides] up and then forged the marks at the end. (Haghoth Maimoni chapter 1 of the laws of a Torah Scroll) See Orah Hayim 32
2) They [the hides] must be tanned with tannin, lime, or something comparable [meaning] chemicals that shrink the hide and strengthen it.
3) [We] copy the Torah Scroll upon Gvil that is the hide that is not split. [We] copy it on the side with hair. If he copied the Torah Scroll on Klaf [split parchment] it is fit for use, this is when he copied on the inner side that is opposite the flesh. Note: Our parchments are choicer than Gvil.  Preferably [we] copy on the flesh side [of the parchment], and we no longer copy on Gvil (Rabbeinu Yehuda Mintz section 66). If he changed and copied on our parchments on the hair side it is unfit for use (Or Zarua Laws of Tefilin) however there are those who are lenient on this (טור וע"פ עב"י)
4) [If] he copied a little bit of it on Gvil [unsplit parchment] or a little bit of it on klaf [split parchment] it is unfit for use. If he made it half Gvil and half deer skin even though it is not the best way to fulfill the commandment it is fit for use. (See later section 290)
5) A Torah Scroll needs line. If he copied it without lines it is unfit for use.  He should not line [the parchment] with lead or something like it because it colors [the parchment].
6) A Torah Scroll must be copied with black ink made of the smoke of oils mixed in gall-nut water. (preferably one should be careful to make the ink only with ingredients that come from trees)(Implied by Zohar Terumah 72a) If he copied with a solution of gall-nut and vitriol [this mixture creates a black ink] it is fit for use, but [this is] not [so] with the rest of the colors like red, green etc. If he wrote a single letter in the other colors or in gold it is unfit for use. Note: Ergo it is forbidden to copy any of the 24 books [of the Hebrew bible] not in black ink (Rabbeinu Yeruham quoting ibn yarhi) There are those who say that we only require black ink for a Torah Scroll (Mordekhai ה"ק).
7) A Torah Scroll must be copied with the right hand (There are those who say that it can be copied with a reed pen and not a feather (Mordekhai Gitin chapter 1).

And these are the seven names: the Name of the Being (YHWH). And the Name of the Lords (Aḋonai). And Eil. Elóah. Elohim. Shadai. Hosts (Tz'va·ot).

<b>Who is fit for the writing of a Sefer Torah, and if the scribe says they did not write the names of God for their own sake. Contains 8 subsections.</b> /n A sefer Torah written by an apikoros should be burnt. A non-Jew, it should be sealed away. Found in the hand of an apikoros and one doesn't know who wrote it, it should be sealed away. Found in the hand of a non-Jew and one doesn't know who wrote it, there are those who rule it fit and there are those who say it should be sealed away. And the community is obligated to purchase it from them at its price or a little more and to seal it away, so that they will not degrade it. And if they want to charge far over its price, we leave it with them. And if it's established that non-Jews disrespect Jewish books, we suspend our argument [on a possibility that] that those books are theirs and they read them. 
A convert who returned to their original religion because of fear is fit to write a Sefer Torah.
A Sefer Torah that was written by a <i>masor</i>, a slave, a woman, a minor, a Samaritan, a heretical Jew: unfit.
A Sefer Torah that was written by a <i>mamzer</i>, there are those who rule unfit. (And this is the same for a <i>ger toshav</i>) (Mordechai, end of Halachot Ketanot)
A Sefer Torah that the scribe said, after it left their hand, "I didn't write the names of God for their own sake": is not believed to render it unfit, but is believed to lose all their wage. And why are they not believed to render it unfit? Lest they were only intending to cause the buyer or the one who paid them a loss, etc., for they wouldn't lose by making the statement anything but the wage for the names of God. Therefore, if they said "This Sefer Torah, its hides are not worked for their sake" - since they're believed to lose their wage, they are believed to render it unfit, since everyone knows that if they are not worked for their sake, they have no wage at all. Note: And since it is like the wage of a fifth in general, they are obligated to repay a fifth, since this in any case is not less than a fifth. (Mordechai, chapter haNizakin).&lt;.i&gt;

Siman 282

Respectful behavior toward a Torah scroll, and the law of its use.  Herein are contained 19 sections:  One must behave with great respect toward a Torah scroll, and is commanded to designate a special place for it which one must treat with respect and which one must decorate (beautify) greatly.  One may not spit in front of a Torah scroll, nor may one undress (to the point of nudity) in front of it, nor may one scuff one’s feet (on a dirt floor) in front of it, nor may one place it upside down.  Also, one may not turn one’s back on it unless it is [sitting on something] ten handbreadths higher [than the person is tall – to be above the turned back].  Rather, one should sit before it with the proper mindset (for prayer), and with awe and fear, since this (Torah scroll) is [considered] the trusted witness regarding [the deeds of] all who live on earth, as it is said, “(Take this book of the Teaching [which can also be read:  ‘Take this Torah scroll’] and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of Adonai your God,) and let it remain there as a witness against you.”  (Deuteronomy 31:26), and one should respect it according to its power.
If one sees a Sefer Torah in motion, one must stand before it, and all should stand until the one carrying it stops and brings it to its place, or until it is visually obscured with a cover. [Comment of Rema: But before our "Chumashim" one does not need to stand (B"Y citing Rambam), although some are stringent (Rashb"a 144). If one hears the voice of the one carrying the Sefer Torah, even if one cannot see them, one must stand (B"Y citing R' Rabbeinu Manoach).]
If one is walking from place to place and a Sefer Torah is with one: one should not set it to rest in a marketplace/in sackcloth, or on the back of a donkey and ride upon it, but rather, one should set it to rest in all its accoutrements, opposite one's heart, and it should ride on the donkey by itself. And if one is afraid of thieves, it is permitted. 
A person should not enter a bathroom, a bathhouse, or a cemetery whilst holding a Sefer Torah, even if it is wrapped in a cloth covering ("mitpachat") and placed in its box. A person should not read from it until they are four cubits distant from the corpse or from the cemetery or from the bathroom. And a person should not hold a Sefer Torah without a cloth covering.
We do not throw/discard holy writings, even laws and narrative (halachot and aggadot). And it is forbidden to turn one on its face (upside-down?), and if a person finds one [holy writing] so, one needs to turn it over (Mahari"l).
Amulets (bound texts worn on the body for protection) if covered by leather, may be brought into the restroom, otherwise, they may not be.
It is prohibited to sit on a bed that has a Sefer Torah upon it. [Comment of Rema: And how much more so is it prohibited to place it on the earth, and this rule is the same for other Sefarim (B"Y citing R"R Manoach and AC and Kolbo) and even on the stairs built in front of the Holy Ark it is prohibited to place Sefarim. And one should not place a Sefer Torah on their knees and lean their two elbows on it (Mahari"l) and it seems to me that this rule would be the same for other Sefarim.]
One may not have sex in a house which contains a Sefer Torah, until one removes it. And if there is nowhere to remove the Sefer Torah to, one should make in front of it a tall partition (mechitza) ten tefachim [fist-heights, about 8cm each] high. But by means of placing it in a vessel within a non-specialised vessel, it's only permitted [to have sex in the presence of] tefillin and other holy writings and chumashim, but it's not permitted regarding a Sefer Torah, though the Ramba"m permits this even with a Sefer Torah. And if one spreads one's tallit over the box that one places it in, this is considered like a vessel within a vessel.
All who are impure, even a menstruating woman, are permitted to hold a Torah scroll and to read from it, provided that their hands are not dirty or soiled. 
A Sefer Torah that wore out or became invalid- we place it in an earthenware container and bury it next to a wise sage, and this is its proper Geniza ("hiding away").
Wrappers of Sefarim that wore out- we make them into shrouds for an "obligatory decedent" (a body without anyone to bury it) and this is its proper Geniza.
A case prepared and used for holding a Sefer Torah; and likewise the Aron or the cabinet that we place the Sefer Torah into- even if the Sefer Torah is not placed in directly, but only inside a case; and likewise the chair prepared and used for holding a Sefer Torah. These are all sacred accessories ("tashmishei kedusha") and are prohibited (for ordinary use). And after they wear out or break, they are placed in Geniza. 
An Ark that has broken: it is permitted to make from it another, smaller one, but it is forbidden to make from it a chair for the Sefer Torah. And a chair that has broken: it is permitted to make from it a small chair, but forbidden to make a "shrafraf" (meaning a small bench) for a chair.
 The platforms ("Bimot") that the one holding the Sefer stands on do not have the sanctity of a Sefer Torah. But they do have the sanctity of a synagogue. 
Everything that was made for a Sefer Torah: if it was made on the condition that it could be used for other uses if one wishes to do so, the condition is effective. 
The gold and silver fruits that are made for the Sefer Torah for decoration: they are sacred accessories and it is prohibited to allow them to leave to the mundane realm, unless it is for the purpose of purchasing a Sefer Torah or a Chumash. 
In any situation where it is forbidden to transfer an item to a lesser degree of sanctity, if the seven greatest people of the city sold the item in the presence of the city's populace: it is permitted. 
An individual who sells their Sefer Torah and its accessories: some permit using that money, and some prohibit it. [But if there were mistakes in it, then it is permitted according to all opinions (Riva"sh 286) and see OC 153.]
It is permitted to place a Sefer Torah on top of another Sefer Torah, and we place Chumashim on top of books of Prophets and Writings. But we do not place books of Prophets and Writings on top of Chumashim, nor Chumashim on top of Sifrei Torah. [Comment of Rema: But books of Writings on top of Prophets (or the reverse is permitted) (B"Y citing Ra"N citing Tosfot Ch. 1 of Baba Batra) And all this applies to two separate volumes, where each volume is bound on its own. But in one bound volume, anything is permitted. (Mordechai Ch. "Hashutafin") And see below section 246 that it is forbidden to ponder words of Torah in dirty places, which is is (likewise) because of honor of the Torah.]

It's forbidden to embroider verses [of the Tana"ch] on a tallit/robe.

It is forbidden to eat new (crop) of the five types of grain until the Omer is brought, which is the 16th of Nissan. As it says, “And bread, toasted grain, and unripe (or damp) grain you may not eat until (the end of) this very day.” And in these times that there is no Omer, it is forbidden (on) all of the 16th day. And outside of Israel where we observe two days, it is forbidden (on) all of the 17th day, until the beginning of the night of the 18th.
The prohibition of (eating) new (grain) is practiced both in Israel and outside Israel, whether of a Jew’s (grain) or a non-Jew’s.
Grain that did not take root before the 16th of Nissan is forbidden until the next Omer comes. Rama: And nevertheless, all indeterminate grain is permitted after Passover because of a double doubt. Perhaps it comes from the previous year. And even if you’ll say that it came from this year, nevertheless, perhaps it took root before the Omer (Tur quoting the Rosh).  And in types of grain that they certainly plant after Pesach, for example in some countries where they plant spelt and barley after Passover, then he should be stringent after the harvest, unless the gates of the country are not closed and most of the grain comes from another place where they plant before Passover. (Hg”M Ch. 11 from the M”A &amp; Tos. End of Ch. 1 of Kiddushin) And also, in a time when the winter season extends to after Passover, and in all of that region they plant the abovementioned crops after Passover, one should be stringent and suspect unless known otherwise. But one should not teach others in a place where most of their drinking and eating is from these species, because it is better that they be negligent and not to be pre-meditated. (So it seems in the Tur quoting the Rosh and T”H Ch. 158)

Siman 294




These three years are not counted from day to day, but rather follow the years of the world, which begin from Tishrei. If a year is intercalated (i.e., a leap year with an extra month), it is intercalated for the purposes of orlah (the prohibition on eating fruit from a tree in its first three years) and revai (the fourth-year fruit that has special rules). Sometimes, it is only two years and 44 days, and sometimes it exceeds three years. How so? If one planted [a tree] before the 16th of Av, when there are still 44 days left until Rosh Chodesh Tishrei (the first of Tishrei), once Rosh Chodesh Tishrei arrives, it is considered as if a year has passed for it, and then two more years are counted. But if one planted on the 16th of Av or later, one must count three full years from the upcoming Rosh Chodesh Tishrei. After Rosh Chodesh Tishrei of the fourth year, all fruits that begin to form before the 15th of Shevat still have the status of orlah, even if they ripen afterward. Those that begin to form from the 15th of Shevat of the fourth year until the 15th of Shevat of the fifth year are called revai. After the 15th of Shevat of the fifth year, they are completely chullin (ordinary fruit, free of restrictions).

SEPARATION OF CHALLAH: WHETHER CHALLAH OF THE LAND OF ISRAEL OR CHALLAH OF THE DIASPORA - CONTAINING 5 SECTIONS: It is a positive commandment to separate a contribution from the dough and to give it to priest, as it is said: "the first of your dough you shall contribute [as] a contribution" (Num. 15:20) - and "first" - this does not have a [specific] amount from the Torah - even if one separated [an amount] like a grain of barley has exempted the dough. And one who make all of one's dough challah has done nothing until one leaves over some. And from the words of the Sages, we separate 1/24 of the dough, and a baker who makes [it] to sell in the market separates 1/48. And if the dough becomes ritually impure by accident or compulsion [i.e. forces out of one's control], even the householder separates 1/48. 
We are not obligated in challah from the Torah other than in the land of Israel alone, as it is said: "and it shall be that when you eat from the bread of the land..." (Num. 15:19). And [it applies] at a time that all of Israel is there, as it is said: "when you [plural] come" (Num. 15:18) - the coming of all of you and the coming of some of you. Therefore, [the obligation of ] challah at this time - even in the days of Ezra in the land of Israel - is only from their [i.e. the Sages'] words [i.e. it is of Rabbinic force only].
We separate challah in the Diaspora according to the words of the Sages in order that the teaching of challah will not be forgotten from Israel.
There are three laws for challah in three lands. All of the land [of Israel] that those who came up from Babylonia held - up to Keziv - separate in it one challah according to its [specified] amount, and it is eaten by priests. And the rest of the land of Israel that those who came up from Egypt, but not those who came up from Babylonia held - from Keziv to Amana - separate in it two challot. The first is 1/48 and it is burnt, and the second has no [specified] amount, and they give it to the priest to eat it. And all the land from Amana onward, whether in Syria or in the rest of the [foreign] lands separate two challot. The first has no [specified] amount, and it is burnt, and the second, 1/48, and is eaten. And it is permitted to those who are ritually impure, even to zavim and zavot [males and females ritually impure due to abnormal genital emissions]. And in this time, when there is no ritually pure dough because of the ritual impurity of the dead body [a status which all are considered to have], they separate one challah in all of the land of Israel, 1/48, and burn it because it is ritually impure. And from Keziv to Amana, they separate a second for the priest for eating, and it does not have a [specified] amount, as was the case in previous times.
Challah of the Diaspora [in our day], even though it is ritually impure, since its essence is an obligation from their [the Sages'] words, it is not forbidden for eating other than  for those [priests] whose ritual impurity goes out upon one from one's body, namely those who have emitted semen, zavim and zavot (males and females ritually impure due to abnormal genital emissions], menstruants, and those who have given birth. But the rest of those who are ritually impure through touching what is ritually impure, and even those who are ritually impure, are permitted for eating it. Therefore, whether in Syria or whether in the Diaspora, if one wanted to separate [only] one challah, one separates 1/48 and it is eaten by a male minor [priest] who still has not seen a seminal emission or a female minor [daughter of a priest] who has not yet menstruated, and there is no need to separate a second [challah]. And it is [also] so if there was an adult priest there who immersed [in a mikveh] from his emission of semen or from his zivah (abnormal genital emission), even though the sun has not set on him (and there are some who say that the sun needs to set - the Ran on Eilu Ov'rin), behold this one is permitted to eat the first challah, and there is no need to separate a second in the Diaspora. Gloss: And there are some who say that since there is no challah eaten in this time in the land of Israel, also [it should be so] in the rest of the places. There is no need to separate [other than] only one challah and to burn it (Tur in the name  of "there are those who say" and other decisors). And such is the basic practice in all these lands, that they do not separate [other than] only one challah that has no [specified] amount, and they burn it like they used to do when they separated two challot, in that the challah of the fire did not have a [specified] amount. And in any case, the practice to take an olive-size (Maharil). And the one [i.e. priest] who eats challah, even in the Diaspora, blesses first according to the type [of food] that one wants to eat, and after than blesses "who makes us holy with the holiness of Aaron and commands us to eat terumah [a contribution]". And there are those who say that when they burn challah, they make an inference because of it that an Israelite [i.e. non-priest] is forbidden to derive benefit from it (Maharik, and so also in Tosafot "Kol Sha-ah"), and they practice to throw it into the oven before they bake the bread.

In this era, even in a place where Jews ascending from the Diaspora have acquired a presumption of ownership, and even in the days of Ezra (the Scribe), there is no pentateuchal obligation of priestly gifts and tithes; rather, a rabbinic obligation exists, since the verse says, "When you shall come...," implying when all of you will ascend to the land, and not a partial Aliyah, as there was in the days of Ezra.  <i>Gloss: And there are dissenters, and their position is that [even] nowadays we are biblically obligated <u>in the land of Israel</u> in priestly gifts and tithes, yet we do not follow this custom (Yaakov ben Asher (Ba'al ha-Turim) quoting Rabeinu Yitzchak).</i>

Admonition (<i>nezifa</i>) is when an eminent person scorns another, saying "How rude they are!" and such things. This is the required behaviour of the scorned person: they should hide themselves, sit in their home and be ashamed; they should not show their face to the person who admonished them, reduce laughter and frivolity, and show all who are watching that they are troubled. But they do not have to cut themselves off from society, whether during meals or in social relations, and they do not have to act in a manner similar to those who are in mourning. They do not need to apologise to those to whom they were rude, and they do not need anybody to release them from the status of 'admonished', because as soon as the time is over they are released automatically. <b>REMA:</b> Even if the eminent person did not say anything explicitly, but one knows that they were silently offended, one should proactively take on the status of 'admonished'.

Siman 335

...It is a religious obligation to visit the sick. Relatives and close friends may visit immediately and others after three days. But if he (the sick) is gravely ill, all may visit immediately.
...A person of high status should visit even a person of modest status, even several times a day, and [one should also visit] one's peer. Anyone who exceeds this standard is worthy of praise, but one should take care not to burden the patient.  There are those who maintain that even an enemy should visit the sick individual (Maharil 197). This does not seem correct to me, rather one should not visit a patient or comfort a mourner who is one's enemy lest the [suffering person] think that [the enemy] is rejoicing in his misfortune, which will only cause more suffering. And this is what seems correct to me. 
...The visitor should not sit on the bed, nor on a chair nor on a bench but rather wrap himself (in tallit?) and sit before him because the Divine Presence rests above his head. Isserles: Especially if the sick person is laying on the ground because the one sitting would be higher then him but if he is laying on a bed it is permitted to sit on a chair or bench....
...We do not visit a sick person during the first three hours of the day because the illness is less pronounced in the morning and one might be tempted not to pray for him; nor during the last three hours of the day because the illness is more severe then and one might despair of praying for mercy. (And anyone who visits the sick and doesn't pray for him has not fulfilled the mitzvah.) (Bet Yosef based on Ramban.)
...When one prays for mercy for the patient, if one is doing so in the patient's presence, one may pray in any language he desires, but if this is not in the patient's presence, one must only pray in the Holy Tongue [Hebrew].
...[When one prays for the sick person] one should include in the prayer a request on behalf of all of the ill among the Jewish people, saying, "May the One have mercy upon you among the people of Israel," and on Shabbat, one should say, "It is Shabbat and we don't cry out on Shabbat, but healing is near at hand."
...We tell the patient that he should attend to his affairs; if he owes or is owed money, but he should not take this inquiry as evidence that he is dying and become afraid.
...We don't visit patients with intestinal maladies, nor eye disorders, nor mental disorders, nor those who have difficulty speaking. We don't visit in these patients' presence, rather, we enter the vestibule of their house and ask after their welfare, inquiring whether they need anything in particular, and we listen to learn about the suffering of [the patient? the caregiver?], and we pray for the patient.
...We visit the sick non-Jews because for the "ways of peace" (mipnei darkei shalom)
...For an intestinal disease, a woman tends to a man but a man does not tend to a woman. Rama’s Note: there are those who say that whoever has a sick person in his house, goes to the sage that request from them mercy for the sick person. And similarly the custom to bless the sick in synagogue, to call them a new name, because changing the name tempers the severe decree. Comfort to the mourners comes before visiting the sick. 

Siman 336

The Torah gives permission for physicians to practice, and it is in fact commanded under the category of saving a life. Furthermore, if it is withheld from someone, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. This is true even if [the patient] has [another] physician, since not just anyone is qualified to practice medicine. Someone should not occupy themselves with practicing medicine unless they are an expert, and there is not a greater [physician] available. If [one practices medicine although] this is not the case, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. If one practices medicine without the permission of the court, they are liable to pay [a penalty for malpractice], even if they are an expert. If one practices medicine with the permission of the court, but makes an error resulting in injury, they are exempt from human judgement but liable to heavenly judgement. If [a physician] killed [a patient] and knows it was [the result of] an error, [the physician] it exiled on account of it.
The physician is forbidden to exact payment for advice or teaching, but payment for effort and lost wages (assuming that the person would otherwise be working a regular paying job) are permitted.

Siman 337

One of the seven relatives for whom it is obligated to mourn of a sick person dies, and don't tell him, lest he tears his clothes in this knowledge. And if no one can read his portion, and there is no choice, and there is no eulogy on him, and cause his heart to break; and they cause silence in front of him.

Siman 338

Say to someone who is leaning towards death: confess! Say to him: many have confessed and they will not die, and many that do not confess, they will die, and in the wage that you confess you live, and all that have confessed that is his part in the world to come. And if one is not able to confess by his own mouth, he can confess in his heart. And if he is not able to know how to confess, say to/for him: “I say: .” And if he is unable to do all these things, is not able to say to him before ordinary people, and not before women, and not before minors, lest they weep/mourn and his heart breaks.
The order of Vidui, the deathbed confession, that is done by a companion: “I acknowledge you, Adonai, my God and God of my ancestors, that my healing and my death are in Your hands. May it be your will before You that I be healed to a complete healing, and if I die, may I be absolved for all of my sins and sufferings and crimes, as I sinned and suffered and did crimes before You, and may my portion be in the Garden of Eden, and may I merit the world to come which is hidden away for the righteous.” And if he wants to lengthen like the confession of Yom Kippur, the permission is in his hand.

Siman 339

One who is dying is like a living person for all his affairs.  They do not dye his cheeks, and they do not anoint him, and they do not wash him, and they do not stuff up his orifices, and they do not remove the pillow from under him, and they do not place him on sand nor on clay nor on earth, and they do not place a pot or a trowel or a pitcher of water or a grain of salt on his stomach, and they do not announce about him to the cities, and they do not hire flautists and lamenters, and they do not close his eyes, until his soul departs.  And anyone who closes with the departure of the soul, behold this one spills blood.  And they do not tear over him and they do not remove their shoes and they do not eulogize over him and they do not bring a coffin into the house with him until he dies.  And they do not open about him with [the post-death blessing of] justifying the judgment until his soul departs.  Gloss: and some say that they do not dig a grave, even tough it is not with him in the house, until after he dies.  (Rivash 114)  It is forbidden to dig any grave to be open until the next day, that they not bury him in it on that day, and there is danger in the matter.  (Rabbenu Yeruham in the name of R. Yehudah he-Hassid, ob"n)  And so it is forbidden to cause the dead person to die quickly.  Such as one who was dying for a long time and he could not separate, it is forbidden to remove the pillow or the mattress from underneath him, because they say that there are feathers of some birds that cause this, and similarly they should not move him from his place.  And similarly it is forbidden to place the keys of the synagogue under his head, in order that he take leave. But if there is something there that is causing delay in the departure of the soul, such as if there is a banging noise next to that house, such as a wood chopper, or there is salt on his tongue, and these are preventing the departure of the soul, it is permitted to remove it from there, that in this there is no activity at all, rather he removes the barrier (it is all in the glosses of Alfasi in the chapter "these shave")....

A bereavement occurs for him (i.e., one of the seven relatives) is required to be in mourning for him, before the burial, one must eat in another house. If he does not have another house, he eats in his friend’s home. If there is no friend’s house, make a partition and eat; and even if the partition is a double sheet, as long as it’s secured so that it doesn’t blow in thethis pers wind. And if he doesn’t have something to make a partition, he should turn his face and eat. And whatever he does, he does. And if he is in another city, he does not need to recline and eat; do not eat meat and do not drink wine, and do not say the motzi blessing nor the birkat hamazon, and do not bless him and do not invite him, even if the food is with others who do bless, do not invite others with an “amen. It is permitted of all the stated mitzvot in the Torah, even if you do not need to engage in the needs of the dead, such as that he will have others that engage for him. And some say that even if the person in mourning wants to do the mitzvot anyway, it is forbidden from him. And on Shabbat and Yom Tov, eat meat and drink wine, if you want to (our teacher Yonah). And if one blesses, he is obligated for all of the mitzvot except for intercourse which is forbidden from him. Isserlis: You can go to synagogue on Shabbat, and even on other days, there is no prohibition against it, only that it is prohibited to pray. If he needs to spend the night, in order to engage in the means of the dead, aninut is incumbent upon him from the time he begins to go in order to pass the dark time. If he wants to bury the deceased on Yom Tov, by means of Gentiles (i.e., because we can’t), it is forbidden through that time. And all the more so on the second day of Yom Tov that he can bury the person himself, but the rules of aninut will be incumbent upon him. Some say that this category applies to a student and his rabbi.

Siman 342

Someone who has made all the preparations for their wedding, such as they have already baked the bread and slaughtered the slaughter and poured the wine, and the father of the groom dies, and it is in a place where he cannot find a place to sell (to recoup the investment), and if they postpone the wedding, he will lose what he prepared; or if the mother of the bride dies, and there are here women’s makeup and frills have been gathered and won’t last (i.e., it will spoil), since they don’t have anyone who will go through this trouble for them another time (this is the way it is in the Gamara), put the deceased in a room, and the groom and the bride will get married, and the act of intercourse for the mitzvah of consummating the marriage and he separates (from her in order to bury the dead), and once the chuppah is incumbent upon him it becomes to him like a festival, and he observes seven days of feasting and then he observes seven days of mourning. And during all of the seven days of feasting there is practice with regard to them these intimate activities (e.g., mixing wine, making the bed, etc.), and it is forbidden to have sexual relations, consequently, for all of the seven days of feasting and seven days of mourning he sleeps with the men, and she sleeps with the women. Hagah: There are some that say that it is forbidden that she be together with him during the day like night, and he does not need to have two guards only that he is amongst the men or she is amongst the women (Tur in the name of the Rosh). And if they do not sleep in one room, they do not need a guard by principle (This is the regulation of the Rashba with the bride ?). And some say that if this is at night, you need two guards, and during the day it is permitted for him to be together with her (Tur in the name of the Ra’avad). And it’s the custom to teach a minor in being groom and young girls in being the bride, and they may not be together by day without a young boy or a young girl. And regarding shloshim, he cannot count [from burial], rather from the seven days of mourning and thereafter, and every seven days of the chuppah permitted to do laundry. And if he doesn’t have a loss, such as in a place where he found a place to sell what he had prepared, or even if he does have a loss, but the mother of the groom died or the father of the bride or one of the other relatives, there remains for them someone who could prepare for them another time, they are not allowed to postpone mourning and bury him immediately, and observe seven days of mourning, and after this marry the groom and the bride to the chuppah immediately, and practice seven days of feasting.

The deceased is not buried in expensive shrouds, even if he was a prince in Israel.
The custom was to bury in white garments.

We close the eyes of the deceased; and if his mouth is open, his jaw should be tied. And his orifices should be plugged after he is washed in spice water. And his hair should be cut. Rema: And his nails. And wash him well in every place, so that he is clean from all impurity, and smash boiled eggs on his head, with the shells, that he is resurrected, that he returns in the world.

A mourner should not eat his own food in his first meal of mourning, but may in his second, even if it's still the first day. His neighbours have a mitzva to feed him from their resources so that he won't have to eat his own food. One may feed his fellow during his period of mourning, and the fellow may then return the favour, provided they don't make this condition to begin with.

One whose relative died, but he did not know, it is not required to tell him.  eEven if it was a parent who died.  And on this it was said: "One who spreads a rumor is a fool" (Prov 10:18), and it is permitted to invite him to a meal for a wedding or any festivity, since he does not know.  However, if he asks, one shouldn't lie and say 'He is alive', as it says  "Keep far away from falsehood." (Ex 23:7) GLOSS: With males, it is customary to tell them, so that they will say kaddish, but with daughters there is no custom to tell them.  It is a mitzva to fast on the anniversary of a parent's death, and one fasts on the date of death, not the date of burial, unless one was present for both death and burial.  If this falls on a day tachanun is not said, one does not fast at all.  If the person died in Adar, one fasts in the first Adar in leap years, and although there are those who dispute this, this is primary. If the person died in the second Adar in a leap year, one fasts in the second Adar in leap years.  See Orach Chaim 568:7, and above 391, that one should not eat at a (festive) meal on the night of the anniversary of the death of a parent.  If this fast falls on Friday, its rule is like other fasts, and see Orach Chaim 249.  But if the person finished his fast the first time this occurred, he should do likewise in all future occurrences.
