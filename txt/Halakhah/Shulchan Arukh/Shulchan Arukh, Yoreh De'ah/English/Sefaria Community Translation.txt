Siman 1

All may slaughter, at the outset, even women.




...The one who is deaf and speaks but cannot hear: He does not perform the slaughter since he does not hear the blessing. If he performs the slaughter, even if it just for himself, the slaughter is valid.
...One who hears but does not speak: if he is an expert, he performs the slaughter even from the outset if another says the blessing.
...A drunk who has reached the drunkenness of Lot--his status is like one who is crazy. If he has not reached the drunkenness of Lot--he may perform the slaughter from the outset. Rem'a: There are those who say that a drunk does not perform the slaughter  because he often comes to chopping (instead of cutting).
...One who is blind: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset unless others are watching him. If he performs the slaughter, his slaughter is valid.
...One who is naked: He does not perform the slaughter from the outset because he cannot say the blessing.
...If a community vowed that only a certain butcher would perform the slaughter, and another goes and performs the slaughter: there those who say that his slaughter is forbidden. Rem'a: If they abolished the decree--all butchers are assumed to be valid as before.

ritual slaughter of [a kosher animal done by] a worshipper of stars [meaning non-jew; the animal slaughtered has the status of a] Nevilah, even [if the ritual slaughtering was done by a non-jewish] minor and even if its not a non-jew (for example a ger toshav) even if others [who are jews] supervise him

There are eight types of terefot, and their signs are D"N (final), HN"K (initial), N (initial), P"Sh: attacked (derusah),  perforated (nekuvah), missing (haserah), removed (netulah),  torn (keruah), fallen (nefulah), severed (pesukah), and broken (sheburah).

If in a behemah (domesticated animal) or chaya (wild animal), most of the bone of the head is crushed, either most of its vault (gab) or most of its circumference (hekkef), the animal is a trefah, even though the membrane is intact.

1. The punctured lung is treif
2. The lung has five (<i>ear-shaped</i>) minor lobes, three on the right and two on the left side, as the animal is suspended by its feet and its guts face the slaughterer, such that the slaughterer's and the animal's right sides are one.  On the right side there is another small lobe called the "small roseate lobe", not in line with the minor lobes, rather it projects from the front.  If one is missing from the right or the left, or if there were two on the right and three on the left, the lung is terefah. <i>HGH"H: The shapes of the right minor lobes are unlike those of the left ones.  If they are reversed in shape - terefah.  Similarly if the right middle minor lobe is larger than the lower minor lobe - terefah. If the upper left minor lobe is larger than the upper right minor lobe - terefah.  Similarly, if the major right lobe is larger than the left - all this is called 'reversed' and is terefah.  The roseate small lobe - if it's absent, or if it's on the left side - kosher. HGH: In these lands we regard zero or two small roseate lobes, or a roseate lobe on the wrong side, terefah, and it is proper to do so, and many of our rabbis agree, and custom should not be changed. Similarly, if its appearance or shape differs from the norm - terefah.  If there are two roseate lobes with a common finger-thick base: even though it has a crack, it's kosher.  And if one is upside down and the other normal, we follow the larger, if that is right side up, it's kosher.  The roseate lobe is normally in a pocket.  </i>

A limb from a live animal is forbidden from a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or fowl.
A limb that separates from a live animal is forbidden. And flesh that separates from a live animal is forbidden because of "And the flesh in the field Treifah." And even what separates from the animal [but] is still inside it - such as [where it was] cut from the spleen or from the kidneys and the piece was left inside it - it is forbidden.

Siman 63

Meat that was found spread out in the market, one goes after the majority, because a part goes after the majority of parts. If the majority of the sellers [of meat] are non-Jews, it is forbidden. And if the majority of the sellers are Jews, it is permitted. And this is the case with meat that was found in the hand of a non-Jew and it is not known from whom he purchased it. If the meat sellers are Jews, it is permitted. This is the law [according to] Torah. And the Sages already forbade all meat that is found, either at the market or in the hand of a non-Jew, even though all the sellers and all of the slaughterers are Jews. And furthermore, the one who buys meat and places it in his house and it disappears, it is forbidden [to eat it]. Rather, if there is a sign or there were recognizable rings [on the meat], and he definitely recognizes it that it is the [same meat] or it was bound and stamped, [then the meat is permitted].

Meat needs to be washed before it is salted. (if the butcher washed it, there is no need to wash it in the house, tur). If, after washing, the piece was cut into two or three (or the hooves were removed after washing, aruch), returning and rewashing is necessary. 
If it was salted but not washed first, rinse it and salt it again. There are some who forbid this practice. Rema: This is our custom, even if it was only salted a little bit, like the amount of salt used before it is roasted, and even if it was not salted for a shiur melicha (aruch, sharei durah, and semag). One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari). If one salted an unwashed piece of meat with other pieces of meat, the other pieces are acceptable and the unwashed one is forbidden (aruch).
Don't use salt that is as fine as flour, and don't use salt that is too thick because it will fall off the meat. Rema: and if one only has salt that is as fine as flour, it is acceptable to use it.
One should scatter salt so that no place remains without salt. And, one should salt so that it [i.e. the meat] won't be fitting for eating with the same amount of salt. There is no need to add more salt than this. It should be salted on both sides. Birds need to be salted also on the inside. If they are only salted on the inside or on the outside, and likewise with pieces [of meat] that are only salted on one side, these are permitted. Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.]. But if the meat hasn't been cooked, one should not cook it as is, but if it's within 12 hours of having been salted should instead salt the second side that hasn't been salted and then cook it afterwards. If it has been after 12 hours of being salted then one should roast it on the fire, and the fire certainly draws it [i.e. the blood] out, and the side that was salted won't absorb [blood] from the side that wasn't salted.
After you salted the piece of meat, if you cut that piece, there is no need to return and salt the place where the meat has been cut.
The length of salting the meat is not less than the length it takes [in time] to walk a mile, and this is approximately a third of an hour. Gloss: And this is authoritative after the fact, or even from the outset [if the meat is needed in order to] to honor guests or for the needs of Shabbat. But, without this [need] the custom is to wait with the meat being salted for the length of an hour, and this cannot be changed.
Before one places the meat in the vessel that it will be washed in, one should shake off the salt that's on it or wash it in water and afterwards place the meat in the vessel that it's being washed in and wash it several times. The vessel should be washed between each and every rinsing [of the meat]. Gloss: And there are those who say that the meat needs to be washed three times and this is the custom from the outset, therefore if one washes or shakes off the salt from among it and washes it twice, this is like washing it three times. Or one places the water in the vessel and afterwards places the meat in it and washes it three times. And this is the custom from the outset, that one gives lots of water in the first rinsing in order to nullify the strength of the salt that's in the brine. It's permitted to wash the meat in fruit juice, and water is not required. 
If one did not shake off the salt that is on [the meat] and did not rinse it [off], the [meat] is not forbidden because the water in the vessel will negate the strength of the salt. Rema: Even a small amount of water will negate the strength of the tzir. (Aruch, klal 6 and Mahari). There are those who permit [the meat] even if there was no water in the vessel when the meat was placed there since we aren't concerned about the short amount of time while the person is washing the meat. (Share Durah). We can rely on this. We only worry about all this for the first washing, but after the first washing there is no concern. (Such are the words of the Mordechai and the Ran). And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy. As long as there is a little water in the vessel to negate the strength of the salt so that it is not cooking, even if the vessel is dairy or non-kosher, or dirty with forbidden things. (Aruch).
Meat that was salted and then cooked without a final washing must  have a sixty ratio (19) [34] against the salt that is upon it.  Rema: (20) [35] And the entire pot is included in the sixty, [36] and if  there is a piece of meat in the pot of equal size to this piece that was  not washed off, everything is permitted for there must be sixty times  the amount of salt on the piece (21), for the piece is certainly at least  sixty times it's salt, and if there is not sixty times against the salt  [37], even if only placed in a kli sheini everything is forbidden (23)  since [38] there is salt and tzir, it has cooked somewhat.  [39] Dried meat can be permitted even in a kli rishon, for it must  certainly be sixty times the size of the salt that is upon it since it has  dried. However, initially one must be careful even with dry meat that  it should not be cooked or even washed in hot water without being  first washed of it’s salt. All this is referring to a case where meat has  not been washed off of it's salt at all, however if even only slightly  washed once, and then cooked, it is permitted, post facto , for post  facto one washing is sufficient. Salt used once, [40] may not be  used again, [41], and it goes without saying that it is forbidden to eat  used salt.   
[42] A non-Jew who works in Jew’s home, who is cooking a piece of  meat that we’re not sure if it was washed off is subject to the following  halacha: If the non-Jew knows Jewish customs, we may believe to say he  washed it off if there was an adult Jew occasionally walking in and out, or  if there was a knowledgeable child. Rema:  One of these is sufficient (24) [43] either mesiach Ifi tumo that he washed  it well, or a Jew, even a child was around walking in and out for he has  some respect for Jewish customs. However if he told the non-Jew not to  wash meat without permission, and the non-Jew went and did so, it is  forbidden for we see that he has no fear and he should not be relied on.   
[44] Meat that has been cooked without having been salted is permitted if  there are [45] sixty times (26) that piece in the pot, (27) and all the other  meat is permitted as well. Rema: (28) [47] Some forbid that piece even if  there is sixty against it, and that is how we are to act if not for a great need  (2) as in honour of Shabbos or [47] guests when we may rely on those  who are lenient. If a piece of meat was not salted (30) properly it is as if it  was never salted. Any meat that stood for three days without having been  salted remains forbidden even if salted and if it is [48] cooked we require  sixty against it.
Meat that was left for three full days without having been salted can no  longer be saltedbecause the blood has dried and will no longer be  released through salting. Therefore it [49] may not be cooked [50] only  roasted (31) and after it is roasted [51] it still may not be cooked (32) but if  it was it is permitted. [52] Meat should not be left for three days for fear  that it may be cooked.   
(33) [53] If the meat was soaked in water within three days, it may go  another three days (34) (54) less half an hour. Meat that we are not sure if  it was salted within three days is permitted. 
Meat that was left unsalted for three days [55] and was then mixed up with  other pieces is [56] nullified [57] among the permissible majority, and [58]  all the pieces may be cooked (35) [59] even if it was a chaticha ha’ruya  I’hischabed. This is also the rule for pieces cooked without being salted,  and then mixed with others.  
(36) [60] Meat covered in blood that was sitting in water for twenty four hours is  forbidden by some unless it is roasted (37) [61] or unless there is sixty in the  water against it, [62] Some even forbid it to be roasted, and this is how we should  act. 
We perform the salting only in a vessel with holes or upon straw or shavings or in  a diagonal position insuring that if water was spilled onto it, it would flow off  immediately. Rema: An especially smooth surface that water would flow from  need not be placed in a slanted position. however if it’s not this smooth it must be placed slanted so that the water flows out. Even in a vessel with holes, one  should be careful to make sure the holes are open, therefore it should not be  placed on the ground, for then it is as a vessel without holes. As a result of this  some people are stringent and place straw or shavings because even the meat  can close up the holes. (38) Post facto, one need not worry about all this. If one  performed the salting in a vessel without holes (39) [63] it is forbidden to use the  vessel with very hot items. Rema: [64] And if it was used then one must take off a  klipah for a dry item, and if it was a liquid we need sixty against the klipah of the  vessel. [66] Some say that even with cold items it is forbidden to use the vessel  unless it is washed down well, and if it was used without first being washed off,  the item used should be washed off. (40) [67] However, it is permissible to re-use  this vessel for salting once holes are made in it (41) [68] or even without holes if  meat has been salted and washed off. 
(42) But if it has holes [69] it is permissible to eat boiling hot food from it, and there are some that forbid boiling hot [70]One should be careful  initially (43) but post facto, it is permitted. 
Meat [71] that was salted in a vessel without holes [72] and was left for as  long as it takes for water to begin boiling is subject to the following rules:  Anything in the tzir is forbidden even for roasting, and what is outside the  tzir is not forbidden [73] expect for a klipah’s worth, even if it is fatty.  Rema: (44) [74] Some forbid the entire piece, even that which is outside  the tzir, even if only salted slightly as is done in preparation for roasting  [75] and even if it was not left for the required salting time rather only for a  little while allowing for tzir to be seen [76] this is the custom, and it should  not be changed. Nevertheless, only the actual piece that is touching the  tzir is forbidden (45) [77] but the other pieces that are upon it and salted  with it are permitted, and this is indeed the custom. 
After meat has been salted and washed, it may even be placed in water that is not boiling [78] and there are those that require it to be placed in boiling water. Rema: The custom is to follow the first opinion. 
Meat that was salted for as long as required and then placed in a vessel without holes without being washed off [79] and then filled up with tzir is permitted. (46) According to this, meat that fell into tzir that came out of the meat (47) after the required salting time is permitted. There are those who forbid it no matter what, and they should be followed initially. Rema: [80] And some forbid even post facto (48) [81] a klipah and this is the custom, regarding that which is in the tzir. However, anything outside the tzir is permitted. (49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) 
In a place where salt is not easily found, one should roast the meat (54) until its blood has come out, and then one may cook it. 

Siman 70

One may salt many pieces, one on top of the other. Regardless of the fact that the the bottom piece finishes its excretions before the top one, we don't say that [the bottom piece] absorbs from the blood of the top one. This is because [the bottom piece] excretes gravy for a lengthy amount of time, and the entire time that gravy is emitted, [the piece] does not absorb. [This is true] even when much gravy gathers and stands inside of a depression between the pieces of meat - it is permitted. In what case is this dealing? In a case when he salts meat on meat, and even ox meat with kid or lamb meat, and even with chicken - [because] it is impossible for them to finish all the excretions of their gravy before the ox meat finishes excreting its blood. {RMA - in any event, we are accustomed to being strict in the first instance, that each piece which has a depression, as in [the case of] of a complete side of meat, to turn it over, in order that the blood should run off. However, one must not worry post factum. A piece which was salted twice is permitted - we don't worry that the secondary salt causes the blood from the first salting to be reabsorbed.} However, meat with fish, even chicken with fish, is forbidden to salt together. This is because the fish ceases excreting all of its gravy before the chicken finishes excreting its blood. If one did salt fish and chicken together, the chicken is permitted but one must take a peeling off the fish. However, if the scales were not removed when it was salted, it is permitted. {RMA - and there are those who forbid the entire fish [not just a peeling] if there wasn't 60 times [the volume] of the chicken, as we estimate in salting 60 times the volume, and such is the custom. And this is specifically referring to an instance where the scales weren't present, as fish skin is a soft membrane and excretes immediately. However, where the scales were present, it is permitted, as they do not excrete [all of their fluids] immediately and [thus] do not absorb from the chickens, because the entire time that they are busy excreting, they will not absorb, as we say about two pieces which were salted together.

Siman 71

[1] The head (1) is cut into two pieces and salted well on the inner side, [2] and is salted on its hair, for the hair is not a blockage from allowing blood to be released by the salt. 
(2) [3] The hooves are slightly slit at the bottom, salted, and laid out so the slit is face down. The hair is also salted. [4j See earlier section 68. 
The membrane surrounding the brain has many veins, and the brain itself  has much blood which will not come out through simply salting the head,  because the skull is blocking it, not allowing for the blood to flow.  Therefore, one who wants to salt it must cut the skull and remove the  brain, cut the surrounding membrane and salt it. [5] If one wants to salt the  head with the brain inside, then a hole must be pierced throughout the  skull and membrane, salt it, and place the hole face down as to allow the  blood to flow. It is then permitted even to be cooked. Rema: [6] And see  earlier in section 68 how one should act initially. If one salted the whole  head without making a hole in the skull then the [7] membrane and skull are forbidden, (3) [8] but the head is permitted along with any other meat  that is with it. The thigh bone, as well as other bones that have marrow  inside of them [9] must be salted [10] and the salting of the bone suffices  for the marrow as well. The bone need not be pierced. [11] Nevertheless,  ideally one should not salt it along with other meat, only alone. Post facto it  is permitted.

The liver contains a lot of blood.

Siman 74



Siman 75

Blood is not assumed to be in the intestines (1) [1] such as in the paunch  and the maw [2] and the bowels and the rectum (meaning the intestinal  tube which is at the top of the anus), if they are without fat on them.  Therefore if they were cooked in a pot without having been salted, they are  permitted [3] unless they have a blush red appearance. Rema: And if they  were salted in a vessel that does not have any holes, they are permitted.  (2) [5] Nevertheless, initially they require salting in a vessel with holes and  a preliminary washing as any other meat. Some disagree regarding the  paunch and say that it does contain blood, [6] even post facto the paunch  and reticulum of the ruminant stomach is forbidden as any other meat.  However the fat that is upon them is as any other meat. Therefore when  the rectum and other intestines are salted [7] they are not salted on the  inner part over the actual food, (3) rather on the outside where the fat is  attached. Rema: If the rectum was salted on the inner side and not on the  outer side it is as if it wasn’t salted. [8] if it was cooked this way it is not  kosher [9] if it has fat on the outside. If it wasn’t cooked yet (4) [10] go back  and salt the outer part [11] and it is then permitted. Eggs that are found in  poultry after being slaughtered if only the yolk was formed but not the white  part of the egg, then it must be salted as any other meat. (5) [12] and it  may be salted with other meat, if even the white part has been formed,  even if the shell on it is as hard as the shell on eggs which are sold in the  market, it is customary to salt it. However one must be careful not to salt it  with other meat, put post facto one need not worry. All fat, even of poultry  is considered as all other meat for the purposes of salting and washing. 
Intestines without fat on them, even though not containing blood (6) [13]  may be salted with other meat. Rema: Some forbid them to be salted with  other meat (7) and this is initially how one should act, however post facto it  is permitted.   
The fat of the winding coil that is on the bowel is full of vessels containing  blood. Therefore some forbid it to be cooked, even if cut and salted, but  now we customarily permit it. Those blood vessels, which if someone is  expert in, may be stretched and properly hung until not even one remains.

It is written in the Torah: "you will not cook a kid in the milk of its mother" three times (Exodus 23:19 /Exodus 34:26, Deuteronomy 14:21); once for the prohibition of Cooking, once for the prohibition of eating, and once for the prohibition of receiving benefit [from the cooked meat and milk products]. Eating is derived from the language of cooking, saying that there is no prohibition from the torah [in regard to meat and milk] unless its in a manner of cooking, but rabbinically it [the mixture of meat and milk] is forbidden in every way. All meat and milk [mixtures] that are not forbidden from the torah [through a way of cooking] is permitted to benefit from.
[the word] "kid", is not specific, it is the rule with a Ox, sheep and goat. It does not matter [if the kid is cooked] in the milk of its mother, and it does not matter if its in the milk of another [domesticated animal], it is but the language of the verse.
Only custom is with meat from a pure [kosher] animal and milk from a pure animal, but meat of a pure animal in milk tha is impure, or meat from a impure animal and pure milk, is permitted to cook an get benefit from it. Meat of a wild animal and of chicken,even in milk which is pure, is permitted cook and benefit; and even eating is not prohibited, its only prohibited rabinically. Rema: its a custom to make milk from almonds and place in it chicken meat, since it not even a prohibition from the rabbis. but meat from a domesticated animal there is [to be strict] to place it next to almond milk, b/c it looks like its an issur, it is explained earlier on in siman 66 for the matter of blood.  
it is forbidden to cook [meat] with milk of a woman, because it seems like the prohibition itself. if it [happens that milk of a woman] fell into the mixture being cooked, it is nullified and there is no need to measure [to see if the milk is null and void by being less than one sixtieth in the contrast to the meat]: REMA: It seems according to this, all the more so that it is forbidden to cook, with intention to do so, with impure milk or impure meat with pure milk  and  [this] is specifically with meat of domesticated animals but with chicken, that is a rabbinical prohibition and there is no need to be concerned. 
Eggs that are found inside chickens, if they are complete that they have egg white and yolk, even though that it is bound with sinews [from the chicken], indeed it is complete and it is permissible to eat it with milk but if the egg does not have egg white and yolk, it is forbidden to cook with milk but if he eats them before them [the dairy products] it is permissible to eat afterwards cheese and milk.

(Non-hot) Meat and cheese that touched each other are both permissible to be eaten, providing that you first rinse off the spot on each where they touched.  It is permissible to wrap them both in one napkin (or wrap), and not be worried lest they touch.
anything that requires rinsing, and you put cold meat on a non kosher plate which is cold, letachila maybe you shouldn't do because its not clean, you have to make sure its clean because you don't rinse (bhadacha) your cold cuts before you eat them.......rama: if you are dealing with something that isn't moist but is dry, then you can put it on the plate and you have nothing to worry about. 
you have to be careful the the meat doesn't touch bread because if it touches it you cant eat it with cheese and visa versa.....
meat and milk that are boiling and are mixed together , and even cold meat that enters boiling milk or visa versa, it is not allowed from rabbinic science because it spreads- but boiling milk that fell on cold meat or visa versa, you take out (peel off) the bad part and the rest is allowed. (if all you did was washing it and cooking it without peeling off the peel is batal besheeshem so its okay-bedeved-after the fact its okay and is allowed)

Siman 92

An olive-worth of meat that falls into a pot of boiling milk: let a non-Jew taste the dish. If he says that there is a taste of meat in it, it is forbidden. If not, it [the milk] is permitted, even in less than sixty, and that piece [the meat] is forbidden.  When is this true?  When one quickly removes the piece before it exudes the milk that it absorbed, meaning before the pot rests from its boiling.  But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, (rama) it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> 
Milk falls into a pot of meat: [let a non-Jew] taste the piece that the milk fell on.  If it does not taste of milk, everything is permitted.  If the piece does taste of milk, then that piece is forbidden. <i>For us who don't rely on a non-Jew, we need sixty in the piece, and if there's not sixty then it's all forbidden.</i> And we measure it [the original piece of meat] against the whole [pot].  If there was in all that is in the pot, the pieces, the vegetables, the soup, and the spices, enough that this piece is one in sixty [or less] of the whole, the piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted.  In what situation are we speaking? When the pot was not stirred at the beginning when the milk  fell in, but only at the end, and the pot wasn't covered.  But if it was stirred from beginning until end or was covered from the time of [milk] falling in until the end, everything joins together to nullify the taste of milk. <i>Therefore, if it wasn't stirred at all, not at the beginning and not at the end, and wasn't covered at all, if there is sixty in the pot compared to the drop of milk that fell in, it only prohibits the piece alone, and the rest of the pot is permitted (Bet Yosef in the name of the Ra'avid and Magid Mishnah in the name of the Rambam.) And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.  And if there is no non-Jew to taste and be relied on, we measure with sixty (until now, the language of the Rambam.)  <i>There are those who disagree and reason that stirring the pot isn't effective unless it's stirred immediately after the prohibited matter fell in, and this is our practice.</i>   
When a piece of meat becomes forbidden due to milk it is prohibited completely. If it was cooked with others, sixty is needed to negate it all. If you recognize it, take it out and the others are acceptable. If you don't recognize it, the sauce is permitted but all the pieces of meat are forbidden if the initial piece was roeeya latchabel (too important to be considered part of a mixture)

...If one inserted a spoon into a cooking vessel two times and did not know in the meantime, they need 60 times twice (the amount of food versus the spoon). There are those who say that it is sufficient to have 60 times (the amount) once. This is the custom.

Every Jewish man is obligated in studying Torah, whether poor or rich, whether completely healthy or suffering, whether young or very old. Even a poor man who frequents doorways (to beg) and even one with a wife and children is obligated to set a time for himself to study Torah, by day or by night, as it says, "And you shall meditate in it day and night." (And in a pressing time, even if he only read Shem"a in the morning or evening, it is called "It shall not be moved..." (HG"M 1 &amp; SM"G Asin 12). And one that it is impossible for him to learn because he does not know how to at all or because of troubles that he has, should support others who study. Haga"h: And it will be considered for him as if he learned himself (Tur) And a person is able to make a condition with his friend, that he will study Torah and he will support him, and he will split the reward with him. But if he already toiled in Torah, he is unable to sell him his portion for the money he will give to him. (TA"V? path 2  from Bavli Sotah)

Charity dispels harsh decrees and famine (&amp;) saves from death as happened at Zarephath: Gloss: (RAMA) This is referring to tithing and one should not test God except in this regard as it was said {Malachi 3,10} "And try Me now herewith" [with tithing] (Tur from the last chapter of Gemara Tanit), and there are those who say that specifically in regards to giving tithes [on produce from Israel] is it allowed to test the Holy One Blessed be His name, but not in regards to other forms of charity. (The Bais Yosef seems to hold this way from Shas there):

A lower level than this is one who gives tzedakah to a poor person and doesn't know to whom they are giving, and the poor person doesn't know from whom they are receiving. And similar to this, is when you give to a charitable fund - and you only give to a charitable fund if you know that the trustee responsible for the fund knows how to run it properly.

One who gives his non-minor sons and daughters, whom he is not obligated to feed, in order to teach the sons Torah and to direct the daughters on the straight path, and so one who gives gifts to his father and they need them, behold this is in the category of tzedakah.  And not only that, but he is required to give [the relative] precedence over others.  And even if it is not his son or father, but a relative, he must give him precedence to all others.  Ans his paternal brother takes precedence over his maternal brother.  And the poor of his household take precedence over the poor of his city; and the poor of his city take precedence over the poor of another city.  (so is found in the Sma”g and Sma”k and Tur)
Gloss:  Those who are fixed in a city are called the poor of that city, and they take precedence to other poor people who come there from elsewhere (Tur, unlike R”Y son of Baruch).  
The residents of Israel take precedence to the residents of the diaspora.
Gloss:  Supporting himself takes precedence over everyone, and he is not obligated to give tzedakah until he has his own sustenance, and afterwards he prioritizes the support of his father and mother, if they are poor, and they take precedence to sustaining his sons.  And afterwards, his sons, and they take precedence to his brothers, and they take precedence to other relatives, and relatives take precedence to neighbors, and neighbors to the people of the city, and the people of his city to the people of another city.  And the same is true if they were taken captive and he needed to redeem them  (This is all in the Tur)

One must prioritize feeding the hungry over clothing the naked.
..
A man and a woman who came to ask for food, we give precedence to the woman over the man.  And so if they came to ask for clothing.  And so if male and female orphans came to get married, they give precedence to the female orphan to marry her off..

One who distributes charity must take care not to favor (lit., increase towards) his relatives more than other people. Rem"a: [This law applies] particularly to a <i>Gabbai</i> [distributors of communal charity], but everyone may give their charity or their <i>Ma'aser</i> to whomever from their relatives, and they take precedence as was explained above in Siman 251 (Mordechi First Chapter of Bava Batra)

It is forbidden to eat new (crop) of the five types of grain until the Omer is brought, which is the 16th of Nissan. As it says, “And bread, toasted grain, and unripe (or damp) grain you may not eat until (the end of) this very day.” And in these times that there is no Omer, it is forbidden (on) all of the 16th day. And outside of Israel where we observe two days, it is forbidden (on) all of the 17th day, until the beginning of the night of the 18th.
The prohibition of (eating) new (grain) is practiced both in Israel and outside Israel, whether of a Jew’s (grain) or a non-Jew’s.
Grain that did not take root before the 16th of Nissan is forbidden until the next Omer comes. Rama: And nevertheless, all indeterminate grain is permitted after Passover because of a double doubt. Perhaps it comes from the previous year. And even if you’ll say that it came from this year, nevertheless, perhaps it took root before the Omer (Tur quoting the Rosh).  And in types of grain that they certainly plant after Pesach, for example in some countries where they plant spelt and barley after Passover, then he should be stringent after the harvest, unless the gates of the country are not closed and most of the grain comes from another place where they plant before Passover. (Hg”M Ch. 11 from the M”A &amp; Tos. End of Ch. 1 of Kiddushin) And also, in a time when the winter season extends to after Passover, and in all of that region they plant the abovementioned crops after Passover, one should be stringent and suspect unless known otherwise. But one should not teach others in a place where most of their drinking and eating is from these species, because it is better that they be negligent and not to be pre-meditated. (So it seems in the Tur quoting the Rosh and T”H Ch. 158)

In this era, even in a place where Jews ascending from the Diaspora have acquired a presumption of ownership, and even in the days of Ezra (the Scribe), there is no pentateuchal obligation of priestly gifts and tithes; rather, a rabbinic obligation exists, since the verse says, "When you shall come...," implying when all of you will ascend to the land, and not a partial Aliyah, as there was in the days of Ezra.  <i>Gloss: And there are dissenters, and their position is that [even] nowadays we are biblically obligated <u>in the land of Israel</u> in priestly gifts and tithes, yet we do not follow this custom (Yaakov ben Asher (Ba'al ha-Turim) quoting Rabeinu Yitzchak).</i>

...It is a religious obligation to visit the sick. Relatives and close friends may visit immediately and others after three days. But if he (the sick) is gravely ill, all may visit immediately.
...A person of high status should visit even a person of modest status, even several times a day, and [one should also visit] one's peer. Anyone who exceeds this standard is worthy of praise, but one should take care not to burden the patient.  There are those who maintain that even an enemy should visit the sick individual (Maharal 197). This does not seem correct to me, rather one should not visit a patient or comfort a mourner who is one's enemy lest the [suffering person] think that [the enemy] is rejoicing in his misfortune, which will only cause more suffering. And this is what seems correct to me. 
...The visitor should not sit on the bed, nor on a chair nor on a bench but rather wrap himself (in tallit?) and sit before him because the Divine Presence rests above his head. Isserles: Especially if the sick person is laying on the ground because the one sitting would be higher then him but if he is laying on a bed it is permitted to sit on a chair or bench....
...We do not visit a sick person during the first three hours of the day because the illness is less pronounced in the morning and one might be tempted not to pray for him; nor during the last three hours of the day because the illness is more severe then and one might despair of praying for mercy. (And anyone who visits the sick and doesn't pray for him has not fulfilled the mitzvah.) (Bet Yosef based on Ramban.)
...When one prays for mercy for the patient, if one is doing so in the patient's presence, one may pray in any language he desires, but if this is not in the patient's presence, one must only pray in the Holy Tongue [Hebrew].
...[When one prays for the sick person] one should include in the prayer a request on behalf of all of the ill among the Jewish people, saying, "May the One have mercy upon you among the people of Israel," and on Shabbat, one should say, "It is Shabbat and we don't cry out on Shabbat, but healing is near at hand."
...We tell the patient that he should attend to his affairs; if he owes or is owed money, but he should not take this inquiry as evidence that he is dying and become afraid.
...We don't visit patients with intestinal maladies, nor eye disorders, nor mental disorders, nor those who have difficulty speaking. We don't visit in these patients' presence, rather, we enter the vestibule of their house and ask after their welfare, inquiring whether they need anything in particular, and we listen to learn about the suffering of [the patient? the caregiver?], and we pray for the patient.
...We visit the sick non-Jews because for the "ways of peace" (mipnei darkei shalom)


Siman 336

The Torah gives permission for physicians to practice, and it is in fact commanded under the category of saving a life. Furthermore, if it is withheld from someone, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. This is true even if [the patient] has [another] physician, since not just anyone is qualified to practice medicine. Someone should not occupy themselves with practicing medicine unless they are an expert, and there is not a greater [physician] available. If [one practices medicine although] this is not the case, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood]. If one practices medicine without the permission of the court, they are liable to pay [a penalty for malpractice], even if they are an expert. If one practices medicine with the permission of the court, but makes an error resulting in injury, they are exempt from human judgement but liable to heavenly judgement. If [a physician] killed [a patient] and knows it was [the result of] an error, [the physician] it exiled on account of it.
