<b>LAWS OF VISITING THE SICK; HEALING; THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND ONE IN A DYING CONDITION.</b><br>It is a religious duty to visit the sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. 127a; B.M. 30b; B.K. 100a; Ned. 39b-40a; Sot. 14a.</i> Relatives and friends<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Who are intimate with him and are on an equal footing as relatives.</i> may enter at once and strangers after three days. If the sickness overtakes him<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘springs upon him.’</i> both may enter forthwith.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> in abridged form from <i>T.H.</i> — <i>G.</i> Y. Peah III, 9(17d); <i>ibid.</i> Git. VI, 7 (48a-b) ; Sem. de R. Ḥiyya (H) I, 1;  also Sem. (H). Int. pp. 17-19 and cf. Ber. 55b; Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XIV, 5 and <i>Kes. Mish. ibid.</i> Strangers are not permitted to visit the sick person before three days elapse, for prior to this period their visit indicates that the patient’s luck is shaky and that he is designated a sick person. This, however, does not apply to relatives and intimate friends who are much closer to him. Hence, if the sickness overtakes him even strangers are permitted to visit him immediately — <i>BaḤ.</i> A <i>Kohen</i> is permitted to visit a sick person in a hospital, although it is quite likely that a corpse is present there. However, he should first make inquiries from the hospital authorities whether there is a corpse there or not. Where this is impossible to be determined, the <i>Kohen</i> may visit the patient in order to fulfil the religious duty of visiting the sick. The <i>Kohen</i> should not fear that there are sick people in the hospital who are in a dying condition, for we apply the principle that the majority of sick people recover — <i>Resp. Teshurath Shai.</i></i>
Even a prominent person must visit a humble one;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ned. 39b.</i> even many times a day and even if the visitor is of his affinity.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Of the same age as the invalid. Thus <i>Rashi.</i> According to <i>Asheri</i>: ‘under the same planetary influence.’ ‘For a master said: ‘A man’s affinity takes away a sixtieth of his (the sick person’s) illness’ (Ned. <i>ibid</i>.; B.M. 30b).</i> One who increases [his visits] is considered praiseworthy,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In accord with Raba’s dictum (Ned. <i>ibid</i>.), ‘Even a hundred times a day.’</i> provided he does not trouble him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> The visitor should not come empty-handed — <i>Sefer Yesh Noḥalin.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that an enemy may visit a sick person</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maharil</i> s. 197 — <i>G.</i></i> <i>However, this does not seem plausible to me; but he should not visit a sick person nor comfort a mourner whom he hates, so that</i> [<i>the latter</i>] <i>should not think that he rejoices at his misfortune, and thereby feel depressed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">One may, however, follow the funeral procession of his enemy since this is the end of every human and ‘rejoicing at one’s misfortune’ does not apply (<i>BaḤ</i>). But as to visiting the sick or offering comfort to a mourner, it depends upon the degree of enmity. — <i>ShaK</i>. One should therefore, use his judgment, especially if the sick person gives him permission to visit him — <i>Sefer ha-Ḥayyim.</i></i> <i>Thus seems to me</i> [<i>to be the correct view</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">San. 19a — <i>G.</i>  also <i>Me’iri ibid.</i></i>
One who visits the sick may neither sit upon a bed, nor upon a chair, nor upon a stool, but must [reverently] wrap himself and sit in front of him [the invalid], for the Divine Presence is above the top-side of his bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For it is written, <i>‘The Lord supports him upon the bed of illness’</i> (PS. XLI, 4).  Shab. 12b, and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>לא</span>; Ned. 40a and <i>RaN</i> s.v. <span>לא</span>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: [<i>This applies</i>] <i>only if the sick person lies on the ground so that he who sits</i> [<i>near him</i>] <i>will be on a higher level; but when he lies upon the bed, it is permissible</i> [<i>for the visitor</i>] <i>to sit on a chair or a stool</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos</i>. citing <i>RaN; Hag. Maim.; Tosaf.</i> and <i>Hag. Asheri</i> — <i>G.</i></i> <i>And thus is our accepted practice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This means that it is permissible to sit on any side of the invalid’s bed as long as the visitor is not on a higher level. , however, Zohar <i>Pinḥas</i> 234b where it is stated that if the invalid is an average person <span>בינוני</span> one should not sit at his feet, and at the top-side of the bed it is forbidden even if both are on the same level; if the invalid is a perfectly righteous person <span>צדיק גמור</span> the visitor may sit only in front of him at his feet, for in this case the Divine Presence is found on every side of the invalid excluding the side at his feet.</i>
One must not visit the sick during the first three hours of the day, — for every invalid's illness is alleviated in the morning and [consequently] one will not trouble himself to pray<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘to ask for mercy.’</i> for him; and not during the last three hours of the day, — for then his illness grows worse and one will give up hope to pray for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ned. <i>ibid.</i> This is not a prohibition but only general advice. Hence, people are not particular with respect to this requirement — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>One who visited</i> [<i>a sick person</i>] <i>and did not pray for him has not fulfilled the religious duty</i> [<i>of visiting the sick</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i> citing <i>N</i> (in <i>T.H.</i>) — <i>G.</i></i>
When one prays for him, — if in his presence,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">e., the invalid’s.</i> one may pray in any language one desires; if one prays, not in his presence,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">e., the invalid’s.</i> one should pray only in Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. <i>ibid.</i> according to which the Divine Presence is with the invalid and supports him (v. <i>supra</i> n. 12). Hence, the visitor may pray in any language since he is in the presence of God. But when he is not in the presence of the invalid he requires the angel’s intercession who according to tradition understands only Hebrew (v. Sot. 33a). This should not be confused with the notion that Judaism advocates praying to angels to intercede on our behalf. The angel merely acts as a carrier of prayers to God.  Y.Ber. IX, 1(13a), “If a misfortune befalls a person, he should not cry to Michael or Gabriel, but let him cry to me and I will answer him forthwith, as it is written, <i>‘whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered</i>’” (Joel III, 5).</i>
One should combine him with other Jewish sick by saying, 'May the Omnipresent have compassion upon you in the midst of the sick of Israel;'<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. <i>ibid.</i> since the merit of a group is more efficacious.</i> and on the Sabbath he says, 'It is the Sabbath when it is forbidden to cry out<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, which is not in keeping with the spirit of the Sabbath.  <i>Siddur</i> for text.</i> and healing will come soon.'<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> O.Ḥ. § 287.</i>
He is told to consider his affairs whether he lent to or deposited [aught] with others,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Or whether he wishes to leave instructions for his children — <i>A.H.</i></i> or vice versa, and that he should not fear death on account of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T.H.</i> citing Sem. However, this is not found in cur. edd. of Sem. The source of this ruling is Sem. de R. Ḥiyya(H) <i>ibid.</i></i>
One must not visit those suffering with bowel diseases,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ned. 41a, on account of embarrassment, since the invalid has to move his bowels frequently.</i> or with eye diseases, or from headaches.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, on account of engaging in conversation which is injurious to people suffering from headaches.</i> And likewise, whosoever is very sick<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘the world rests heavily upon him.’</i> and conversation is injurious to him must not be visited in his presence, but one may enter the outer chamber and ask and inquire regarding him, — whether it is necessary to sweep or sprinkle the ground before him<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 40a.</i> or anything similar to this, and hear his suffering and and pray for him.
One must visit the sick of the Gentiles in the interests of peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Git. 61a. Cf. <i>W.G.</i> a.l.</i>
[In the case of] those suffering with bowel diseases,—[the law is that] the man must not attend upon the woman, but the woman may attend upon the man.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In such cases attendance by a man upon a wowan leads to obscene thoughts and licentiousness. In the reverse case the passion is not as strong and hence permissible. Thus <i>D.M.</i> <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i> make a distinction between diseases, where the male is more prone to be tempted, and other illnesses, where this is not applicable. Cf. <i>supra</i> § 195, 18 and <i>infra</i> § 352, 3.  also Resp. <i>N.B., E.H.</i> s. 69.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that whosoever has a sick person in his home should go to the Sage of the city in order that he pray for him;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. 116a and <i>N.Yos.</i> a.l. — <i>G.</i></i> <i>and likewise is it the accepted practice to recite blessings</i> [<i>on behalf of</i>] <i>sick persons, in the Synagogues</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">On days when the Torah is read.  O.Ḥ. § 54, 2; § 288,  Blessings may be recited on behalf of sick people even if the latter do not reside in the same city — <i>P.Tesh.</i> No blessing is recited on behalf of an excommunicant — <i>Sefer Ḥasidim</i>.</i> [<i>viz.</i>,] <i>to give them an</i> [<i>additional</i>] <i>new name, for a change of name causes an evil decree passed upon man to be cancelled</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">R.H. 16b.</i> [<i>The precept of</i>] <i>comforting mourners takes precedence over visiting the sick</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kol Bo</i> — <i>G.</i>  also Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XIV, 7. Since the precept of comforting mourners is a charitable act both on behalf of the living and the dead.</i>

The Torah has granted the physician permission to heal,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 85a derived from the words, <i>‘And to heal he shall heal’</i> (Ex. XXI, 19).</i> and it is a religious duty<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ned. 41b, <i>Asheri</i> s.v. <span>רפואת</span>. The apparent contradictory terms ‘permission’ and ‘religious duty’ on explained as follows: True healing is the result of efficacious prayer. But not every person merits such consequences. Man, therefore, has to rely upon natural cures too, through the permission granted the medical man to administer treatment, who in turn is religiously dutibound to perform his duty — <i>Ta</i>Z. In this sense <i>Ta</i>Z explains the passage in Ber. 60a bot. On the question of cures in the Talmud, cf. <i>R. A. Eger</i> a.l.; M.K. 11a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>כוורא</span>; Kol Bo(G) § I, sec. </i> which comes under the rule of saving an endangered life.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T.H.</i>, derived from Yoma 83a-b. Cf. O.Ḥ. § 328, 4.</i> If he withholds [treatment] he is regarded as one who sheds blood;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from Y.Yoma VIII, 5(45b). Cf. O.Ḥ. <i>ibid.</i> par. 2.</i> and even if there is someone else who can heal him; for not from every one does one merit to be healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Y. Ned. IV, 2(38c).</i> Nevertheless, on should not occupy himself with medical treatment unless he is an expert and there is none other greater than he; for if not so, he is regarded as one who sheds blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This follows <i>a fortiori</i> from all other laws and teachings of the Torah which only an expert is permitted to deal with. Cf. San. 84b; Kid. 82a, Mishna.</i> If one administered medical treatment without the permission of the Jewish Court,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Or nowadays without a medical diploma — <i>A.H.</i></i> he is subject to payment of indemnities, even if he is an expert; and if he administered medical treatment, having the permission of the Jewish Court, and erred, causing [thereby] injury [to the patient], he is exempt by the laws of man and is held responsible by the laws of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Tosef(Ẓ). B.K. VI, 17. This applies only if it was the result of his negligence. Otherwise, he is regarded as not having committed any sin — <i>A.H.</i> If he caused injury intentionally, even after having permission of the Court, he is held responsible by the laws of man — <i>ShaK.</i></i> If he caused death and it became known to him that he acted inadvertently, he is banished<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Tosef(Ẓ). B.K. VI, 17. This applies only if it was the result of his negligence. Otherwise, he is regarded as not having committed any sin — <i>A.H.</i> If he caused injury intentionally, even after having permission of the Court, he is held responsible by the laws of man — <i>ShaK.</i></i> on account of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Tosef. <i>ibid.</i> according to version of <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.</i> Cf. <i>W.G.</i> a.l.</i>
The physician is forbidden to take payment for his wisdom and learning<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 81b; San. 73a; Sifre Deut. XXII, 2, derived from, <i>‘And thou shalt restore to him’</i> which implies that not only lost objects must be returned to their owner, but even if the person proper is lost or is sick, one is dutibound to restore the person of his fellow-man. Hence, this includes giving medical advice which may save the patient and restore his person to good health. Consequently, this must be done gratuitously. Cf. Bek. 29a, ‘Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously,’ for one must not receive remuneration for the performance of a religious duty.  <i>ibid.</i> Mishna. Advising the patient which medicine to take would refer to learning and wisdom which must be offered <i>gratis</i>; visiting the patient or writing a prescription would refer to trouble and lost time for which payment may be accepted — <i>A.H.</i></i> but he may receive payment for his trouble<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bek. 29a; Kid. 58a.</i> and lost time.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bek. <i>ibid.</i> a and b; B.M. 31b.</i>
One who has medical ingredients and his neighbour is sick and requires them, is forbidden to raise the price above the standard value.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from Yeb. 106a regarding the daughter of R. Papa’s father-in-law.</i> Furthermore, even if they agreed to pay him an excessive amount, due to the need of the hour, — for they found that only he possessed the medical ingredients, — he is entitled only to the [standard] price.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i> ibid.</i> regarding the man who escaped from prison.</i> However, if one stipulated an excessive sum as payment to the physician, he is obligated to give it to him, for he sold him his learning which cannot be valued in [terms of] money.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T.H.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Although he is required on account of the religious duty</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>supra</i> n. 2.</i> <i>to heal him</i>, — <i>for every positive command which rests upon every person</i> [<i>to fulfil</i>], — [<i>yet</i>] <i>if it chances to come to one's hand and he agrees to execute it only for money</i>, — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>we do not claim the money from him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If the physician had already received the money — <i>BaḤ</i>. The same applies to the medical ingredients if already paid for — <i>R. A. Eger.</i> Although the physician is forbidden to receive payment (v. <i>supra</i> par. 2), it is different, however, if the patient had obligated himself to pay. For the physician may put forth a valid claim that it was not only his own duty to study medicine, since everyone has the opportunity to master this field. Nevertheless, in the case of the man who escaped from prison (v. <i>supra</i> n. 14) and offered the ferryman an exorbitant fee to take him across the river, the law is that he was obliged to pay only the normal rates, despite the fact, that in this case too, the ferryman may claim that every person has the opportunity to learn his type of work, for in the latter case there exists an established rate, whereas in the former case the knowledge of the physician cannot be measured in terms of money. Consequently the stipulation must be fulfilled — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i> <i>nor do we make him cancel his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus reading of <i>T.H.</i> and <i>B.Yos.</i> a.l.

One who is sick and suffered a bereavement, must not be informed thereof lest his mind become unclear; nor is his garment rent; nor is it permitted to cry or make lamentation [for the dead]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Whether for his dead or another’s dead.</i> in his presence, so that his heart be not broken; and they silence the comforters in his presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 26b; <i>Alfasi;</i> Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VIII, 4 and <i>Kes.

<b>LAWS OF RENDING GARMENTS</b><br>One who suffered a bereavement, namely, [one] of [his] near-of-kin<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>infra</i> § 374.</i> [died], for whom he is required to observe mourning rites, must rend [his garments] for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 24a: ‘A mourner who does not rend his garments, is guilty of a mortal offense.’ The requirement is Rabbinical and the Rabbis gave it support by reference to a Biblical verse — <i>ShaK.</i> It is customary that another person rends the garment, for then the mourner endures more grief, and on seeing a stranger rend his garment, and remaining silent he thereby acknowledges Divine Justice. The stranger must not rend more than is required. Otherwise, he is held responsible for damages. Even when the mourner himself rends the garment, he must not rend more than the law requires. If he rends more, he transgresses the law forbidding one to ruin anything wantonly (v. Deut. XX, 19) — <i>P.Tesh.</i> One must also rend garments when he collects the bones of a near-of-kin — <i>G.Mah.</i> (v. <i>infra</i> § 403, 2). The benediction recited when rending garments must contain the <i>‘Divine Name’</i> and the word <i>‘King’</i> — <i>Bir. Yos.</i></i> One must rend [his garments] while standing;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 20b, derived from the verse, <i>‘Then Job stood up and rent his mantle’</i> (Job I, 20).  also II Sam. XII, 31.</i> and if one rent [his garments] while sitting, he has not discharged his duty;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. <i>ibid.</i></i> <i>and he must rend again</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>Ghayyat; Asheri; Hag. Maim.; B.Yos.</i> according to opinion of <i>RaBaD; N; Mord. M.K. III</i> — <i>G.</i> Some authorities state that if he had already rent in a sitting position, the reading is considered valid.  <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>In the first instance one must rend</i> [<i>his garments</i>] <i>before he conceals the face of the corpse</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i> citing <i>SeMaK</i> — <i>G.</i> Cf. <i>supra</i> § 339 according to which the mourner rends his garments when he reaches the words, ‘<i>Judge of Truth</i>.’ There is no contradiction between these rulings, since the former rule is in accordance with the custom to recite the <i>Ẓidduk Haddin</i> when the soul departs — <i>Ba’er Heteb.</i> If one has not rent garments after death, he may still do so throughout the seven days of mourning, for during this period it is still regarded as a ‘moment of excitement’ (v. M.K. 24a).</i>
The region for rending is all along the neck of the garment in the forepart; but if he rent in the back part, <i>or in the lower parts of the garment</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i></i> or on the sides, he has not discharged his duty.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 26b.  Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VIII, 1. Likewise if the garment is rent widthwise, one does not discharge his duty — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that one discharges his duty if he rends in the lower parts of the garment; and thus is the common practice to adopt the more lenient view</i>, [<i>viz.</i>,] <i>to rend in the lower parts of the garment</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These customs you will find in <i>SeMaK, MaHaRIW, Ḥid.

And thus is the common practice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>SeMaK</i> on the basis of Sem(H). IX, 18: ‘One who rends in the lower parts or on the sides of the garment has not discharged his duty. R. Judah says, that he has discharged his duty.’ In the case of other dead, who are not his near-of-kin, we accept R. Judah’s view.</i>
The extent of rending is a handbreadth.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 22b: ‘Said R. Abbahu, what text teaches this? <i>Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them</i> (II Sam. I, 11), and there is no taking hold of anything by less than a hand-breadth. Cf. Suk. 32b; Nid. 26a.</i> If he rent [his garment] upon suffering a bereavement, and extends the rent, on sustaining another bereavement; if [the second bereavement] is after the seven [days, the additional rent] may be as small [as he wishes]; if during the seven [days], a handbreadth is required.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 26b.  <i>infra</i> par 21.</i> However, for his father and mother, [after having suffered a previous bereavement], even after seven [days], he rends until he bares his chest.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. <i>ibid.</i>  <i>infra</i> par. 18 and 2</i>
Just as he rends for his near-of-kin, for whom he observes mourning rites, so does he rend in the presence of his near-of-kin, when the latter sustains a bereavement. In what respect? If his son's son dies, or his son's brother,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">After divorcing his wife, she remarried and had a son from her second husband, who is now a maternal brother to his own son.</i> or the mother<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">After having divorced her she died.</i> of his son, he is required to rend in the presence of his son.

Hence, she adopts the above procedure in order to avoid exposure of her chest, so that if men are present they should not be led to obscene thoughts. Although <i>Isserles</i> (<i>supra</i> par. 10) rules that the undermost garment is not rent, nevertheless, even exposure of the undermost garment may lead to obscenity — <i>ShaK.</i></i>

This reasoning finds support in <i>D.M.</i> on the authority of <i>N.Yos.</i>, who writes that if one sustains a bereavement and knows not who it is, and rends garments without specifying for whom he does this, and later discovers who it was, discharges his duty on the principle of <i>Bererah</i> (v.

Similarly here, according to the final report he received which verified the first tidings, the rending took place at the proper time. This, however, would not apply were he still alive at the time the first report was brought to him, for then it would be after the period of an utterance — <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i>. In the latter case he would have to recite again the benediction, ‘<i>Judge of Truth</i>’ — <i>Sede Ḥemed</i>. Regarding the seven day period of mourning which he observed partially, it may be stated that since the mourning took effect through his initial observance, he does not have to complete the days he missed unwillfully. They are, therefore, counted in as part of his period of mourning. This matter, however, requires further study (cf. <i>infra</i> § 396) — <i>ShaK</i>.</i>
[With respect to] a minor who suffered a bereavement, — [the law is that] we rend [his garment] for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. <i>ibid.</i> The reason given (<i>ibid</i>.) is in order to stir up grief. According to <i>Ghayyat</i> the law of rending the minor’s garments falls into the same category as all other religious duties into which minor children must be introduced. <i>B.Yos.</i> states that this is done even when the reason to stir up grief does not apply. <i>Derisha</i> holds that a minor who has reached the age when children are introduced into religious practices, must also observe all rites of mourning. This viewpoint is accepted by <i>Ta</i>Z. <i>ShaK</i> in <i>Nek. HaK</i>. rejects this comparison. His reason is that only when the minor becomes of age during the seven days of mourning does the problem arise whether he should observe seven complete days of mourning. But if he is still a minor (less than thirteen years plus one day) this problem does not apply. <i>D.Merb.</i> agrees with <i>ShaK.</i> His reason is that by requiring him to observe the mourning rites, we thereby cause him to neglect the study of the Torah, which is not so in the case of rending garments. Cf. <i>infra</i> § 396, 3, notes 10-11.</i>

One does not rend [garments] on a Festival day,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna, M.K. 24b.</i> even on the second Festival day of the Diaspora;<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XI, 1 and <i>N.</i> In the Diaspora every Festival which is observed for one day is kept for two days because of doubt. For example, Passover occurs on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan.</i> It was necessary, therefore, to know when the New Moon appears in order to determine when the Festival was to be fixed. This was done through the testimony of witnesses. However, this applied only to the thirtieth day of the month, but the thirty-first day could be consecrated even without the confirmation of witnesses, since the moon renewed itself about every twenty-nine and a half days. Those who lived in the Land of Israel proper were easily contacted through messengers who were sent out to inform the people whether the <i>Sanhedrin</i> in the city of Jerusalem had consecrated the thirtieth or the thirty-first day of the month, thus making the month just passed full or defective. Hence, those who lived in the Diaspora could not be informed in time and because of doubt observed two Festival days. E.g., Passover was kept on the fifteenth and the sixteenth of <i>Nisan.</i></i> even the near-of-kin of the dead. However, during <i>Hol ha-Moed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">125*</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.</i> one rends according to whatever the case may be, [viz.,] if one is present at the time of the departure of the soul, or if it is for a worthy person or for a scholar; for everyone according to the law as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. <i>ibid.</i>, Mishna and Gem.  <i>Mishna le-Melek</i>, Yad, <i>Ebel ibid.</i>, who writes that for one who died and was interred (by Gentiles) on the first Festival day, he is not permitted to rend garments during the Festival week (<i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>), but must postpone the rending until after the entire Festival is over, at which time mourning rites take effect. But if one suffered a bereavement during the Festival week, he is permitted to rend garments immediately after death at the moment of excitement (cf. O.Ḥ. § 547, 3) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that it is customary to rend</i> [<i>garments</i>] <i>during Hol ha-Moed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">125*</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.</i> <i>only for one's father and mother, and for all other dead one rends after the Festival</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ter.

And even with respect to the former opinion, not to rend garments during <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, it applies only if it is still possible to rend after the Festival, but where during the Festival the tidings are ‘near,’ and after the Festival they become ‘distant’, the law is that we rend during <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> — <i>BaḤ.</i> For ‘distant tidings one does not rend during <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, even for parents, since the mourning rites are over, consequently the rending is also not made — <i>RaShaL.</i> Cf.

One who received near tidings during a Festival [i.e., on <i>Hol ha-Moed</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">125*</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.</i> must rend [garments] even if after the Festival it becomes distant tidings.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>N.</i> According to the Talmud, rending of garments and observance of mourning for seven days are interrelated, ‘There is no rending without seven days (of mourning).’ It might have been thought that in the present case one should not rend garments, since the mourning rites will not be observed after the Festival but for one day, for then the tidings become distant. We are therefore, informed in this par. otherwise. For the interrelationship between rending and mourning applies only if one receives the death report on the Festival day proper, when it is forbidden to rend garments, and after the entire Festival it becomes distant tidings, at which time the mourning rites are completely suspended but for one day. In such a case only do we apply the aforementioned principle, ‘There is no rending without mourning.’ However, when near tidings are received during <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, when rending garments is permissible (v. <i>supra</i> par. 31), he rends even if it becomes distant tidings after the Festival. For the Festival merely interrupts the mourning rites but not the rending — <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK.</i></i>

Consequently, he mends the rent — <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK.</i></i> and returns the garment to him and compensates him for the damage done by the rent.

In our present case, it was the lender <span>משאיל</span> who approached the borrower to go and perform the condolence rites.

When, however, the person is legally not exempt, but there it an unavoidable interference, the <i>Tefillah</i> is temporarily suspended until the following service at which time a complementary prayer is said.</i> With respect to the <i>Habdalah</i>, one should recite [it] after the corpse is buried.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>R.

The words, ‘anytime during the week,’ are explained to mean until after the third day is ended.

Judah (<i>ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Tur</i> a.l.) who held that one should not recite the <i>Habdalah</i> after (burial.  <i>Ta</i>Z <i>infra</i> § 396 who disagrees with both views and advances another explanation. After burial when the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer is recited it is said only over a cup of wine without the fragrant spices and the candle. If the bereavement was sustained on a Festival day, the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer may be said only on the following day after burial, but not as in the case of the Sabbath where the law is that it may be said even until the third day. An <i>Onen</i> who was ignorant of this ruling and recited the <i>Habdalah</i> on the night following the Sabbath is not required to recite it again after burial — <i>P.Tesh.</i> On the question whether an <i>Onen</i> who has a child to be circumcised should perform the circumcision before or after burial, a difference of opinion exists among the <i>Codifiers.

However, if this is not feasible, the circumcision is performed first and the <i>Sandek</i> recites the benediction, and it matters not whether the circumcision is held during the prescribed time, i.e., on the eight day or later. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> accepts <i>RaShaL’s</i> ruling. <i>Bir.

Nowadays if a parent dies the wedding is postponed until after the seven days of mourning — <i>Ba’er Heteb, Ḥatam Sofer.</i> On the eve of Passover after midday it is permissible for a groom or bride who are in mourning to be married, since with the advent of the Passover Festival and the period of counting the <i>Omer</i> that follows it is forbidden to hold marriages. This is in accord with <i>Isserles’</i> ruling (v. <i>infra</i> § 399) that after midday on the eve of a Festival mourning rites have no legal effect, <i>contra ShaK</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). This applies to a groom who was never married before and did not yet comply with the duty of propagation — <i>Zekor le-Abraham, Net’a Sorek.</i> If they suffered a loss after the marriage was already performed, the groom must not perform the marital act until after the seven days of mourning, after which, follow the seven days of the wedding-feast (v. <i>infra</i> § 383). One who was in a dying condition and instructed his daughter’s marriage to take place and he died after the dutiful marital act had already been performed, the law is that the daughter is not permitted to attend the funeral, since it is already regarded as a Festival period for her, and were she to attend the funeral, it would be considered tantamount to observing mourning rites publicly on a Festival which is forbidden — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> and there are womens' perfumes and toilet [prepared] which are not durable,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaN ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Rashi ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ואביו של חתן</span>.</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>since there is no one</i> [<i>available</i>] <i>who will prepare for them a second time</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from Gemara <i>ibid.</i> — <i>G.</i></i>, they bring the corpse into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into a bridal chamber, and he performs the dutiful marital act and [then] separates [himself from her and they bury the corpse forthwith].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gemara <i>ibid.</i> This applies even if he married a woman who was married before.

This difficulty may be removed because the first day of a groom’s marriage is considered Biblical, for it is written, <i>‘In the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart’</i> (Song of Songs III, 11) — <i>Asheri.</i> Although an <i>Onen</i> is forbidden the use of the conjugal couch (v. <i>supra</i> § 341), the Rabbis were lenient in this case and put it on an equal footing with one who had given up hope of burying his dead in which case he is permitted to eat meat and drink wine and use the conjugal couch — <i>RITBA.</i></i> and after this he observes the seven days of mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As to the question of rending garments, there is a difference of opinion among the authorities. <i>MaHaRIL</i> (Laws of Mourning) states that the garments are rent after the seven days of the wedding-feast. <i>She’elath Yabeẓ</i> maintains that garments should be rent forthwith since it is not a Biblical Festival. <i>Sede Ḥemed</i> accepts <i>MaHaRIL’s</i> ruling. <i>Mishmereth Shalom</i> agrees with <i>Yabeẓ.</i></i> And the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast he observes matters pertaining to private [mourning], and he is forbidden to use the conjugal couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XI, 8. <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>RaBaD</i> writes that he is only forbidden to use the conjugal couch or to be alone with her, but the mixing of the cup, the making of the bed and the washing of his face, hands and feet are permitted to be done in each other’s presence. <i>ShaK</i> rejects this on the basis of numerous sources in the Talmud and Codes and extends the prohibition to embracing and kissing as well.</i> Therefore, the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast and the seven days of mourning, he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ket. <i>ibid.</i> According to our ruling today (v. <i>supra</i> c. 193 end) that after the dutiful marital act she is considered a <i>Niddah</i>, no guarding should be necessary.

A mere indication of suicide is not relied upon, unless the suicide’s previous actions clearly indicate such commision. b) It must be committed wilfully and clearheadedly. c) The expressed intention for such commision must be followed by the act proper. d) In the case of a person found hung, even if the surrounding circumstances lead one to believe that the person took his life, nevertheless, he is not considered a suicide — <i>P.Tesh.</i> If one was not seen going up to the roof-top to take his life in accord with his previous expressed intention, the law is that even if he was later found dead, he is not presumed to be a suicide (<i>RaSHaL</i>) — <i>ShaK.</i>  <i>supra</i> c.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>One who stole or robbed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that stealing or robbing are punishable by death in no way indicates that the culprit, being aware of the outcome of his crime, may have committed suicide, for it is quite possible that he might have thought that he would not be caught.

XII, 11 (v. also <i>ibid.</i> p. 241). that the accepted custom is to bury the corpse with fringes, provided some disqualification is made in them. The fringes are regarded as accessories of religious observances (<span>תשמישי מצוה</span>) which may be thrown away when disused, and hence in this case they do not have to be removed, <i>contra</i> Abba Saul who it seems considers them (i.e., the fringes) as accessories of holiness (<span>תשמישי קדושה</span>) which are usually stored away.  Meg. 26b. This opinion is also accepted by <i>RIBA</i> and <i>RaSHaL</i> (cited by <i>BaḤ</i>)<i>.</i> There are two more opinions regarding this problem, viz., that of <i>Ra’BIaH</i> who holds that one who observed the precept of <i>Ẓiẓith</i> during lifetime should be buried with <i>Ẓiẓith;</i> otherwise, he should not be buried with <i>Ẓiẓith;</i> and that of <i>R.

Furthermore, ‘diverse kinds’ are forbidden by the Torah only if they afford warmth to the individual, which is not applicable in the case of the dead. One who through no fault of his own but on account of unavoidable circumstances could not observe the precept of <i>Ẓiẓith</i> during his lifetime, may be buried in a <i>Talith</i>, provided he left sufficient funds with which to buy one.

A dead person who did not have [sufficient funds] for the burial needs and they raised [money] for his sake and there was a surplus; if at the time they collected the [money it was done specifically] for the needs of this particular dead person, [the surplus] should be given to his heirs; but if not [collected specifically for this particular person, the surplus] should be used for the needs of other dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Shek. II, 5. Although we accept the principle that ‘designation is not considered a reality’ (San. 47b; <i>supra</i> § 349, 1), and consequently, the surplus should not be prohibited for general use, neverthelss, since the deceased was put to shame through the public collection of funds for his funeral needs, we say that the dead forgives his humiliation for the sake of his heirs only (<i>ibid.</i> 48a; <i>supra</i> § 253, 6). It follows therefore, that a woman may not collect her marriage settlement (<i>Kethubah</i>), nor a creditor his debt, from this surplus — <i>A.H.</i> The collection refers to money or other articles for the sake of the dead — <i>ShaK.</i> If the collector withholds the surplus in order to erect a monument over the grave of the dead person, and the heir demands the surplus for himself, contending that many other graves are also without monuments, the surplus must be given to the heir, unless it is customary that all the members of the dead person’s family have monuments on their graves, in which case the collector may use the money for the monument — <i>P.Tesh.</i> Cf.

XXI, 23). Cf. <i>ibid.</i> 46b. Some hold that only the negative command is transgressed, since the positive command refers only to those executed by Court. Cf.

If there is a government law in force, forbidding burial immediately after death, the above prohibition does not apply.

They who carry the bier and they who relieve them and they who relieve these, both they who go before and they who follow the bier, — [the law is that] they who are needful for the bier are exempt (<i>from reciting the Shema</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.

Ber. <i>ibid.; Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>הכי גריס</span>; <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri.</i> According to these commentators the reading of the Mishnah is: <span>את שלמטה צורך בהם פטורים ואת שאין למטה צורך בהם חייבים</span> Thus also text in Y. a.l. <i>Rashi</i>, however, has the following reading: <span>את שלפני המטה צורך בהם פטורים ואת שלאחר המטה צורך בהם חייבים</span> according to which the obligation to carry the bier rests only upon those who go before the bier. Hence, only the are exempt, but not those who follow the bier, even if they are needful for the bier. <i>Caro</i> adopts <i>Maim.</i> interpretation. <i>Be’er Hagolah</i> states that the source of <i>Caro</i>’s ruling is the <i>Tur.</i> However, the latter’s interpretation is not quite the same as that of <i>Maim.</i>  <i>Eshel Abraham</i> to O.Ḥ. § 72, 1 where this ruling is also found. <i>Caro</i>’s ruling is applicable only in a city where there are special groups arranged to carry the bier, and since everyone wishes to take part in this religious duty, all are therefore exempt from reading the <i>Shema</i>, even those who stand at a distance, on the principle that ‘One who is engaged in a religious duty is exempt from performing another religious duty’ (Suk. 25a). But if there are no special groups arranged to carry the bier, only those who are in proximity of the bier are exempt, since they participate in carrying the bier, but not those who are at a distance — <i>M.Abr.</i> and Mishna Ber. <i>ibid.</i></i> and the others who follow the corpse, who are not needful for the bier, are not exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> O.Ḥ. § 72 — <i>G.</i> Although escorting the dead (<span>הלוית המת</span>) is a religious duty which falls into the category of ‘deeds of love’ (<span>גמילות חסדים</span>) which is Biblical and should alone suffice to exempt one from the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, yet, since those who merely escort the dead are not regarded as being busily engaged or troubled (<span>טרודים</span>), they can manage to read the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> in a standing position with the proper intention, and the rest of the <i>Shema</i> while walking. In any case they are exempt from reciting the <i>Tefillah.</i> Cf. O.Ḥ. § 106.</i>
The corpse is not brought out [for burial] close to [the prescribed period] for the reading of the <i>Shema</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to one opinion this means half an hour prior to the prescribed period for reading the <i>Shema.</i> The expression ‘close to’ employed here is similar to the expression ‘close to <i>Minḥah’</i> found in Pes. 99b. Hence, in the morning, since the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> in the first instance (<span>לכתחילה</span>) is ‘when one sees his friend at a distance of four cubits and recognizes him,’ until the ‘sparklings of the rising sun’ appear (Ber. 9b; O.Ḥ. § 58, 1; § 89, 1), a corpse may be taken out for burial at least half an hour before this period. Otherwise, we apprehend that there will be insufficient time to complete the burial and read the <i>Shema</i> in time — <i>Disciples of R. Jonah</i> (Ber. 19a). In Y.Ber. III, 2(6b) one hour is mentioned, which is explained (v. <i>R. Jonah ibid.</i>) to mean, as long as there is sufficient time to complete the burial before the prescribed period arrives. Hence, ‘close to’ does not refer to the half hour period. In Y. <i>ibid.</i> the following question is raised: Since we learn in the following Mishna (Ber. <i>ibid</i>.): ‘When they have buried the dead and returned, if they can begin (the <i>Shema</i>) and complete it before reaching the (mourners’) line, they begin it; but if they can not, they do not begin it,’ it follows that the <i>Shema</i> is never read during the time that the corpse is borne for the purpose of burial (for as we have seen one must take the corpse out for burial prior to the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i>). Consequently, we may ask, why does the Mishnah make a distinction with respect to the <i>Shema</i> at the time the corpse is carried out for burial? In order to remove this apparent difficulty, Y. <i>ibid.</i> explains that it applies only to a case where they thought that there was ample time to complete the burial before the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i> arrived, and they erred. In Ber. <i>ibid.</i> it is stated that it refers to a distinguished person who may be taken out for burial even close to the prescribed period for the reading of the <i>Shema.</i> The custom today is to take out the corpse for burial after the morning Service at the Synagogue is over, so that many people will be able to attend the burial — <i>B.Hillel.</i> Cf. <i>G.</i> anon.</i> whenever there is no time to bring him out [and] to bury him before the time for the reading of the <i>Shema</i> arrives; but if they had [already] commenced to bring him out, they do not desist<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>supra</i> n. 3.</i> in order to read [the <i>Shema</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ber. 19a; Y.Ber.

III, 19). Cremation is forbidden according to Jewish Law.  <i>Beth Yiẓḥak</i>; <i>Eben Yekarah; ‘Arugoth Habosem; Imre Yosher</i> and others who strongly prohibit cremation. One who left instructions to be cremated after death is regarded as one who dissociates himself from the practices of the Congregation and is considered a heretic. Hence, he has the same status as those for whom one does not observe <i>Aninuth</i> or mourning rites. The ashes of a cremated person are forbidden to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. On the question of cremation cf. also lengthy article by Dr. H. Higger, appended to his <i>Halakoth Wa-Agadoth</i> pp. 161-183.</i>

Cf. B.B. 101a-b according to which burial in an upright position is regarded as the burial of asses. If a corpse is placed in an upright or sitting position it is considered disrespectful. It is customary to cover the top of the coffin and not to throw earth directly on the corpse, which would be considered disgraceful — <i>ShaK.</i>  however, <i>Tur</i> who quotes <i>Resp.</i> of <i>R.

Hence, the thickness of the wall of the grotto was half a cubit. Accordingly, some rule (v. <i>R. A. Eger; G.Mah.; Yad Abraham</i> and others) that the intervening wall should be one cubit in thickness. This follows the opinion of the First Tanna in the Mishna ibid. <i>Caro</i> here and in <i>B.Yos.</i> seems to rule in accord with the opinion of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel (<i>ibid.</i>  <i>W.G.</i> a.l.) that everything depends upon the quality of the intervening earth or rock. If it is hard, one may make more sepulchral chambers, since less intervening space for the walls would be required. On the other hand, if the earth is soft, more space would be required for the intervening walls. Hence, the number of grottos would be less. <i>P.Tesh.</i> states that the custom to bury the dead close to each other stems from the fact the land available to us for cemeteries is quite limited.  <i>Ta</i>Z § 364, n. 2. <i>A.H.</i> rules that legally no specific thickness for the intervening wall is required.

Meg. 29a and <i>infra</i> § 363, 1, according to which even natural soil of burial grounds is forbidden for profitable use and consequently contradicts the present ruling. <i>B.Hillel</i> therefore, explains that in our case (Gemara San. <i>ibid.</i>) where it is reported that Samuel permitted people to take earth from Rab’s grave and apply it as a remedy on the first day of an attack of fever, we deal with natural soil taken from a grave and applied as a remedy only, which is permissible; whereas in the other passage (Gemara Meg. <i>ibid.</i>) the natural soil was not used for a remedial purpose, and consequently, is forbidden for profitable use, not because legally this is so, but rather because this is considered disrespectful treatment of the dead.

If they found a slain Israelite, they may bury him [in the same condition] as they found him, [viz.,] without shrouds, and they do not even remove his shoes.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Thus they do</i> [<i>with respect</i>] <i>to a woman in confinement who died, or regarding a person who fell down</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., from a roof top.</i> <i>and died</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MaHaRIL</i> s. 65 — <i>G.</i> If there was bleeding, the <i>Tohorah</i> (v. Glos.) should not be performed, for the blood which also requires burial (v. <i>infra</i>) will thereby be removed. The dead person should therefore be buried in his clothes. This applies only if the person died while wearing his clothes, but if after suffering a fall, the person was confined to bed and died some days later, after his clothes were removed, and there was no bleeding, the <i>Tohorah</i> is performed and the corpse is wrapped in shrouds as usual. There is however, a distinction to be made between the case of one who fell from a roof top and one who was murdered. In the latter case, even if the blood flow had ceased when the corpse was found, he is buried in the condition he was found in order ‘to raise our anger’ and possibly avenge the slain person; whereas in the former case where the person fell from a roof top, this is not applicable. Similarly, in the case of a woman who died in confinement, and the blood flow still continues, we bury her in the garments she wore at the time of death. But if death occurred some days or weeks later, at which time the blood flow had already ceased, we deal with her as with other dead and bury her in shrouds. A further reason for burying a slain person in his clothes is that there is fear that at least a fourth of a <i>Log</i> (v. Glos.) of blood that escaped, — the smallest quantity required to sustain life, — is absorbed in the clothes. Hence, he should be buried in his clothes. For the very same reason even the shoes should not be removed, since there may be a similar quantity absorbed in them. Even the earth surrounding him, which absorbed blood, should be buried. The same principle would therefore apply to one who fell from a roof top, or in the case of a house which collapsed upon a person, or a confinement case, where there was a flow of blood, and consequently there is an absorption thereof in the garments, — in all these cases, since there is an absorption of blood in the garments, — they should be buried with the corpse. This would not apply to one who froze to death or was drowned, for since there was no flow of bloood, they are buried in shrouds as usual — <i>MaHaRIL</i> (<i>ibid</i>.), <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i>.  <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> <i>Some say that they wrap them over their garments</i> [<i>with</i>] <i>shrouds</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hag.

And even if the precept of <i>Ẓiẓith</i> is considered temporarily suspended, then later, when they are untied, the <i>Ẓiẓith</i> are invalid, for it would not be in keeping with the principle, <i>‘Thou shalt make’</i> (Deut.

A <i>Kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.</i> is forbidden to enter beneath an overshadowed space<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘a tent.’ Uncleanness through overshadowing (<span>טומאת אהל</span>) takes place in one of three ways: a) when a person or a vessel or food are present together with a corpse (or an olive’s bulk from a corpse) under the same roof space. In this case another object (the roof) forms a tent over the person etc. and the corpse (<span>דבר אחר מאהיל עליו ועל המת</span>); b) when a corpse or an olive’s bulk from a corpse overshadow from above, a person or vessels beneath. In this case the corpse forms the tent; c) when the person is present above the corpse or the olive’s bulk from a corpse. In this case the person overshadows. Cf. Num. XIX, 14.</i> under which there is a corpse, even if it is very large;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Meg. 26b a.e.</i> and [he is] even [forbidden to enter] into another [adjoining] house or another [adjoining] upper storey, which open into that house by means of an opening a square handbreadth in size, and [the prohibition also applies to entering] a house [which opens] into that [latter] house ad infinitum.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Ohol. III, 6-7 from which the following principles are derived: a) If a corpse lies in a room, whatever is within the room suffers corpse-uncleanness, and if the room has many doors or exits, even if they are closed, all objects which lie beneath the lintels of these doors or exits become unclean, because we assume that the corpse may be removed through any one of the exits, at which time the corpse and the objects will be together under the lintels, and the objects will suffer uncleanness through overshadowing (v. <i>supra</i> n. 1a). Hence, we regard the objects and the corpse as if they were already present under the lintels of the door or exits. But if we know through which exit the corpse will be removed, then only that particular exit suffers uncleanness, not the others. This means that that particular exit saves the objects beneath the other exits from uncleanness through overshadowing. The minimum size of such an exit must be one handbreadth square for an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the room, to prevent uncleanness from spreading to the other exits, and a minimum of four handbreadths square opening will prevent the uncleanness from spreading to the other exits in the case where an entire corpse is present in the room. The reason for the different sizes regarding the openings, depends upon the size of the uncleanness, for it is feasible to remove an olive’s bulk from a corpse through an opening one handbreadth square, and an entire corpse through an opening four handbreadths square (v. also Ohol. VII, 3); b) If there are two adjoining houses or rooms and in the intervening wall there is an opening of one handbreadth square, and in one of the houses or rooms there is a corpse or an olive’s bulk from a corpse, the uncleanness passes to the adjoining room or house in which all objects become unclean. In this case the opening need not be more than a square handbreadth in order to give passage to the uncleanness of an entire corpse; c) An object (e.g., a board) which is one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high (i.e., between the board above and the olive’s bulk from a corpse which lies beneath, there is a space of not less than one handbreadth), brings uncleanness to other objects in the same space and forms a partition against uncleanness to objects above it. But if the roof (i.e., the top of the board) is less than one handbreadth high, the uncleanness breaks through the solid matter and rises and goes down. Cf. Ohol. VI, 6; VII, 1-2; IX, 13, 14, 16; X, 6-7; XII, 6-7; XV, 1, 3, 7. <i>ShaK</i> states that the wife of a <i>Kohen</i>, who is pregnant may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ and there is no fear that she may give birth to a male child who would then be forbidden to be present there, for a double doubt exists: a) perhaps it will be a non-viable birth to which this apprehension does not apply, or b) if it is a viable birth, perhaps it will be a female child. This point, however, is questioned on the principle that ‘a clean object that has been swallowed (in this case, the child within the mother) cannot be rendered unclean’ (<span>טהרה בלועה</span>) (Hul. 71a). Consequently, the following explanation of the above case is offered: We deal here with a case where the time for giving birth has already approached, and there is fear that the child might push out its head and be regarded as born and hence is not regarded as a ‘swallowed object.’ Consequently, since there is a double doubt, the pregnant wife of the <i>Kohen</i> may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ — <i>P.Tesh.</i> Uncleanness is not conveyed through many openings which together make up one square handbreadth, e.g., in the case of trellis-work. The square handbreadth must be open in one spot for the uncleanness to pass through. Otherwise, the opening is considered stopped up (cf. Ohol. XIII, 1) — <i>Ta</i>Z, <i>ShaK.</i></i> But if one stopped up the opening, it is permissible for him to enter the other [adjoining] house, for the closure forms a partition [against the uncleanness], even if one has not renounced ownership therein<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">e., in the object which serves as a closure.</i> so that it remain there forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Mishna and Gemara Shab. 157a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>,הלקטי קטנה</span>.

VI, 2 and cf O.Ḥ § 629, 8. <i>Ta</i>Z reports the ruling of a certain authority in the following case which he analyses and rejects: There was an uncleanness in a house adjoining a Synagogue, which passed through the [Synagogue window in the women’s section, and a ruling was given by a certain authority, that in order to form a partition against the uncleanness, the window opening should be stopped up by the curtain which served as a partition between the men’s and women’s section, and was suspended on iron hooks. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes this ruling (v. however, <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> who accepts it) and claims that it is erroneous for the following reasons: a) According to the Mishna Ohol. VIII, 1, a sheet or a mat form a partition against uncleanness only if spread out tentwise, which is not the case here, and hence, the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness of the adjoining house (v. <i>R. Samson of Sens ibid.</i> and Yad, <i>Tumath Meth</i> XIII); b) The reason that the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness is because the law states that vessels (in this case the curtain hooks) cannot form a partition, since the curtain without the hooks would not remain suspended. Consequently, the main items are the hooks and not the curtain (v. Yad <i>Tumath Meth</i> XVIII; B.B. 19b s.v. <span>רואין</span>  this note beg.) c) A partition formed by a door or window that cannot stand without the support of metal hinges is not considered valid (although the hinges are considered as attached to the ground and do not contract uncleanness.  Kel. XI, 2 and cf. Ohol. VI, 2). Hence, the same applies with respect to the curtain and the hooks. <i>ShaK</i>, however, rejects this. Cf. <i>G.Mah.</i> A closure of trellis-work in a metal door does not prevent passage of uncleanness (v. <i>ShaK</i> who modifies this ruling) — <i>Ta</i>Z. It is permissible for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by train, although there is a possibility that a corpse is being transported. Likewise, is it permitted for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by plane, although the plane passes over burial grounds — <i>Sh.M.B.</i> (vol IV, p. 278-9).</i>
A hatchway<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ohol. X, 1ff. Quite a number of laws are enumerated <i>ibid.</i> with respect to overshadowing in connection with hatchways, yet the present law is stated because it contains a novel ruling, viz., that it is permissible to enter the ground floor where the uncleanness is found, and not the upper storey — <i>B.Yos.</i></i> that is between a house [a ground floor] and an upper storey, and there is not in it an opening of a [square] handbreadth [in size], and an olive's bulk from a corpse is in the house directly beneath the hatchway, — [the law is that] the house [ground floor] is clean and the upper storey is unclean<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the uncleanness breaks through and rises (<span>טומאה בוקעת ועולה</span> v. Ohol. VI, 6), since it lies directly under the hatchway, despite the fact that the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size. The uncleanness does not spread to the sides of the ground floor, for it has an opening above in order to rise — <i>ShaK.</i> The uncleanness does not cleave downwards, back into the lower floor, since the opening is less than a square handbreadth (<i>Asheri</i>). And again, since there is only an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the ground floor, the law is that although the uncleanness will eventually be removed through the door opening, the ground floor does not become unclean now, because the uncleanness which rose to the upper storey, is already regarded as present in the public domain, for the opening is less than a square handbreadth. Hence, we may infer that if a room in a ground floor has no roof space over it (but there is a roof over the upper storey. Thus <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> on <i>Ta</i>Z), it is forbidden for a <i>Kohen</i> to be present in any part of the ground floor, for since the uncleanness will ultimately be removed through the door opening of this uncovered ground-room, the uncleanness cleaves back into it and thence through the door opening, for it must be borne in mind that the entire ground-room is uncovered unlike above where the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size (v. <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i>) — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i>.

However, if each room has a separate door leading to the outside, and it is intended to remove the corpse through the door of the inner room the <i>Kohen</i> is permitted to remain in the outer room. Likewise is it permissible to keep the corpse in a cellar which has a separate door leading to the outside. But if the cellar has no door leading to the outside, and the corpse will ultimately be removed through the house, two conditions must be fulfilled in order to permit the <i>Kohen</i> to remain in the house above the cellar, viz., a) that there should be an opening in the cellar at least four handbreadths square, and b) that there should be no overshadowing space a handbreadth in width over the cellar opening. So too, if the corpse is in an upper storey that has an opening through which the corpse will be removed, and the opening has no overshadowing space above it, <i>Kohanim</i> are then permitted to remain on the ground floor.

Hence, we infer from this that he may defile himself for his near-of-kin even in the case where the defilement is not required for the corpse’s needs, e.g., preparation of shrouds etc. Accordingly, this defilement is considered obligatory — <i>ShaK.</i></i> And some say, only for the requirements [of the corpse].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., all burial requirements, such as a coffin, shrouds etc. But if these are not required, the <i>Kohen</i> may not defile himself for them — <i>ShaK.</i>  Pes. 8a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>בשפחתו</span> end; Nid. 15b, Tosaf. s.v. <span>ובא</span> end.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And according to the former opinion, even if he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kohen.</i></i> <i>suffered a bereavement on the Sabbath where it is impossible to bury him the same day</i> [<i>on account of the Sabbath</i>], <i>he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kohen.</i></i> <i>is permitted to defile himself for him and guard him so that he should not lie in disgrace.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ter. ha-Deshen</i> s. 283 — <i>G.</i></i> <i>It is proper to adopt the stringent view according to the latter opinion</i> [<i>viz.</i>,] <i>that he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kohen.</i></i> <i>should defile himself only for the requirements of the burial</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">On a weekday the <i>Kohen</i> may be present in the house where his dead near-of-kin lies awaiting burial, even if there are others who attend to the burial needs, since there may be something with respect to the burial needs concerning which his presence is required.

According to the former, it refers to the cover or lid of the coffin ; according to the latter, to the stone placed upon the grave (this should not be confused with the tombstone). From <i>Rashi</i>’s interpretation it might appear that once the coffin is covered in the house, the <i>Kohen</i> should not be permitted to defile himself for the corpse (since this would be regarded as the closing of the <i>Golel</i>), but in reality, <i>Rashi</i> too, it may be shown from Shab. 152a refers to the closing of the <i>Golel</i> when the coffin is placed in the grave. Hence, it follows that even in accordance with <i>Rashi</i>’s interpretation of <i>Golel</i>, the <i>Kohen</i> may defile himself for his near-of-kin while the coffin stands covered in the house — <i>ShaK.</i></i> <i>And if his intention is to clear him away</i> [<i>therefrom</i>], <i>he is permitted to defile himself for him for the sake of</i> [<i>his</i>] <i>needs until the closing of the second Golel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA Resp.</i> s. 292 — <i>G.</i>, as in the case of mourning rites (<i>infra</i> § 375, 3).</i>

Therefore, a <i>Kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos.</i> who suffered a bereavement must be careful and bury him [the corpse] at the end of the cemetery, so that he should not [have] to enter the cemetery and will not [thereby] defile himself through other graves when he buries his dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> Yad, <i>Ebel</i> II, 15.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And</i> [<i>this applies</i>] <i>only after he departs from his dead, but while he attends to his dead, he is permitted to defile himself even for other</i> [<i>corpses</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Derived from Sem(H).

Huna (Naz. <i>ibid.</i>) the law rests with R. Tarfon. Furthermore, when an anonymous opinion is recorded in the Mishna (as in Naz. <i>ibid.</i>) followed by a difference of opinion in a Baraitha, the ruling is in accordance with the anonymous opinion of the Mishna, which in our case is in agreement with R. Tarfon. Cf. also Nid. 57a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>ודילמא</span> for a similar view.  However, Y.Naz. III, 5(52d) where R. Tarfon agrees with R. Akiba.  <i>W.G.</i> a.l. There is no prohibition against the <i>Kohen</i> defiling himself for another corpse while on his way to attend to the burial rites. It is only on his return after having completed the burial of his near-of-kin, at which time he comes in contact with other graves, that the prohibition takes effect. <i>BaḤ</i> rules that the prohibition exists even when he is on his way to the cemetery, for he can bury his dead at the end of the cemetery grounds and not have to come within proximity of other graves.

If, however, the family chief accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain at home count from the time that the corpse is interred. b) <i>Tosaf.</i> adopts a stringent view, viz., that if the family chief accompanies the corpse, everyone counts from the time of burial (similar to <i>Asheri</i>), but if he remains here, then those who remain with him commence the observance of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse are required to begin the observance of formal mourning from the time of burial. However, those who accompany the corpse should observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, although the seven day period of formal mourning begins for them after burial. c) <i>Caro:</i> If the chief of the family accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain here count from the time of burial, from which it follows that if the family chief remains here, we revert to the first ruling recorded at the outset of this par. viz., that those who remain here begin to count the seven days of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse from the time of burial. Hence, <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation is in accord neither with a) nor b). For according to b) even if the family chief remains here, those who accompany the corpse, it is true, commence the observance of formal mourning from burial, but they are also required to observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, and according to a) if the family chief remains here, then all, — even those who accompany the corpse, begin the counting of the seven days of mourning from the time the corpse leaves. <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation may be the result of a) a different reading in Y. <i>ibid.</i>, or b) he follows <i>Maim</i>. in Yad <i>ibid</i>. and makes no distinction regarding the family chief and consequently does not take into consideration the stringency of <i>Tosaf.</i> — <i>ShaK. A.H. Caro</i>’s ruling, viz., that when the family chief accompanied the corpse, even those who remain here count from the time of burial, applies only if the family chief will reach the burial place within three days, otherwise they begin counting forthwith and the family chief from burial (v. M.K. 22a) — <i>ShaK.</i>  <i>infra</i> § 399, 14 where <i>Caro</i> rules that ‘one who suffered a bereavement on the eve of a Festival day and he was afraid lest he have not sufficient time to bury the corpse prior to the advent of the Festival whilst it is still day and gave the corpse over to Gentiles to attend to the burial, the law is that as soon as they carry the corpse out of the city and he can no longer be seen by the near-of-kin, mourning takes effect upon him, and if it is one hour prior to the Festival and he observed mourning rites therein, the restrictions of the seven days become annulled although he was buried on the Festival proper.’ This means that even if the corpse was buried on the Festival, in which case mourning is usually postponed until after the Holiday period is over, yet, since the corpse was transferred to the Gentiles prior to the advent of the Festival, it is considered as if the burial had taken place before the Festival and the seven days of mourning become annulled. This presents a difficulty. For in the present ruling it is implied (v. <i>supra</i> n. 7) that if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the city, the mourning period begins from the time of burial.

This apparent contradiction is removed only if we assume that <i>Caro</i> holds that in the case of a Festival the law is different, since from the moment the Jew transfers the corpse to the Gentiles for burial we regard the corpse as having been already interred which is similar to the case of one who is taken out for burial to another city where mourning rites begin from the moment they turn away their faces — <i>D.Merb.</i></i> The chief of the family<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 22a.</i> means the one upon whom [the people of] the household depend and who are guided by him, irrespective whether he is a brother or a young son.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Asheri, Tur</i> a.o.

As to the observance of mourning rites, the above principle applies (v. <i>infra</i> § 395) ; e) One who is within his thirty days of mourning and one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> each have a right to recite one <i>Kaddish;</i> f) One who is within his thirty days of mourning takes precedence over one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, although the latter has a right to recite one <i>Kaddish</i> (v. however, <i>supra</i> n. 45) ; g) If there are many observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, the one who is within his thirty days is overridden; h) If there are many observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> and one who is within his seven days of mourning, the latter has a right to one <i>Kaddish</i> and the others cast lots; i) If there are many who are within their thirty days of mourning, one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> and one within his twelve month period of mourning, the latter is overridden entirely, and all the <i>Kaddishim</i> of that day belong to the one observing <i>Yahrzeit;</i> j) The <i>Kaddish</i> recited after the daily Psalm (<span>שיר של יום</span>) and after the Sabbath Psalm (<span>מזמור שיר ליום השבת</span>) belong to the mourners.

A mourner is forbidden to eat of his own at the first meal [after burial],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 27b in accord with R. Judah on the authority of Rab. Derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <i>‘And eat thou not the bread of men’</i> (Ezek. XXIV, 17) whence it follows that for others it is done. Should others, however, not provide him with the first meal, or in the case where he is the only Jewish resident in town, he may eat of his own — <i>Ta</i>Z. Some explain that the reason the first meal is provided by others is that usually the mourner immediately after burial refuses to eat and in some cases prefers death — <i>Perisha.</i> The main part of the mourner’s meal is the bread as may be seen from the verse in Ezek. <i>ibid.</i>, but he may eat other dishes of his own even at the first meal — <i>A.H.</i> It is customary to bring him bread with eggs or lentils. Cf. B.B. 16b where it is stated that on the day that Abraham our father died, Jacob made a broth of lentils to comfort his father Isaac (v. Gen. XXV, 29-30 and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.), and the reason it was of lentils is that ‘just as the lentil has no mouth (i.e., no cleft), so too, the mourner has no mouth (i.e., for speech)’. Others say, ‘Just as the lentil is round, so too, mourning rolls and goes around to all the denizens of this world.’ The practical difference between these two explanations is whether we should comfort with eggs, which have no cleft, but are not perfectly round. Hence, according to the first reason offered in the Talmud (B.B. <i>ibid.</i>) one may provide the mourner’s meal with eggs. Some of the <i>Later Authorities</i> hold that also beverages should be provided by others at the first mourner’s meal — <i>Leḥem ha-Panim</i>.</i> but at the second [meal] he is permitted [to eat of his own] even on the first day [of mourning].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus also <i>Tur</i> and <i>Asheri</i> who explain that the words, ‘on the first day’ mentioned in M.K. <i>ibid.</i> apply only to the first meal. Cf. Pes. 36a where the expression ‘first day’ (<span>יומא קמא</span>) refers to one meal. So also <i>Hag. Maim. Ebel</i> IV, 9 citing <i>SeMaG</i>, for the underlying principle is that we follow the lenient authority in laws of mourning (M.K. 18a; ‘Er. 46a a.e.). <i>Tosaf.</i> (M.K. 20b s.v. <span>שכבר</span> and 27b s.v. <span>יום</span>) maintain that the mourner must be provided with all the meals he requires on the first day, for they take ‘first day’ to mean the meals of the entire day.</i> A religious duty rests upon his neighbours to provide food for him of their own in order that he should not eat of his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Y.M.K III, 5(82b).

Meir of Rothenberg.</i> Cf. Lev. R. VI, 3 and Lam. R.

When she provides other women with the mourner’s meal, she does not have to obtain her husband’s consent, for this is considered a small matter for which the husband’s approval is unnecessary.  Ḥ.M. § 358 and <i>supra</i> § 248. However, if the husband refuses, she may not bring the mourner’s meal to other women. If both the husband and the wife are mourners, men are permitted to provide the mourner’s meal for both, since the meal in this case is provided mainly for the husband, and indirectly she eats too — <i>A.H.</i> For the same reason, one who obligated himself to feed his son and daughter-in-law or his daughter and son-in-law, and mourning befell them, the latter may not eat of his food — <i>A.H.</i></i> So too, one who has [in his employment] a scribe or a hired man, if [each of them] receives meals as his payment, and mourning befell him, he should not eat the first meal of his employer.

Furthermore, this (viz., that during the seven days the mourner has priority) applies only if both the mourner and the comforter are of equal distinction, but if the head of the house is a mourner and there is a guest present, or even if the guest is a mourner, then the law is that if the head of the house desires to lead in the saying of grace and to recite the blessing over the cup (even after the seven days), he has a right to do so — <i>P.Tesh.</i> and <i>Later Codifiers.</i></i>

If a buyer should suffer a loss on account of the seller who is in mourning, the latter is permitted to sell through the agency of others, and it is quite possible that even the mourner himself may sell directly — <i>P.Tesh.</i> A distinction should be made between two kinds of business deals, viz., a) In the case of a business deal in which the mourner became interested only incidentally, but his main livelihood is derived from other sources, the law is that he is permitted to transact this incidental deal through the agency of others only when he suffers a loss if it is postponed; b) In the case of one, however, whose permanent source of income depends upon such transactions, even the prospective profit may be considered on the same footing as the principal, for the individual depends upon it for his livelihood. Consequently, the prohibition applies only in the case where he would make more profit now than later. But if, at present, he would make the same profit as later, it is permissible to sell through the agency of others, since there is also the possibility that later he will not make any profit at all — <i>A.H.</i></i> Yet, if caravans or ships arrived,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, if the market day coincides with his seven days of mourning, even if it is on a small scale, he is permitted to transact business through the agency of others.

Two [individuals who were] partners in a shop,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘who are shopkeepers.’</i> and mourning befell one of them, close their shop so that the [other] partner should not do work publicly, but he may do work privately in his house, even work pertinent to the partnership. But if the mourner is a prominent person and the partnership is called by his name, so that even if [the other partner] will do work in his own house it is known that the mourner has a share in it, — [the law is that] the other partner is forbidden to do work even in his house.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Y.M.K. III, 5(82) bot. where the ruling is mentioned that ‘two partners … must close their shop.’ However, from M.K. 11b in the case of Marion, the son of Rabin and Mar, the son of R. Aḥa, it appears that only in the case of a distinguished person we would rule thus, but not in other cases. This apparent contradiction is removed by <i>RaBaD</i> as follows: In Y. we deal with work done publicly (cf. the term <span>חנות</span> -shop used <i>ibid.</i>), whereas in B. it refers to work carried on privately. Hence, Caro’s ruling here. There are many authorities who adopt a lenient view with respect to partnership. Moreover, the leniency is extended even to cases where the shop belongs to the mourner alone, on the principle that it is impossible to keep one’s shop closed for the entire week which would entail great losses. The question, however, may be raised, — on what basis is such a leniency adopted? For even drawing up a bill of sale between the mourner and his partner or any other person, would not be helpful since the reason for the prohibition is on account of ‘appearance sake’ (<span>מראית עין</span>) and consequently, people will still know that the shop belongs to the mourner. <i>RaShaL</i> (<i>Resp.</i> 66) is lenient in this matter after three days (and part of the third day is considered a full day). Yet <i>Maim.</i> in Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 9 states that the prohibition remains in force for seven days. <i>A.H.</i> advances the following argument in favour of the lenient practice: With respect to a matter which entails an irretrievable loss if postponed, we find that mourning and <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> are on an equal footing (v. O.Ḥ. § 539 where it is stated that if the market day falls on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the individual may sit in his shop). Hence, we see that if a loss is involved, the question of conducting business publicly does not enter. Similarly, in the case of mourning. In Prague it was customary to dissolve the partnership or to transfer one’s business by means of <span>קנין סודר</span>, i.e., a legal form of acquisition by handing over an article (e.g., a scarf) from one party to the other as a symbol that the object itself has been transferred. Some would transfer the business while still in the observance of <i>Aninuth;</i> others, whilst the person was in his dying condition.  also <i>P.Tesh.</i> and <i>Later Authorities.</i></i>

In what manner is bathing [forbidden]?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 15b, derived from, <i>‘And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner etc… and annoint not thyself with oil’</i> (II Sam.

The undefined term <span>רחיצה</span> (bathing) refers to warm water (v. Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) ; cf. <i>infra</i> § 399 and O.H. § 549). Moreover, bathing in cold water is not considered pleasure (<span>תענוג</span>) — <i>ShaK. D.Merb.</i> and <i>R. A. Eger</i> maintain <i>contra ShaK</i> that even in cold water it is permissible to bathe only one’s face, hands and feet, but the entire body should not be bathed in cold water for thirty days. <i>A.H.</i> agrees with <i>ShaK. Or Zaru‘a</i> explains that this prohibition regarding bathing within the thirty days is on account of combing the hair, which is forbidden within the thirty days. But since we permit combing of the hair today (v. <i>infra</i> § 390), it would be permissible to bathe after seven days. <i>RaShaL’s</i> reason for the prohibition of bathing is on account of hair-cutting. Hence, bathing should be forbidden just as hair-cutting is. On <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, however, we find that hair-cutting is forbidden and bathing is permitted. This difficulty may be removed on the grounds that on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the prohibition of hair-cutting applies to everyone as a result of which people will remember and be careful. Consequently, bathing is permitted. But in the case of mourning, it applies only to the individual mourner. Hence, there is fear lest he forget (cf.

A mourner throughout the seven days [of mourning] is forbidden to read the Pentateuch, Prophets or Hagiographa, [or to study] <i>Mishna, Gemara, Halakoth</i> or <i>Aggadoth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Glos. for Heb. terms. M.K. 15a, 21a, derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <i>‘Sigh in silence.’</i> (Ez. XXIV, 17). According to Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) this ruling is derived from Job II, 13, <i>‘And none spoke a word to him,’</i> where <i>‘a word’</i> is taken in the sense of Torah. The study of the Torah is forbidden throughout the seven days contrary to the opinion of some authorities who hold that the prohibition against Torah-study should last for one day only as in the case of <i>Tefillin</i> (v. <i>infra</i> § 388). The underlying reason for the prohibition is that the study of the Torah affords one joy (cf. Ps. XIX; CXIX, vv. 14, 16, 24, 47). Hence, the prohibition applies to the entire week. Cf. also M.K. 21a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אלו</span> and <i>T.H.</i> A mourner is permitted to read Job, Lamentations, the sad parts of Jeremiah and the Laws of Mourning (<i>infra</i> par. 4).

On the fast day of the ninth of Ab (<i>Tish’a be-Ab</i>), a mourner may be called to the reading of the Torah or to recite the <i>Haftarah</i>, since everyone is then in mourning and only the study of calamitous topics is permitted — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> If, however, the public have need of him<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 21a.

There is no contradiction between these two rulings. The ruling (<i>infra</i>) with respect to a <i>Kohen</i>-mourner on the Sabbath is due to the fact that on the Sabbath public mourning alone is forbidden. Hence, if the <i>Kohen</i> is not called to the reading of the Torah, it would indicate that he is observing public mourning which is forbidden on the Sabbath. The present ruling applies to a weekday when the study of the Torah is forbidden both privately and publicly — <i>ShaK.</i></i> [as <i>Kohen</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Or a Levite.

A mourner is required to muffle the head,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 15a, derived from, ‘<i>And cover not thine upper lip’</i> (Ez.

Hai Gaon</i>, derived from the dictum of Samuel, ‘a covering that is not like the covering of the Ishmaelites (up to the lips) is not a mourner’s covering’ (M.K. 24a), and also from R. Naḥman who demonstrated this by covering himself up in his mantle up to the sides of the beard (<i>ibid.</i>). Only the nose and eyes remained exposed. Cf. also Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) top, ‘From this we learn that the mourner should cover his mouth. But let him cover his mouth from beneath? — So that they should not say, he has an ailing on his mouth (and therefore ties it up).’ On muffling the head with a mantle or a piece of cloth, cf. <i>T.H.</i> on the authority of <i>R. Mattathias Gaon</i>, derived from M.K. (<i>ibid.</i>) in the case of Abaye and R. Joseph.</i> And this [matter, viz.,] that a mourner is required to muffle [his head] all day, applies [only when he is alone], but when comforters come to him, he uncovers his head out of respect to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On the authority of <i>T.H.</i>, derived from Sem(H).

A mourner is required to overturn the couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 15a-b, 27a: ‘A mourner is required to overturn his couch (bed), for Bar Kappara taught. “I (the Lord) had placed my image among you, and for your sins I upset it; upset now your beds”’ (cf. Ez. XXIV, 23). In Y.Ber. III, 1(6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(83a) this is derived from Job. II, 13, <i>‘So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days.’</i> It was customary in those days for people to sit on couches or beds throughout the year. Hence, the mourner is required to overturn his couch and sit on the ground. Cf. however, M.K. 27a where it is stated that in a case of mourning, on the eve of the Sabbath, from the time of the <i>Minḥa</i> (afternoon) service and onwards, the couches were placed in erect position, but the mourner did not sit down on them until it was dark. This shows that the overturning of the couches or beds was on account of the prohibition against sitting on them (v. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. <span>מן המנחה ולמעלה</span>). According to the opinion of Bar Kappara, even if the mourner sat or slept on the ground, he had to overturn all the beds or couches in his home save a couch used specifically for vestments (<i>ibid.</i> 27a).</i> When the time for sleeping or eating [arrives], he may sit [or sleep] on an overturned couch, but during the entire day he may not sit even on an overturned couch save on the ground. So too, the comforters are not permitted to sit save on the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">On overturning the couch, consult the following sources: Sem(H). XI, 10-19; Tosef. M.K. II, 9; Y.Ber. III, 1(5b-6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(82c-83a) ; Y.San. II, 1(20a); M.K. 27a; San. 20a-b; M.K. 20a, 21a; <i>Asheri</i> to M.K. III; <i>RIBaSh, Resp.</i> s. 69; <i>Toldoth Adam we-Ḥawah</i> II, 266a; <i>Tur</i> a.l.; <i>T.H.; Shaare Simḥah</i> p. 46; B.B. 144a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אודייני</span>; Yalkut Shimoni II Sam. s. 149; Sem(H). VI, 2; <i>W.G.</i> a.l. for variant readings not found in cur. edd. of Talmud.</i>
Now it is not the common practice to overturn the couch because the Gentiles will say that it is [a kind] of sorcery. Moreover, our couches are not made like their couches in order that overturning should be discernible [as it was in former days].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri.</i>  M.K. 21a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אלו</span> The mourners may sit on low stools (<i>contra Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i>). Support for this may be found in Y.Ber. III, 1(6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(83a), where the reason for overturning the couches is derived from Job. II, 13, <i>‘So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days’</i> (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1, n. 1). The text for the words <i>‘upon the ground’</i> reads <span>לארץ</span> (lit. ‘(close) <i>to the ground’</i>) whence it is inferred that a mourner may sit on a low stool. One who is feeble in health or a pregnant woman may sit on ordinary stools or chairs. On the eve of the Sabbath, a few hours before nightfall, the mourner may rise from the low stools and close to the time of kindling the Sabbath lights, he may put his shoes on — <i>A.H.</i></i>

Siman 389

A mourner is forbidden to wash his garment during the entire seven days [of mourning],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic days there were two kinds of washing: a) <span>כיבוס</span> i.e., plain washing, and b) <span>גיהוץ</span> i.e., laundry work. In Ket. 10b it is stated that ‘our (i.e., Babylonian) laundry work is like their (i.e., Ereẓ Israel) washing.’ In the Land of Israel the plain washing was superior to the Babylonian, because they had either better water or better ingredients for washing. In order to procure satisfactory results, they would have to do fine laundry work in Babylonia, and that would include smoothing the cloth or garment with a stone, or according to <i>Rashi</i> (<i>ibid</i>.) with a gloss-stone.  S. <i>Krauss T.A.</i> I, 156, 581 and cf. Ta‘an. 29b. There are two main views held among the authorities regarding these terms. 1) During the seven days of mourning every type of washing is forbidden for two reasons — a) It entails work. Hence, not only the mourner is forbidden to wash his clothes, but others are also forbidden to do this for him (v. <i>supra</i> § 380); b) There is a prohibition against wearing even garments that were washed prior to the time that mourning sets in. <i>This is derived from, ‘And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her: I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and annoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead’</i> (II Sam. XIV, 2) — M.K. 15a. With respect to the thirty days of mourning, no prohibition against washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is found in the Talmud; only the prohibition against laundry work (<span>גיהוץ</span>) applies then. During the entire thirty days the mourner is forbidden to wear laundried garments (M.K. 23a), and R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon forbade only new white linen clothes, and Raba (<i>ibid.</i>) rules in accord with the latter.  also <i>ibid.</i> 27b; Yeb. 43a and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.; Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 1, 3; VI, 4. This represents the view of <i>Rashi, Maim.</i> and <i>Alfasi.</i> 2) Even washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is forbidden for thirty days. This is derived from Sem(H). VII, 4, where it is stated, ‘One who did not wash garments on the eve of a Festival should not wash for thirty days.’ The Talmudic texts (cited <i>supra</i> 1) are explained as follows: Yeb. <i>ibid.</i> is interpreted according to this viewpoint as referring only to those persons enumerated in Mishna, M.K. III, 2. Regarding M.K. 27b, the text should be emended to read, ‘thirty days for washing (<span>כיבוס</span>), and as to M.K. 15a, it should be understood as referring to washing in water only, which is permitted during the thirty days save the seven days of mourning. However, washing with natron and lye is forbidden (M.K. 23a, Tosaf. s.v. <span>כל</span>). — This is the viewpoint held by <i>RIBA. Caro</i> accepts the first viewpoint which represents the majority of the authorities.</i> even [if washed] in water alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 17b, derived by R.

During the seven days of mourning, one may put on a clean undershirt, if necessary, on account of perspiration or in a case where one suffers from a skin disease.

If a mourner is invited to be the <i>Sandek</i> at a circumcision, or if he is the <i>Mohel</i>, he is forbidden to cut his hair and this does not come within the ruling mentioned <i>infra</i> § 391, 2 <i>Gloss</i> on the authority of <i>MaHaRIL</i> — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> both the hair of his head as well as the hair of his beard, or any hair that he has [on his body], even that of the secret parts, — for the entire thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sem(H).

Amusement (<span>שחוק</span>) is not regarded as real joyous entertainment, but is related thereto. Hence, the prohibition applies only for seven days. Cf. Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 20. <span>שחוק</span> is the reverse of <span>בכי</span> (weeping).  Koh. III, 4: <i>‘A time to weep and a time to laugh.’</i> Therefore, during the seven days, the first three of which are for weeping (M.K. 27a), laughter or amusement is forbidden, but not during the remainder of the thirty days of mourning. Thus <i>Tur</i> and <i>Caro.</i> <i>Caro</i>’s text here, however, presents a difficulty. He begins with ‘joyous entertainment’ and then states ‘therefore he should not etc.,’ but as explained above, amusement (<span>שחוק</span>) is not complete joyous entertainment. The text should therefore, be understood thus, — ‘therefore etc.,’ i.e. since <span>שחוק</span> is not equivalent to joyous entertainment (<span>שמחה</span>), the prohibition lasts only for seven days — <i>A.H.</i> During the seven days of mourning a mourner may recite the prayers relating to the sanctification of the New Moon, provided that after the seven days the time limit to recite these prayers will have lapsed. On the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer during the seven days of mourning, v. <i>supra</i> § 376, 3, n. 14.</i>

Maimonides’ reason is that M.K. <i>ibid.</i> mentions only marriage, but not betrothal. Therefore, since in Yeb. <i>ibid.</i> there is a difference of opinion between R. Judah and R. Jose, the latter maintaining that it is forbidden to betroth, — yet, since M.K. would harmonize with R. Judah’s view, who permits betrothal, this is the law — <i>Leḥ. Mish.</i> Furthermore, just as we find that on the fast day of the ninth of Ab, one may betroth lest another man get ahead of him in proposing to the woman he desires to marry (<span>שמא יקדמנו אחר</span>), the same applies according to Maim. to mourning rites. However, most of the authorities dispute this ruling of <i>Maim</i>., for they hold that the law is in accord with R. Jose (Yeb. <i>ibid</i>.), and this law cannot be derived from the ninth of Ab, since in the latter case it is considered ‘an ancient mourning’ (<span>אבילות ישנה</span>). Accordingly, the reason M.K. <i>ibid.</i> mentions only marriage, is primarily for the sake of introducing a remarkable feature, viz., marriage during mourning, but this does not exclude betrothal from the same ruling. <i>Isserles</i>, therefore, rules (v. anon) that even betrothal is forbidden for the entire thirty days.</i> provided he does not make a feast [of betrothal], unless thirty days have gone by [at which time a feast is permissible].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Kes.

If his wife died, he is forbidden to take another [wife] until three Festivals have gone by her [death].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 23a in accord with the First Tanna; Sem(H). VII, 15. Thus also Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VI, 5 cited by <i>Tur, contra</i> second opinion stated by R. Judah (M.K. <i>ibid.</i>) that the prohibition extends only until the second Festival, but before the third he is permitted. <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ער</span> state on the authority of <i>R. Jonah</i> that R. Judah’s opinion cannot be accepted on the principle that in all matters pertaining to mourning the law is in accord with the lenient authority (this is in fact the ruling of <i>Ghayyat, N</i> and <i>Asheri</i> that we we must accept R. Judah’s view since he represents the lenient opinion), for in the case of remarriage after his former wife’s death, the days of mourning (i.e., the thirty days) have already gone by and the reason for the requirement of three Festivals has no bearing upon mourning rites. <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> advances various reasons why the husband must wait until three Festivals have passed prior to remarriage, — a) that by waiting for three Festivals to pass without the joy of marital life, he will not forget his former wife’s love and consequently, he will be inspired to remarry; b) to give the husband a chance to forget his former wife’s love, so that when he remarries, he will not mention his former wife’s love and devotion to his second wife, and thereby will avoid domestic friction. The law of three Festivals applies whether his former wife was at the time of marriage a spinster or a widow, or whether it was his first or second marriage. Likewise, whether his former wife was healthy or sick, or whether he lived peacefully or had disputes with her — <i>A.H.</i> The lenient view of R. Judah that two Festivals suffice, may be relied upon in a case of emergency — <i>A.H.</i> In the case where her husband died, she mourns only for thirty days, but she is forbidden to become engaged or to remarry before three months go by, in order to determine whether she is with child by her former husband or not (v. E.H. § 13). <i>Mord.</i> states that the reason why a woman does not have to wait until three Festivals have gone by before remarriage, is that she is satisfied to lead a married life than to remain single (v. Kid. 7a), and consequently, she is more apt to forget her former husband after thirty days of mourning and to devote herself to her new partner. If it happened that he married her within her thirty days of mourning for other near-of-kin, she should not cohabit with him before the thirty days of mourning are over. Thus opinion of <i>Maim.</i> (Yad, <i>ibid</i>), in accord with <i>BaḤ’s</i> interpretation — <i>Ta</i>Z, <i>ShaK</i>. <i>Shemini Aẓereth</i> is considered an independent Festival with respect to the waiting period of three Festivals — <i>D.Merb.

Since it states (M.K. <i>ibid.</i>) ‘if one <i>observed’</i> and it does not say, ‘one who <i>buried</i> his dead three days prior to the Festival,’ <i>RaBaD</i> infers that only if the mourner <i>observed</i> mourning rites before the Festival is the mourning period interrupted by the intervening Festival, but not otherwise. Consequently, the mourning rites must be observed after the Festival. However, this excludes rending of garments which must be done immediately after death from the moment of excitement’ (<span>שעת חימום</span>), and the entire seven days are considered a ‘moment of excitement.’ Hence, the ruling here. Thus also <i>Asheri</i> and <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.</i> One who was ill or was not in a normal state of mind at the time his near-of-kin died and consequently, did not rend garments, should rend his garments when he becomes well again, even during the entire thirty days, for when he ultimately becomes aware of his loss, it is considered for him a moment of excitement — <i>ShaK, BaḤ</i> and <i>A.H.</i>  <i>Ba’er Heteb</i> and <i>Naḥ.

Likewise, if one received a report that his father died and a relative of his informed him that the death report was incorrect and after two days elapsed the relative informed him that the original report was correct, the law is that the mourner counts from the time he received the first death report — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i>

The latter, however, exempts him even when he becomes of age (thus ruling of <i>Caro</i> here), since mourning did not apply to him at the time of burial. This is not to be compared to a Festival, in which case mourning is postponed until after the Festival (v. <i>infra</i> § 399), for in the latter case the individual proper was obligated to observe mourning rites, only that the Festival interrupts this. Moreover, on a Festival private mourning is still observed. Nor is this case be compared to the law of <i>Habdalah</i> with respect to a mourner (v. <i>supra</i> § 341, 23 and notes), for the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer may be recited during the first three days of the week (v. <i>ibid</i>.), whereas mourning rites take effect from the moment the tomb is closed by the <i>Golel</i>, and since at that moment the minor was exempt, mourning no longer takes effect.  <i>Ta</i>Z for lengthy discussion on this ruling who finally agrees with <i>Caro.</i></i> and he is not obligated therein.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The twelve month period, however, should be observed by the minor who became of age after burial, since this is done out of deference to one’s parents and is considered an independent mourning rite not connected with the seven and thirty days of mourning.

One observes mourning rites on the testimony of a single witness or [on the testimony of] a witness testifying to what he has heard from an [eye-] witness or if a Gentile makes an incidental statement [regarding] one's death.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>T.H.</i>, for the general principle is that any type of evidence on which we grant a woman permission to remarry, mourning rites are also observed (E.H. § 17, 3; <i>Asheri</i> M.K. III).  Pes. 4a; M.K. 20b; San. 5a on the question of mourning rites observed on the evidence of a single witness. Furthermore, the principle is that in ‘any matter which eventually will be exposed people do not lie’ (v. R.H. 22b; Yeb. 93b). Although we compare mourning to the laws of evidence on which a woman is permitted to remarry, we may ask the following: In the case of a woman there is an additional reason (excluding the reason of evidence) for granting her permission to remarry, viz., ‘A woman is careful to make inquiries prior to remarriage’ (<span>דיקא ומנסבא</span>) (Yeb. 116b), which is not so in the case of mourning. How can we therefore, compare the two cases? There are, therefore, some authorities who hold that the permission granted the woman is based mainly on the evidence of the single witness. It may, however, be possible that in the case of the woman we adopt a stringent view and require both the principle of evidence plus the fact that she also makes her own inquiries, whereas in the case of mourning a lenient view is adopted and the principle of evidence alone suffices — <i>A.H.</i> (Evidence offered in writing is also accepted in the case of permitting a woman to remarry.  E.H. <i>ibid</i>). One who received a letter informing him that his near-of-kin died, and in the letter it is not stated whether it is still within or after the thirty days of mourning, the law is that if the sender is not a learned person, we presume that the deceased person was alive until the time that the letter was written and dispatched (for an exposition of this type of presumption v. <i>A.H.</i> a.l.). Hence, the receiver of the letter must observe mourning rites. But if the sender was a learned person, we presume that the thirty day period is over, for were it possible for the letter to reach the mourner within the thirty days of mourning, the sender would not have stated the death report without defining the matter — <i>ShaK.</i> But if the deceased person was his father or mother, since the adopted custom is to inform the mourner about the death of a parent forthwith, in any case, the mourner is required to observe mourning rites — <i>Birke Yos.</i> If it happened that in a doubtful case it was ruled for one not to observe mourning, and subsequetly it became known to the individual that originally when the doubt was entertained regarding the death of his near-of-kin, the latter had really died, and it was still at the time the doubt was entertained within the thirty days, the law is that the mourner does not have to observe mourning rites (thus corrected text of <i>ShaK</i> in <i>Nek. Hak.</i>)  <i>supra</i> § 396 beg. (the reason being that now since it is already after the thirty days, mourning does not obtain) — <i>ShaK.</i> One who receives a death report via telegram should observe mourning rites — <i>Sh.M.B.</i> If a Gentile offers formal testimony (not incidentally), it is not accepted — <i>Mord.</i></i>

One to whom a report came that he suffered the loss of a near-of-kin [for whom one is dutibound to observe mourning rites], — if the report reached him within thirty days [after burial],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VII, 1 derived from M.K. 20a.

From this we conclude that the Sabbath must have been the thirtieth day, and since one observes on the Sabbath only mourning pertaining to private matters, formal mourning cannot continue after the Sabbath. Hence, with the termination of the Sabbath the death report is regarded as distant tidings. Were the Sabbath the twenty-ninth day, the entire seven days of formal mourning would have to be observed. Consequently, we may conclude that a death report received on the thirtieth day (excluding the Sabbath) is regarded as near tidings. The thirtieth day is calculated according to the locality of the mourner and not the place of death, e.g., if one who lives in United States or Canada receives a death report from Europe on the thirtieth day, although in Europe at that time it was already the thirty-first day, we follow the locality of the mourner with respect to determining whether it is near or distant tidings — <i>Resp.

Ḥiyya then said to his attendant, “Take off my shoes and bring along my things to the (public) bath-house.” From this we learn three things: We learn that a mourner is forbidden to put on shoes; that (on hearing) distant tidings (one observes mourning rites) for one day only; and that part of the day is (regarded) as a whole day.’ According to R. <i>Ḥananel</i>, R Ḥiyya referred to his own parents when questioning Rab about them (v. <i>Rashi and Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>אייבו</span> for other interpretations). The same ruling is derived from the case of R. Ḥinena (<i>ibid.</i> 20a) who received tidings from Be Ḥozai about the death of his father, and after consulting R. Ḥisda, the latter told him, ‘On (receiving) distant tidings, mourning is observed for one day only.’</i> And this, — [viz., that even in the case of receiving distant tidings about the death of one's parents, one hour of mourning suffices], applies only with respect to the restrictions of the seven [days of mourning which fall away in the case of distant tidings],<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.</i> on the basis of a logical deduction.</i> but as to the restrictions of the thirty [which apply in the case of other dead],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">e., whatever restrictions obtain in the case of other near-of-kin with respect to the thirty days, e.g., laundry-work, hair-cutting, obtain in the case of one’s parents until he is rebuked etc. — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i> — he observes [in the case of receiving distant tidings] about [the death of] his father and/or mother the [prohibition against] hair-cutting until his friends rebuke him, and with respect to laundry work, — until the Festival arrives and they rebuke him, and likewise, with respect to extending a greeting of peace or entering a house of feasting.

However, if he has no shoes on his feet [at the time the distant tidings are reported to him], he is required to overturn his couch or to muffle his head, for he is required to perform a [positive] act whereby it may be seen that he acts [thus] on account of mourning.

If at the place of death it was already night when the person died and at the place of the near-of-kin it was still day, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day is fixed according to the place of death — <i>Sh.M.B. contra Kol Bo</i>(<i>G</i>).

Consequently, if one dies on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> is observed only one day, — the law is that in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the second day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i>, which is the first day of the month of <i>Kislev.</i> However, if one died on the first day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> consisted of two days, the question is — when should one observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day only? Should one observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i> on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, since the death took place on the last day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, or do we say that since in matters pertaining to vows (v. end of <i>Gloss anon</i>) we follow the language of the people, he should observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev?</i> — The following procedure should be adopted: If during the first year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> is observed for one day only, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan.</i> Thus also whenever the month of <i>Ḥeshvan</i> is defective, then on the following day (i.e., <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i>), if there are no mourners in the Synagogue, he should also recite the <i>Kaddish</i> and lead the services. But if during the year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, consequently, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> becomes fixed for <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> and he should observe it thus every subsequent year, even when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day. The same principle applies to other months which are sometimes full and sometimes defective — <i>M.Abr.</i> Since <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> is sometimes observed one day, in which case the sixth day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first of <i>Tebeth</i>, the seventh day, — the second of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the third of <i>Tebeth;</i> and sometimes <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> consists of two days, i.e., the sixth and seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, in which case the seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first day of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the second day of <i>Tebeth</i>, — consequently, one who observes <i>Yahrzeit</i> during these days should not err by counting the days of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, but one must always count the days of the month — <i>M.Abr.</i></i> <i>and  O.H.</i> § 568, 8. <i> supra</i> § 391 <i>that one should not eat at a feast on the night of</i> [<i>which the following</i>] <i>day is the death anniversary of one's father or/and mother</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>supra</i> § 391, 3, <i>Gloss</i> n. 38.</i> [<i>If</i>] <i>this fast falls on the eve of the Sabbath, the law is as</i> [<i>on</i>] <i>other fastday</i>[<i>s</i>]. <i> O.H. § 249</i>. <i>In any case</i>, — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>if the first time one fasted the whole day, one should adopt this practice all the days of his life</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For it is then regarded as a vow. Hence, he must always fast on that day. Should one, however, be ill or should there be any other reason which prevents him from observing the fast-day, he must first be released from his vow. But if, prior to observing the first fast-day, one explicitly stated that he fasts on the condition that this should not be regarded as a vow for the following year, he does not require any release (v.

Yet, it is [more] proper that one should not collect them by himself. [This is derived] from that [which is related] about R. Eliezer b. Ẓadok [as stated] anon.
A person may collect the bones of two corpses at one time, [viz., he places the bones of one corpse] at the end of [his] <i>epikarsion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The text has <span>אפרסקל</span> a corruption of <span>אפיקרסין</span> a sheet or anything similar to that.  <i>supra</i> § 340, n. 59.</i> on one side, and [the bones of another corpse] at the [other] end of the [same] <i>epikarsion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The text has <span>אפרסקל</span> a corruption of <span>אפיקרסין</span> a sheet or anything similar to that.  <i>supra</i> § 340, n. 59.</i> on the other side.
