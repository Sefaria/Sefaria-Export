Siman 1

Nowadays<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">e., after the dissolution of the Jewish Commonwealth. Derived from Git. 88b; B.K. 84b; San. 2b-3a, according to which non-<i>Mumḥin</i> (v. <i>infra.</i> n. 13) may adjudicate cases of admissions and transaction of loans which are matters of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss, thereby carrying out the commission of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> of the Land of Israel. The present ruling applies today to the Land of Israel too. Cf. Git. <i>ibid., Tosa</i>f. s.v. <span>במלתא</span>. Thus also <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur.</i> The underlying reason for this law is given by the <i>Codifiers</i> as follows: <i>‘Judges and officers thou shalt make thee</i> in all thy gates <i>which the Lord thy G-d giveth thee</i> tribe by tribe (Deut. XVI, 18. This has reference to the Land of Israel only) — (this means that) in your gates (i.e., in Israel) tribunals should be set up in every district as well as in every city. However, outside the Land (of Israel) you should set up tribunals in every district but not in every city’ (Mak. 7a). This, of course, applied only to those times when the original form of ‘ordination’ (<i>Semikah</i>, <span>סמיכה</span>) was in vogue, but nowadays all judges have no authoritative power to adjudicate legal questions Biblically, as it is written, — <i>‘And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them</i> (Ex. XXI, 1) — <i>before them</i> (i.e., authoritative judges, specially ordained) and not before non-<i>Mumḥin</i> (laymen judges)’ — Git. <i>ibid.</i> Consequently, today we merely act as agents of the former authoritative judges and deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which also involve a monetary loss (<i>Tur</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> On the question whether we carry out today the commission of the former duly ordained judges Rabbinically or Biblically, there is a difference of opinion among the <i>Codifiers. N</i> and <i>RaShBA</i> hold that our commission is Rabbinical. <i>Nethiboth</i> maintains that it is Biblical.</i> the Judges may adjudicate cases of admissions<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>הודאות</span> admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. <span>הלוואות</span> transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (<span>שבועת היסת</span> i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (<span>כופר הכל</span>) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (<span>מודה במקצת</span>), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — <i>M.E.</i></i> and transaction of loans,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>הודאות</span> admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. <span>הלוואות</span> transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (<span>שבועת היסת</span> i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (<span>כופר הכל</span>) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (<span>מודה במקצת</span>), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — <i>M.E.</i></i> marriage contracts,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Containing among other things, the settlement of a certain amount due to the wife on her husband’s death or on being divorced. Heb. <i>Kethubah</i> (<span>כתובה</span>), — the wife’s settlement.</i> inheritances,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> derived from San. 3a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שלא</span>.</i> gifts<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> derived from San. 3a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שלא</span>.</i> and damage done to another person's chattel,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 9 derived from B.K. <i>ibid.</i></i> which are matters that are of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the case of ‘inheritances’ and ‘gifts’ which are of frequent occurrence there is also the possibility of a loss involved, for no doubt the claimant must have rendered some service to the bequeather or the donor (Thus <i>A.H.</i>). The underlying reason in the case of admissions and the transaction of loans is ‘in order not to shut the door against borrowers’ (<span>שלא תנעול דלת בפני לווין</span>). For a creditor will refuse to grant a loan should he find it difficult to collect his debt. The same reason applies to the other matters enumerated here. This (viz., that we deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which involve a monetary loss) has reference only to monetary claims. But in the case of other important matters, such as, accepting converts, although it is of infrequent occurrence, or in the case of compelling an obstinate husband to grant his wife a divorce although it does not involve a monetary loss, the law is that we may deal with such cases — <i>M.E.</i></i> but matters that are not of frequent occurrence although they involve a monetary loss,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yad <i>ibid.</i></i> e.g., cattle that injured other [cattle],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of goring with the ‘horn’ (<span>קרן</span>) which is of infrequent occurrence. This, of course, refers not only to damage caused by ‘horn’ but also to all other types of injury or damage of infrequent occurrence (e.g., damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’ (<span>אש זבור</span>) — <i>Shak.</i>  Mishna B.K. I,  <i>P.Tesh.,</i> however, cites authorities who permit a Jewish Court today to deal in matters pertaining to damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’). This form of damage is called <span>חבלה</span>. Hence, the term <span>שחבלה</span> used here. In the case of damage or injury which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss, the legal term used is <span>היזק</span>.  <i>infra</i> par. 3 — <i>M.E.</i></i> or matters that do not involve a monetary loss although they are of frequent occurrence,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yad <i>ibid.</i></i> e.g., the repayment of the double amount,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">e., the additional amount to be paid as fine on restoring stolen goods (Ex. XXII, 3; 6-8). This is derived from San. 8a where it is stated that cases of fine must be dealt with by three authoritative Judges (<i>Mumḥin</i>), but not laymen Judges. The repayment of the double amount (<span>תשלומי כפל</span>), it may be asked, in any case belongs to the category of fines (<span>קנסות</span>) mentioned anon, and the payment thereof is collected only by authoritative judges (<i>Mumḥin</i>)? Furthermore, <i>Tur</i> has <span>בושת</span> i.e., payment for indignity suffered which is of frequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved. Likewise, in the foregoing example of matters of infrequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved, <i>Tur</i> has ‘e.g., if a man injured another man’ instead of <i>Caro</i>’s example (following <i>Maim.</i> in Yad <i>ibid.</i>) ‘cattle that injured other cattle’. The difficulty may be removed if we understand our text as follows: First <i>Caro</i> states examples (e.g., the repayment of the double amount and cattle that injured other cattle) which are specifically of a penal nature (<span>קנס</span>) and then the general proviso, ‘and likewise all fines’ which the Rabbis equated to these examples. Consequently, the examples cited by <i>Tur</i> are included in the general statement concerning fines — <i>M.E.</i></i> and likewise, all fines that were imposed by the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. <i>ibid.</i> dealing with a case where R.

Cf. <i>infra</i> § 420, 4 <i>Caro</i> adopts <i>Maim.</i> (Yad <i>ibid.</i>) explanation of <span>תוקע</span>; <i>Isserless</i> accepts the explanation of <i>Rashi</i> and <i>RaN</i> (v.

Yet, since it is of infrequent occurrence and does not involve a monetary loss, we cannot order its collection. The Rabbis, however, called it <span>קנס</span> (fine) because the law thereof is similar to fines. Cf. B.K. 27b, 84b, <i>Tosaf</i>, s.v. <span>קנסא</span> — <i>M.E.</i></i> — and thus also whosoever pays more than the actual damage done, or one who pays half-damages,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 15b, 27b; Ket. 41b and v. <i>Tur.</i> E.g., the repayment of the double amount (Ex.

V, 16, 24; XXVII, 27), or half-damages done by an innocuous animal (<span>תם</span>), i.e., an animal that did not gore three times and did injury before warning had been given, opp. <span>מועד</span> (Ex.

Liability for blemish applies only in the case of rape (v. E.H. § 177). Blemish stands on an equal footing as injury (v. B.K. <i>ibid., Rashi</i> s.v. <span>ופגם</span>). It may, however, be asked, why blemish (<span>פגם</span>) which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss (B.K. <i>ibid.</i>) should not be adjudicated today? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that ‘frequent occurrence’ of blemish applies only to the assessment, i.e., we know how to determine the liability of blemish (the difference in valuation between a virgin <span>בתולה</span> and a non-virgin <span>בעולה</span>), but the actual <i>act</i> of rape is of infrequent occurrence — <i>M.E.</i></i> indignity,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Tur citing Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 10.

Mish.; B.Yos.; MaHaRIK</i> Rt. 1 a.o.) as referring to ‘injury’ (<span>נזק</span>) only, which, it is true, involves a monetary loss, but is of infrequent occurrence (v. <i>supra</i> n. 19). Hence, Raba’s dictum does not include ‘loss of time’ and ‘healing.’ Consequently, payment may be ordered by a Jewish Court today for the latter. Thus also <i>Isserlein</i> in his <i>Decisions</i> (<span>פסקים</span>) — that nowadays we may order payment for ‘healing’ and ‘loss of time’ and likewise impose a fine upon the offender. <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Alfasi</i>, however, hold that payment for the latter are not ordered today. Raba’s dictum is explained by them to refer to anything that requires valuation (<span>כל הנישום</span>). <i>Caro</i>, however, accepts the opinion of <i>Maim.</i> since it is supported by the <i>Geoninm</i> (Yad <i>ibid.</i>). Thus also <i>Hag.

Derived from B.K. 84a-b in the case of the ox that chewed the hand of a child and Raba ruled, ‘Go forth and value the child as if it were a slave,’ and after a lengthy discussion in the Talmud (<i>ibid.</i>), Raba’s dictum, viz., that payment may be collected in Babylon where chattel was damaged by cattle, is explained to have reference to damage done by Tooth or Foot which is considered <i>Mu‘ad ab initio.</i> For Mu‘ad v. Glos.</i> Thus also, [with respect to] one who stole or robbed<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the unlawful acquisition of chattels by violence. Cf. Lev. V, 23; II Sam. XXIII, 21.</i> [an object], they may collect from him the principal only.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 1 , B.K. 84b where it is concluded that in matters of a penal nature we do not act as agents of the former authoritative Judges of Israel. Hence, only the principal may be collected. , also B.K. 115a where such cases were dealt with in Babylon and B.K. 96b in the case of the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and B.K. 21a in the case of a certain person who built a villa on the ruins that belonged to orphans and when R. Naḥman advised the defendant to make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he refused to do so, whereupon R. Naḥman confiscated the villa. Cf. also <i>ibid.</i> 37a and 4b. In the latter reference it is stated that theft (<span>גניבה</span>) and larceny (<span>גזילה</span>) involve civil liability. A difficulty, however, presents itself, viz., in the Mishna San. I, 1 and Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 3a we are told that cases of larceny are dealt with by <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges only, which contradicts the present ruling. <i>Tosaf.</i> (ibid. s.v. <span>שלא</span>; B.K. 84b s.v. <span>אי נמי</span>; Git. 88b s.v. <span>אי הכי</span>) explain that the Mishna <i>ibid.</i> refers to cases of larceny by means of injury inflicted (<span>גזילות ע״י חבלות</span>), in which case only <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges may adjudicate the matter. Hence, in such cases of larceny we nowadays cannot act as the agents of the former authoritative Judges, since this is a matter of infrequent occurrence, but cases of larceny where no bodily injury resulted we may act as the agents of the former. Thus also <i>Kes. Mish.</i> and <i>B.Yos. N.Yos.,</i> however, removes the above difficulty as follows: <i>Caro’s</i> ruling that we may order the payment of the principal in cases of larceny refers only to matters of frequent occurrence, such as, one who denies a deposit (v. <i>Gloss</i> anon), but actual larceny is of infrequent occurrence. Hence, it is not adjudicated today (v. <i>D.M.</i> a.l.). <i>ShaK</i> advances a different opinion, viz., that in San. <i>ibid.</i> we deal with the adjudication of fines, e.g., the repayment of the double amount, the four and five-fold restitution, which require only <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1 and notes), but the actual principal is recoverable even by laymen Judges (this is however, a stained interpretation, since the payment of the double etc., refers to cases of theft but not to larceny — <i>Ba’er Heteb</i>). <i>ShaK</i> also writes that the increment (<span>שבח</span>) of the misappropriated article prior to the owner’s resignation, is also recoverable today <i>contra BaḤ. RaN</i> and <i>N</i> offer an altogether different explanation in removing the above difficulty, viz., that as to San. <i>ibid.</i> that requires <i>Mumḥin</i> in cases of larceny, it has reference only to the period when such Judges were available, but if, as today, <i>Mumḥin</i> are no longer available, even laymen Judges may deal with such matters. Thus also <i>Nethiboth, K.H.</i> and <i>Tummim.</i> Otherwise, the earth will become full of violence — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And some say</i> [<i>that this applies</i>] <i>only to cases of larceny that are of</i> <i>frequent occurrence, e.g.,</i> [<i>a guardian</i>] <i>who denies</i> [<i>having received</i>] <i>a deposit and the like, but actual larceny is not</i> [<i>considered</i>] <i>of frequent occurrence and they do not adjudicate</i> [<i>this</i>] <i>unless the robbed object is</i> [<i>still</i>] <i>intact</i>, [<i>in which case</i>] <i>they order</i> [<i>him</i>] <i>to return it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>N.Yos.</i> to B.K. 84b — <i>G.</i> , previous note.</i>
[With respect to] the laws of damage caused indirectly,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 98b; Ket. 86a where it is related that in the case of an action for damage caused indirectly, Rafram (in accord with R. Meir <i>ibid.</i> 100a) compelled R. Ashi, who in his childhood had destroyed by burning, the bond of a creditor, to make payment ‘like a beam fit for decorative mouldings,’ i.e., a proverbial expression for ‘straight and exact’ and out of the best of one’s estate (v. <i>ibid.</i> 5a), whence we see that payment for indirect damage (<span>גרמי</span>) may be collected even by laymen Judges outside the Land of Israel, and such payment is not regarded as a fine (<span>קנס</span>). , Yad <i>Ḥobel u-Mazzik</i> VII, 9. There are three expressions used in Talmudical terminology with reference to different categories of damage that require elucidation, viz., a) <span>היזק שאינו ניכר</span> — damage not discernible in the object itself, such as, leavened matter over which Passover has passed (which had been in the house during Passover) that becomes forbidden for use after Passover, although the damage is not evident here; b) <span>דינא דגרמי</span> — indirect damage which is discernible and is not the result of any action performed, such as, in the case of the fence of a vineyard that has been broken down and the owner of the adjoining cornfield requires the owner of the vineyard to restore it. If the owner of the vineyard neglects the matter and does not restore it, he thereby causes his neighbour’s produce to become forfeit (Deut.

In other words, they are proven to have been ‘schemers’ or ‘plotters,’ and they are punished by the law of retaliation (Deut. XIX, 16ff.). According to <i>W.G., Isserles</i> mentions this ruling here, since as in the aforementioned law of the ‘informer’ damage is caused by mere speech without tangible action (this is also apparent in <i>Mord</i>. to B.K.

B.K. 4b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>עדים</span>). The reason why the example of <span>הזמה</span> (the refutation of the witnesses by another set of witnesses by proving an <i>alibi</i>, e.g., ‘How can you offer this testimony, if, at the time you state that the alleged offence was committed, you were present with us in another locality?’) is mentioned, and not the example of <span>הכחשה</span> (counter-evidence which contradicts the testimony of the first set of witnesses), is because in the latter case when two witnesses state that So-and-So borrowed money from So-and-So, as a result of which money was collected on their testimony, and subsequently, two other witnesses came and offered counterevidence, the former set of witnesses cannot be ordered to make payment, for we may say, that the evidence offered by the second set of witnesses does not carry more weight than that of the first set. Not so, however, if the witnesses are proven <i>Zomemim</i> (v. <i>infra</i> § 31, 38; § 46, 37) — <i>M.E.</i> , also <i>infra</i> § 28, 3, <i>Gloss</i>.

Thus also <i>Tur.</i> The injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where he or his chattel caused injury, because the injured person does not receive more than the damage incurred, and should we not adopt this stringency one would feel that he is free to injure his fellow-man and be entirely exempt. This, however, does not have reference to cases which involve the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution — <i>M.E., ShaK, RaShaL. ‘Ir Shushan</i> writes that when the defendant is placed under the ban, which is lifted only after he appeases the plaintiff by compensating the latter for the damage, such compensation must include not only an approximate amount of the actual damages suffered but also of the payment of the double and the four and five-fold restitution. <i>M.E.</i> rejects this ruling because as stated above the injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where there is no additional payment of fines.</i> and as soon as he<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The injurer.</i> gives him an amount which appears reasonable [to the injurer to be given] to him, they release him<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The injurer.</i> [from the ban],<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This does not refer to an exact amount corresponding to the damage but rather to an approximate amount. Thus also <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>R. Sherira Gaon, Asheri</i> and <i>Alfasi</i>. This explains the words, ‘they release him (from the ban),’ i.e., although the injured person demands full payment. This also follows from the <i>Gloss</i> of <i>Isserles</i>, ‘whether his litigant was appeased etc.’ The following words, however, ‘if the injured person seized an amount etc.,’ refers to seizure of the full amount. The latter statement has reference to a seizure that also compensates the injured person with respect to the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution. Biblically, one who admits an act with which a fine is connected, is exempt from the fine (<span>מודה בקנס פטור</span> v. Ket. 43a). But the admission must be made in the presence of a Court duly ordained (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1, n. 1). Hence, nowadays the defendant’s admission would not exempt him from the additional fine also seized by the claimant, save that the following distinction should be borne in mind, viz., that if the defendant admitted that witnesses were present during the time that the damage was done, he is still held responsible and his admission does not exempt him, but if no witnesses were present at that time, the claimant’s seizure of the additional amount corresponding to the fine is not valid — <i>Nethiboth</i>. If the injurer died, we do not place his heir under the ban, for the main purpose of the Geonic enactment (v. <i>supra</i> n. 45) was that violent men should not be on the increase. Hence, the injurer only is placed under a ban but not his heir in the case of the former’s death — <i>Nethiboth</i> and <i>Tummim.</i></i> <i>whether his litigant was appeased</i> [<i>thereby</i>] <i>or whether he was not appeased</i>. And likewise, if the injured person seized an amount, [viz.,] whatever is proper for him to take, they do not reclaim [it] from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Conclusion reached in B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. This ruling applies even if the plaintiff seized an amount corresponding to the fine as well, for the law is that had we been permitted to adjudicate this matter today, the defendant would have paid an amount corresponding to the actual damage plus the fine. Consequently, the plaintiff’s seizure is considered valid. So also <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> (<i>infra</i> § 349 end). , also <i>Isserles infra</i> § 348, 4 <i>Gloss. Caro</i> and <i>Isserles</i> state the law here without making a distinction as to whether the seizure was made at the time the damage was suffered or subsequent to that, or whether the chattel that caused the damage was seized by the injured person or other possessions of the injurer. <i>R. Tam</i> in <i>Tosaf.</i> to B.K. and Ket. <i>ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ואי תפס</span> holds that the plaintiff seized the animal that caused the damage, i.e., before it reached the owner’s hand. Thus <i>Hag. Maim.</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> This is substantiated by Ket. 84b according to which R. Tarfon maintains that the seizure of a man’s produce by a creditor is valid after the latter’s death, provided, — as Rab and Samuel explain — it lies in a heap in a public domain, i.e., in a place where <i>Meshikah</i> is possible. In other words, before it passes into the hands of the heirs. , <i>Hag. Derisha u-Perisha</i>. But other chattels cannot be seized by him. For if so, the plaintiff will continue to seize thereafter other items too, and we would not be able to dispossess him thereof, since this comes under the category of ‘fines’ which are not adjudicated today. <i>Asheri</i> on the other hand, maintains, that even other chattels, not necessarily the animal that caused the damage, may be seized. Should he seize more than his damage we may dispossess him of the surplus which does not come under the category of ‘fines’ since the adjudication will be for the surplus seizure which is permissible to be dealt with by the Judges. , also <i>RIDBaZ</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> who writes that were <i>R. Tam</i>’s explanation correct, the text should have stated <span>ואי תפסיה</span> i.e., ‘he seized it’ and would be referring to the tort-feasant animal or the like (v. B.K. and Ket. <i>ibid.</i>). Furthermore, the law is that the nuisance, in this case the animal, must be abated, as R. Nathan said, ‘Whence is it derived that a man should not breed a bad dog in his house? — From the text, <i>That thou bring not blood upon thy house</i> (Deut. XXII, 8).’ Hence, we see that <i>Caro</i> and <i>Isserles</i> in stating the law here adopt the opinion of <i>Asheri</i>. <i>Mord</i>. writes that if the damage was caused through ‘Horn’ we follow <i>R. Tam</i>, and in other cases of damage (e.g., cattle that caused damage to man even through ‘Tooth’ and ‘Foot’ which are of infrequent occurrence. Thus <i>K.H.</i>) we adopt the opinion of <i>Asheri</i>. In the case of an ‘innocuous animal’ (<i>Tam.</i> , Glos.) that caused damage, some say that the seizure is valid only if the plaintiff seized the animal proper, for the owner of such an animal pays only half-damages and the payment is made out of the body of the tort-feasant animal (v. Mishna B.K. 34a) — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The seizure spoken of here refers to one made in accordance with Jewish Law but not if carried out through non-Jewish Law (<i>RaShaL</i>) — <i>ShaK. R.A.Eger</i>, however, writes that only ‘in the first instance’ (<span>לכתחילה</span>) is it forbidden to seize through a non-Jew, but if already done (<span>דיעבד</span>) the seizure is considered valid (thus implied in <i>RaShaL</i>, the source of this ruling. Cf. <i>infra</i> § 4 <i>Gloss</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i> If a guardian advances the plea of theft in the case of an article which was entrusted with him for safekeeping and took the ‘guardians’ oath’ (<span>שבועת השומרים</span>) after which it was discovered that he himself had stolen the deposited article, — the law is that if the plaintiff seized an amount including the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution, since nowadays one is not required to pay the latter, the reason being that the oath must be taken before a duly ordained Court comprised of <i>Mumḥin,</i> — the seizure is not valid — <i>ShaK, Nethiboth</i>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And if the injured</i> <i>person should say</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">To the Judges.</i> <i>'Assess for me my damage so that I should know up to how much I should seize,' he is not obeyed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For otherwise it would mean that we adjudicate penal cases. But whatever he is instructed to return to the injurer does not come under the category of penal matters, since he had already seized it himself. <i>RaShaL</i> rules in accord with <i>Alfasi</i> that with respect to anything which is of a civil and not of a penal nature save that it is of infrequent occurrence, we do obey him and assess the damage for him — <i>ShaK</i>.</i> <i>save that if he had already seized, they assess for him</i> [<i>his damage</i>] <i>and instruct him, 'So much you may keep</i> [<i>as your own</i>] <i>and so much you must return</i> [<i>to the injurer</i>].'<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri</i> to B.K. VIII and to B.K. I end — <i>G.</i> This is <i>contra MaHaRIW</i> who maintains that all that was seized by the claimant must be returned. <i>Isserles</i>, as can be seen, adopts the opinion of <i>Asheri</i> that only the surplus should be restored. <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> also rule that if the plaintiff does not produce witnesses that he is entitled to the amount seized, he must return whatever he seized. <i>Isserles</i>, however, writes that this applies only if he seized in the presence of witnesses, but if the seizure was not in the presence of witnesses, and the defendant denies having incurred any damage, the claimant is believed on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (a legal rule according to which a deponent’s statement is accepted as true on the ground that if he had intended to tell a lie, he might have invented one more advantageous to his case, viz., he might have said, ‘I did not seize at all’). , <i>infra</i> § 87, 30. This principle applies not only to claims of civil liability but also to those of a penal nature (<i>Mord</i>. to B.K. III; <i>Tur infra</i> § 399; <i>Isserles</i> and <i>‘Ir Shushan</i>) — <i>M.E. R. Mordekai ha-Lewi</i> (cited by <i>Tur ibid.</i>) states that the principle of <i>Miggo</i> is not valid in penal cases. Thus also <i>N.Yos.</i> to B.K. III end; <i>Mag. Mish.</i> to Yad, <i>Nizke Mamon</i> IX end. In the case where the injurer died, the seizure of the orphans’ money or chattels is not valid in penal cases, for legally movable property of orhpans does not become mortgaged to a creditor save that the <i>Geonim</i> decreed that they become mortgaged. But this Geonic decree certainly does not apply to penal cases — <i>Nethiboth, A.H.</i> If the injured person seized an amount which also corresponds to the fine, after which the injurer reseized the fine, the Judges nowadays cannot order this fine to be returned to the injured person, for if so, it would mean that they adjudicate fines — <i>Nethiboth. R.A.Eger</i>, however, states that the amount corresponding to the fine may be restored to the injured person, for once the latter seized this amount it became his personal property and no longer falls under the category of fines — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>And all this</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That nowadays Judges have no authority to adjudicate fines.</i> [<i>applies</i>] <i>only to fines stated</i> [<i>in Biblical Law</i>], <i>but</i> [<i>as to</i>] <i>fines which the Sages come</i> [<i>from time to time</i>] <i>to impose of their own accord with respect to</i> [<i>one who does not observe</i>] <i>their ordinance</i>[<i>s</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">e., ordinances decreed by the Sages for the sake of safe-guarding the Torah laws — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>they may collect everywhere</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Whether in or outside the Land of Israel.

Hence, the exigencies of the hour apply here too (<i>Tummim</i>). Others, however, maintain that the individual may be penalized even when the foregoing reason is not applicable (<i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> may pass judgment both [with respect to] death<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from San. 46a, Yeb. 90b: ‘It was taught, R. Eliezer b. Jacob stated: I heard that the Court of Law may (whenever necessary) administer punishment by lashes and impose (capital) sentences, even though not (warranted) by Biblical law; not for the purpose of disregarding the Torah but in order to make a fence around the Torah. It once happened that a man rode on horseback on the Sabbath during the Greek period and was brought before the Court of Law and was stoned, not because he was liable to this penalty, but because the needs of the hour demanded it. It also happened that a man had intercourse with his wife under a fig tree and was brought before the Court of Law and was flogged, not because he deserved it, but because the needs of the hour demanded it.’ <i>N.Yos.</i>, however, writes that the above penalties were imposed by the <i>Great Sanhedrin</i> but any other Court of Law does not have the authority to administer such punishment. He adduces the following text to prove his point: San. 52b: ‘Immarta, the daughter of Tali, a <i>Kohen</i>, committed adultery. In consequence of that, R. Ḥama b. Tobiah had her surrounded by faggots and burnt. R. Joseph said: He (R. Ḥama) was unaware of two laws. He was unaware of R. Mathna’s statement (that burning was executed by pouring molten lead down the culprit’s throat) and was ignorant of the following Baraitha: <i>And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days</i> (Deut. XVII, 9). This teaches that when the priesthood operates (in the Temple), the Judge operates (with respect to capital punishment) ; but when the priesthood does not operate, the Judge may not function.’ Hence, R. Ḥama, who flourished after the destruction of the Temple had no authority to impose capital punishment. <i>N.Yos.</i> cites additional cases to corroborate his viewpoint: Nid. 13b, San. 58b: ‘R. Ḥama had the hand of one who was accustomed to strike other people cut off.’ San. 27a: ‘The Exilarch (<i>Resh Galutha</i>) said to R. Abba b. Jacob, Go and investigate the matter; if he is definitely the murderer, dim his eyes.’ In these latter cases only partial punishment was administered but not full punishment in accordance with Biblical law. However, <i>N.Yos.</i> is opposed by the <i>Codifiers</i> (v. also <i>D.M.</i>) who hold that if <i>the needs of the hour demand it</i> even full punishment may be meted out including capital sentences although it would not be in accordance with Biblical law where legal warning and valid witnesses are required which would be difficult to obtain nowadays as a result of which the world would become full of violence and ultimately destroyed. Cf. ‘Jerusalem was destroyed because judgments were rendered in accordance with strict Biblical law’ (B.M. 30b).

A Court of Law must consist of not less than three [Judges]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna San. 2a and Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 2b-3a in accord with R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika that Biblically even one is sufficient to judge monetary cases. Three, however, are required Rabbinically on account of idlers who are unversed in the law (v. <i>Isserles</i> anon). Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 10 (v. <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> on the authority of <i>RaShBA</i>) and <i>Asheri</i> to San. I end <i>contra ‘Ir Shushan</i> — <i>M.E. BaḤ</i> writes that in the first instance (<span>לכתחילה</span>) three who are versed in the law are required. Regarding a city wherein all the inhabitants are unversed in the law, v. <i>infra</i> § 8, 1, <i>Gloss. ShaK</i> defends <i>‘Ir Shushan</i> on the basis of the following text: San. 3a: ‘Said Raba, . . cases of indebtedness require no <i>Mumḥin</i> for the reason advanced by R. Ḥanina (v. <i>infra</i>). R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika states: Biblically even one individual is qualified to deal with cases of indebtedness, as it is written, <i>In righteousness shalt</i> thou <i>judge thy neighbour</i> (Lev. XIX, 5). Three judges are required on account of idlers who act as judges … What is the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika (since they both agree that laymen Judges are legally qualified to adjudicate monetary cases) ? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: If two laymen Judges adjudicated a monetary case, their judgment holds good but they are called an arrogant court. Raba (who requires three Biblically) does not agree with Samuel; whereas R. Aḥa, does.’ Consequently, continues <i>ShaK,</i> since we do not rule in accordance with Samuel (v. <i>infra</i> par. 2 beg.), we must say that the law agrees with Raba, viz., that Biblically three <i>Mumḥin</i> are necessary, for the term <i>‘Elohim’</i> denoting <i>‘Judges’</i> is found three times in Ex. XXII, 6-8 with respect to cases of larceny, and on the basis of the principle that there is <i>‘an interweaving of Biblical sections’</i> <span>עירוב פרשיות</span> (i.e., clauses of one section are taken over for interpretative purposes to a succeeding section, in this case the term <i>‘Elohim’</i> is taken over to the section in Ex. XXII, 24 which deals with cases of indebtedness). Hence, three <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges should be required even in cases of indebtedness. However, this requirement was relaxed and three laymen Judges suffice on account of the reason advanced by R. Ḥanina, viz., ‘in order not to close the door against borrowers’ (people would refuse to advance loans should they subsequently meet with difficulties in having to procure <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges in order to collect their debts). This is also evident from <i>Asheri,</i> for he decides in favour of R. Abbahu that the adjudication of two Judges is invalid <i>contra</i> Samuel (v. <i>supra</i> this note). Furthermore, <i>Asheri</i> states explicitly that the law follows R. Abbahu since we have an established principle that beginning with Abaye and Raba the law always rests with the <i>Later Authorities.</i> Consequently, the law is decided in favour of Raba who disagrees with Samuel. Thus also <i>Alfasi, RABaN</i> and <i>N.Yos. Maim.</i> ruling (v. Yad <i>ibid.</i>) presents the following difficulties: a) On the one hand <i>Maim.</i> rules that three Judges are required and on the other hand, he states that one <i>Mumḥeh</i> is permitted to try monetary cases, which is in agreement with R. Aḥa. But, as we have seen above, R. Aḥa accepts Samuel’s dictum, and such being the case, <i>Maim.</i> should likewise accept Samuel’s ruling that two Judges are sufficient. The same difficulty is found in <i>SeMaG.</i> b) According to B.K. 84b and Git. 88b, the reason why we may adjudicate monetary cases nowadays is because we act as agents of the former authoritative Judges (<i>Elohim</i>). Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 8 and <i>SeMaG</i> (v. <i>supra</i> § 1 notes). Hence, Biblically, monetary cases are tried by <i>Mumḥin,</i> i.e., in accord with Raba, for according to R. Aḥa, one laymen Judge would be sufficient today (v. <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> to Yad, <i>ibid.</i> II, 10 who raises the same question and cites <i>Resp.</i> of <i>RaShBA</i> in order to remove the above difficulties. Cf. also <i>Leḥem Mishneh ibid.</i>). <i>ShaK</i> writes that the solution of the latter authorities is strained. <i>A.H.</i> removes the above difficulties as follows: Samuel’s dictum that ‘If two judges tried monetary cases their decision holds good,’ <i>refers only to Biblical adjudication.</i> And needless to say that the one (R. Aḥa) who maintains that Biblically one Judge is qualified to try monetary cases will certainly hold that if two adjudicated the matter, their decision is valid and they are Biblically designated a Court of Law. However, Rabbinically, all agree that three Judges are required on account of idlers who are unversed in the law. This is what is meant by the text (v. <i>supra</i>), ‘What is the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: ‘If two Judges etc.,’ i.e., Biblically, the decision given by two judges is valid and they are designated a Court of Law according to Samuel. Therefore, the Gemara does not state that the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa centers around the difference of opinion between Samuel and R. Abbahu (the latter holding that the decision of two is invalid), for as far as a valid judgment is concerned, R. Aḥa and Samuel agree with R. Abbahu that three are required <i>Rabbinically,</i> on account of idlers. Samuel and R. Aḥa only differ Biblically.</i> and every [group of] three [Judges] is called a Court of Law even if they be laymen.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">San. 2b-3a.  previous note.</i> <i>For it is impossible that there should not be among them</i> [<i>at least</i>] <i>one who has a knowledge of</i> <i>logical inferences in</i> [<i>civil</i>] <i>laws</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">San. 3a. The expression, ‘who has a knowledge of logical inferences in (civil) laws’ (<span>דיודע סברות בדינים</span>) taken from <i>Tur,</i> is not equivalent to the Talmudic term <span>סביר</span>, i.e., one who has the capacity to reason even regarding matters concerning which he did not study. For this would be equivalent to a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (authoritative Judge). , Shab. 63a a.e. The expression used here has reference to one who merely received reasons for certain laws from others, but is himself not endowed with the power of reasoning — <i>M.E.</i> (v. also <i>Perisha</i>). <i>ShaK</i> agrees with <i>M.E.</i> regarding the term <span>סביר</span>, but maintains that one of the Judges must be versed in traditions (<span>גמיר</span> used in San. <i>ibid.</i>). Thus also <i>R. Meir of Padua contra BaḤ</i> who writes that <span>גמיר</span> refers to partial knowledge. The ruling here, viz., that one is required to be versed in the law follows <i>Asheri contra Mord.</i> who requires the three Judges to be versed in the law even if they have no reasoning power.

[If] less than three [Judges tried a monetary case] their decision is not binding,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">San. 2b in accord with R. Abbahu. Thus also <i>Alfasi, Asheri</i> and Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 10. The following sources in Rabbinic literature indicate that R. Abbahu’s view was the accepted law: San. 29b-30a: Regarding a deed of a debtor’s admission of indebtedness in the presence of witnesses (<span>אודיתא</span>) where it is taken for granted that the document was legally drawn up in the presence of a Court of three. Ket. 22a (cf. San. <i>ibid.</i>) : If one of the three Judges necessary for the authentication of signatures on documents (<span>קיום שטרות</span>) died before signing it, the document should contain such wording. So too, in B.B. 165b. B.M. 31b: ‘Go and bring three people in whose presence you made the division (of partnership).’ San. 2b-3a: Raba agrees with R. Abbahu that if two adjudicated a monetary case their decision is not binding. Thus also the opinion of R. Joḥanan and Resh Lakish in Y. San. I, 1(18a) cited by <i>Tosaf.,</i> San. 2b s.v. <span>דברי הכל</span>. <i>Mord</i>. a.o. write that even Samuel who regards the decision of two Judges binding (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1) will agree that in the cases of <span>אודיתא</span> (admission of indebtedness) and <span>קיום שטרות</span> (authentication of signatures) mentioned above, three Judges are required. As to the statement in San. 30 and parallel references, ‘But perhaps the Rabbis of Rabbana Ashi’s academy agreed with Samuel,’ — it should be understood as refering to other cases of adjudication (v. <i>Hag. Imre Baruk</i>). This also follows from <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Maim.,</i> the latter holding that even a <i>Mumḥeh</i> is not qualified to deal alone in the above-mentioned matters, although in other cases he is qualified. <i>BaḤ</i> writes that if two Judges adjudicated a monetary case and exacted money from one person and gave it to another person and the latter betrothed a woman with this money, — we should be stringent and consider the marriage binding and in order to dissolve the marriage a <i>Get</i> (Bill of Divorce) is required. <i>ShaK</i> opposes <i>BaḤ</i>’s <i>ruling.</i></i> even [if] they did not render an erroneous decision,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from San. 6a.</i> unless the litigants accepted them [to abide by their ruling],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> or [in the case of] one who is a recognized <i>Mumḥeh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">San. 5a; Bek. 37a. <i>Tur</i> citing <i>R. Sherira Gaon,</i> writes: ‘Whoever is considered like R. Naḥman in his generation (San. 6a) and is versed in Mishna and Talmud and likewise is an expert in weighing opinions and deciding between opposing parties (<span>שיקול הדעת</span>) and has perused legal texts for a number of years and was examined numerous times and gave no erroneous decision, — such a one is a recognized <i>Mumḥeh.</i>’ On the term <i>Mumḥeh,</i> cf. also Shab. VI, 2 and <i>Gemara</i> ibid. 53b — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication</i> [<i>of monetary cases by</i>] <i>a recognized Mumḥeh so that he judge</i> [<i>not</i>] <i>alone against the will of an individual</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MaHaRIW</i> s. 147 — <i>G.</i> Cf.

The same ruling applies nowadays with respect to the release of vows where a single expert cannot deal with such matters, but a Court of three is required. , <i>Tur</i> and <i>Sh. ‘Ar.</i> Y.D. § 228, 1; § 243, 8, <i>Gloss.</i> The same applies to imposing the fine of a <i>‘Litra</i> of gold’ in the case where one insults a scholar (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 55) — <i>M.E.</i> However, if one recognized Judge rendered an erroneous decision, he is not liable to make restitution. In this sense the term <i>Mumḥeh</i> is still applicable — <i>ShaK.</i></i> Every [group] that does not consist of three [Judges],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 18; San. 31b.</i> <i>and</i> [<i>the litigants</i>] <i>did not accept them</i> [<i>to abide by their decision</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Rashi,</i> San. 5a, s.v. <span>אי קבלוך</span>.</i> <i>and they are not recognized Mumḥin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Hence, if they are experts (<span>מומחין</span>), even if less than three, an admission of indebtedness made before them is considered valid. Thus <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri. Maim.,</i> however, holds (Yad, <i>ibid.</i>) that even if they are experts and duly ordained, — as long as they are less than three, an admission made before them is not binding. But if they are three, even laymen, it would be valid. This is the meaning of <i>Caro</i>’s statement, ‘even if they are duly ordained,’ i.e., even if they are experts (although Yad has ‘even if he is a rcognized <i>Mumḥeh,</i>’ it applies equally to two experts). Consequently, <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> is difficult to comprehend, for it should have been stated as a dissenting opinion. Perhaps <i>Isserles</i> should be understood thus: ‘and they are not Judges who are recognized by the public.’ But this is a strained interpretation — <i>M.E. ShaK</i> rejects the interpretation of <i>M.E.</i> For even if the Judges are recognized by the public, their decision would still be invalid since they are less than three. The reason, therefore, why <i>Isserles</i> does not record this as a dissenting opinion is duel to the fact that the term ‘duly ordained’ (<span>סמוכים</span>) employed by <i>Caro</i> is unclear. For Judges may be duly ordained and yet not be experts (<span>מומחין</span>). , <i>Tur</i> and <i>Asheri infra</i> § 25 that <i>‘Ordination’</i> holds good even for a non-<i>Mumḥeh.</i> The law, however, is that even if they are duly ordained and also experts, — yet, if their number is less than three, an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is not binding (<i>contra Isserles</i>). Thus also <i>‘Ir Shushan</i> — <i>ShaK. A.H.</i> rules that if the litigants accepted the Judges (although their number is less than three) or one Judge who was a recognized authority (<span>מומחח לרבים</span>), e.g., if the people accepted a Rabbi to judge all monetary matters alone, the latter has the status of a Court of Law and an admission made in his presence is binding and the litigants cannot alter their original pleas. Likewise, one who denies aught in his presence and subsequently witnesses appeared and refuted his evidence, is presumed to be a liar even in the future (v. Sh. ‘Ar. anon). So too, may this single Judge compel one to appear before him for judgment and may hear testimony, save that in one respect there is a difference between a single Judge and a Court of Law of three. For in the latter case, an admission made in their presence is regarded as an admission made in writing and another Court may adjudicate the matter in accordance with the testimony and the pleas heard by the first Court of three even if the testimony etc., is submitted by the first Court to the second Court in writing. But if one was accepted as the recognized authority, although, as stated above, an admission made in his presence is regarded as made before a Court of Law of three, and should he on the basis of the information he obtains, render a decision, it would be binding, — yet, if after hearing the testimony and obtaining all the information in the case, — for some reason, it is submitted to another Court for final adjudication, the evidence presented to the second Court for consideration is regarded as having the status of oral testimony offered by a witness testifying to what he has heard from an eye-witness’ (Bek. 36a a.e.) which is invalid. Consequently, the second Court cannot render a decision on the basis of the submitted evidence. And if this testimony is submitted in writing to the second Court, the latter would have to hear the evidence again directly from the contesting parties or the party that made the admission, for the law is that testimony must be offered by witnesses orally and not from their writing (derived from Deut. XIX, 15, <i>At the mouth of two witnesses</i> … <i>shall a matter be established</i> — Git. 71a). But if the single recognized authority completes the adjudication himself, his decision is as binding as the one given by a Court of three — <i>Nethiboth</i>. On testimony offered before a Court, v. <i>infra</i> § 39, 12 and on the authentication of documents, v. <i>infra</i> § 46, 4, <i>Gloss</i>.</i> even [if] they are duly ordained in the Land of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 1.</i> — [the law is that] an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as an admission made outside the Court<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> San. 29b and <i>infra</i> § 39, 7.</i> and they [the litigants] may alter their [original] pleas which they put forth before them [the Judges].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. 31a.</i> One who denies aught before them [the Judges] and subsequently witnesses arrived [and refuted him], is not presumed to be a liar.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">B.M. 17a and <i>Alfasi</i> a.l. However, if he declared before them: ‘You are my witnesses’ or he phrased his statement in the form of a complete admission, he is presumed to be a liar (v. <i>infra</i> §32, 1 and § 81) — <i>M.E. ShaK</i> opposes <i>M.E.</i> and writes that even if he stated: ‘You are my witnesses,’ they are still not regarded as a Court of Law, but only as witnesses. Hence, if he later alters his pleas and states, ‘I paid you,’ he is not presumed to be a liar (v. <i>infra</i> § 79, 9). Cf. however, viewpoint of <i>Nethiboth</i> and <i>A.H. supra</i> n. 2</i> However, regarding the [Court which consists of] three [Judges], although they are not duly ordained, — [the law is that] the admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as one made before a competent Court of Law.

Although one who is a recognized <i>Mumḥeh</i> is permitted to judge alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 11 derived from Aboth IV, 8: ‘Judge not alone.’ <i>Maim.</i> has the reading, ‘One who was a recognized <i>Mumḥeh</i> or obtained permission (to judge) from the Court of Law.’ <i>Tur</i> has, ‘An individual who obtained permission etc.’ On this ruling v. San. 5a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>כגון</span>. Cf. however, Y. San. I, 1(18a): ‘R. Abbahu was sitting alone in judgment in the <i>Turbulent</i> (<span>מרדתא</span>.

Said his disciples to him, Rabbi, have you not taught us thus: Judge not alone? — Said he to them, Since they (the people) see me sitting alone in judgment and yet come to see me (with their cases), it is as though they accepted me (to abide by my decision) and it has thus been taught: When does this apply (that one must not judge alone) ? — If they did not accept him, but if they did accept (him), he may judge even alone.’ One should be careful nowadays not to judge alone even if the litigants accepted him to abide by his decisions, unless he expressly stated, ‘I am not competent to judge matters of strict law (<span>דין תורה</span>) and in case I give an erroneous decision, I am not to be held liable,’ or if it is a matter with which he is familiar and experienced — <i>ShaK.

A person may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 27b: ‘It has been stated: Rab Judah said: A man may not take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests. R. Naḥman said: A man may take the law into his own hands for the sake of safeguarding his interests. Where there is an irretrievable loss pending, all the authorities agree that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests. They differ only where there is no irretrievable loss pending. R. Judah holds that a man may not take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests, for since no irretrievable loss is pending let him go to the Judge; whereas, R. Naḥman maintains that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests, for since he acts according to the law why should he trouble himself (to go to Court) ?’ The law is decided in favour of R. Naḥman. Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 13.</i> If he sees aught that belongs to him in the hand of another person who robbed it [from him], he may take it from his hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. <i>ibid.</i>: ‘Ben Bag Bag stated: Do not enter (stealthily) thy neighbour’s courtyard in order to take aught without his knowledge even if it belongs to you lest you will appear to him as a thief. You may, however, break his teeth and say to him (the alleged offender), I am taking possession of what is mine.’ This deals with a case where the loss is not an irretrievable one and supports R. Naḥman’s viewpoint. Furthermore, we might have thought that the legal principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ applies only to a case where one comes to seize aught that is in the possession of another individual, in which case, the latter, in order to safeguard his interests may take the law into his own hands, but not so in the case where the article is already in the possession of the offender. Ben Bag Bag, therefore, in stating that a man has a right to say, ‘I am taking possession of what is mine,’ informs us otherwise.</i> and if the latter makes a stand against him, he may strike him<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> previous note on Ben Bag Bag’s view and B.K. 27b: Concerning R.

Naḥman asked for the circumstances of the case … There was a well that belonged to two persons, They used it on alternate days. One of them came and used it on a day that was not his. The other said to him: This day is mine! But when the latter paid no attention, he took the blade of a hoe and struck him with it. R. Naḥman replied : He ought to have given him a hundred blows with the hoe.’ Although this case would harmonize even with R. Judah’s view (v. <i>supra</i> n. 1) since it involved an irretrievable loss (for there would be no water left in the well by the time they go to Court), — yet, we see that he was permitted to strike him, whence it follows that even according to the view that one may take the law into his own hands even where no irreparable loss is pending, he may also strike the offender.</i> until he releases it, — <i>if he cannot save</i> [<i>the stolen article</i>] <i>otherwise</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Thus also <i>Asheri.</i> Derived from B.K. 27a in the case of the ox that threw himself on the back of another ox with the intention to kill, where it is pointed out that one may not cause damage to a <i>tort-feasant</i> animal if it was possible to save his own chattel otherwise, even where there is an irretrievable loss involved.

Said Abaye, he should have the right to plead, When I handed over the article it was my own property that I surrendered. Said Raba to him: <i>Is he then believed if he says so?</i> — Raba therefore, said: We impose a ban upon him until he returns the net and appears before the Court.’ It follows that only if he were able to prove that it is his do we apply the principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands.’ Otherwise not. , also M.K. 17a where it is stated that ‘a scholar may take the law into his own hands when he is absolutely certain as to the law,’ whence it follows that one who is not a scholar must be prepared to establish that it is definitely his. For if he cannot prove that the article is his, then not only is he forbidden to strike him and seize the article, but he is forbidden to take the article even without resorting to force. This is applicable only if he seizes the article in the presence of witnesses, but if there are no witnesses present, he may seize it, since then he would be believed before the Court on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 50) — <i>M.E., ShaK.</i></i> Nevertheless, he has no right to seize a pledge for his debt [when it matures].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For if he takes a pledge of him, he transgresses the negative precept, <i>When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his home to fetch his pledge</i> (Deut. XXIV, 10). B.M. 113a: ‘One who lends money to his fellow, may take a pledge of him (when the debt falls due) only through the Court.’ Not only is he prohibited to enter the debtor’s home in order to seize the pledge, but even outside of the home it is permitted only for the Court officer to seize it forcibly according to Samuel (<i>ibid.</i>). If, however, the borrower denies the debt, the lender may seize the pledge without witnesses in order that he be believed on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 6). For the reason why it is forbidden for him proper to seize the pledge is that he can seize the pledge through the Court, but in this case where he cannot collect it through Court, he may seize it himself (v. <i>infra</i> § 97, 15). Cf. also <i>infra</i> § 61, 6. Thus <i>Sha‘ar Mishpat. K.H.</i> reject this — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>On account of the reason which will be explained infra § 97, par. 6.

Another interpretation: You may not enter his house, but you may enter (to distrain) for porterage fees, payment for hiring asses, the hotel bill etc.’ Hence we see that in the latter cases one may take the law into his own hands and seize even a pledge.</i> <i>or where he</i> [<i>the creditor</i>] <i>does not have to take a pledge, — for it</i> [<i>the pledge</i>] <i>is already in his possession as a deposit — or</i> [<i>in the case where</i>] <i>he discovered it in the possession of another person</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>supra</i> n. 7.

Especially according to <i>Tosaf.</i> (B.M. 113a, s.v. <span>אימא</span>) who write that the prohibition against the creditor seizing forcibly from the debtor, even outside of the latter’s home, is only a Rabbinical measure lest he seize in his (the debtor’s) home. According to Zohar, <i>Bamidbar</i> 119a, it is forbidden to seize even a pledge that was deposited with the creditor (<i>K.H.</i>). <i>R.

Consequently, seizing forcibly a pledge where both the Biblical prohibition <i>Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge</i> (Deut. XXIV, 10) as well as the Rabbinical prohibition (v. <i>supra</i> n. 9) do not enter, would be permissible under all conditions and would not come under the category of ‘legal adjudication’ (<span>דינא</span>). Hence, the principle ‘a man may take the law etc.,’ would not be applicable in such a case. For ‘seizure’ (<span>תפיםה</span>) without ‘striking’ (<span>הכאה</span>) is not designated ‘legal adjudication’ (<span>דינא</span>). This is substantiated by B.M. 115a (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 8). The latter text would present difficulties even according to R. Naḥman (needless to say according to R. Judah), for as seen above, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ is applicable only where the article is intact and is certainly his (the claimant’s), but what is not specifically his does not come under this principle. Consequently, it may be asked how may the claimant enter the home of the surety etc., to take or seize an article which is not specifically his? However, if we say that seizure without striking is not ‘legal adjudication,’ he may enter the home of the surety even against the latter’s will, for this is not a case of taking the <i>law</i> into his own hands. As far as Ber. 5b (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 14) is concerned the vine twigs were taken by R. Huna not as ‘seizure’ (<span>תפיםה</span>), but rather as ‘payment’ (<span>תשלומין</span>), i.e., not with the intention to go subsequently to law. Hence, <i>Isserles</i> states here, ‘and subsequently he goes down with him to Court,’ i.e., he may seize the pledge on the condition that he have the matter dealt with subsequently by the Court.</i> <i>This entire</i> [<i>foregoing ruling</i>] <i>deals with one individual in conflict with</i> [<i>another</i>] <i>individual, but</i> [<i>in the case of</i>] <i>an individual in conflict with an</i> [<i>entire</i>] <i>community,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> M.K. 17a where it is stated that ‘a scholar may take the law into his own hands where he is certain that it is his’ (v. <i>supra</i> n. 6) although he may not be able to prove this before others. An entire community enjoys the status of a scholar in this respect. This is substantiated by B.B. 24b on the principle that ‘a pot that belongs to two partners is neither warm nor cold,’ i.e., since the opinions of an entire community differ and each townsman would rely upon the other, the Rabbis were lenient with them and gave them the status of a scholar even if the individual townsman would suffer thereby. Furthermore, in the case of an entire community it is difficult to ascertain the matter, since they are all interested parties as in the case of a scholar who cannot ascertain his case before others being occupied with his learning. Consequently, the <i>onus</i> of proof rests upon the defendant.

It is for this reason that <i>Isserles</i> does not state the law regarding one who is not a member of the community, for it seems that he is doubtful regarding this matter — <i>M.E.

Also with respect to a pledge that has to be given by the individual to the community (v. <i>Gloss</i> anon) before going to Court, the law is that there is no difference between an individual from the same town or not — <i>W.G.</i></i> <i>they may take the law into their own hands in order to safeguard their interests,</i> [<i>provided</i>] <i>if they know that the law is in their favour, although they are unable to prove</i> [<i>this</i>] <i>before the Court of Law, — for they cannot testify since they are all interested parties in the matter.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA Resp.</i> 27, s. 95 — <i>G.</i></i> <i>, § 7, par. 12 and § 37.

This is substantiated by B.B. 55a : ‘If property is purchased by rich landlords (they paid to the government the tax on land, the owners of which were in arrears and thus became the owners of the land) who buy up land from the ruler or his servants and pay the tax on it, the sale is valid. This has reference, however, only to (land) which is transferred to the rich landlords because of the land tax, but if on account of the poll tax, then a purchase from them is not valid, because the poll tax is a personal liability. R. Huna, the son of R. Joshua said that even barley in the pot is seizable for the poll tax. R. Ashi said: Huna b. Nathan told me that Amram found that this view is untenable because if it were so, it would interfere with the law of the double portion to which a firstborn is entitled in the case of an inheritance (Deut. XXI, 17), for all the (inherited) property would thus become ‘prospective’ (since all the property was seizable by the government on account of the poll tax) and (the law is that) a firstborn does not receive a double portion in prospective as in actual assets.’ The Gemara concludes that the father must have paid the land tax prior to his death thereby making his assets actual. Hence, we see that the tax collectors who are authorized by the government are considered ‘actual possessors’ (<span>מוחזקים</span>). , <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>אם כן</span>. Thus also according to Yeb. 46a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>כי נפקי</span>. Consequently, the townsmen may say to the individual, ‘Prove your case because it is the claimant that must produce evidence’ (<span>המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה</span>).

Gemara: Why cannot the owner of the tree say, Compensate me first and I will then cut it down? … A pot with two cooks is neither hot nor cold’ (i.e., each townsman will wait for some other to compensate as a result of which the tree will still remain). Similarly, in the present case, the pledge must be given by the individual to the townsmen and the former becomes the claimant, otherwise the matter will be neglected.</i> <i>The fact that they are called actual possessors with respect to an individual applies only in matters of taxes but not in other cases</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. 24b: In the case of the tree which must be kept away from a town a distance of twenty-five feet cubits (v. previous note), the Mishna states that ‘if the town was there first, the tree is cut down (by the townsmen) and no compensation is given. If the tree was there first, it is cut down and compensation is given. If there is a doubt which was there first, it is cut down and no compensation is given. Gemara asks : Why in the case of pit (<i>ibid.</i> 25b) is it stated that (in the case of a doubt whether the pit or the tree was there first) the tree is not cut down? — With respect to pit it is stated that if the tree was certainly (there first) it is not cut down (contrary to the case of the tree that was there before the town was founded). Consequently, when there is a doubt we also do not say to him, Cut it down. However, in the present case even if the tree was there first it is cut down, consequently, if there is a doubt we also say to him, Cut it down. And should the question of compensation arise, we say to him, Produce evidence that it is yours (i.e., that the tree was there first) and take compensation.’ It follows therefrom that the fundamental reason for cutting down the tree in the case of doubt and not giving compensation is because it is obligatory to remove the tree and since we rule that even if it is certain that the tree was there first, it is cut down, consequently, the doubt remains only regarding the compensation and the townsmen are regarded as the ‘actual possessors.’ Hence, only with respect to monetary matters do they enjoy the status of ‘actual possessors,’ being empowered by the ruler or the government, but not in other matters.</i> <i>Nevertheless, he must give</i> [<i>them</i>] <i>a pledge before they go down to Court with him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumath ha-Deshen</i> s. 341 — <i>G.</i> The pledge must be given by the individual even in a case where the community does not enjoy the status of a possessor, so that the individual should be the claimant.  <i>supra</i> n. 23.</i> <i>This entire</i> [<i>foregoing ruling applies only</i>] <i>where the individual</i> [<i>who is in conflict with the community</i>] <i>is not a scholar, but if he is a scholar where the</i> [<i>study of the</i>] <i>Torah is his</i> [<i>sole</i>] <i>profession and he has a claim in this</i> [<i>matter</i>] <i>on account of taxes, he is not required to give them a pledge and they too are not called actual possessors with respect to him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>R.

It is forbidden to try [civil suits] on the Sabbath and on a Festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Beẓ. 36b: ‘None may judge’ (in a lawsuit) on the Sabbath or on a Festival. This is included among the optional secular acts (<span>רשות</span>) enumerated <i>ibid.</i> (An optional secular act refers to one that involves somewhat of a religious act). Explained <i>ibid.</i> 37a: ‘It is a preventive measure lest he write,’ i.e., the arguments and the decision (<span>פםק דין</span>). , O.H. § 339, 4; § 524,  Thus also Yad, <i>Shabbath</i> XXIII, 14. The members of the <i>Beth Din</i> should be careful not to assemble on the Sabbath in the locale where they ordinarily conduct legal proceedings during weekdays lest it should appear that they are sitting in judgment (v. San. 88b where it is stated that on Sabbaths and Festivals the Great Sanhedrin did not meet in the Hall of Hewn stones but rather in the <i>Ḥel.</i> Cf. <i>Ba’er Heteb</i> to O.Ḥ. § 339, n. 3) — <i>P.Tesh.</i> However, if this locale is also used as a meeting place for those who occupy themselves with the needs of the community, it is permissible, — for the law is that one is permitted to devote himself to communal needs on the Sabbath (O.Ḥ. § 306). On <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> it is permissible to hold judicial sessions and to put the decision down in writing (O.Ḥ. § 545, 5) — <i>A.H.</i></i> However, if one violated [this law] and judged [on the Sabbath or Festival], his decision is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> state that the source of this law is the Y.

[Civil suits] are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Y. San. IV, 7(22b) ; Y. Beẓ. V, 2(63a); Y. Ket. I, 1(24d) where it is stated that the Mishna in San. 32a: ‘Capital cases are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival’ (since in case of condemnation the verdict must be carried out on the following day which is impossible were the trial to be held on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Moreover, it would be against the law to leave judgment in suspense until after the Sabbath or Festival — San. 35a. Cf. M.K. 14b) implies that civil suits <i>may</i> be tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Hence, <i>Caro</i>’s ruling presents a difficulty. Y. (<i>ibid.</i>) therefore, explains that the prohibition against adjudication of civil suits on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival is merely a Rabbinical measure. Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XI, 3; <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> to San. <i>ibid.</i> Even if the litigants agreed to appear before the Judges on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, the prohibition still stands. For the Judges must be deliberate in judgment and since they are busy preparing for the Sabbath or Festival, this is not possible (<i>contra ‘Ir Shushan</i> who writes that the reason is that the people are busy making the festive preparations and should therefore, not be summoned then). This is substantiated by <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> (anon), ‘but where a prohibition is involved (e.g., divorce or <i>Ḥalizah</i> proceedings) the lenient view should not be adopted’ and in <i>D.M., Isserles</i> adds, ‘for they (the Judges) are busy with the Sabbath preparations and cannot be deliberate in judgment.’ Thus we see that it is on account of the preoccupation of the Judges. This applies only to adjudication, but as regards hearing the pleas of the litigants and issuing the verdict after the Sabbath or Festival, it would be permissible from the Judges’ standpoint to meet for this purpose on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival (Thus <i>RaN</i> to Ket. beg.). The litigants, however, cannot be compelled to appear. This is the meaning of the following statement of <i>Caro</i>, ‘If they summoned a litigant to appear . . he is not obliged to come,’ i.e., even if the summons was for the purpose of hearing the pleas only, or it may mean that even if the Judges are free (e.g., others make the festive preparations for them), yet, the litigants cannot be compelled to appear — <i>M.E. Nethiboth</i>, however, maintains that if the litigants are willing to accept the verdict even if it is erroneous, the Judges may try their case even on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival.</i> If they summoned a litigant to appear before the Court of Law [on these days], he is not obliged to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 113a; Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXV, 9. , end of previous note.</i> Even if they summoned [him on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival] to appear after the Sabbath or Festival, and he did not come, we do not penalize him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. <i>ibid.</i> For he may offer the reason that he was busy preparing for the Sabbath or the Festival and did not take notice of the summons (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>M.E., ShaK</i>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>There is an authority who writes that nowadays we may conduct legal proceedings on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival on account of the neglect of</i> [<i>Torah instruction by</i>] <i>teachers</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For throughout the week if they should have to appear in Court, the study of the Torah would be neglected. Hence, on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival when they are free from teaching, it is their only opportunity to appear in Court, if necessary. Hence, if the <i>Beth Din</i> finds it necessary to adjudicate cases on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, it is permissible. A substantiation for this leniency may be derived from the following Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the contesting parties) said to the other: I accept my father or your father as trustworthy (to act as a Judge), or I accept three herdsmen as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.’ The law is in accord with the Sages, viz., that he cannot retract. It follows therefrom that no prohibition exists against a <i>Beth Din</i> which is Biblically ineligible to adjudicate the case, provided the litigants agreed to accept the ineligible Judges. This applies, of course, to a community where no eligible Judges are available, and such a <i>Beth Din</i> is valid under the circumstances (v. <i>infra</i> § 8, 1; § 22, 1). This is binding only in civil lawsuits, but not where a prohibition is involved. Hence, the ruling of <i>Isserles</i> anon — <i>W.G.</i> (in accord with interpretation of <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i>).</i> <i>And only with respect to a monetary lawsuit may we adopt this lenient view, — for an expropriation made by the Court is valid</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the Judges erred because they could not be deliberate in their judgment — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>but where a prohibition</i> [<i>is involved</i>], <i>the lenient view should not be adopted</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumath ha-Deshen</i> s. 227 and <i>Hag.

But after the Festival a date may be fixed. The reason mentioned <i>supra</i> n. 5 does not apply here since there was ample time for him to take notice of the summons. Thus <i>Isserles</i> anon — <i>ShaK</i>. In the month of <i>Sivan</i> it would be permissible to summon one to Court because <i>Shabuoth</i> which occurs in this month consists only of two days in the Diaspora (and one day in the Land of Israel) and the question of preoccupation does not apply. On the eve of <i>Shabuoth</i> it would still be forbidden for the reasons stated above — <i>M.E.</i> Some authorities, <i>contra ShaK</i>, forbid the entire months of <i>Nisan</i> and <i>Tishri</i>. There are twenty-one days during which a Groom should not be summoned to appear in Court, viz., seven days prior to the wedding; the seven days of the wedding-feast; seven days following the wedding-feast. Other authorities hold that a Groom should not be summoned only three days before and seven days after the wedding. A widower who marries a widow is not to be summoned during the three days after the marriage (E.H. § 64). In other cases of religious duties, e.g., a circumcision, the <i>Sandek</i> or the father of the child, should they have to appear in Court, the days to be fixed for the hearing should be left to the discretion of the Judges — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> for one who is not [a resident] in town, to appear for trial;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">But a resident in the same town may be judged. Thus <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Mord</i>., whence we infer that if the contending parties agree to appear for trial from another town, they may be judged throughout the month of <i>Nisan</i> or <i>Tishri</i> (except on the eve of the Festival) — <i>M.E.</i> The opinion of <i>Tur.</i> and <i>Mord</i>. is substantiated by M.K. 14b where it is taught (derived from Tosef.

But <i>Isserles</i> does not make any comment (<i>ibid.</i>) as in the present ruling, although <i>Mord</i>. is the source of the ruling in O.Ḥ. too. It is quite possible that <i>Caro</i> in O.Ḥ. is dealing with a case where it is permissible to bring charges in the month of <i>Nisan, e.g.</i>, where the accused was one of the townsmen or there was deliberate postponement and deception on the part of the accused party, in which case as stated here, it is permissible. Hence, in O.Ḥ. under the above conditions, it is not forbidden to bring charges — <i>M.E.</i> This interpretation is questioned by <i>Ba’er Heteb</i> a.l., for <i>Isserles</i> states here that even villagers who came from out of town are not to be tried whence we infer that much more so in the case of residents is this forbidden. <i>M.E.</i> may, however, be defended for in O.Ḥ. § 539, 3 <i>Isserles</i> does comment, viz., <i>‘He is permitted to bring charges</i> (against his fellow) <i>in</i> (the place of) <i>judgment on account of his debts.’ M.Abr.</i> rejects the interpretation of <i>M.E.</i>, for in O.Ḥ. we deal with bringing charges before a heathen Court, which is permissible during the Festival. This is what is meant by the term <span>משפט</span> (‘in the place of judgment’) employed in O.Ḥ. <i>M.E.</i> is defended by <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> because <i>M.E.</i> refers to § 546 where <i>Caro</i> states the law without using the term <span>משפט</span> (‘in the place of judgment’), i.e., even before a Jewish Court. <i>Maḥaẓith ha-Shekel</i> and <i>Peri Megadim</i> defend <i>M.Abr.</i> for in O.Ḥ. § 546 too, the source is <i>Mord. Tummim</i> makes the following distinction: In the present ruling we deal with a case of one who not only brings charges against his fellow but also, demands that the matter be adjudicated, which is forbidden during this period; whereas in O.Ḥ. we deal with a case where the plaintiff demands payment and refers to a matter which is not contested by the accused party. Hence, it is permissible to be done on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>and if we</i> [<i>are able to detect that</i>] <i>there is</i> [<i>deliberate</i>] <i>postponement and deception</i> [<i>on the part of the summoned party in order to avoid justice</i>], <i>we may adjudicate</i> [<i>the matter</i>] <i>forthwith</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mord</i>. to B.K. X beg. and <i>Hag. Maim.</i> — <i>G.</i> B.K. 113a: ‘R. Naḥman said: We never summon the participants of the <i>Kallah</i> (the assembly of Babylonian students in the months of <i>Elul</i> and <i>Adar</i>) to appear in Court during the period of the <i>Kallah</i> or the participants of the Festival sessions which are held during the festive season (which begins thirty days prior to the Festival). When plaintiffs would come before R. Naḥman (and requested that summonses be issued during this season) he would say to them: Have I assembled them for your individual benefit? But now that there are impostors (who take advantage of this privilege) there is apprehension (that they came to the assemblies for the sake of avoiding justice) !’ The last part of this statement, ‘and now that there are impostors’ is explained by <i>Mord</i>. to mean that we investigate the matter in order to determine whether there is a deliberate postponement or deception on their part in order to avoid justice. Hence, if we discover that this is really the case, we do fix a date for them to appear in Court during the <i>Kallah</i> and the festive sessions.</i> <i>There are some localities where the adopted custom is that if they had begun to adjudicate</i> [<i>the matter</i>] <i>before Nisan and Tishri, we may fix a date</i> [<i>for the continuation of the hearing</i>] <i>even therein</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">e., during <i>Nisan</i> and <i>Tishri</i>.

Gemara (<i>ibid.</i> 34b) : ‘Whence is this derived? R. Ḥiyya b. Papa said: From the verse, <i>And let them judge the people at all times</i> (Ex. XVIII, 22 i.e., even at night). If this is the case, then even the commencement of the trial may (be held at night) — It is as Raba expounded. For Raba pointed out an incongruity (between two verses) : It is written, <i>And let them judge the people at all times</i> (<i>ibid.</i>); but elsewhere it is written, <i>And in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</i> (Deut. XXI, 16. Here <i>day</i> is emphasized whence it follows that not only cases of inheritance must be decided by day but likewise all civil claims. Hence, this verse contradicts the preceding one). How now is this (reconciled)? — The day is for the commencement of the trial, the night for the conclusion of the trial’ (for, <i>and they shall judge … at all times</i> implies rendering judgment which is the essential factor). In <i>Resp.</i> of <i>Isserles</i> he writes that if the contesting parties agreed to be judged at night, it is permissible to do so, for this should not be regarded different from a case where the litigants accepted as Judge a relative or one who is ineligible. For this reason we adopt the lenient practice nowadays to judge at night, for when the parties appear for trial and come willingly, it is regarded as though they accepted him. Hence, the proceedings may be held at night. Thus <i>M.E. P.Tesh</i> cites dissenting opinions. <i>Caro</i>’s ruling that ‘they may conclude at night’ has reference to cases where there was not enough time to complete the proceedings during the day — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> <i>Some say that if they violated</i> [<i>this ruling</i>] <i>and tried cases at night</i> [<i>even with respect to the commencement of the trial</i>], <i>their decision holds good</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBaM</i> (to B.B. 114a, s.v. <span>אפילו</span>) — <i>G.</i> Derived from Y.

Cf. <i>infra</i> § 28, 24; San. 11b: The sanctification of the month must take place during the day. This is based on the verse, <i>For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the G-d of Jacob</i>. Thus we see that the sanctification of the month is equated to <i>Judgment</i> which is executed during the day. <i>ShaK</i> rules, <i>contra</i> the present ruling that if the entire legal proceedings were conducted at night, the decision is not valid.</i>
The time when Judges sit [in judgment] is from the morning until the end of the fifth hour.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. 10a: ‘Until when do they sit in judgment? — R. Shesheth said until mealtime. R. Ḥama said, Which Biblical verse (teaches this) ? — For it is written, <i>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! Happy art thou O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness!</i> (Eccl. X, 16f) [i.e.,] in the strength of the Torah and not in the drinking of wine.’ (‘Princes’ are taken here as ‘Judges’ who first sit in judgment and then have their meal). <i>Ibid.</i>: ‘The sixth hour is the mealtime for scholars.’ , also O.Ḥ. § 157. <i>Tur</i> writes, ‘until mid-day’ and <i>Maim.</i> (Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> III, 1) states, ‘until the end of the sixth hour.’ <i>Caro</i> in <i>B.Yos.</i> states that this is incorrect, for the sixth hour is the mealtime for scholars and ‘after that it is like throwing a stone into a leather bottle’ (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>), i.e., it has no effect or is indigestible. <i>Caro</i> in the present ruling follows <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> to San.  It is quite likely that both <i>Tur</i> and <i>Maim.</i> in using the expression ‘until’ may mean ‘exclusive of’ (<span>עד ולא עד בכלל</span>) i.e., close to midday or close to the end of the sixth hour, so that the mealtime begins for the Judges <i>before</i> the sixth hour is over and is extended into the seventh hour. Eating something before the end of the sixth hour would be equivalent to partaking of something in the morning in which case it matters not if the main meal is postponed (v. Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>M.E., BaḤ, ShaK.</i> Cf. <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> According to Zohar, <i>Mishpatim</i> 122a, one must not sit in judgment after partaking of a meal.

Cf. however, M.K. 14b. <i>Tur</i> at the head of this chapter adds, that originally it was enacted by Ezra, the Scribe, that Courts hold their sessions on Mondays and Thursdays (B.K. 82a) for then people were present since they came to read the Torah. Today, however, all days are similar. Hence, this was not mentioned by <i>Caro</i> — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>From that time onward they are not obliged to sit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from Shab. <i>ibid.</i> ‘R. Ammi and R. Assi were sitting and studying between the columns (of the study-house). From <i>time to time</i> they would knock at the side of the door and say: If there is anyone who has a lawsuit, let him enter and come in. R. Ḥisda and Rabbah, son of R. Huna were sitting in judgment all day and their hearts grew faint (<i>Rashi</i>: they were distressed at not being able to study. Or because they were famished), (whereupon) R. Ḥiyya b. Rab of Difta expounded to them, <i>and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening</i> (Ex. XVIII, 13) ; Can it really enter your mind that Moses sat and judged the entire day? When was his learning done? But this teaches you, Every Judge who judges in complete truth even for one hour, the Bible text credits him as though he had become a partner to the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation. Here it is written, <i>and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening</i>, and elsewhere it is written, <i>and there was morning and there was evening one day</i> (Gen. I, 5).’ According to <i>Rashi</i>’s second interpretation they were not obliged to sit and judge throughout the entire day.</i>
They [the Judges] do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour even to conclude the trial until they recite the [major] <i>Minḥa</i> service.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Shab. 9b in accord with R. Aḥa b. Jacob (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) who explains that this has reference even to the conclusion of the trial (<span>גמר דין</span>) where the pleas of the litigants have already been heard, for the Judges may discover an argument in order to reverse the judgment which will necessitate hearing the pleas afresh and will thereby forget to recite the <i>Minḥa</i> service. Thus also Yad, <i>Tefillah</i> VI, 5. According to <i>Rashi ibid.</i> s.v. <span>מנחה גדולה</span>, the major <i>Minḥa</i> begins from six and a half hours and onwards (assuming that the day begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends at 6:00 p.m. An ‘hour’ means a twelfth part of the day), i.e., from 12:30 p.m. The expression ‘close to’ (<span>םמוך</span>) used in Mishna <i>ibid.</i> means half an hour before the appointed time. This is derived from Pes. 99b where <span>םמוך למנחה</span> (close to <i>Minḥa</i>) refers to one half hour before the minor <i>Minḥa</i>. Hence, the same applies to the major <i>Minḥa</i> which begins from six and half hours and onwards. Cf. also <i>ibid</i> 100b and v. Ber. 26b: ‘Which is the major <i>Minḥa?</i> — From six hours and a half onwards. Which is the minor <i>Minḥa?</i> — From nine hours and a half and onwards,’ i.e., from 3:30 onwards. Consequently, we do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour. Legally the beginning of the seventh hour (12 noon) is the time for reciting <i>Minḥa</i> (v. O.Ḥ. § 232, 2), only that the Sages ordained to wait an additional half an hour in order to make certain that the sun is beginning to decline, for otherwise one may err with respect to the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh hour — <i>M.E.</i></i> However, if they began, even the commencement of the trial, they need <i>not</i> interrupt,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Shab. <i>ibid.</i> Just as ‘in the first instance’ no distinction is made between the beginning of the trial (<span>תחלת דין</span>) and the conclusion of the trial (<span>גמר דין</span>), so too, if they had already begun, no such distinction is made.

The Judges do not hold a judicial session [on account of a claim] less than a <i>Perutah's</i> worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">B.M. 55a: ‘Levi taught in his Baraitha collection … A Court session is convened on account of a <i>Perutah’s</i> worth’ (If one admits liability or there are witnesses to substantiate this admission, and payment is nevertheless refused, a Court session may be held in order to compel the debtor to pay). For in the case of robbery of less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, it is not considered ‘money’ (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> In the case of a claim of vessels, however, the Court meets even if less than a <i>Perutah’s</i> worth is involved. , <i>infra</i> § 88, 3. Thus also <i>RaN</i> to Sheb. VI, <i>R. Yeruḥam; Maim</i>. Yad, <i>To‘en we-Nit‘an</i> III, 5. Others oppose this view and maintain that even in the case of vessels a Court session meets only when at least a <i>Perutah’s</i> worth is involved, for less than that is not considered ‘money’ — <i>ShaK. Tummim</i> states that <i>Shitah Mekubeẓeth</i> writes on the authority of <i>RITBA</i> (to B.M. <i>ibid.</i>) that if the claim concerns an object that is still extant, a Court session may meet for this purpose, even if it involves a claim of less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. It is only when payment is demanded that it must involve at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. In the case of two partners who have a claim against an individual in the amount of a <i>Perutah</i>, the law is that although the claim involves only half a <i>Perutah</i> with respect to each partner, yet, since the claim of the partners as a whole involves at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, we may hold a Court session therefor. This would not apply to two individuals (not partners) who together have a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth against the same party — <i>P.Tesh., A.H.</i> If one person has a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth against two people, a judicial session may be held therefor, since with respect to the plaintiff the claim is regarded as ‘money’ — <i>A.H.</i> If the Court held a session for a claim that involved less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, such Court has the jurisdiction of a <i>Beth Din</i> insofar as admissions made in their presence are considered binding. Likewise with respect to one who was found to be a liar at such a session, the law is that he remains under such presumption — <i>Nethiboth</i>.</i> However, if they met [on account of a claim of] a <i>Perutah's</i> worth, they may conclude their trial even for [a claim] less than a <i>Perutah's</i> worth.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>Maim.</i> Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XX, 11 in accord with R.

Raba raised an objection: <i>And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing</i> (Lev. V, 16), this (redundant <i>and</i>) extends the law of making amends even to less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. Hence, it applies only to <i>Hekdesh</i> but not to <i>Ḥullin!</i> (i.e., only in the case of sacred objects amends should be made even regarding less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, but not in secular objects. In the latter case one may be compelled to restore aught that involves at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth) — But if it was said, it was said thus: R. Kattina stated, If the Court met for a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, they may conclude (the case) even for less (i.e., if for some reason the claim was reduced to less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth), (because) at the commencement of the trial a <i>Perutah</i> must be involved, but at the conclusion a (claim of a) <i>Perutah</i>’s worth is not necessary.’ This latter statement viz., that ‘at the commencement of the trial … not necessary,’ should be understood as follows: Even if the defendant after the verdict is rendered puts forth a claim against the plaintiff which involves less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, the Judges may conclude the trial even for this amount, the reason being that it is all regarded as one trial, for if the defendant is legally proven to be justified in his claim, he may deduct whatever is owing to him from the plaintiff’s claim. Thus <i>Rashi ibid.</i> and <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> It is for this reason that <i>Caro</i> in the present ruling states, ‘and they may conclude <i>their</i> trial,’ whereas <i>Maim. ibid.</i> has ‘and they may conclude <i>his</i> trial’ — <i>M.E.</i> , B.M. <i>ibid., Tosaf</i>. s.v. <span>ותנא דידן</span>; <i>W.G.</i> and <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i> a.l. <i>M.E.</i> adopts the ruling of <i>Asheri contra Maim.</i>, that even if they hold a session for a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, they may not conclude the proceedings for less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. If for some reason the plaintiff’s original claim is reduced to less than a <i>Perutah</i> and at the conclusion of the trial the plaintiff puts forth another claim of less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, according to some, even <i>Asheri</i> will hold that the trial may be concluded, because both claims are combined. <i>BaḤ</i>, however, disagrees with this — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i>

A Court of three [Judges] of which one was a proselyte is unfit to judge a fellow Israelite<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">e., in civil suits — <i>M.E.</i> Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XI, 11 and cf. <i>ibid. Melakim</i> I, 4. Derived from Yeb. 102a: ‘Raba said: A proselyte may judge a fellow proselyte according to Biblical law, for it is said, <i>Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy G-d shall choose, one from among thy bretheren, shalt thou set king over thee</i> (Deut. XVII, 15. ‘King’ is taken to mean also ‘Judge.’  Prov. XXIX, 4); only when set <i>over thee</i> must he be <i>one from among thy brethren</i>, but a proselyte may judge his fellow proselyte.’ <i>Rashi</i> explains this passage as referring to capital cases, for as far as civil suits are concerned, a proselyte may judge even Israelites according to Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are eligible to judge civil suits’ which is explained in Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 36b: <i>‘All</i> includes a proselyte.<i>’ Tosaf.</i> (Yeb. 45b, s.v. <span>כיון</span>) however, maintain that the passage in Yeb. 102a refers to civil suits (i.e., if his mother was not an Israelitish woman he may judge only a fellow proselyte in civil suits but not an Israelite), and as to the text in San. <i>ibid.</i> it refers to a proselyte who judges a fellow proselyte only. <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> write that in San. we deal with a proselyte whose mother was an Israelitish woman. <i>Caro</i>’s present ruling, viz., that even if one of the members of the <i>Beth Din</i> is a proselyte, the Court is unfit to judge an Israelite, is derived from Yeb. 101b: ‘R. Samuel b. Judah was once standing before Rab Judah when the latter said to him, Come up to this bundle of reeds (a place designated for a <i>Ḥaliẓah</i> ceremony) to be counted in the number of five (judges at the <i>Ḥaliẓah</i> ceremony) so that the matter be publicized well (i.e., in order that it become known that she is a <i>Ḥaluẓah</i> and forbidden to a <i>Kohen</i>). We have learned, the first said, <i>In Israel</i> (Deut. XXVI, 10) means at a Court of Israelites, but not at a Court of proselytes, and I am a proselyte.’ This shows that even if one of the members of the Court is a proselyte, it is unfit to judge. Even the children’s children of a proselyte are ineligible to judge Israelites — <i>M.E.</i></i> unless his<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The proselyte’s.</i> mother<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yeb. 102a: ‘If his mother was an Israelitish woman (i.e., even if his father is non-Jewish — <i>R.A.Eger</i>) he may judge even an Israelite.’ For then the proselyte is considered <i>one from among thy brethren</i>. , Yeb. 45a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>כיון</span>.

If his father alone was an Israelite (and his mother was a proselyte — <i>R.A.Eger</i>) it goes without saying that the proselyte may judge a fellow Israelite — <i>M.E.</i></i> were Israelitish. A proselyte may, however, judge his fellow proselyte<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">e., a real proselyte; but if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition (his mother became a Jewess before conception), he is regarded as a genuine Israelite, in which case the Judge must be the issue of an Israelitish woman (v.

But as far as the proselyte Judge is concerned even if he was conceived and born in a hallowed condition, he may not judge a fellow-Israelite — <i>R.A.

[A Judge who genealogically is] a bastard<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>ממזר</span>. On the meaning of this term, v. Mishna Yeb. IV, 13 and E.H. § 4, 13.</i> and even if the three of them [who comprise the Court] are bastards, they are eligible to act as Judges<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">San. 36b: Mishna: ‘All are fit to try civil suits.’ Gemara: ‘What does <i>all</i> include? — It is meant to include a bastard. Have we not already learnt this before (Nid. 49b), Whoever is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try civil suits. However, there are some who are fit to try civil suits but not capital cases … One was intended to include a proselyte, the other a bastard.’ , <i>supra</i> n. 1. Just as a proselyte may try a fellow-proselyte even if he has to compel the latter to appear before him for trial (v. <i>supra</i> n. 6), so too, in the case of a bastard-Judge. This is derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are fit to try civil suits, but not all are fit to try capital cases,’ which means that as in the case of capital charges, compulsion may be used, so too, in the case of civil suits, the bastard-Judge may use compulsion — <i>Be’er Eliyahu. Caro</i>’s ruling that even if the entire <i>Beth Din</i> is comprised of bastard-Judges they are considered fit to judge, is derived from the expression (San. <i>ibid.</i>) ‘<i>all</i> (<span>הכל</span>) are eligible,’ which is meant to include not only if one of the Judges was a bastard, but even if an entire Court of three consists of bastard-Judges, they are eligible to act as Judges.

Not as in the case of a proselyte who may judge only a fellow-proselyte if the former’s mother was not an Israelitish woman. The bastard-Judge may try even Israelites. This is deduced from Kid. <i>ibid.</i> according to the interpretation of San. 36b. <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>חדא</span>. For contrary to the proselyte whose mother was not an Israelitish woman and consequently may only judge a fellow-proselyte, the bastard is of Jewish ancestry.</i> Thus also if each one of them was blind in one of his eyes, he is eligible [to act as Judge].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Yad <i>ibid.; N; Ba‘al ha-Maor; R. Sherira Gaon a.o.</i> This refers even to the ‘commencement of a trial.’ <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> state the reason as follows: Since all other people may conclude the trial by night and the eyesight of one blind in one eye is better by day, consequently, the latter may judge even at the commencement of the trial (<i>M.E.</i>), even ‘in the first instance.’ For if this applies only to the conclusion of the trial, how can there be a conclusion without a commencement of the trial — <i>Lebush</i> and <i>Tummim</i>. Here too, it refers to both one Judge or three Judges blind in one eye — <i>A.H.</i> , <i>supra</i> nn. 6 and 8. The present ruling is derived from San. 34b; Nid. 49b-50a: ‘Our Mishna (that a decision may be given at night) disagrees with R. Meir. For it has been taught, R. Meir would say, What is the meaning of the verse, <i>According to their word shall every controversy and every leprosy be</i> (Deut. XXI, 5) ? What connection is there between controversies and leprosies? Controversies are compared to leprosies: just as leprosies must be examined by day, since it is written, <i>And in the day when raw flesh appeareth in him</i> (Lev. XIII, 14) so must controversies be tried by day; and as leprosies are not to be examined by the blind (even in one eye, v. Neg. II, 3), for it is written, <i>Wherever the priest looketh</i> (<i>ibid.</i> v. 12), so controversies also may not be tried by a blind man (even in one eye only — <i>Yad Ramah</i>) … A blind man who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Joḥanan used to try civil suits and R. Joḥanan raised no objection against it. But how could he (R. Joḥanan) act so (to permit him to judge) ? Did not R. Joḥanan actually say, The <i>Halakah</i> agrees with an anonymous Mishna, and we have learnt (the following anonymous Mishna) : Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify. However, one may be fit to testify but not eligible to judge, and R. Joḥanan said that this includes one who is blind in one eye (consequently, R. Joḥanan should have objected to the blind man who acted as Judge) ? — R. Joḥanan found another anonymous Mishna (according to which a blind man may judge): Civil suits must be tried by day and may be concluded by night (San. 32a. Hence, according to this Mishna ‘controversies’ were not assimilated to ‘leprosies.’ Consequently, they were not compared with respect to the unfitness of a blind man either, since there are many whose eyesight is as dim by night as a blind man during the day and yet, it states that they may conclude the trial by night). Why is this anonymous Mishna (San.) preferable to the other (Nid.) ? — If you wish I might say, An anonymous Mishna which expresses the view of the majority is preferable (in Nid. the individual opinion of R. Meir is given; in San. that of the majority of the Rabbis), and if you wish I might reply that it (San.) was taught in the tractate dealing with legal procedure (whereas in Nid. it is cited only incidentally).’</i> However, one who is blind in both his eyes is ineligible [to act as Judge].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Yad <i>ibid.</i> For only in the case of one blind in one eye is it permissible, whence it follows that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, since everyone agrees that it is forbidden to try cases at night (v. <i>supra</i> § 5, 2) and for one blind in both eyes the day too, is like night for him — <i>M.E. ‘Ir Shushan</i> deduces the prohibition against one blind in both eyes from the comparison made between ‘controversies’ and ‘leprosies’ (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 10). This is rejected by <i>M.E.</i>, for in San. and Nid. <i>ibid.</i> it was explained that this represents an individual opinion (R. Meir). Furthermore, on this principle, even one blind in one eye would be ineligible. <i>W.G.</i> writes <i>contra M.E.</i> that the eligibility of one blind in one eye is not on account of the comparison with ‘night’ during which a trial may be concluded, for then one blind in both eyes should be fit to judge, but it is rather derived from the general rule in the first part of the Mishna (Nid. <i>ibid.</i>), viz., ‘Whosoever is fit to judge is fit to testify,’ and since one blind in both eyes is ineligible to offer testimony, he is likewise unfit to judge. According to <i>M.E.</i> (who follows <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i>), a Judge whose eyesight was unimpaired at the commencement of the trial and before the trial was concluded became blind, would be eligible to judge at the conclusion of the trial (v. <i>supra</i>); whereas, according to ‘<i>Ir Shushan</i> who compares ‘controversies’ to ‘leprosies,’ he would be ineligible — <i>P.Tesh</i>. An actual case is reported in <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> where the litigants were tried by three Judges and after the pleas were heard and the testimony was offered, one of the Judges accidentally became blind in both eyes, whereupon one of the litigants objected to the participation of the blind Judge in the conclusion of the trial. <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> after stating the views of the <i>Codifiers</i>, viz., a) <i>Maim.</i> — one blind in both eyes is ineligible to judge even at the conclusion of the trial; b) <i>Tosaf., SeMaG</i> and <i>Mord</i>. — eligible even for the commencement of the trial, c) <i>Alfasi</i> — ineligible for the commencement of the trial, eligible for the conclusion, — ruled in accordance with the last opinion (<i>Alfasi</i>). Hence, the Judge in the above case who became blind in both eyes before the conclusion of the trial, is eligible to judge together with the other two judges and give a decision. <i>BaḤ</i> also states that <i>ex post facto</i> (<span>בדיעבד</span>) the decision of one blind in both eyes is valid. Moreover, the above case may be considered as <i>ex post facto</i>, since the pleas and testimony were already heard before the accident happened. In addition it may be said that since three Judges were present, then even if the decision of the now blind Judge is not valid, yet, on the basis of <i>BeHaG</i> and <i>Tosaf.</i> who accept Samuel’s dictum, ‘If two Judges tried a case, their decision holds good’ (San. 2b. Cf. <i>supra</i> § 3, 2), the recalcitrant litigant may be compelled to accept their decision. However, according to <i>Tummim, Nethiboth</i> a.o., even if the Judge became blind at the conclusion of the trial, he is ineligible — <i>P.Tesh</i>. One whose eyesight is very dim but is not blind may act as Judge. According to the majority of the <i>Codifiers</i> who rule that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, support for this may also be found in the following passage in Ket. 94b: ‘(R. Joḥanan) said (to R. Shesheth who was totally blind), I am a Judge and the master is no Judge,’ i.e., R. Shesheth had no right to render a decision in a certain case mentioned <i>ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Rashi ibid.</i> — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i>
Some say that one is fit to judge only from the age of eighteen and onwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of ‘some say,’ derived from Shab. 56b: ‘R. Samuel b. Naḥmani said on the authority of R. Jonathan: Whoever says that Josiah sinned is mistaken, for it is written, <i>And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David his father</i> (II Kings XXII, 2). How then do I explain, <i>and like unto him there was no king before him that returned</i> (Shab) <i>to the Lord with all his heart</i> etc., (<i>ibid.</i> XXIII, 25, whence it follows that at first he sinned). This intimates that he reconsidered every decision that he rendered between the ages of eight (the time of his accession to the throne <i>Ibid.</i> v. 1) and eighteen’ (when the Book of the Law was discovered). He thus re-examined (this is the meaning of <i>Shab</i>) his decisions in the light of the Book of the Law discovered by Ḥilkiah (<i>ibid</i> vv. 1-8). ‘Eighteen’ is taken by <i>Rashi</i> to refer to the eighteenth year of his reign. Hence, it has no connection with the age of the King. Some, however, take ‘eighteen’ (and this is followed by <i>Caro</i> in the present ruling) as the age of the King, i.e., when Josiah was eighteen years of age, the Book of the Law was discovered by Ḥilkiah. At the age of eighteen a person is considered a distinguished and conspicuous individual and has the capability to save the poor from the hand of one who would rob him. This is one of the attributes of a Judge (v. <i>Tur</i> a.l.) — <i>M.E.</i> , also Aboth V, 21.</i> and [provided] he has grown two pubic hairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deduced from Mishna Yeb. 96b: ‘It is all one (i.e., with respect to illegal cohabitation) whether he is of the age of nine years and a day or whether he is of the age of twenty years and has not grown two pubic hairs.’ Thus we see that if one has not produced the signs of maturity, he still counts as a minor. Cf. Nid. V, 9. Hence, the present ruling.</i> And some say that from the age of thirteen years [plus one day] and onwards, one is eligible to judge, even if he has not grown two pubic hairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Derived from Y. San. IV, 9(22b): ‘R. Abbahu states on the authority of R. Joḥanan: Even one who is less than twenty years old and has not grown two pubic hairs, is eligible to try civil suits but not capital charges.’ Although the age of thirteen is not mentioned in this text, it goes without saying that the Judge must not be less than thirteen years and a day, for only then is one designated an adult. As to the text in Shab. <i>ibid.</i>, this viewpoint accepts the interpretation of <i>Rashi</i> (v. n. 12 <i>supra</i>). Cf. also the reading in Shab. <i>ibid., ‘until eighteen’</i> (<span>עד י״ח</span>). Were <i>‘until eighteen years of age’</i> meant the reading should have been <span>עד בן י״ח</span>. , <i>Maharsha</i> a.l. The underlying reason for the second viewpoint is that although with reference to valid testimony it is required that the witnesses possess signs of maturity, deduced from, <i>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord</i> (Deut. XIX, 17. This refers to the witnesses and it is obligatory that they be <i>men</i>, i.e., of mature age. , Sheb. 30a; B.B. 155b), this is not the case with respect to a Judge. In the latter case he must possess a reasoning mind and be versed in the intricacies of the Law. But one who is less than thirteen years old, is ineligible to judge, for being a minor he does not come under the category of observing religious duties according to Biblical Law. However, a difficulty presents itself on the basis of the principle, ‘Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify’ (Mishna Nid. 49b), which conversely, would mean that ‘whoever is unfit to judge is ineligible to testify.’ Consequently, it follows that according to the first opinion recorded in the present ruling, one who is thirteen years of age and has grown two pubic hairs would be ineligible to testify, and again, according to the second viewpoint, one who is thirteen years of age but has not produced two pubic hairs would be ineligible to judge. This difficulty may be removed on the assumption that the above-mentioned principle was meant to assimilate testimony and adjudication with respect to the minority age of the individual only, for in both cases, a minor, i.e., one less than thirteen years and a day is unfit — <i>M.E.</i> In civil suits involving immovable property (<span>קרקעות</span>), he may not judge until he produces two pubic hairs, for otherwise, his transaction is considered invalid in immovable property ( B.B. 155b; <i>infra</i> § 35, 3; § 235) — <i>Tummim. Mishkenoth Ya‘akob</i> supports the first view recorded in the present ruling, but concludes that a Judge should be appointed when he is at least twenty years old. <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> states that in the case of one who judges alone we should adopt a stringent view and one should not judge before he is forty years old unless there is none other greater than he available in that city (v. Y.D. § 242, 31, <i>Gloss</i>). But with respect to one who is a member of a Court of three, it is permissible for him to judge even before he reaches his fortieth year, for his decision should not be regarded as inferior to that of a Court of three laymen whose decision is binding — <i>P.Tesh</i>. , also <i>P.Tesh</i>. to Y.D. <i>ibid. A.H.</i> writes that the above rulings are only added stringencies, and that according to Biblical Law, it seems that if the individual has grown two pubic hairs and is thirteen years of age plus one day, he may be a Judge. Before he produces the two pubic hairs, his decision is not binding (<i>contra</i> second opinion), for a minor’s act is ineffective.</i>
A woman is ineligible to judge.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 15a (v. parallel passages) : ‘In the School of Eleazar it was taught: <i>Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them</i> (Ex.

Git. 88b: ‘<i>before them</i>, but not before laymen,’ and a woman is ineligible to judge, for the Mishna Nid. 49b states that ‘Whoever is fit to judge is fit to testify’ and since a woman is unfit to testify (v. B.K. 88a; Sheb. 30a), it follows that she is unable to judge. Consequently, the above passage that equates man and woman as regards all the judgments of the law refers to woman only from the point of view of being judged in cases where she has monetary claims against another person, but she herself may not act as Judge. As to Deborah, the prophetess concerning whom it is stated that <i>She judged Israel at that time</i> (Judges IV, 4) whence we see that a woman may judge, it may be said that it was permissible only on account of a Divine order, or that she merely taught the Law. But the text serves as no precedent that a woman may judge. , also Y. Yoma VI, 1(43b); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) where it is stated that a woman may not judge because she is ineligible to testify. Cf. also Yad, <i>Melakim</i> I, 5 and <i>RIDBaZ</i> a.l.; Sifre to <i>Shofetim</i> XVII, 15. Although a woman may not judge, nevertheless, a learned woman may instruct law and offer legal directives (cf. <i>supra</i> on Deborah and <i>Sefer ha-Ḥinnuk</i> § 83 and § 152; <i>Sha‘are Teshubah</i> to O.Ḥ. § 461, n. 17 — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i>
Some say that those who are under the influence of wine are permitted to adjudicate civil suits.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna San. 40a: ‘They (the Judges) drink no wine the entire day.’ Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 42a: ‘Why is wine not permitted? — R. Aḥa b. Ḥanina said: The Scriptural text states, <i>It is not for princes to say, Where is strong drink</i> (<i>Prov</i>. XXXI, 4), (i.e.,) those engaged in (solving) the secrets of the world (administration of justice, connecting <span>רוזנים</span> with <span>רז</span>, secret) must abstain from strong drink.’ <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>העוסקים</span> write that this refers only to the adjudication of capital charges, but not to civil suits. As to the text in ‘Er. 64a: ‘He who drank a quarter of a <i>Log</i> of wine must not render legal decisions,’ it refers to giving a legal decision in ritual law (<span>איסור והיתר</span>. Cf. the expression <span>אל יורה</span>). , also Yad, <i>Bi’ath ha-Mikdash</i> I, 3; Y.D. § 242, 13, <i>Gloss</i>. The present ruling, viz., that in civil suits one who is under the influence of wine may act as a Judge has reference only to a case where there are two other Judges present who will remind him of the law should he err, but a single Judge or three Judges under the influence of wine should not judge — <i>Tummim, Nethiboth</i>. However, according to Num. R. X, 4, one under the influence of wine may not act as a Judge even in civil suits (cf. the expression <span>אל ידון</span> <i>ibid</i>) which contradicts the present ruling. <i>BaḤ</i> and <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> rule that even in civil suits one under the influence of wine is forbidden to act as Judge. Thus also <i>R. Jonah</i> in <i>Sefer ha-Yir’ah</i> makes no distinction between ritual and civil law. In both cases one under the influence of wine must not act as a Judge — <i>P.Tesh. M.E.</i> writes that since our wines nowadays are diluted, we may adopt a leniency with respect to a Judge who partakes of a quarter of a <i>Log</i> of wine.</i> A witness may not act as a Judge.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ket. 21a: ‘R. Abba sat and stated this law, that a witness may act as a Judge. R. Safra raised an objection against R. Abba: If three saw it (the new Moon) and they are of the Court (that sanctifies the new moon), two (of them) stand up and set (two) of their fellows (of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>) beside the one (Judge) and they (the two) bear witness before them (the three who constitute the Court) and (then) they may say, It is hallowed! It is hallowed!, — for a single person is not believed by himself. Now, if you entertain the opinion that a witness may act as a Judge, what is all this for? Let them sit in their places (after testifying) and declare (in conjunction with the third person), the new Moon is hallowed! — He (R. Abba) replied: That also presented a difficulty to me, and I asked R. Isaac b. Martha, and R. Isaac (asked) R. Huna, and R. Huna (asked) Ḥiyya b. Rab, and Ḥiyya b. Rab (asked) Rab, and he said to them, Leave alone the testimony regarding the new Moon (because it is) Biblical and the attestation of documents is Rabbinical (In a Biblical matter a witness may not act as a Judge; in the case of a Rabbinic enactment, e.g., the confirmation of documents this does not apply. Cf. Git. 5b).’ B.B. 113b-114a: ‘Rabbah b. Ḥanina taught a Baraitha before R. Naḥman: (It is written,) <i>Then it shall be in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</i> (Deut. XXI, 16) — (this teaches) that you may make the division of inheritances during the day, but not at night. Abaye said unto him: But according to this (Abaye assumes that the division of an inheritance is made only when the person died in the daytime) would children inherit him who died during the day and not him who died at night? Perhaps you refer to the adjudication of inheritances (which must take place during the day. , <i>supra</i> § 5), for it was taught: (With the Biblical text), <i>but it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment</i> (Num. XXVII, 11), the whole section (Num. <i>ibid.</i> vv. 1-11 on the laws of inheritance) has been proclaimed as of a judicial nature (The judicial procedure of inheritances is equated to that of civil suits in general. Those who are present form a Court of three even if the testator’s natural heirs are opposed to it. Thus <i>Tosaf.</i> who explain that this refers both to a sickbed bequest as well as to one made by a person in good health. , <i>Rashi</i> to San. 34b). And this is in accord with Rab Judah who said: If three (persons) came to visit a sick person, they may, if they so desire (either) write down (his bequest and thus act as witnesses to the document), or issue a judicial verdict (for since they are three they form a laycourt and thus attest to the instructions of the testator and execute the Will). If two (persons came), they may write down (the instructions and act as witnesses to the document), but may not issue a judicial verdict (for since they are less than three they cannot constitute a Court and merely may act as witnesses). R. Ḥisda stated: This applies only to daytime; at night, however, even three (persons) may (only) record (the instructions of the testator and act as witnesses), but may not form a Court (because at night judicial sessions are not held for the commencement of a trial. , <i>supra</i> §. 5). What is the reason? Because (at night) they (merely) become (eligible to act as) witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge (this means that even on the following day they may not act as Judges in this matter since the instructions were recorded at night and they became qualified to act as witnesses only).’ Cf. San. 34b. Mishna R.H. 25b: ‘If three saw it … It is hallowed’ (v. first part of this note for text). Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 25b-26a: ‘This means that a witness may act as Judge. May we say that our Mishna is not in agreement with R. Akiba, for it has been taught: If the <i>Sanhedrin</i> beheld a man murder a person, some of them act as witnesses and some of them as Judges. This is the opinion of R. Tarfon. R. Akiba says: They all act as witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge? — You may even say that our Mishna is in agreement with R. Akiba, but R. Akiba stated this only with respect to capital charges, for the All-Merciful commanded, <i>the congregation shall judge … and the congregation shall deliver</i> (Num. XXXV, 25-26), and since they saw him murder a person, they cannot find any defence in his favour. However, in this case, even R. Akiba agrees (that a witness may act as a Judge).’ Cf. B.K. 90b. , also Y. R.H. III, 1(58d); Y. San. I, 2(18c); <i>ibid.</i> V, 5(23a). There are two fundamental reasons why a witness may not act as a Judge: a) Evidence that is given must be liable to refutation by proving an alibi (<span>עדות שיכול להזימה</span>. , <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 40). Hence, if we should say that a witness may act as a Judge, this principle would not be applicable, for the Judge will never accept any refutation against himself; b) It is written, <i>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days</i> (Deut. XIX, 17), — <i>Both the men</i> refers to the witnesses; <i>between … is</i> applies to the litigants; <i>before the Lord … judges</i> means that they must stand before the Judges. Hence, if a witness may act as a Judge, this exposition would be impossible. Cf. <i>supra</i> n. 14. , Ket. 21b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>הנח</span> and par. ref. Consequently, if three persons beheld the incident during the day when it is permissible to hold a judicial session, they constitute a Court of three and are not designated as witnesses. Hence, they may act as Judges as stated anon — <i>M.E.</i></i> [This applies] only [to] a witness who testifies, e.g., if one of the Judges testified<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Together with another person — <i>M.E.</i></i> before his colleagues<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">e., before a Court of three, for hearing evidence is part of the adjudication which requires three Judges to be present. It means that after one of the Judges rises to testify in conjunction with another lay person, the remaining two Judges co-opt a third person to form a <i>Beth Din</i> of three. Consequently, after giving evidence, the witness may not return to sit with the Judges — <i>M.E.</i></i> about a [certain] incident which he beheld, he cannot be combined with them to hold a judicial session regarding that incident.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R.H. 25b-26a and parallel passages. , texts <i>supra</i> n. 17; Ket. 21b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>הנח</span> and parallel references.</i> However, if he does not testify, e.g., [in a case] where the three Judges beheld the incident,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> even if they beheld [the incident] with the express intent to be designated as testimony,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> — [the law is that] if they beheld it during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">At which time they were eligible to act as Judges. , <i>supra</i> § 5, 3.</i> they may act as Judges and may hold a judicial session concerning that incident;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>supra</i> n. 20. A judicial session may be held in this case since we can argue that hearing the evidence should not carry greater weight than seeing the incident, and they may hold the judicial session even at a later date just as in the case of hearing evidence in general a judicial session may be held at a later date. Not so, however, when they saw the matter at night, in which case they only become witnesses and cannot act as Judges, for hearing the evidence is also not valid in the first instance if heard at night — <i>M.E.</i></i> but if they beheld it at night,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">At which time judicial sessions are not held. , <i>supra</i> § 5, 2. Likewise, if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival, they may not act as Judges, although the prohibition against trying cases on these days is only a Rabbinic measure (<i>BaḤ</i>). This question, however, requires further elucidation — <i>ShaK. Ta</i>Z opposes <i>BaḤ</i>, for on the principle that in a Rabbinic matter a witness may act as a Judge (v. <i>Isserles</i> anon and <i>supra</i> n. 17), it should be permissible. <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> agrees with <i>BaḤ. Tummim</i> is in agreement with <i>Ta</i>Z. <i>K.H.</i> concludes that we should adopt a leniency in this matter. Hence, they may hold a judicial session on a following day even if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> they may not hold a judicial session on [the strength of] their own evidence.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>supra</i> n. 20. For in this case since judicial sessions are not held at night, they merely become designated as witnesses and we cannot apply the principle, ‘let the hearing of evidence not carry greater weight than seeing the incident,’ since the time of seeing the incident was not the time of hearing the evidence, because we receive no evidence at night — <i>M.E.</i></i> However, on [the strength of] evidence given by others they may act as Judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The next day or even many days later.</i> But if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter, — then] even on [the strength of] evidence given by others, they may not act as Judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For in this case it carries even lesser weight than beholding the incident at night. Thus <i>RaShBaM</i> to B.B. <i>ibid.</i>, where it is stated that ‘<i>If three persons came to visit a sick man</i> etc.’ (v. <i>supra</i> n. 17), whence it follows that they did not come at the express bidding of the testator to act as witnesses (note the words <span>נכנסו לבקר</span>), for if they were invited or ordered by the testator to come, they would be designated as witnesses, and consequently, even if they came during the day, they would not be able to act as Judges even if other witnesses give evidence.</i> Some say, however, that even if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter], they may act as Judges on [the strength of] evidence given by others.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This is similar to beholding the incident at night. Thus <i>Tosaf.</i> to B.B. <i>ibid.

To sum up this ruling, the following principles should be borne in mind: a) Mere intention to act as witnesses of an incident does not invalidate the individuals from acting as Judges; b) Once they have testified they no longer may act as Judges; c) If they beheld the incident during the day, they may act as Judges; if at night, they may act as Judges if others testify; d) If they were summoned to act as witnesses, there is a difference of opinion between <i>RaShBaM</i> and <i>Tosaf.;</i> e) In a Rabbinic matter even a witness who testified may act as a Judge.</i>
[With respect to] one who is summoned to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him [in learning, — the law is that] the Judge [who summoned him to appear in Court] cannot compel him to go [and be tried] before him, but they call a meeting of the scholars who are [present] there and look into the matter among themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>R. Hai Gaon</i>. Derived from Kid. 70a: ‘A certain individual from Nehardea entered a butcher’s shop in Pumbeditha and stated: Give me meat! They replied: Wait until the attendant of Rab Judah b. Ezekiel takes his and then we shall serve you. He exclaimed, Who is Rab Judah b. Shewiskel (a nickname for Ezekiel, derived from <span>שזיסקי</span> meaning roast, i.e., the eater of roast meat) to take precedence over me and to be served before me? They went and informed Rab Judah (about this), whereupon he pronounced the ban against him. They said to him (further), He (that man) is in the habit of calling people slaves, whereupon he (Rab Judah) announced that he (that man) was a slave (himself). Thereupon that man went and summoned him (Rab Judah) to a lawsuit before R. Naḥman. When they brought the writ of summons, Rab Judah went before R. Huna and asked him, Shall I go or not? (his high office gave him the right not to recognize R. Naḥman’s authority over himself). He (R. Huna) answered: Indeed you must not go because you are a distinguished personage, but on account of the honour of the <i>Nasi</i>’s house (R. Naḥman was the son-in-law of the <i>Resh Galutha</i>) arise and go.’ From this passage it follows that one is not obliged to appear before a Judge who is inferior to him. Furthermore, it does not depend upon the age of the Judge who sent the writ of summons, for even if the latter is much older than the scholar who is summoned, nevertheless, if in learning and knowledge he is inferior to him, he cannot compel him to appear before him (cf. B.B. 142b). The same principle applies to a single Judge or a Court of three who sent the writ of summons — <i>P.Tesh</i>. The mode of expression used here indicates that <i>R. Hai Gaon</i> holds that if the defendant agrees to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him, he may appear before the latter for trial on the principle that ‘A Rabbi who renounces his honour, it is considered renounced’ (Kid. 32a-b). For if this were not so, how can the inferior scholar summon him to law in the first place. Hence, he may summon him only because there is a possibility that the latter may agree to come — <i>P.Tesh</i>. ‘They call a meeting of the scholars … themselves,’ means that the scholars of that locality examine the case together. Consequently, it is no longer disreputable for him to be tried in their presence — <i>Tummim. BaḤ</i> explains that the words, ‘and look into the matter’ means that they investigate the case in order to determine whether it is proper for him to appear for trial or not. In a case where it is not respectable for the scholar to appear in Court with a litigant who is an uncultured person, the Court may send scribes to the scholar’s home in order to record his arguments in writing and then they adjudicate the case on the basis of the recorded information — <i>M.E.</i> , <i>infra</i> § 124. Cf. also <i>infra</i> § 28, 5.</i>

The majority of the Rabbis [San. <i>ibid.</i>] hold <i>contra</i> R.

And we say this only when he has no fixed time (for study) with him; but if he has a fixed time (for study) with him, we have nothing against this (i.e., if the Judge is his teacher and this is the appointed time for his lesson, the scholar is permitted to arrive before his opponent), because he (his opponent) will say, he is busy with his lesson.’ We, therefore, see that no prohibition exists against a teacher acting as Judge for his disciple. The Judge may also adjudicate a case of the father of his disciple, although he receives tuition fees from him — <i>M.E.</i> Likewise, may one act as Judge in lawsuits involving his host, employees or daily workers — <i>ShaK</i>.</i> <i>And even a Court that is unfit to judge on account of friendship or enmity can appoint other eligible Judges</i> [<i>in order</i>] <i>that they adjudicate</i> [<i>the case in question</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Decisions of Isserlein</i> s. 258 and <i>MaHaRIK</i> Rt. 21 — <i>G.</i> , San. 8a. <i>MaHaRIK ibid.</i> writes that even one who adopts a stringent view out of piety is fit to choose Judges. <i>Isserlein ibid.</i> states that every Court that is ineligible to adjudicate a case, has a right to appoint another Court — <i>M.E.</i> However, one who is unfit to judge on account of kinship may not appoint another <i>Beth Din</i> unless such is the prevailing custom in that particular community — <i>Nethiboth</i>.</i> <i>One who makes a statement concerning a Judge that he is his enemy or a friend of his opponent, is not believed, and he is required</i> [<i>to adduce</i>] <i>proof</i> [<i>in order to substantiate</i>] <i>his words</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Mishna San. 23a in accord with the Sages: ‘Each party may refuse to accept the Judge chosen by the other.

III: ‘Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to each other? — This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if one of them was proven to be a <i>Zomem</i> (v. Deut. XIX, 19), is he put to death (by the law of retaliation) before his fellow (-witness) is (also) proven to be a <i>Zomem?</i> — (Certainly not.) Consequently, since the law of retaliation operates only if both witnesses are proven to be <i>Zomemim</i>, it follows that if both witnesses are related to each other, each kinsman-witness would be put to death through the testimony of his fellow kinsman-witness (which is impossible on the basis of the text, <i>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers</i> — Deut. XXIV, 16, — which is explained anon to intimate that all relations, not only fathers and sons, are not to be put to death through the testimony of other relations. , Y. anon and cf. San. 27b-28a). (For) if you say thus (i.e., that witnesses may be related to each other, would not the result be that one kinsman-witness) is put to death on his (i.e., the other kinsman-witness) testimony? Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to the Judges? — This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if they (the witnesses who are related to the Judges) are proven to be <i>Zomemim</i>, would not (the result be that) they (the witnesses) are put to death through their (the Judges’) verdict (i.e., after the Judges receive the refutation of the testimony that was given by the witnesses who were related to the Judges) ? Whence is it derived that the Judges should not be related to each other? — Scripture states : Put to death on the testimony of witnesses (v. Deut. XIX, 15) ; Put to death according to the decision of Judges (v. Deut. XVII, 11) — just as witnesses must not be related to each other, so too, must the Judges not be related to each other.’ Cf. also <i>infra</i> § 46, 21.

A Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a wicked man, should not join with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he renders a correct verdict — <i>M.E.</i>, or even if they arbitrate the case — <i>A.H.</i> Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXII, 10; II, 14. Derived from Sheb. 30b: ‘Whence do we derive that a Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a witness who knows his colleague to be a robber should not join with him (to judge or testify) ? — Because it is said, <i>From a false matter keep far</i> (Ex. XXIII, 7).’ Hence, if the status of his colleague is unknown to him, he may sit with him in judgment. , however, <i>supra</i> § 3, 4: ‘It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he sits lest he sit with people who are not suitable and is (then) found to be included in a council of conspirators and not in a <i>Beth Din</i>,’ — whence it follows that as long as one is not certain about the eligibility of his fellow-Judge, he must not join with him, which contradicts the present ruling. <i>BaḤ</i> therefore, explains that <i>supra</i> we deal with a Judge who is distinguished in wisdom and learning, in which case he should first make certain about the eligiblity of his colleague; whereas in the present ruling we treat of an ordinary Judge who is permitted to join with a colleague to sit in judgment unless it is known to him that the latter is a robber or a wicked person. <i>Tummim</i> removes the contradiction by explaining that <i>supra</i> we deal with the commencement of a trial, in which case one must make certain that his colleague is fit to judge; whereas here we deal with a case where the trial had already commenced and he thought that his colleague was an eligible person, but during the proceedings it became clear to him that his colleague was ineligible to judge, in which case the law is that if he knows him to be a robber etc., he must discontinue the proceedings (note the expression <span>לישב</span> employed <i>supra</i> and <span>להצטרף</span> used here). <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> explains that <i>supra</i> we deal with a Judge who does not know his other two colleagues. Hence, he must not sit with them before he determines their eligibility. Otherwise, he is regarded as associating himself with a council of conspirators, since the majority of the members of the Court are unfit to judge. However, if two of the Judges know each other, but they do not know the third Judge, there would actually be no prohibition if they associated themselves with the latter, yet, the pure-minded of Jerusalem would refrain from sitting in judgment with such a Judge until they would be certain about his eligibility (v. <i>supra</i> § 3, n. 33). The present ruling, however, has reference to a case where one of the three Judges knows one of his colleagues to be a robber etc., in which case he must not join with him, even if the third Judge is fit, for although this Court is not regarded as a council of conspirators since the majority of its members are fit, yet, it is forbidden on account of the Biblical injunction, <i>From a false matter keep far</i>. If the litigants accepted the ineligible Judge, there is no prohibition against joining with the latter since there are two eligible Judges, and consequently, it is not considered a council of conspirators and the verse, <i>From a false etc.</i>, is not applicable — <i>A.H.</i></i>
[With respect to the members of] a Court of three, it is necessary that each one of them should possess seven [characteristic] things, [viz.,] wisdom, humility, fear [of G-d], averseness to money [acquired illegitimately],<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>A.H.</i></i>, love of truth, love [manifested] towards them by [fellow] creatures<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of <span>ידועים</span>, (v. next note), according to Maim. — <i>W.G.</i> Cf.

The following sources enumerate the qualities that a Judge must possess: Tosef (Ẓ). San. VII, 1; <i>ibid.</i> Hag. II, 9; Y. San. I, 4(19c); San. 88b. In the three latter sources the quality of ‘humility’ (<span>ענו</span>) is mentioned after ‘wisdom’ (<span>חכם</span>). The quality of ‘humility,’ however, is not found in the following additional sources: Deut. R. I, 10 to v. 13 <i>ibid.</i>: ‘R. Berekiah on the authority of R. Ḥaninah stated: Judges must possess the following seven qualities: (They must be) wise men (<span>חכמים</span>), understanding (<span>נבונים</span>), full of knowledge (<span>ידועים</span>). Hence we have three. And four more as it is written elsewhere (Ex. XVIII, 21), <i>Thou shalt provide out of all the people able men</i> (<span>אנשי חיל</span>), <i>such as fear G-d</i> (<span>יראי אלקים</span> ), <i>men of truth</i> (<span>אנשי אמת</span>), <i>hating unjust gain</i> (<span>שונאי בצע</span>). Hence, we have seven. Why were not the seven stated together? (To intimate) that if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with seven (qualities), one may bring (Judges) possessing (only) four (qualities) ; and if (Judges) were not found (endowed) with four (qualities), one may bring those possessing three (qualities); and if these were not found, one may bring (Judges) possessing one (quality), for it is written, <i>A woman of valour who can find</i> (Prov. XXXI, 10).’ In the last verse quoted it seems that the Midrash takes <i>a woman of valour</i> (<span>אשת חיל</span>) as equivalent to <i>able men</i> mentioned in Ex. <i>ibid.</i>, i.e., even if the Judges possessed only one quality, it suffices. Cf. Prov. <i>ibid.</i> v. 23: <i>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land</i>. This refers to the gates of justice where local matter were adjudicated. Hence, the connection between the text in Prov. and that of Ex. , <i>MaHaRZaW</i> to Deut. R. <i>ibid.</i> Cf. also Sifre to Deut. <i>ibid.</i> on the seven qualities that a Judge should possess. <i>Maim.</i> (followed by <i>Tur</i> and <i>Caro</i>) considers ‘wise men’ and ‘understanding’ (<span>חכמים ונבונים</span>) as one quality. Hence, he adds the quality of ‘humility’ (<span>ענוה</span>), although it is not mentioned in Deut. R. However, it seems that he followed San.

Cf. <i>Maim.</i> Yad <i>ibid.</i> who elaborates on the qualities to be possessed by Judges and gives a different order from that mentioned in the above texts.</i>
Every case concerning which there results indirect benefit to the Judge, he [the Judge] cannot adjudicate. Therefore, [if] a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople has been stolen, he [the alleged culprit] is not tried by the Judges of that town,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. 43a: ‘Has it not been taught: If a Torah scroll belonging to the townspeople was stolen, (the alleged culprit who claims that he bought it — Thus <i>RaShBaM</i>), must not be tried by the Judges of that town, nor can evidence be given (against him) by the inhabitants of that town (because they are all interested parties). Now if we adopt the opinion that a partner can renounce his interest (v. Gemara <i>supra</i>), why cannot two of the inhabitants of the town renounce their interest in the scroll and try (the alleged culprit) ? — A Torah scroll is different because it is utilized for public reading (hence, none of the inhabitants of that town can entirely renounce his interest in it, unless he leaves the town. Consequently, all are considered interested parties). Come and hear: If one says, Give a <i>Maneh</i> to the poor of my town (and it was stolen, the alleged culprit) … must not be tried by the poor Judges of that town, nor may the poor of that town give evidence … Cannot two of them renounce their interest and adjudicate the case? — Here too, we (treat of) a Torah scroll and the reason why the donor referred to the recipients as poor is because all are poor with respect to a Torah scroll.’ , Yad, <i>‘Eduth</i> XV, 2.</i> unless they have another Torah scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In the Synagogue where the Judge or Judges worship. For then the Judges are no longer interested parties. But if in this Synagogue there is no other Torah scroll available, though there is another Synagogue in town where they have a Torah scroll, yet, in order for the Judges to be permitted to try the case, they must renounce their interest in this Synagogue. This is derived from <i>RaShBaM</i> to B.B. <i>ibid.</i>, s.v. <span>דהכל אצל</span>: ‘All are in need of the Torah scroll, and it is customary to refer to the townspeople who have no Torah scroll as <i>poor</i> (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 58 and), for there is no greater poverty than this.’ It follows, therefore, that only when this is the only Torah scroll they possess that they are designated <i>poor</i>, but if they have in addition another scroll, then after renouncing their interest, they may adjudicate the case and are permitted to read even in the disputed Torah scroll. Thus also <i>Tur; Asheri</i> in <i>Resp.</i> and <i>R. Yeruḥam</i>. Similarly, when the controversy is regarding the Synagogue where the Judge worships, he must renounce his interest in that Synagogue and worship in the other Synagogue; but when he attends his own Synagogue, although he can go to the other Synagogue, despite the fact that he renounces his interest in his Synagogue, he is still regarded as an interested party — <i>M.E. contra ‘Ir Shushan</i>. Moreover, the circumstances must be such that all the townspeople could be accomodated at the other Synagogue. Otherwise, the Judge would still be regarded as an interested party because the law is that townspeople who are in need of a Synagogue may compel each other to build one (v. <i>infra</i> § 163, 1) and consequently, the Judge will also have to contribute. Hence, if the other Synagogue is not large enough to accomodate all the worshippers of the disputed Synagogue, they are all considered interested parties, for they all desire to regain possession of their Synagogue. However, if the Judge’s seat in the disputed Synagogue is his own property, he is not regarded as an interested party, provided the ‘seven representatives of the town’ (<span>שבעה טובי העיר</span>) have no right to sell the Synagogue or the Torah scrolls for the needs of the community (v. Y.D. § 282). Otherwise, the Judge is always considered an interested party — <i>Tummim, A.H.</i></i> And [likewise,] one who says, 'Distribute a <i>Maneh</i> to the poor of my town,' [and it was stolen, — the alleged culprti] is not tried by the Judges of that town.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. <i>ibid.</i> , text <i>supra</i> n. 58.

We understand this to mean that there is no fixed amount (for them to donate, but the contribution is made only when the occasion arises. Hence, as long as there is still a possibility of collecting the money from the alleged culprit, they are still interested parties).’ It follows therefore, that just as in the case of a charitable contribution which is <i>not fixed</i>, renounciation is ineffective, so, too, in the case of a <i>permanent tax</i> it is impossible to establish with certainty that no benefit will be derived at some time or other. For it is impossible to know how long the person who is tried will live in order for the Judges to know how much they should pay as their share so as not to be regarded as interested parties — <i>B.Yos.</i> It is only in the case of a special tax where the amount to be renounced may be established that renunciation is effective.</i> However, if they made an ordinance,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">B.B. 8b. , text <i>supra</i> § 2, n. 18; B.K. 116b: ‘Ass-drivers are permitted to stipulate that one who loses his ass should be provided with another ass,’ i.e., even if it against the law. , <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>ורשאין</span>.

But if they hired a guide to go before them, the calculation has to be made also (<i>also</i> is wanting in Y. B.M. VI, 4(11a)) in accordance with the number of people in the caravan (because a guide is essential also to protect one’s life) and they must not deviate from the general practice of the ass-drivers (i.e., if they stipulate to make the calculation according to possessions or persons, they may do so).’ The same applies to the general custom of mariners stated further <i>ibid.</i> Hence, we see that we follow the adopted practice although it is against the law. , also Mishna B.M.

The prohibition against accepting bribes refers not only to Judges but to all persons who are entrusted with communal matters although no adjudication of law is involved — <i>P.Tesh</i>. Likewise is it forbidden to accept equal bribes from both litigants although the foregoing reason no longer applies — <i>M.E.</i> The Judge must not accept any gifts from the acquitted party even after the conclusion of the trial — <i>Asheri</i> to San. 27a in the case of Bar Ḥama.</i> and if he accepted it, he must return it when the donor claims it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXIII,  Derived from Tem. 4b: ‘Abaye stated: Every act which the Divine Law prohibits, if it has been executed, the act has its legal effect; for if you were to entertain the opinion that the act does not have its legal effect why is one punished by lashes (on account thereof)? But Raba says that the act does not have its legal effect at all and the reason why one is punished by lashes is because he has transgressed a commandment of the Divine Law.’ After a number of texts are adduced according to which in some cases the transgression of a negative command has its legal effect while in others it does not,— concerning which Abaye and Raba agree, — the Talmud continues <i>ibid.</i> 6a-b: ‘R. Aḥa, the son of Raba said to R. Ashi . . In what respect do Abaye and Raba differ? — They differ with respect to direct usury (<span>ריבית קצוצה</span> i.e., lending four <i>Denari</i> in return for five) in accord with R. Eleazar. For R. Eleazar stated: Direct usury can be collected through the Judges, whereas indirect usury (<span>אבק ריבית</span>, lit. ‘dust of usury,’ e.g., if one sells his field and says to the buyer that if he pays him forthwith the price is one thousand Z<i>uz</i>, but if at a later date the price will be more. Consequently, if the buyer pays at the later date, the additional amount is regarded as indirect usury) cannot be collected through the Judges. R. Joḥanan states: Even direct usury is not collected through the Judges (Hence, Raba will conour with R. Eleazar and Abaye with R. Yoḥanan). But do they (Abaye and Raba) differ merely in logical reasoning? Do they not differ in the interpretation of Biblical texts? For R. Isaac said: <i>He hath given forth upon usury and had taken increase</i>: <i>shall he than live? He shall not live</i> (Ez. XVIII, 13), which teaches that the taking of usury is a matter that concerns life but is not liable to restoration (consequently, even Raba who holds that a prohibited act does not have its legal effect, here he will admit that the act is valid on account of the text). R. Aḥa b. Adda says: From here: Scripture states, <i>But fear thy G-d</i> (Lev. XXV, 36), teaching that the taking of usury is a matter of fearing G-d, but is not liable to restoration. Raba stated: From here: <i>He hath done all these abominations</i>: <i>he shall surely die</i>: <i>his blood shall be upon him</i> (Ez. XVIII, 13). <i>Now, lo, if he begat a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 10). Those who lend on interest are comparable to those who shed blood. Just as those who shed blood cannot make restoration (of the lost lives), so those who lend on interest are not liable to restoration (of interest). R. Naḥman b. Isaac stated: What is the reason of R. Eleazar? (who maintains that direct usury is collectible through the Judges), for the Biblical text says: <i>That thy brother may live with thee</i> (Lev. XXV, 36) thus teaching that he must restore the interest so that he (the borrower) may live with you.’ Consequently, since the law rests with Raba (excluding certain cases), bribes are equated to usury and are collectible through the Judges, which means that the donor claims it. <i>M.E.</i> writes that if the donor does not claim the return of the gift, the Judge is not obliged to return it, because the donor gave it willingly for the purpose of being acquitted contrary to usury concerning which it is written <i>That thy brother may live with thee</i>. <i>Ta</i>Z disagrees with <i>M.E.</i> on the basis of <i>Rashi</i> to B.M. 61b, s.v. <span>ע״כ ריבית קצוצה</span> according to whom the Court may also compel him to return the usury only if he claimed it. Thus also <i>Ta</i>Z to Y.D. § 161, 5, n. 3. Even if the donor claimed the bribe after a considerable time had elapsed, yet, as long as he did not renounce his rights to it, he may still make a claim. However, it is proper that the recipient of the bribe should return it of his own accord if he wishes to do his duty towards G-d and repent — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> Just as the one who receives it transgresses a negative command, so does the donor transgress [the negative command], 'Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind.'<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XIX, 14. Thus Yad <i>ibid.</i>, derived from the law of usury, for just as we deduce the law of returning bribes from the law of usury so too do we deduce from the law of usury that the one who gives bribes transgresses the negative injunction, <i>And thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>, i.e., the one who offers a bribe tempts the Judge and thereby places a stumbling block before him. , Mishna B.M. 75b: ‘These transgress a negative injunction : the lender, the borrower, the surety and the witnesses. And the Sages add: the scribe too. They transgress the injunction, <i>Thou shalt not give</i> (<i>him thy money upon usury</i>) [Lev. XXV, 37] and <i>Take thou</i> (<i>no usury</i>) <i>of him</i> (Lev. XXV, 36) and <i>Thou shalt not be to him as a usurer</i> (Ex. XXII, 24) and <i>Neither shall ye lay upon him usury</i> (Ex. XXII, 25) and <i>Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy G-d</i>: <i>I am the Lord</i> (Lev. XIX, 14).’ Gemara <i>ibid.</i>: ‘Abaye said: The lender transgresses all (the injunctions); the borrower: <i>Thou shalt not cause thy brother to take usury</i> (Deut. XXIII, 20. Heb. <span>תשיך</span> is in the <i>Hiph‘il</i> which is causitive. Hence, it refers to the debtor), <i>but unto thy brother thou shalt offer no usury</i> (ibid. v. 21), <i>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>. The surety and the witnesses: only, <i>neither shall ye lay upon him usury</i>.’ One is forbidden to give a bribe to a Gentile Judge on the basis of <i>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>, for civil laws are also binding upon all Noaḥides. But if it is evident that the Gentile Judge desires to pervert justice in favour of one of the litigants, it is permissible (<i>Ḥatam Sofer</i>) — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> And not only a bribe of money [is forbidden] but even a bribe of words [or acts].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ket. 105b: ‘Our Rabbis taught: <i>And thou shalt take no bribe</i>.

But if it was his usual practice to extend a greeting, we consider the debtor’s greeting as of a mere incidental nature. Cf. B.M. 64b, Tosaf. s.v. <span>אבל חצר</span>. Similarly in the present case.

One who takes payment to act as a Judge, all the judgments that he pronounced are void,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Bek. IV, 6(29a): ‘If a man takes payment to act as a Judge, his judgments are void.’ Gemara: ‘How do we know this? — Rab Judah stated on the authority of Rab: The Biblical verse says, <i>Behold I have taught you</i> etc., (Deut. IV, 5). Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously. It was likewise taught thus: Scripture states: <i>Even as the Lord my G-d commanded me</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) — (i.e.,) just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously.’ <i>Tosef</i> (Z). Bek. III, 8: ‘One who is suspected (<span>החשוד</span>) of taking payment and (then) judges; (or taking payment) and (then) gives evidence, all the judgments that he pronounced and all the evidences that he gave are void.’ Cf. also Y. San. I, 1(18b) beg. Thus also <i>RaN</i> to Kid. II end, since the Mishna <i>ibid.</i> states <i>‘his judgments’</i> (<span>דיניו</span>) and not <i>‘his judgment’</i> (<span>דינו</span>). In the light of these sources we may say that not only where we know for certain that he received payment for pronouncing judgment, but also with respect to those regarding which we may entertain a suspicion that payment was taken by the Judge, we rule that they are null and void. Hence, it follows that where we know for certain that the Judge did not take payment for his decision, the judgment is binding. <i>BaḤ</i> writes that if the Judge took payment for adjudication, <i>legally</i> he does not have to return the money. It is only when he received money as a bribe that he is obliged to return it, for in the latter case an explicit Biblical principle has been transgressed (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1). Others maintain <i>contra BaḤ</i> that even when accepted as payment, it must be returned — <i>P.Tesh</i>. The judgments are regarded as void only from the moment we discover that the Judge took payment to act as Judge, for we say that only now has his status been impaired — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The adopted practice for both parties to give the Judge aught prior to the pronouncement of judgment dates back to former times when a communal measure was in vogue, enacted originally for the maintenance of the Judges. Hence, even nowadays when a Rabbi or Judge is appointed by a community it is as though a stipulation were made with the community to pay something to the Judge to pronounce judgment, since this was the original custom — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The other Judges of the Court are not disqualified on account of the Judge who took payment to pronounce judgment. Furthermore, his decision are null and void only with respect to discretionary judgment (<span>שודא דדייני</span>), i.e., where the Judges use their discretion to which of the litigants to adjudicate the claim, but not in the case where an explicit law is involved — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> unless it is known that [in certain cases] he did not take payment [to act as Judge].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">e., that particular decision is binding, although he took payment for other judgments before or after this. This should not be compared to the case of one who transgressed a Biblical injunction where the law is that all his judgments and evidences are void until he repents, for here it is different since he did not transgress any Biblical principle and the fact that his judgments or evidences are regarded void is merely a penalty imposed by the Sages — <i>M.E.</i> Cf. previous note.</i> However, if he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, it is permissible, provided it is clearly evident to all that he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, e.g., where he [the Judge] has special work to execute at the time that he has to act as Judge<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ket. 105a in the case of Karna who received compensation for loss of work that could be ascertained since he was engaged in smelling tests at wine stores for which he was paid a fee.

Ta</i>Z disagrees with <i>M.E.</i> and holds that if no stipulation was made at the outset, he is not entitled even to compensation given for an idle labourer, for the litigant may say, ‘Had I known this, I would have taken my lawsuit to another Judge who would not have to interrupt his work.’ Thus also <i>Tummim</i> and <i>Nethiboth.

Likewise, even if the Judge is obliged to go to another home to try a case, he is permitted to receive payment for his trouble — <i>A.H.</i> The entire ruling here has reference to Judges who were not permanently appointed by the community; but those who were appointed to act as permanent Judges are permitted to take equal shares of payment from the litigants.

Similarly, if both litigants are either poor or rich.

For other opinions, cf. <i>BaḤ</i> and <i>Ta</i>Z.</i>
A disciple who sits before his master and notices that he errs in the law, should not say, 'I will keep silent until he completes the adjudication and [then] I will upset his decision and build up [another] decision [of my own] so that [the decision] will be called by my name,'<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Sheb. 31a: ‘Whence do we know that a disciple who sees his master erring in the law should not say, I will wait until he completes (the adjudication) and (then) I will upset his decision and build up (another decision) of my own, so that the decision should be called by my name?

For it has been taught: If one was (unintentionally) transgressing a precept of the Torah, his son should not say, Father you transgressed a Biblical precept, but say… Father, the following verse is written in the Torah’ (by stating the verse indirectly his father will not be put to shame). Hence, this applies much more so in the case of his master, because the accepted principle is that respect for one’s teacher takes precedence over respect for one’s father (v. B.M. 33a). Ḥag. 14b: ‘(R. Eleazar b. ‘Arak) said to him (R. Joḥanan b.

In which manner is a defendant summoned to appear in Court? — The [members of the] Court send their messenger to him in order that he come on the appointed day to Court. [If] he did not appear [on the appointed day], they summon him a second time; [if] he did not appear [after the second summons], they summon him a third time; [if] he [still] did not appear, they wait for him all day, and if he did not appear, they place him under the ban on the morrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">M.K. 16a: ‘Raba said: Whence do we derive that we send a Court messenger (in a legal summons) ? — For it is written, <i>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab</i> (Num.

Whence do we derive that we summon him to appear (in person) ? — For it is written, <i>And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy congregation before the Lord, thou and Aaron</i> (<i>tomorrow</i>) (<i>ibid.</i> v. 16).

(That both parties should be named) thou and So-and-so? — For it is written, <i>Thou and they</i> (that are with them) <i>and Aaron</i> (<i>ibid.</i> v. 16).

The defendant has a right to say to the claimant before appearing in Court, ‘Tell me the nature of your claim,’ and if the claimant refuses to comply with his request, the defendant can say, ‘I will not go to Court with you until you tell me, for it is quite possible that when I hear your claim I will settle with you and indemnify you’ — <i>ShaK contra Be’er Sheba.</i> In the latter case, the defendant should report the claimant’s refusal to disclose the nature of his claim to the Court messenger — <i>A.H.</i> The expenses for the summons should be defrayed by the claimant and not by the defendant — <i>ShaK.</i> The claimant can summon the defendant to appear only on the days that Court sessions are held according to the adopted custom of the community unless the local usage is to hold a Court session whenever the need arises.

Otherwise the defendant may state that ‘since the Court messenger summoned me in the name of one Judge, I thought that the other Judges were not in session today.’ <i>A.H.</i> also states that there are some localities where the Court messenger summons the defendant in the name of the litigant as follows : ‘So-and-so summons you to appear in Court.’</i>

However, in Yad <i>ibid.,</i> par. 8, <i>Maim</i>. in stating the law, a) of one who was in the city (<span>בעיר</span>) and did not appear in Court after receiving a legal summons, has ‘<span>לערב</span>,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban the very same day in the evening; yet, in the same par., when stating the law of one who was in a country town (<span>בכפרים</span>) and did not appear in Court even after the third summons, <i>Maim.,</i> has ‘<span>עד למחר</span>,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban only on the morrow. On the other hand, <i>Caro</i> has both in a) and b) <span>למחרתו</span>, i.e., on the morrow and in the present ruling has <span>לערב</span> in the evening. The following explanation is advanced in order to remove the apparent discrepancy. In Yad <i>ibid.,</i> par. 8, both in a) and b), we are informed that the party is not placed under the ban before the end of the day. In a) <span>לערב</span> (in the evening) is used, i.e., the beginning of the following day; in b) <span>עד לערב</span> (on the morrow) is used, i.e., the morrow of the following day. The reason why <i>Maim</i>. uses both terms is in order to teach us the remarkable feature of this law, viz., in a) where only one day is given to him to appear in Court, since he is in the city, consequently, we adopt a stringency and pronounce the ban at the <i>beginning</i> of the following day, i.e., ‘in the evening;’ in b) where he departs from and returns to the city in which case we give the defendant three terms, we adopt a leniency and give him time until the morning of the following day. Hence, the term <span>עד למחר</span> (until the morrow).

When two [litigants] appear before you for trial, one weak [in influence], the other powerful [in influence], so long as you have not heard their pleas or [even after you have heard their pleas, — [so long as] you are in doubt which way the judgment will incline, you may say to them, 'I am not bound to try your case,' lest the one of powerful [influence] be pronounced guilty and persecute the Judge.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Tosaf.</i> (v. <i>infra</i> n. 3) ; <i>Alfasi; BeHaG; She’iltoth, Mishpatim</i> s. 58.

However, if you have already heard their pleas and know which way the judgment will incline, you cannot say to them: “I am not bound to render a decision in your case,” for it is written, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man</i> (Deut. I, 17).’ , <i>supra</i> n. 2. Regarding one of the Judges who wishes to withdraw from the case, v. <i>infra</i> § 18, 4.</i> And if he was appointed [to serve as Judge] for the public, he is obliged to try their case.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Yad, <i>ibid.</i> Because the entire community will protect him. This has reference even to a case where the Judge had not yet heard the pleas of the litigants, or even if he did hear the pleas but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, — yet, since he was appointed by the public he is bound to try the case; whereas one who is not an appointed Judge may withdraw under these conditions. Cf. the following sources which substantiate this ruling: Sifre to Deut. I, 16: <i>‘And I charged your judges at that time saying</i>: <i>Hear the causes between your brethren</i> etc. — In former days you possessed your own authority; from now on you are slaves and subject to the community.’ Sifre to Deut. I, 17: ‘Lest you say, I am afraid of So-and-so who might put my son to death, or might set my stack of grain on fire, or might cut down my young trees, — the text reads, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man.</i> And so too, does it state with regards to Jehoshaphat, <i>and he said to the judges</i>: <i>Consider what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord</i> (II Chron. XIX, 6).’ The expression <i>I am afraid of So-and-so</i> etc., indicates that we deal here with a case where one of the litigants is of powerful influence, but since the Judges were appointed they could not withdraw froom the case. <i>W.G.,</i> however, disagrees with <i>Caro</i>’s ruling, viz., that in the case of an appointed Judge he may not withdraw even if he did not hear the case or even if he did hear the case, but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, where the litigants are of unequal influence. For even in the case of an appointed Judge, <i>W.G.</i> maintains that it is only <i>after</i> he has heard the pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline that he cannot withdraw. And as to the above text in Sifre, ‘In former days (i.e., prior to your appointment as Judges),’ — it has reference even to a case where both litigants were of strong influence at which time you could withdraw before you heard the pleas, or where you had heard the pleas but were in doubt as to the verdict, — for even in such a case there is still the possibility that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty, might harass the Judge, but where only one of the litigants is of strong influence, even an appointed Judge is permitted to withdraw before the pleas are heard etc. Appointed Judges are subject to the community and cannot withdraw save where both litigants are of powerful influence. Furthermore, the text in San. <i>ibid.</i> which also adduces the Biblical verse, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man,</i> addressed to appointed Judges, found in Sifre <i>ibid.,</i> — clearly states that we deal with a case where one litigant was of weak and the other of strong influence and only <i>before</i> the pleas are heard can the Judge wihtdraw. It follows therefrom that the exposition in Sifre <i>ibid.,</i> ‘Lest you say etc.,’ also deals with similar circumstances. Hence, <i>W.G.</i> would not agree with <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> anon. Cf. also <i>Hag. Asheri</i> to San. III who State the case of Mar ‘Ukba who refused to act as Judge (although he was an appointed Judge. v. Shab. 55a) in a case where he knew that the litigants will not accept his decision (v. San. 29a), which is equivalent to a case where one litigant is of strong influence and the pleas had not been heard. In short, even an appointed Judge is not bound to try the case of strong and weak litigants prior to hearing the pleas or before he knows which way the judgment will incline.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>So too, if they were both powerful</i> [<i>litigants</i>] <i>he is required to try their case</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hag.

Cf. Kid. 71a the case of R. Phineas where we find that if powerful individuals might endanger one’s life, one should refrain from admonishing them. <i>A.H.</i> writes that they may withdraw even at the conclusion of the trial even if they are permanent Judges only if there is danger. If a Judge sees that his other two colleagues (who are incompetent) are perverting justice, he may, when requested to give his legal opinion in the matter, say, ‘I know not the law in this case,’ as a result of which other Judges will be co-opted to form a majority against the incompetent Judges (v. Mishna San. V, 5). This is permissible in the interests of peace (<i>Tummim, Nethiboth</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i>
It is a religious duty to say to the litigants at the outset, 'Do you wish [to resort to] law or [to submit to] arbitration?' If they consented [to submit to] arbitration, they bring about a settlement between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXII, 4. Derived from San. 6b-7a: ‘R. Joshua b. Korḥa states : Arbitration is a religious duty, for it is written, <i>Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates</i> (Zech. VIII, 16). Certainly where there is (the execution of) justice, there is no peace, and where there is peace, there is no (execution of) justice! But what is that kind of justice that is accompanied by peace? — You must admit: Arbitration (because the rigid application of the law does not necessarily set the contesting parties at peace). And so too, in the case of David it says, <i>And David executed justice and righteousness</i> (charity) <i>towards all his people</i> (II Sam.

Korḥa… and it is a religious duty to ask the litigants whether they desire to resort to law or to submit to arbitration.’ Consequently, since it is a religious duty to arbitrate, the Judge should make this clear to the litigants in order that they consent to submit to arbitration. The meaning of <i>Caro</i>’s text, therefore, is: — If you wish to resort to law I will act as your Judge; if not, then know ye that arbitration is preferable because it is a religious duty — <i>M.E.</i></i> And just as [the Judge] is cautioned not to pervert judgment, so too, is he cautioned not to direct the arbitration [in favour of] one party more than the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Tur.</i> Derived from San. 32b: ‘It has been taught: <i>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</i> (Deut.

When the matter was submitted to arbitration, it was ruled that <i>A</i> be exempt from the imposition of an oath on condition that he pay instead a certain amount of money. <i>A,</i> however, claims that <i>B</i> too, was originally obliged to take a number of oaths, — yet, in the latter case the arbitrator did not decide that he be exempt therefrom by paying money instead. In addition, <i>A</i> claims that certain oaths were overlooked entirely. b) The original agreement upon submitting the case to arbitration referred only to the elimination of oaths, but not to any other part of the case. However, according to the decision of the arbitrator, the settlement took into account the case as a whole. Hence, <i>A</i> contends that the entire decision is invalid. <i>Responsum</i>: Argument a) is not valid because undoubtedly the arbitrators have their reasons for acting thus only with respect to the oaths that <i>A</i> was required to take. Argument b), however, is a valid one and consequently, it must be reconsidered. We do not apply the principle that since one of the argument is valid then the whole case should be reconsidered. Should <i>A,</i> however, show that one argument depends upon the other, there is the possibility that the entire case must be reconsidered, but this must first be clearly established before invalidating the decision. Where the Judge is requested to arbitrate a case and render a decision that would be related to strict law (<span>פשרה קרובה לדין</span>), the law is that not more than one third less than the amount the defendant would have to pay according to strict law, is regarded a valid settlement in such a case. E.g., if according to strict law he would have to pay 300 dollars, then 200 dollars would be regarded as a valid settlement — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> Every Court of Law that always brings about a settlement is considered praiseworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXII, 4.

Joḥanan : An expert slaughterer who did not slaughter properly (as a result of which the animal became ritually unfit for consumption) is held responsible even if he was as skilled as the slaughterers of Sepphoris… Did not Rabbah b. Bar Ḥanah state that a similar case came before R. Joḥanan in the Synagogue of Maon and he said to the slaughterer, Go and bring proof that you are an expert to slaughter hens and I will exempt you? — There is no difficulty. The latter law (has reference to a slaughterer who worked) gratuitously; the former (where the slaughterer does it) for hire… A certain woman showed a <i>Denar</i> to R. Ḥiyya and he informed her that it was good. Subsequently, she came to him again and said to him, I showed it later (to others) and they informed me that it was bad, and I could not pass it. He then said to Rab, Go and exchange it for a good one … R. Ḥiyya (although he was an expert and needed no further instruction in this matter, and consequently, would be exempt) acted beyond the requirements of the line of justice, as R. Joseph learnt: <i>And shalt show them</i> (v. Ex. XVIII, 20) refers to their livelihood; <i>the way</i> refers to acts of lovingkindness; <i>they must walk</i> refers to visiting the sick; <i>wherein</i> refers to burial <i>and the work</i> refers to law; <i>which they</i> <i>must do</i> refers to (acting) beyond the requirements of the line of justice.’ , also B.M. 30b in the case of R. Ishmael b. R. Jose. Hence, we see that acting beyond the requirements of the law, although it is derived from a Biblical text, and in the eyes of the Judges it would be the proper thing to do, yet, it cannot be enforced by the Court of Law. Cf., however, B.M. 83a: ‘Some carriers (negligently) broke a barrel of wine that belonged to Rabbah b. R. Huna (Thus <i>Alfasi.</i> Cur. edd. : ‘b. Bar Ḥanan’). Thereupon he confiscated their cloaks; so they went and told Rab about it. Give them back their cloaks, said the latter. Is this the law, he asked. Yes, he answered, <i>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men’</i> (Prov. II, 20). Hence, we may ask why this is not derived from the above-mentioned text? <i>RI of Orleans</i> in B.K. 100a, <i>Tosaf</i> s.v. <span>יפנים</span> explains that acting ‘beyond the requirements of the law’ has reference only to a) a case where others under the same circumstances would be liable to pay but not he, as in the case of R. Ḥiyya and R. Ishmael b. R. Jose mentioned above, whereas in b) a case where there is no distinction between him and others (i.e., everyone would be exempt) as in the case of Rabbah b. Bar Huna, such action is merely a case of <i>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men.</i> Consequently, in a) acting beyond the requirements of the law is considered Biblical, whereas in b) it is based on post-Mosaic tradition. Hence, our present ruling refers to a). Cf. also B.M. 24b and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>לפנים</span>. There are thus three degrees of acting beyond the requirements of the law: a) where the responsibility is such that it does not even come within the purview of acting beyond the requirements of the law. Consequently, one who out of equity acts thus, <i>walks in the way of good men.</i> E.g., the carriers who negligently broke a barrel of wine belonging to Rabbah b. R. Huna who suffered damages; b) where everyone would be exempt and should not even come under the category of acting beyond the requirements of the law, but since no damage was caused as in a), one should act beyond the requirements of the law.

E.g., the case of R. Ḥiyya. Our present ruling refers to c). , also <i>BaḤ</i> for other interpretations.</i> <i>However, some differ with</i> [<i>this opinion</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mord.</i> to B.M. II, — <i>G.</i> Derived from B.M. 24b: ‘R. Judah once went after Mar Samuel in a street of whole meal dealers and asked him: What is the law if one found a purse here? — (Mar Samuel) answered: It belongs to the finder. What is the law if an Israelite came and produced an identification mark? — (Mar Samuel) answered: He would be required to return it. Both (views contradict each other)! — (Mar Samuel) answered: One should act beyond the requirements of the law. So too, the father of Samuel found asses in a desert and (yet) he returned them after a year of twelve months: he (acted) beyond the requirements of the law.’ In this passage, the expression ‘it belongs to the finder’ (<span>הרי אלו שלו</span>) indicates that <i>legally</i> it belongs to the finder. Consequently, the subsequent statement ‘he would be required to return it’ (<span>חייב להחזיר</span>) refers to doing one’s duty towards G-d. In addition the expression ‘he returned them etc.,’ (<span>אהדרינהו למרייהו</span>) indicates thhat he did this on his own. Moreover, he was only obliged to return their worth (v. <i>Tosaf.,</i> B.M. <i>ibid.</i> s.v. <span>לבתר</span>). Derived also from the case of the ‘carriers’ (B.M. 83a. Cf. passage quoted <i>supra</i> n. 16), since it is not stated that they came before Rab for trial but rather ‘they went and told Rab about it,’ i.e., to use his influence by means of words of persuasion. Thus also <i>Asheri</i> to B.M. II who considers this a case of acting beyond the requirements of the law and cites the Biblical text <i>which they must do</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 16) and would be <i>contra Tosaf.</i> Hence, according to this opinion all cases of acting beyond the requirements of the law are similar and in all cases mentioned above we cannot compel anyone to act beyond the requirements of the law. The interpretation here follows <i>W.G.</i> and <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i> , <i>BaḤ</i> for other interpretations.</i>
It is permissible for the Court of Law to forgo [certain] rights in property belonging to orphans [provided this is carried out by a settlement] out of Court in order to set them at peace from [entering into future] disputes.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Isserlein.</i> Derived from B.K. 21a: ‘A certain man built a mansion on the ruins belonging to orphans. R. Naḥman confiscated the mansion from him… originally Carmanians (MS.M <span>קדמאי</span>; MS.R. and <i>Rashi</i> <span>קדמונאי</span> ‘old settlers’ or ‘nomads’) had been living on the abandoned property belonging to the orphans and had been paying a nominal rent (Hence the orphans suffered a loss however small it was). (When R. Naḥman) said to him, Go and make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he paid no attention. R. Naḥman, therefore, confiscated the mansion from him.’ This shows that although legally the defendant was responsible in full, nevertheless, R. Naḥman suggested at first a peaceful settlement. Likewise, the legal guardian of the orphans may make a settlement on behalf of the orphans which would ultimately be advantageous to their welfare. He should, however, make the settlement in accordance with a recognized Court of Law — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i>
The Court of Law has the power to issue a decree and to pronounce the ban so that the settlement be carried out and that the orphans should not be able to protest [against the settlement] when they reach their majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Isserlein.</i> Derived from Kid. 42a (cf. parallel passages): ‘R. Naḥman stated on the authority of Samuel: Orphans who came to divide their father’s estate, — the Court of Law appoints a guardian for them, and they choose a suitable portion for each (orphan)… R. Naḥman on his own stated: When they reach their majority, they cannot protest, for if so, where is the power of the authority of the Court of Law?’ Since in legal matters we adopt the ruling of R. Naḥman, it follows that the Court of Law or the guardian have the right to make a settlement for the benefit of the orphans and this remains in force even when they reach their majority. Moreover, even if the Court of Law had not issued a decree, the orphans cannot protest against the settlement when they reach their majority, because since this was done for their benefit it is tantamount to a legal transaction consumated on behalf of orphans which is binding even when they become of age — <i>Nethiboth.</i></i>
The Judge has the power to adjudicate a lawsuit [in a manner] similar to a settlement where the matter cannot be [otherwise] determined [according to strict law]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Asheri Resp.</i> Derived from B.M. 42b: ‘A certain administrator of orphans who bought an ox for them committed it to the care of a cowherd. But it had no molars or (front) teeth to eat with and it died. Said R. Rami b. Ḥama : How should Judges decide this case? Shall we say to the administrator, Go and pay; then he will retort, I committed it to the care of the cowherd (and he should have told me that it does not eat). Shall we say to the cowherd, Go and pay; then he will reply, I put it among the other oxen and I threw food before it; it was impossible to know that it was not eating anything. Now, let us see: The cowherd is a paid trustee of the orphans and should have looked into the matter (whether the ox eats or not) ? — If there were a loss to the orphans, it would be so, but here we deal with a case where there is no loss to the orphans, for they found the owner of the ox (i.e., the seller) and the orphans received their money back from him (on grounds that it was a purchase made in error). Then who is the complainant? — The owner of the ox pleads that he (the administrator) should have informed him. But what could he inform him? He certainly knows that it was a purchase made in error! — He (the owner of the ox) was a middleman who buys here and sells there (immediately). Therefore, he (the middle-man) swears that he knew not (of the animal’s condition) and the cowherd pays the lower price of meat.’ This has reference to two-thirds of the usual price and was considered a sort of settlement because the cowherd advanced the plea, ‘I put it among the other oxen etc.’ Thus <i>Rashi. Tosaf.,</i> however, state that the verdict was in accord with strict law, for if the cowherd were to inform the middleman about it, the latter would have had to slaugther it and sell it at a cheap price, not being able to wait until the market day. Cf. <i>supra</i> n. 8.</i> and he is not permitted to allow the verdict to pass out of his hand [only] in part without [bringing the proceedings to] a [complete] close.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Judge has the right to pronounce judgment according to his discretion (<span>שודא דדייני</span>) when the matter cannot be clarified or he may submit the case to arbitration. This means that he may give his opinion even against the will of the litigants — <i>M.E.</i> This applies only if the Judge recognized fraud on the part of the defendant, in which case he submits the matter to arbitration, but when the claimant is suspected of fraud, the Judge should withdraw from the case — <i>Nethiboth.</i> , <i>infra</i> § 15, 3-4.</i>

B.K. 40a-b: ‘It has been stated: If a man borrowed an ox on the supposition that it is a <i>Tam</i> but was later discovered to have already been formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad</i> (then if it repeated to gore) the owner pays one half of the damages and the borrower pays (the other) half of the damages. But why should the borrower not contend against the owner, I borrowed an ox, I did not borrow a lion? — Rab said: We deal here with a case where the borrower knew that the ox was a gorer (although he knew not that the ox was formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad</i>). Let him therefore plead: I borrowed an ox in the state of <i>Tam,</i> but I did not borrow an ox that was formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad?</i> — Because the owner might retort: In any case, even if the ox had been a <i>Tam,</i> you would have to pay half-damages? Now, too, you must go and pay half-damages. Let him (the borrower) still contend against him: Were the ox in the state of <i>Tam,</i> damages would have to be paid out of its body (the indemnity would be collected from a sale of the animal and not from my best possessions. , Ex. XXI, 35) ? — Because the owner might retort: In any case, would you not have to compensate me (the full value of) the ox? Let him (the borrower), however, plead: Had the ox been a <i>Tam,</i> I would have admitted (the act of goring) and be exempt from making payment (because he who confesses an act with which a fine is connected, — in this case the half-damages which may be considered as of a penal nature — is exempt from the fine). And even according to the one who maintains (v. B.K. 15a) that half-damages is a civil liability (and by making a confession he would not be exempt), the borrower might still contend: Were the ox in a state of <i>Tam,</i> I would have caused it to flee to the meadow (and would have thus avoided payment out of its body which is the law in the case of <i>Tam.</i> , Ex. <i>ibid.</i>) ? — We deal here with a case where the Court of Law took steps first and seized the ox. If so, why should the owner pay half-damages? Let him contend: You were the cause of making my ox fall into the hands of one with whom I cannot go to law? — Because the borrower might argue against him: Were I even to have returned it to you, would they not have taken it from you? But let the owner say to the borrower: Were you to have returned it to me, I would have caused it to flee to the meadow? — Because the borrower might retort: In any case, would the damages not have been paid from the best of your possessions (since the ox was designated <i>Mu‘ad</i> while still in the possession of the owner) ? — This would be a valid argument (by the borrower) where the owner possessed property, but what can be said where the owner possessed no property? — Because the borrower can say to the owner: As well as I am obliged to pay you (i.e., to restore the ox), I am obliged to pay him (the plaintiff who is your creditor). This follows from (the dictum of) R. Nathan. For it was taught: R. Nathan stated: How do we know that if a man claims a <i>Maneh</i> (100 Z<i>uzim</i>) from another and the latter (claims a similar amount) from a third, that money is collected from the one (the last) and given to the other (the first) ? From the verse (Num. V, 7) : <i>And give it unto him whom he hath trespassed</i> (translating: And he [the last debtor] gives it unto him [the first] to whom he [the second] is indebted).’ The argument: <i>‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow’</i> is attacked by <i>Tosaf.,</i> a.l. s.v. <span>הוה מערקנא ליה</span> because this would certainly be regarded as an illegal act according to R. Akiba (<i>contra</i> R. Ishmael in B.K. 33a) who is of the opinion that both the plaintiff and the defendant become joint owners of the ox and consequently by causing the ox to escape to the meadow the defendant is regarded as a robber. Furthermore the Court of Law has a right to pronounce the ban against the defendant if he evades payment of damages. Therefore, <i>Tosaf.</i> explain that what is really meant by this argument is this: By causing the ox to flee to the meadow the plaintiff would have made a settlement with me for a small amount. Consequently, the borrower by not returning the ox to the owner has caused the latter damages by having to pay the difference between the settlemnt and the full amount of damages. This explanation of <i>Tosaf.</i> contradicts <i>Caro</i>’s present ruling according to which one is forbidden to employ evasive means in order to obtain the consent of the plaintiff to make a settlement and to forgo the difference. <i>W.G.</i> removes this contradiction by explaining that in B.K. the circumstances are entirely different because the borrower has a valid plea against the owner, viz., that the latter can have nothing against him, since he borrowed the ox on the assumption that it was <i>Tam</i> and it was discovered that it was declared <i>Mu‘ad,</i> consequently, he is not responsible for making any payment towards a liability which is in a different category. Hence, he may employ a vague and paltry reply, namely, <i>‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow.’</i> The same vague reply could be given by the owner, but it does not mean that it is permissible to actually do so. In short, it means that under the circumstances one may state that he would have acted thus, but not that it is really permissible to do this (v. <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i>). In the present ruling however, we are told what the final law is in such a case. <i>Tummim</i> advances another interpretation. In B.K. we deal with a case where the owner may be trying to collect an old loan from the plaintiff, but he has no witnesses to prove this. Consequently, under the circumstances he may employ evasive means to recover his debt. <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> differentiates between <i>Tosaf.</i> and our present ruling as follows : In B.K. by causing the animal to escape to the meadow it would be considered merely an indirect act, which is permitted on the principle, ‘sit and do nothing’ (<span>שב ואל תעשה עדיף</span>), i.e., it is better not to act directly in doubtful cases; whereas in the present ruling the prohibition is against a direct act to force one into a settlement through evasive means. , also Sheb. 31a that it is forbidden to use evasive means even in support of the truth. <i>Tummim</i> and <i>Nethiboth</i> write that the present ruling has reference only where the plaintiff has a just claim, but where the defendant has a valid counterclaim which he cannot ascertain before the Court of Law, he may employ evasive means, provided he does not appear as a wicked person in the eyes of the Judges.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And if he violated</i> [<i>this law</i>] <i>and employed</i> [<i>evasive means</i>], <i>he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven until he restores to him</i> [<i>the plaintiff</i>] <i>what rightfully belongs to him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA</i> in <i>Resp.</i> Cf. B.K. 55b-56a: According to R. Joshua one of the acts for which one is exempt before men but is liable before Heaven, is to hire false witnesses to offer testimony. Regarding this the Talmud says: ‘In what case? Shall we say for his own benefit, then he has to pay back the money (he thus obtained illegitimately) and should be liable even by the judgment of men? — It therefore means for the benefit of his friend.’ Hence, ‘for his own benefit’ must mean that he employed evasive methods. Yet, it states ‘he has to pay back the money’ whence it follows that the money is recovered by the judgment of men which contradicts <i>Isserles</i>’ ruling who states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of heaven’ which implies that he is exempt by the judgment of men. <i>Isserles</i> must therefore be in in accord with <i>Tosaf</i>. <i>ibid.,</i> s.v. <span>ממונא</span> according to whom if we were to know that they are false witnesses he would have to pay, but since we are ignorant of this, the Talmud cannot very well state that he is exempt by the judgment of men. So too, <i>Isserles,</i> states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven’ because by employing evasive means he has thereby kept the entire matter hidden from people so that we are unaware whether he has anything in his possession illegally or not. Hence, the statement, ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven.’</i>
Although the litigants consented [to submit their case] to arbitration before the Court of Law, they can retract so long as a formal agreement was not made with them by means of a <i>Kinyan</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>קנין</span>.  Glos. Thus <i>Tur; Tosaf.; Mord</i>. to San.  This is <i>contra Ra’BIaH</i> and <i>RABaN</i> who hold that if the litigants were silent after hearing the verdict of the arbitrators, <i>Kinyan</i> is not necessary — <i>M.E.</i> This applies even if at the outset the litigants agreed to resort to law <i>contra N</i> who rules that if at first they agreed to be tried in Court then subsequently if they consent to submit to arbitration, it holds good even without <i>Kinyan</i> — <i>M.E.</i> In order for the parties not to retract they must not only accept the arbitration by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> but must also expressly state that So-and-so should act as arbitrators. But if the arbitrators were not specified, they cannot arbitrate the case. However, if the contesting parties appeared before three Judges for trial and subsequently agreed to submit their case to arbitration before them, then <i>Kinyan</i> alone without expressly stating the names of the arbitrators is valid (<i>RaN</i>) — <i>Nethiboth.</i> Accordingly, writes <i>Bigde Yesha,</i> if one states to another, ‘I sell you this according to the appraisal of three persons’ (v. <i>infra</i> § 200, 7), or in the case of selling the <i>Ḥameẓ</i> to a non-Jew before the Festival of Passover (the contract containing the clause that the price of the <i>Ḥameẓ</i> will be fixed according to the appraisal of three competent persons), it would be obligatory to expressly mention the three persons. Yet, in the Talmud and the Codes we find no such requirement and even <i>RaN</i> might not be stating this as a law to be adopted. This matter, therefore, requires further study — <i>P.Tesh.</i> The present ruling that they may retract if no formal agreement was made by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> means that even the plaintiff who consented to submit to a settlement with the defendant and to forgo some of his claims and we might have thought that this comes under the heading of ‘a waiver requires no <i>Kinyan’</i> (<span>מחילה אינה צריכה קנין</span>), — yet, the following distinction should be borne in mind between ‘a waiver’ where the individual of his own accord foregoes certain claims in which case it is binding even without a <i>Kinyan</i> (v. following par. and <i>infra</i> § 241, 2) and ‘a waiver’ which is the result of a settlement through arbitration made by the Judges where a <i>Kinyan</i> is required so that the plaintiff should subsequently not be able to plead against the Judges’ settlement. Hence, even if the Judges told the plaintiff that the defendant will have to pay him a certain amount of the claim and the plaintiff foregoes the balance, a <i>Kinyan</i> is required because the plaintiff foregoes the balance of his claim not of his own accord. Consequently, this implies (Thus <i>D.M.</i>) that if the plaintiff stated <i>after hearing the settlement,</i> ‘I forego certain claims in accord with the verdict of the arbitrators’ or ‘I forego an oath which should have been imposed upon the defendant,’ a <i>Kinyan</i> is not required — <i>M.E.</i></i> for [the law is that] arbitration requires a <i>Kinyan</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">San. 6a. The arbitrators are relied upon that they effected a <i>Kinyan</i> in the event that the litigants deny this. A settlement reached by the litigants alone (i.e., effected by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant), requires no <i>Kinyan,</i> for then it comes under the heading ‘a waiver requires no <i>Kinyan’</i> — <i>ShaK, MaHaRaM Lublin.</i> Cf. however, <i>infra</i> § 22, 3 from which we see that where the plaintiff himself suggests a settlement, if there was no <i>Kinyan,</i> he may retract <i>contra</i> ruling of <i>MaHaRaM Lublin</i> — <i>P.Tesh.</i> However, if there was only one arbitrator who effected the settlement and he is contradicted, viz., that no <i>Kinyan</i> was made, he is not relied upon, on the principle that the evidence of one witness is not accepted in the case of counter-evidence — <i>Tummim.</i> Judges who state that the litigants agreed to be tried before them and the litigants deny this, — the law is that if there are no other witnesses to corroborate the statement of the Judges, the latter may not try this case, for although they are relied upon as witnesses, nevertheless, they cannot try this case on the principle that ‘a witness may not act as a Judge’ (<span>אין עד נעשה דיין</span>). However, arbitrators under the same circumstances are relied upon because a witness may act as an arbitrator — <i>A.H.</i> If they submitted the case to settlement by arbitration through ‘striking hands’ (<span>תקיעת כף</span>), although it does not have the same effect as a <i>Kinyan,</i> nevertheless, the parties may be compelled to fulfil their promise because ‘striking hands’ has the same status as an oath. Consequently, if the litigant dies, the heirs cannot be forced to submit to arbitration. However, in the case of <i>Kinyan,</i> the heirs may be forced to fulfil the <i>Kinyan</i> — <i>Nethiboth.</i> If they submit to arbitration before the representatives of the town (<span>טובי העיר</span>), <i>Kinyan</i> is not required and the parties cannot retract — <i>R.A.Eger</i> (on the authority of <i>BaḤ.</i> Actually found <i>infra</i> § 22, 1, <i>Gloss</i>). Even if the litigants originally came to Court with the express purpose of submitting their case for arbitration, <i>Kinyan</i> is required — <i>BaḤ, Tummim contra RaShaL.</i></i> even if made before three.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">e., even if three Judges effected the settlement. Thus San. 6a, <i>Rashi</i> s.v. <span>והלכתא</span>. Derived from the fact that R. Ashi (Gem. <i>ibid</i>.) who does not require <i>Kinyan</i> makes no distinction between two or three arbitrators. And since the adopted law is that arbitration requires a <i>Kinyan,</i> it follows, even if the settlement by arbitration was made by three.</i> However, if a formal agreement was made with them by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> they cannot retract even if made before one.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">San. <i>ibid</i>. in accord with the view of the Sages that one is sufficient.

This difficulty may be removed if we realize that <i>Maim.</i> mentions two in order to indicate that in strict law their decision would not be binding (v. <i>supra</i> § 3, 1, n. 1), but in a settlement of arbitration even <i>Maim.</i> will hold that one is sufficient in accord with the Sages — <i>Be’er ha-Golah.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: [<i>And this has reference</i>] <i>not only to a formal agreement made by means of a Kinyan, but likewise, if he</i> [<i>the defendant</i>] <i>gave a note of indebtedness</i> [<i>thus</i>] <i>obligating himself</i> [<i>to carry out the settlement</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i> on the authority of <i>Resp.</i> by <i>RITBA</i> — <i>G.</i> Ket. 101b: ‘It was taught: One who said to another, I owe you a <i>Maneh,</i> is liable according to R. Joḥanan; but Resh Lakish holds: He is exempt. Under what circumstances should this be understood? If (this has reference to a case) where one said to them (those present when he made this admission), You are my witnesses, what is the reason of Resh Lakish who rules that he is exempt? (for this would be <i>contra</i> San. 29b)? If, where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, then what is the reason of R. Joḥanan who rules that he is liable? — Actually, this (refers to a case) where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, but here we deal with one who said to his fellow, I owe you a <i>Maneh</i> (and in the presence of witnesses) gave him a note of indebtedness (in which he admits the debt in his handwriting but it is not attested to by his signature nor by that of witnesses — Thus <i>Rashi</i>). R. Joḥanan holds that he is liable because the items enumerated in a bond (delivered in the presence of witnesses) are as binding as if the one who delivered it said, You are my witnesses; but Resh Lakish holds, He is exempt because the items enumerated in a bond are not binding.’ Hence, we see that a bond is as binding as a <i>Kinyan.</i> Cf. also <i>Asheri</i> a.l. Although <i>Caro</i> (<i>infra</i> par. 13) already states this law, — <i>Isserles,</i> however, refers to a note of indebtedness before the settlement of arbitration is made known. So long as the defendant states in the document, ‘I hereby obligate myself to pay the amount which will be determined by the arbitrators,’ then even if there were no witnesses, it is binding even regarding aught that the defendant is not indebted to him. The document may also be written in the form of an admission. Cf. <i>infra</i> § 40 — <i>M.E.</i> The document must contain no conditions, for assuming liability on a condition has no legal effect in the case of a bond of indebtedness.

They can retract? — R. Assi on the authority of R. Joḥanan stated: Each made a formal agreement with the other by means of a <i>Kinyan.</i> But even if they made such an agreement what does it matter since it is a mere verbal agreement (for this relates only to a verbal promise but not to any tangible object) ? — They made an agreement by <i>Kinyan</i> to take different sides (consequently, something tangible is involved).’ Hence, the same applies to arbitration, i.e., the disputed article should be symbolically transferred from the defendant to the plaintiff by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> the former stating, ‘I hereby transfer the article to you,’ and the latter stating, ‘I hereby forego in my claim whatever the arbitrators will decide.’ In the case of a monetary claim where the law is that ‘money cannot be used for symbolical delivery’ (B.M. 45b a.e.), the defendant must assume the liability to pay as the arbitrators see fit — <i>M.E.</i> Where the plaintiff states that he <i>will</i> forego a certain amount, it does not have its legal effect, for this is regarded as a <i>Kinyan</i> to the effect that ‘I will give’ (<span>קנין אתן</span>) which has no binding force (v. <i>infra</i> § 203) — <i>Nethiboth.</i> , also <i>infra</i> § 245 beg. and § 73.

VI, 13 ff.] the sacrifice that I must then bring should be purchased with second tithe money)? He answered him: He is under the obligation of a vow, but he cannot fulfil (his duty of <i>Ḥagigah</i> thereby) ; he is a Nazirite, but he cannot shave (according to his stipulation to purchase the sacrifice with second tithe money, but only with unconsecrated funds, for once he stated, ‘ I take upon myself etc.,’ he remains under the obligation because his dedication to the Lord by word of mouth is equal to what delivery is in private transactions — <i>Rashi.</i> Consequently, the subsequent condition has no legal effect to change the vow).’ Hence, in the present ruling too, since he made a formal agreement by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> to accept the settlement of arbitration, he cannot retract from his obligation to carry out the settlement by merely paying the fine. However, if he stated, ‘Should I not fulfil the settlement of arbitration, I will pay the fine,’ the law is that if he desires he pays the fine and does not have to carry out the terms of the settlement — <i>Nethiboth.</i> Cf. also <i>Ḥelkath Meḥokek</i> and <i>Beth Shemuel</i> to E.H. § 50, 6.</i>
If the litigant argues that the arbitrators who ordered him to act [in accordance with their decision] did not fix a time limit for him [to carry out their decision] and that he will act [accordingly] as soon as [the matter] will come to hand, what he says is considered void, but he must carry out [the decision] forthwith.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA.</i> Cf. Ned. 3b: ‘How is <i>thou shalt not delay to pay it</i> (Deut. XXIII, 22) with regards to <i>Neziruth,</i> applicable? For as soon as he says, Behold I am a <i>Nazir,</i> he becomes a <i>Nazir</i>; if he eats (grapes), he violates, <i>neither shall he</i> … <i>eat moist grapes or dried</i> (Num. VI, 3) ? — When he says, When I wish I will become a <i>Nazir.</i> But if he says, When I wish, the Biblical injunction, <i>thou shalt not delay</i> is not applicable? — Said Raba, e.g., If he says, I must not leave the world before having been a <i>Nazir,</i> for he becomes a <i>Nazir</i> from that very moment. This is similar to one who says to his wife, Behold here is your bill of divorce (to become effective) one hour prior to my death in which case she is straightway forbidden to eat <i>Terumah.</i> Hence, we say that he may die any moment. Consequently, here too, (regarding a <i>Nazir</i>) he becomes a <i>Nazir</i> at once, because we say, Perhaps he will die now.’ Thus we see that when one undertakes to fufil something without mentioning any specified time, it takes effect immediately. Consequently, the same principle operates in the present ruling. Cf. also Sifra to Lev. XV, 25. Once the arbitrators state their decision before the litigants, they must not make any changes, for their commission is then considered completed. However, as long as they have not stated their decision before them, although they had stated it before the witnesses or others, they may still make changes according to their discretion — <i>Birkath Ya‘akob.</i></i>
If A intimidated B, [viz.,] to deliver him [to a violent person]<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Thus in some edd.</i> should he not give him money [or the like] concerning which they [A and B] were in dispute and [in reality A] has no legal rights [in his claim] and [consequently] they made a settlement by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> and a [forced] cancellation [by B] of a notification<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>מודעא</span>.

But this has reference only to a sale where he receives money for his article. However, in the case of a gift it is not valid because the donor receives nothing in return, and consequently, does not agree to give the recipient ownership rights in the gift (B.B. 47b, <i>RaShBaM,</i> s.v. <span>תליוה וזבין</span>). Further, in the case of a sale if he made a declaration of protest (<span>מודעא</span>) before witnesses that the sale was being forced upon him against his will, the sale is not valid, whereas in the case of a gift, it is not valid even if the donor did not make a declaration of protest as long as the witnesses know that he was under pressure, or where he issued his protest even if they knew not of his duress. Again, in the case of a gift his cancellation of the declaration of protest unlike the case of a sale, is not valid (save where we knew not of his duress and he cancelled his previous declaration of protest — B.B. 48a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אמר</span>; <i>infra</i> § 242, 2). Hence, a settlement of arbitration <i>where the plaintiff has no legal grounds</i> is on the same footing as a gift. Therefore, if we know that the defendant is under pressure, his cancellation of the previous notification or declaration of protest has no legal effect. , <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i> The present ruling is also applicable where the defendant was forced to take an oath, provided the oath was of such a nature that one could cancel or annul it mentally (although the law is that ‘a mental stipulation is not valid’ <span>דברים שבלב אינם דברים</span> [Kid 49b], in the case of pressure it is effective) and that his verbal statement of the oath should not be contradictory to his mental stipulation (v. Y.D. § 232, 14). The present ruling with regards to the ‘cancellation of a notification’ means that it subsequently became known to us that the cancellation was also made under pressure. , <i>B.Yos.</i> and <i>D.M. infra</i> § 205 end and cf.

[If] two people are in dispute concerning the building of immovable property and a settlement was made between them without a formal agreement by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> [then] as soon as [the contending parties] accepted [to carry out the settlement] and one party built a little and the other party [also built] a little according to the decision of the arbitrators, they cannot retract.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA</i> in <i>Resp.</i> Although <i>Tur</i> (<i>infra</i> § 157 beg.) writes that regarding a courtyard belonging to joint-owners in which there is no right of division (i.e., it is not large enough to assign four cubits thereof to each partner) in which case the division must be made by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> (B.B. 3a. , text cited <i>supra</i> n. 31), the law is that as soon as <i>one</i> of the parties takes possession of his share, the division becomes effective and neither may retract (<i>contra</i> Yad, <i>Shekenim</i> II, 10 cited by <i>Caro infra</i> § 157, 2), in the present ruling even <i>Tur</i> will agree that <i>both</i> contending parties must build (or employ any other mode of acquisition depending on the case in question. , <i>supra</i> par. 7) in order that neither should be able to retract, for <i>Tur</i>’s ruling is applicable only <i>infra</i> where each partner had an equal share, only that before the division was made they each made use of the entire coutryard and now it is only a question of making the division legally binding. It is for this reason that <i>Asheri</i> (source of <i>Tur</i>’s ruling) writes (to B.B. 3a) that even if one of the partners took possession of his share in the absence of his fellow-partner and even if the latter did not say to him, ‘Go take possession and acquire ownership’ (v. B.B. 53a and cf. B.B. 3a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>רב אשי</span>) — he acquires ownership. Examine the expression employed in B.B. ibid.: <span>בגון שהלך זה בתוך שלו והחזיק וזה בתוך שלו והחזיק</span> which is explained by <i>Asheri</i> to mean: (‘the division becomes legally effective if) for instance one walked across his own part and took possession <i>or</i> the other did likewise,’ on the principle that as soon as one party takes possession (in the case of movables), the other assumes liability for what is given in exchange (Mishna Kid. 28a) and the same principle operates in the case of immovable property according to Tosef (Ẓ). Kid. I, 9 cited by <i>Asheri</i> because even if <i>one</i> takes possession it is done for the benefit of both parties (thus TaZ); whereas in the present ruling the parties are in dispute as to who should build one part and who the other part. Consequently, both are required to carry out the settlement of the arbitrators in order to make it legally effective. This is <i>contra ‘Ir Shushan</i> who maintains that even in the present case it suffices even if only one party builds — <i>M.E.</i> Hence, according to the present ruling, even if there was no formal agreement by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> nevertheless, since both parties carry out the terms of the settlement, it is regarded as though a settlement was entered into — <i>A.H.</i></i>

The law of a settlement of arbitration made in error will be explained [<i>infra</i>] at the end of § 25.
One who became bound to his fellow to take an oath, and they [the Court of Law] persuaded the claimant to waive [the oath] for his [the defendant's sake], and he [the claimant] stated, 'Let it be as you say,' — he [the claimant] can [subsequently] not retract [from his waiver].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mord.</i> to San.

Cf. Kid. 6a where the law follows R. Jose who holds that ‘if a man discussed with a woman matters regarding her divorce or betrothal and then handed her her divorce or <i>Kiddushin</i> without making an explicit declaration, it is sufficient; Mishna Naz. 20b: ‘If one said, I will be a Nazirite, and his companion heard and said, I too … they all become Nazirites’ — <i>Mord. ibid.</i> Hence, the same principle is applicable here too.</i>

Hence, it is advisable to stipulate prior to the settlement of arbitration that they will follow the majority since it is almost impossible for all the arbitrators to reach a unanimous decision — <i>A.H.</i> Arbitrators may also act as witnesses which is not so in the case of strict law (v. <i>supra</i> § 7, 5) — <i>A.H.</i></i>
[In the case of] a settlement of arbitration without [entering into] a formal agreement by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> and they [the contending parties] delivered a pledge into the hand of the arbitrators, — [the law is that] it has no legal consequences<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RaShBA</i> in <i>Resp.</i> For this is regarded as an <i>Asmakta</i> (<span>אסמכתא</span>), i.e., a promise to pay or to forfeit pledged property (or equivalent) without having received a sufficient consideration; collateral security with the condition of forfeiture beyond the amount to be received, e.g., <i>A</i> pays a portion of his indebtedness to <i>B,</i> leaving the note of indebtedness as a security in the hands of a third party, and agreeing to pay the <i>full amount</i> on the note, if, at the stipulated time, he should fail to pay the due balance. , B.B. 168a.</i> unless they said, [This pledge] is no mere <i>Asmakta</i>'<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"> however, <i>infra</i> § 61, 5, <i>Gloss;</i> § 207, 18 according to which even if one stated, ‘This is no mere <i>Asmakta’</i> it still has no legal validity.

It is therefore, possible that arbitration is not a <i>real Asmakta</i> but is <i>similar</i> to one. Hence, the words, ‘this pledge is no mere <i>Asmakta’</i> must be stated. For were arbitration a real <i>Asmakta</i> even <i>Kinyan</i> would have no legal force.

It is not regarded as a loan save that the vendor has the privilege of repurchase). We see, therefore, that when one states, ‘Let it be yours from now,’ although there is still a condition that has to be fulfilled, nevertheless, it is no longer viewed as an <i>Asmakta.</i> So too, in the case of arbitration when one says he gives the other ownership rights in the pledge ‘from now,’ it becomes the possession of the latter forthwith as a gift made with the condition that it must be returned which is legally a valid gift, i.e., it becomes the recipient’s property for the time being (v.

We do not use means of coercion against a man that he submit his arguments in writing,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">e., to his fellow-litigant. Not only must we not compel one litigant to submit his arguments in writing to his fellow-litigant because he may state: ‘You (i.e., the fellow-litigant) appear to me like a lurking lion’ (B.B. 168a), i.e., ‘I have no confidence in you,’ for you merely wish to acquaint yourself with my arguments in order to prepare or have someone else prepare counter-arguments against me; but even the Court of Law cannot force any litigant to submit to them the pleas in writing even if he had already stated his pleas before them, because once the arguments are recorded, the litigant can no longer alter them (<i>N.Yos. to Mishna</i> B.B. 167b.

But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party (consequently only one witness is left and the law is that one witness does not have the authority to disqualify the testimony of two)? — R. Aḥa b. R. Ika said: (Yes;) e.g., where the qualification of one of the witnesses was contested. Of what nature was that alleged disqualification? Shall we say a disqualification based on a charge of robbery? But does he have the authority to do this, the fact being that he is an interested party? Hence, the disqualification must be based on alleged family blemish (descent from slaves whose testimony is inadmissible or in the case of a Judge who is descended from converts. Cf. <i>supra</i> § 7 beg.). R. Meir maintains that they (the litigant and the one who substantiates his testimony) testify against the man’s <i>family</i> blemish, while <i>he</i> (his fellow-litigant) automatically becomes disqualified; and the Sages contend that after all said and done he is still an interested party.’ The law follows the opinion of the Sages. Although the above discussion refers only to that part of the Mishna that deals with the disqualification of witnesses, the same principle applies to Judges adopted in the present ruling.</i>

For only when the litigant doubts the impartiality of the Judge, the latter must inform him the grounds of his verdict (B.M. 69a-b). , <i>infra</i> par. 4, <i>Gloss.</i> The Court must state in the written verdict that they give permission to examine the verdict. Otherwise, it is forbidden to judge a case where the verdict had already been given by others because of the principle that ‘one Court of Law is not careful in its examination of a case already tried by another Court of Law’ (<span>בי דינא בתר בי דינא לא דייקא</span>), v., Yeb. 106a; B.B. 138b: ‘We are not afraid of (i.e., we do not provide against) an erring Court of Law.’ Needless to say that a written verdict is given only by a smaller Court. The reason why <i>Isserles</i> does not explain this here (viz., that only the arguments and the verdict are recorded) is simply because here we deal with a case where one was <i>compelled</i> to attend the local Court. Hence, it is understood that the defendant has a right to ask for this document — <i>M.E.</i> However, where the defendant was <i>not compelled</i> to be tried, but appeared willingly, then even a smaller Court is not required to give the verdict to the litigant in writing even for the purpose of referring the case to the Supreme Court of Law — <i>A.H.</i></i> and afterwards they exact payment from him [in accordance with their verdict].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Payment must be made forthwith, and if he subsequently produces written evidence from the Supreme Court wherein it is stated that the local Court erred, they must return his money. , <i>infra</i> par. 4, <i>Gloss</i> and <i>D.M.</i> a.l. — <i>M.E.</i> Cf.

The present ruling is derived from San. 31b: ‘When R. Dimi arrived (from the Land of Israel), he stated on the authority of R.

R. Eleazar said in his presence, Rabbi! One who has a claim against his neighbour in the amount of a <i>Maneh,</i> must he expend another <i>Maneh</i> in addition to the (first) <i>Maneh</i> (in travelling expenses)? (Certainly not), but he is compelled to be tried (by the local Court) in his (the creditor’s home town.’ <i>Ibid</i>.: ‘Amemar said: The law is that he (the plaintiff) is compelled to go to the place of Assembly. Said R. Ashi to him: Did not R. Eleazar say, He (the defendant) must attend Court in his (the plaintiff’s) home town? — This applies only where the debtor demands of the creditor (to be tried at the place of Assembly); but if the creditor (demands this, the debtor must yield, because) <i>‘The borrower is servant to the lender</i> (Prov. XXII, 7).’ We thus see that only where the reason <i>‘the borrower is servant to the lender’</i> applies that we compel the debtor to go to the place of Assembly if such is the creditor’s wish; but where this reason is not applicable, e.g., where both litigants are claimants, they are tried in the local Court. This follows <i>Maim.</i> and <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation of place of Assembly (v. <i>supra</i> n. 3).</i> but if the creditor said, 'Let us go to the Supreme Court of Law,' — they compel the debtor and he goes up with him [the creditor].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For only in the case where both are claimants we do not obey the wish of the one who demands to be tried before the Supreme Court (cf. the expression <span>שנים שנתעצמו</span> in San. <i>ibid</i>.). And this applies both to a claim regarding a loan, robbery or damages, since they are both claimants concerning aught which is not in the possession of either of them. In short, it is not firmly established that one of them is a defendant (<span>נתבע</span>), but both are claimants (<span>זה טוען וזה טוען</span>), in which case we do not yield to the demands made by the one who says, ‘Let us be tried by the Supreme Court.’ However, where the litigants fall into the category of a claimant (<span>תובע</span>) and a defendant (<span>נתבע</span>), then we submit to the demand of the claimant — <i>Ta</i>Z. Cf. <i>M.E.</i></i> Likewise, if one party claimed that one injured or robbed him and the claimant wishes to go up [and have the case tried by the Supreme Court of Law], [then] the Court of Law that is in his town compels the defendant to go up with him, and so too, in all analogous cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VI, 7.

If one [of the litigants] is a scholar and knows how to set down his evidence in writing and his opponent is an illiterate person, — [the law is that] the scholar should not write himself when they send on [the case] to seek advice from the Supreme Court of Law, but the Judges should make a copy of them [the arguments].<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Hence, the scribe should not mention the names of the litigants. However, the scholar should not write himself even if he does not mention his name because the Court might recognize the scholar’s handwriting.

The Judge is required to give priority to the adjudication of a lawsuit that comes before him first [in order];<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">San. 8a: ‘<i>Ye shall hear the small and the great alike</i> (Deut.

Resh Lakish stated: (This verse intimates) that a lawsuit of a <i>Perutah</i> should be regarded by you as equally important as one involving a hundred <i>Maneh.</i> For what practical issue is this law stated? If it is to insist that we study the case carefully, is this not obvious! Rather, it is to give preference to the case if it is first in order.’ <i>‘A lawsuit that comes before him first</i> (<i>in order</i>),’ means that the litigant pleaded his case first and the Judge prepared himself to listen to his case although the claim may have been filed in Court later — <i>M.E.</i></i> but he must give priority to a lawsuit of a scholar<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Whether he is the claimant or the defendant — <i>K.H., A.H.</i> Derived from Sheb. 30a: ‘R. ‘Ulla, the son of R. Elai had a case before R. Naḥman. R. Joseph sent (a communication) to him (R. Naḥman): Our friend ‘Ulla is a fellowman (i.e., a colleague, a scholar) in Torah and precepts. Said (R. Naḥman): Why did he send (this communication) to me? (Did he mean) that I should favour him in Court? (Certainly not!) Then he (R. Naḥman) said: (Perhaps he meant) that I should decide his case first (so as not to detain him); or, (with respect to) discretionary judgment (i.e., to which of the claimants to adjudicate the claim in a case that does not depend on witnesses or an oath but rather on the discretion of the Judges. R. Joseph, therefore suggested that if ‘Ulla’s case was of such a nature, then because he was a scholar he should give preference to his case).’ The latter alternative possibility is omitted here because we rule today that in matters pertaining to the descretion of the Judges (<span>שודא דדייני</span>) the Judge must be a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (v.

The majority of <i>Codifiers</i> rule that nowadays, too, a scholar enjoys this privilige — <i>P.Tesh., A.H.</i> a.o.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And if the scholar himself</i> [<i>appears</i>] <i>before the Judges</i>, [<i>then</i>] <i>even</i> [<i>if</i>] <i>they had already begun</i> [<i>to adjudicate</i>] <i>another lawsuit, they should judge him</i> [<i>the scholar</i>] <i>first, so that he should not be disturbed from his studies</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">, B.B. 22a whence we see that in the case of scholars or Rabbis we adopt leniencies so that they should not be disturbed from their studies.</i> <i>However, if his</i> [<i>the scholar's</i>] <i>relative appeared for trial</i>, [<i>then</i>] <i>if they had</i> [<i>already</i>] <i>begun</i> [<i>to adjudicate</i>] <i>another lawsuit, there is no need to interrupt</i> [<i>the adjudication</i>]; <i>but if they had not</i> [<i>begun</i>], <i>they</i> [<i>the Judges</i>] <i>must judge him</i> [<i>the relative</i>] <i>first on account of showing respect for the scholar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i> on the authority of <i>RITBA</i> — <i>G.</i> , Ket. 106a whence we derive that one must also give priority to the lawsuit of a scholar’s relative. Hence, the law is that when the scholar himself appears in Court, or sends a mandatory to replace him, or informs the Court of Law that he is sending his relative to be tried, although the latter’s case has nothing to do with the scholar, we give priority to the scholar or his relative. However, if the scholar’s relative came with a lawsuit and the scholar did not inform the Court concerning his relative’s case, he has no priority rights, for in this case we are not obliged to show respect for the scholar’s relative save in the case of the scholar’s wife who enjoys the same privileges as her husband — <i>A.H.</i></i>

Derived from <i>Judge the orphan, plead for the widow</i> (Is. I, 17) quoted by Yad, <i>ibid.</i> Cf. however, <i>Ye shall not afflict any widow or orphan</i> (Ex. XXI, 21) where the <i>widow</i> is placed before the <i>orphan.</i> This presents no difficulty because the latter text speaks of <i>affliction</i> of the widow or orphan who are forlorn and heartbroken (v. Yad, <i>De‘oth</i> VI, 10) in which case the widow suffers more than the orphan (cf. San. 22b: ‘The death of a man is felt by none than his wife’). But young orphans are not mature enough to realize the gravity of their loss. Hence, in this respect the Bible gives priority to the widow. However, in the case of a lawsuit the orphans are weaker than the widow. Consequently, the orphans receive precedence — <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i></i> and the lawsuit of the widow takes precedence over the lawsuit of a Scholar,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Whence it follows that the lawsuit of an orphan certainly takes precedence over that of a Scholar which contradicts the ruling in par. 1 <i>supra</i> which is derived from Ket. 105b-106a: where it is related that R. Anan who once accepted a gift (v. reason a.l) from a man who brought a lawsuit to him sent the latter to R. Naḥman to whom he also sent (the following communication): ‘Will the Master adjudicate (the case of) this man because I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him. Since he dispatched such a message to me, (R. Naḥman) thought, he must be his (R. Anan’s) relative (and one is forbidden to act as Judge or witness in a relative’s action). An orphan’s lawsuit was going on before him and he pondered: This one (i.e., to judge an orphan) is a positive precept and that one (to show respect for a Scholar and consequently, for his relative too) is also a positive precept, but the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah (i.e., for a Scholar on account of his learning) takes precedence. Consequently he put aside the orphan’s lawsuit and placed before him that man’s suit. When the other litigant noticed the honour he (R. Naḥman) was showing him (his opponent whom R. Naḥman thought was R. Anan’s relative) he had nothing to say (i.e., he was intimidated).’ In order to remove the contradiction between the present ruling and that of par. 1 <i>supra</i> the following point should be made: In par. 1 we deal with a case where the legal guardian (<span>אפוטרופוס</span>) of the orphans brought the lawsuit. This is substantiated by the expression <span>דינא דיתמי</span> (not <span>והוו יתמי קמיה</span>) employed in Ket. <i>ibid.,</i> the source of the ruling that we give priority to the Scholar’s lawsuit; in the present ruling we refer to the orphans themselves who appeared in Court — <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i></i> and the lawsuit of a Scholar takes precedence over the lawsuit of an illiterate person,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">, <i>supra</i> n. </i> and the lawsuit of a woman takes priority over the lawsuit of a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yeb. 100a: ‘In former times, when a man and a woman (with different lawsuits) appeared before me for a legal decision, I used to settle the man’s lawsuit first, because I was of the opinion that a man (should receive precedence) being subject to the fulfilment of all the commandments (a woman is exempt from some); when, however, I heard this (the reason why a woman should be given her share of the poor man’s tithe first. , Gem. a.l), I settle a woman’s lawsuit first.

The Judge before whom a lawsuit comes [up] which he knows to be fraudulent, should not say, 'I will decide it [in accordance with the testimony of the witnesses] and the collar<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span>קולר</span> from the Lat. collare, ‘collar,’ the Roman prisoner’s iron collar or chain around the neck.</i> [of responsibility], <i>i.e., the chain of guilt,</i> will hang around the neck of the witnesses.'<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXIV,  Derived from Sheb. 30b-31a: ‘Whence do we know that a Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent (having reached a conclusion from the testimony of the witnesses that they spoke falsely), should not say, Since the witnesses bear testimony, I will decide the case (in accordance with their testimony) and the collar (of responsibility) will hang around the neck of the witnesses? — For it is said: <i>From a false matter keep far</i> (Ex. XXIII, 7).’</i> In what manner should he act? — He should investigate and inquire into the matter closely by means of [the methods employed in the] cross-examination and investigation of capital cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">San. 32b: ‘R. Papa stated (in reconciling the views of the Mishna [San. 32a] that both monetary and capital cases require examination and inquiry, and the Baraitha [ibid.] according to which examination and inquiry in civil suits are not necessary) … In our Mishna the lawsuit is fraudulent (therefore, there must be a thorough examination and investigation), but in the other (Baraitha) the lawsuit is not fraudulent. This accords with Resh Lakish, for Resh Lakish pointed out an incongruity (between two verses): It is written, <i>In justice</i> (E. <i>‘righteousness’</i>) <i>shalt thou judge thy neighbour</i> (Lev. XIX, 15); and (elsewhere) it is written, <i>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</i> (Deut. XVI, 20. The repetition of the word <i>justice</i> indicates a more thorough investigation). How is this possible? — The latter verse refers to a lawsuit that is fraudulent; the former verse to a lawsuit that is not fraudulent.’ However, this passage contradicts the passage in Sheb. <i>ibid.</i> (v. previous note) according to which the Judge is required to withdraw from adjudicating a fraudulent lawsuit. There are in the main three views held among the <i>Codifiers</i> in order to reconcile these two Talmudic sources. a) <i>Tosaf.</i> (San. 32b, s.v. <span>כאן</span>) maintain that in Sheb. we deal with a lawsuit that we know to be fraudulent. Hence, the Judge is obliged to withdraw from such a case; while in San. we deal with a lawsuit that is suspected of being fraudulent. Consequently, examination and inquiry are required in order to determine for certain the fraudulence in the case. b) <i>Maim.</i> (Yad, <i>ibid.</i>) holds that both in Sheb. and San. we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit only that in Sheb. examination and inquiry had already been applied (note the expression ‘A Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent).’ Consequently, we apply the verse, <i>From a false matter keep far</i> and the Judge must withdraw from the case. In San., however, we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit where examination and inquiry were not conducted as yet. Accordingly, there is no difference whether the plaintiff made a fraudulent claim or whether the defendant presents a dishonest case, — the Judge must withdraw. And although the defendant may benefit according to this view, nevertheless, we are not responsible (This perhaps explains the version found in some texts of Yad <i>ibid</i>.: <span>וידון אותו מלכו של עולם</span> ‘Let the King of the world judge him’ instead of <span>וידוננו מי שלבו שלם</span> ‘One whose heart [intelligence] is perfect should judge it.’ In other words, even if the defendant will benefit, the ‘King of the universe’ will eventually see that justice is carried out). c) <i>Asheri</i> reconciles the passages as follows: In Sheb. the plaintiff is the one who makes the false plea. Therefore, the Judge should withdraw; while in San. we deal with a case where the defendant is a fraudulent person. Hence, in order for the latter not to benefit, the Judge must not withdraw. , <i>infra</i> par. 4.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Nevertheless, the law</i> [<i>of cross-examination in this case</i>] <i>is not</i> [<i>as strict</i>] <i>as</i> [<i>in</i>] <i>capital cases where if</i> [<i>a witness</i>] <i>stated during one of the inquiries, 'I know not,' that the testimony becomes void; but what is meant to be said is that he</i> [<i>the Judge</i>] <i>should inquire into a fraudulent lawsuit as much as it is possible</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 266 — <i>G.</i></i> If it appears to him [the Judge] according to his understanding that there is fraud therein, or where his common sense [directs him] not to rely upon the statements of the witnesses although he cannot [find grounds] to disqualify them, or where his [practical] judgment inclines [to assume] that this litigant is a deceiver and a cunning person and mislead the witnesses although they are eligible [witnesses] and gave evidence in ignorance of its legal bearing, and this party [the deceiving litigant] led them astray, or it appears to him [the Judge] from the general contents of the statements that there are other concealed matters therein and they are not willing to reveal them, — [then the law is that in] all these [aforementioned] matters and anything similar to these, he is forbidden to render a legal decision in that lawsuit, but he should withdraw from this case and one whose heart [intelligence] is perfect in [the examination of] such a case should judge it and these are matters entrusted to the heart [intelligence].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Yad <i>ibid.</i> followed by <i>Tur</i> who also cite, <i>For the judgment is G-d’s</i> (Deut.

[If] one of the litigants<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Whether the claimant or the defendant.</i> said, '[Give me an extension of time because] I can produce witnesses,' they allow him thirty days,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. 112b: ‘Raba said: The law is that a document may be verified by its signatories even not in the presence of the other party; and even if he cries aloud before us (that the document was forged).

Should, however, the claimant not state that he can verify the matter were he to be given more time, and the property of the defendant depreciates in value, the law is that even the thirty days are not given — <i>M.E.</i> Cf. <i>infra</i> § 24. The extension of thirty days is given to people in general, but if it is definitely knows that the litigant is a powerful person who defies the law, v. <i>infra</i> § 98, 4 — <i>M.E.</i></i> and after thirty days [if no witnesses were produced by him], they issue the verdict, <i>and he is obliged to make payment</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mord.</i> to San.

Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel stated: What should he do who did not find (evidence) within the thirty days but found it after thirty days?’ The present ruling is in accord with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel.

Naḥman stated on the authority of Rabbah b. Abbuha: Whence do we know that the Court should attend to the first claimant (i.e., when <i>A</i> brought legal proceedings against <i>B</i> [and according to some versions of <i>Rashi, A</i> has witnesses or a document substantiating his claim, so that <i>B</i> cannot say that he paid] and the latter made a counter-claim against <i>A.</i> Thus <i>Rashi. Tosaf.</i> [according to one interpretation] s.v. <span>שאין</span>, explain as follows. After <i>A</i> instituted an action against <i>B,</i> the latter stated that there were witnesses available at the time of the act who could corroborate his counter-claim, and we deal here with a case where the Court also knows that witnesses were available at the time of the act. Consequently, were it not for the Biblical text [v. anon] we might have said that under these circumstances the Court should give him ample time until he produces the witnesses. Therefore, we are informed that this is not so, but we give prior consideration to <i>A</i>’s claim)? — For it is said: <i>If any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them</i> (Ex. XXIV, 14), (i.e.,) let him cause his matters to come (first) before them.’ <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> (according to a second interpretation) explain that we deal here with a case where <i>A</i> claims that <i>B</i> injured him, and <i>B</i> advances a counter-claim, in which case the law is that <i>A</i>’s claim is given prior consideration even if <i>B</i> states that he can produce witnesses in a day or two — because no extension of time is given in the case of injury (B.K. 91a). <i>Tosaf.</i> accept the second interpretation, viz., that we deal here with cases of injury. Consequently, the above verse refers <i>only</i> to cases of injury. Hence, according to the first interpretation of <i>Tosaf.</i> to which the above verse does not apply, <i>B</i> would be given time until he can produce his witnesses. This is the source of <i>Caro</i>’s text on the authority of <i>Asheri.</i> Thus <i>W.G.</i> , <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i></i> <i>Likewise if it is known to the Court of Law that he can verify his statements within the thirty</i> [<i>days</i>], <i>they do not give him</i> [<i>additional</i>] <i>time for nothing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>B.Yos.</i> on the authority of <i>RITBA</i> — <i>G.</i> , B.M. 118a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>זמן</span> end. This ruling means that even where no loss would be sustained by the fellow-litigant were we to give the claimant an extension of time. Even if we are not aware whether he deliberately wishes to postpone the case for the present or not, but we know that his opponent suffers a loss thereby, the law is that he must produce evidence within thirty days — <i>M.E., ShaK.</i></i> <i>, infra § 98, 4</i>.

Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: What should he do who did not know that witnesses were available, but found them later, or who did not know that he had proof, but found it later (consequently, both the proof and the witnesses should be accepted)?’ The law in this case rests with the First Tanna. Hence, the ruling here. By stating the ruling here in the name of ‘some say,’ <i>Caro</i> disagrees with it, although none of the <i>Codifiers</i> question this law.

What is the case before us? If a case where there are two (witnesses), is it not self-evident that it is based on a Biblical verse (why then should it be mentioned here?), (for it is written), <i>If he do not utter it then he shall bear his iniquity</i> (Lev. V, 1)? — It refers to a case where there is one (witness whose testimony merely imposes an oath upon the defendant — v. Sheb. 40a).’ We thus see that two witnesses who withhold evidence commit a Scriptural offence and even in the case of one witness, he is still held responsible to the judgments of Heaven. Consequently, we should do everything in our power to restrain one from transgression. , <i>infra</i> n. 21.</i> even if the one who is his opponent [in Court] knows about the favourable opinion of the witnesses and the [other] evidence, he is obliged to state [it].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">B.K. <i>ibid</i>.: ‘To hire false witnesses to give evidence (is an offence for which the offender is exempt from the judgments of Man, but is held responsible to the judgments of Heaven).

Judah stated: I heard that if they (the Judges) desire to permit them both to sit, they may do so.’ Although R. Judah represents an individual opinion and we would ordinarily rule in accordance with the Rabbis who represent the majority, nevertheless, since the second Baraitha (v. <i>supra</i> n. 2) and all the cases cited in Sheb. 30a,b harmonize with R. Judah’s view, the law rests with him. The litigants, however, are not permitted to sit down of their own accord, and if they did so, the Judge must ask them to rise, and subsequently, if they desire to permit them to sit, they may do so. According to this explanation it is understandable why King Jannai who was summoned to be present during the trial of his slave who killed a man (v. San. 19a) was told by Simeon b. Shetaḥ when the latter noticed that Jannai sat down after he arrived at Court, ‘Stand on your feet King Jannai and let the witnesses offer testimony against you’ (v.

Hence, this text contradicts our present ruling. Nevertheless, since we deal in our ruling with individuals who are considered equals, therefore our text does apply (v. <i>‘Eẓ Yosef</i> in cur. edd. of Tanḥ.). Should, however, one litigant <i>stand</i> on a higher level and the other on a lower one, it does not matter — <i>M.E.</i> The underlying reason for regarding the litigants as equals is in order to avoid disheartening on the part of a litigant who is not treated as an equal and thereby forgets his pleas.</i> When does this apply?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That if the Court desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so.</i> — At the time of the discussion <i>of the pleas,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Sheb. 30b: ‘R.

Consequently, as in the case of witnesses the law that testimony must be offered while standing is applicable in the first instance, but if the evidence was given while sitting it is considered valid <i>ex post facto,</i> so too, in the case of the litigants it is valid <i>ex post facto</i> if presented in a sitting position.</i> What is considered the conclusion of the case? — [When the verdict is pronounced,] '[So-and-so, You are not guilty,' or 'So-and-so, you are guilty.'<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna San. 29a. , <i>infra</i> § 19, 1 and cf. <i>supra</i> § 12, 2.</i> [With respect to] the witnesses [the law is that] in the first instance they must always [testify] while standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Sheb. 30b in accord with ‘Ulla. , <i>supra</i> n. 10; Git. 71a (ref to Mishna <i>ibid.</i> 67b: ‘If one is struck dumb and they said to him, Shall we write a <i>Get</i> for your wife? and he nodded his head, they must test him three times. If for <i>no</i> he said <i>no,</i> and for <i>yes</i> he said <i>yes,</i> they write and deliver it’): ‘In the same manner as he (one who is struck dumb) is examined with reference to a <i>Get,</i> so too, is he tested regarding transactions, testimony and bequests’ (cited from Tosef(Z). VII(V), 1). <i>Testimony</i> is explained by R. Joḥanan in Y. Git. VII, 1(48d) to refer to ‘one who offers testimony while sitting.’ This according to <i>W.G.</i> refers to one who is sick, since one who is struck dumb must have become so as a result of sickness and yet, we see that his testimony is considered valid through the test of nodding the head. Hence, it follows that if one testified while sitting, his testimony is considered valid <i>ex post facto</i> (cf. Tosef. <i>ibid.</i> where <span>חולה ומשותק</span> is mentioned). , also Zeb. 16a and Tosaf. s.v. <span>מיושב</span>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And standing by being supported is indeed regarded as standing with respect to this matter</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 266 — <i>G.</i> Meg. 21a (ref. to Mishna: ‘One who reads the <i>Megillah</i> may do so while standing or sitting’): ‘A Tanna stated: This (namely, that one may read the <i>Megillah</i> while standing or sitting) does not apply to the Torah (the reading of the Torah in public). Whence is this derived? — R. Abbahu said: Because the Scriptural verse states, <i>But as for thee, stand thou here by me</i> (Deut. V, 28) … One verse states, <i>And I sat</i> (<span>ואשב</span>) <i>in the mount</i> (Deut. IX, 9) and another verse states, <i>And I stood</i> (<span>עמדתי</span>) <i>in the mount</i> (<i>ibid.</i> X, 10) — Rab said: He (Moses) stood when he learnt and sat when he reviewed (his learning). R. Ḥanina said: He was neither standing nor sitting but stooping.’ Hence, we see that stooping is designated neither standing nor sitting and yet the verse (<i>I stood</i>) refers to it as standing. Consequently, standing while leaning against something (equivalent to stooping) is still called standing. <i>Leaning</i> would therefore, include both standing and sitting. It is designated <i>standing</i> where this would be the requirement of the law as in the present ruling, and <i>sitting</i> where the law requires it as <i>infra</i> § 28, 26 where standing (in the case of Judges) by being supported is not considered standing but rather sitting in accord with the First Tanna in Zeb. 19b.

Hence, if Judges who are required to sit, stood by means of some support, or if witnesses who are required to stand, did so only by means of support, we adopt a leniency in both cases and consider standing by means of support in the case of Judges as sitting and in the case of witnesses as standing.

Ḥanina, This is a warning to the Court of Law not to hear the claims of one litigant before his fellow-litigant arrives (Because in the absence of the other party he will not refrain from stating false pleas).’ However, if the Judge had already heard the claims of one litigant in the absence of the other litigant, it is permissible for him to try the case. But, if after listening to one litigant, he gave the latter a written ruling in accordance with the majority of the <i>Codifiers and Responsa,</i> then he is forbidden to try the case because he is considered an interested party, since he will not contradict his own ruling — <i>ShaK, Tummim.</i> , Zohar <i>wa-Yesheb</i> 179b: ‘Who is regarded as a cunning knave (<span>רשע ערום</span>)? — One who pleaded his cause before the Judge before his fellow-litigant arrived (cf.

XVIII, 17, i.e., the statements of the second party appear false and the Judge searches him out. Hence, both parties should be heard together). This is forbidden even if one litigant states both his cause and that of his adversary — <i>P.Tesh. Zikron Ya‘akob</i> writes that if one litigant presented his case before one whom he knows will act as Judge in his case, i.e., the litigant stated: ‘So-and-so has done me violence,’ — the law is that if the Judge does not investigate into the circumstances surrounding the case under which the violence was committed, he is permitted subsequently to act as Judge. <i>MaHaRIL,</i> however, implies that even pleading in such a form is forbidden (v. <i>D.M</i>.) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And this applies only when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge in the case; but if he had</i> [<i>already</i>] <i>heard the pleas of one party and subsequently the second party was satisfied to be tried before him, he is permitted to act as Judge in the case</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MaHaRIL Resp.</i> 195 — <i>G.</i> This means that the Judge is also aware that the other litigant will have to appear before him, in which case the law is that in the first instance he should not hear the cause of the single litigant for perhaps the second litigant will not be satisfied to be tried before him since the Judge had already heard the pleas of his adversary. Furthermore, when the Judge knows that he will act as Judge, the pleas of the litigant who appeared alone will make an impression upon him, which is not the case, however, where the Judge does not know that he will act as Judge, — then he is permitted to listen to one litigant alone in which case he may try the case only if he tells the second litigant that he had already heard the pleas of the other party, and the second litigant agrees to appear before him, although he heard the pleas of the first litigant — <i>M.E.</i> For this may be equated to a case where one agrees to be tried by a relative of the other party or one who is otherwise unfit to judge — <i>A.H.</i> Moreover, since he was unaware that he would act as Judge in the case, the pleas of the first litigant do not impress themselves upon him — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>No Sage should write a decision for one of the litigants in</i> [<i>the following</i>] <i>manner,</i> [<i>viz.,</i>] <i>'If such</i> [<i>are the circumstances of the case which this litigant set forth before me, then the law would be as follows</i>],'<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Aboth I, 8: ‘Do not make yourself to be like legal advisers (i.e., be careful as Judge not to suggest an advice to one of the litigants).’</i> <i>or</i> [<i>even</i>] <i>write for him</i> [<i>the litigant</i>] <i>his opinion without</i> [<i>giving</i>] <i>a</i> [<i>definitive</i>] <i>decision as long as he did not hear the words</i> [<i>claims</i>] <i>of both</i> [<i>litigants</i>] <i>lest from his</i> [<i>the Judge's</i>] <i>words they will learn to utter lies</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth I, 9: ‘Simeon b.

The Judge should not hear [the pleas of the litigant] from the mouth of an interpreter.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXI, 8.

The underlying reason for the prohibition against hearing the pleas from the mouth of an interpreter is that when the Judge listens to the claims of the litigants directly, he has first hand information and is in a much better position to clarify the case. If the Judge requires no interpreter even to reply, only that one of the litigants desires to have an interpreter repeat his pleas, it is permissible. So too, if the litigant appointed the interpreter to be his mandatory, it is permissible, for then the interpreter has the status of the litigant.

The threatening statement was made by the litigant as follows: ‘Were I to desire, I would have made such and such a claim and the law would have been in my favour, but now I do not wish to make this claim against you.’ Consequently, if the law is not as stated by the litigant, the Judge is obliged to say to him, ‘You are making a false statement, for the law is not as you state.’ The reason for this requirement is that since the facts mentioned in the litigant’s statement do not enter into the fashioning of the final verdict, one who overhears this will say that the litigant is right since the Judge was silent (<i>Tummim</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>A litigant who made a claim against his fellow for a small amount and the Judge sees that according to the law</i> [<i>the defendant</i>] <i>would be liable</i> [<i>to pay</i>] <i>more than the amount which was claimed, the Judge should not give a decision</i> [<i>that the defendant pay</i>] <i>more than that which was claimed, and if he</i> [<i>the Judge</i>] <i>decided for him</i> [<i>the claimant</i>] <i>a larger</i> [<i>amount than he claimed</i>], <i>it is considered an error in judgment and he may retract</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">His (<i>Isserles</i>’) own opinion derived from B.B. 5a in the case of Ronya who had a field enclosed on all four sides by fields of Rabina.

Or it is quite possible that the reason the claimant does not make the additional claim is due to the fact that he is aware that the defendant has a counter-claim for the surplus or he may have foregone his claim for some other valid reason. However, if the Judge knows that the claimant is a G-d-fearing person, but is unversed in the law, and this being the reason for his not making a larger claim, since he is afraid that he would be robbing the defendant — the Judge may say to him, Know you that in accordance with the law you are entitled to more, — then if the claimant had foregone his rights or when he owes the defendant the difference, he will state this before the Judge since he is a G-d-fearing person. If the claimant said that he erred in the amount of his claim because he is unversed in the law he is relied upon; or if the Judge himself feels that he has additional rights, he must tell this to the claimant.

But have we not learnt, We begin with the most distinguished (of the Judges)? … The voting in the school of Rabbi was different because in all their voting they began (with the opinion) of those who sit on the side (on account of Rabbi’s humility).’ Hence, when the Mishna states that we begin the voting with the opinion of the most distinguished it means that we <i>may</i> begin with the most distinguished Judge because we do not apprehend that the other Judges will refuse to differ with him; but if they wish to adopt a stringency and begin with the opinion of the minor Judges who sit on the side benches it is a more proper approach, and since this was the procedure adopted in the school of Rabbi, it follows that it is permissible to do so. , also San. <i>ibid</i>.: ‘But in capital cases we begin (with the opinion of those that sit) on the side (benches): Whence do we know this? — R.

For otherwise, after the number of Judges is increased there should be <i>four</i> members. It seems, however, that <i>Maim.</i> and <i>Caro</i> after him maintain that in capital cases only is the undecided member considered as non-existent but not in monetary matters. Cf.

This explains why the number of Judges added in monetary cases is not mentioned in Mishna San. 29a. But in capital cases where the conviction must be effected by a majority of two, it is mentioned (v.

Caro</i> follows <i>Maim.,</i> viz., that after the number of Judges is increased, the one who states, ‘I know not how to decide’ does not invalidate their decision as long as there is a majority of Judges who issue the verdict. Y. San. V, 5 (23a): ‘It was taught: Why are the Judges increased (in civil suits)? — So that if two of the first (Judges) were for acquittal (and one said ‘I know not how to decide’ and they increased the number of the Judges by two) and one of the latter (Judges who were added was also for acquittal and one stated ‘I know not how to decide’), — (the law is that) the proceedings are completed (i.e., sentence is pronounced) by three (since we now have a majority and we do not say that since one stated ‘I do not know’ he is considered as nonexistent and consequently we should again increase the number by two. The point is this: At the outset there were only two Judges who concurred and since the verdict is not valid if given by two Judges, the number had to be increased; but now that there are three who agree, sentence is pronounced and it matters not whether one of the added Judges was for condemnation or was undecided). Said R. La (Heb. <span>לא</span> abbrev. of <span>אילא</span>), Since (two Judges have been added) it seems that the final verdict should be pronounced by four (Judges, because the one who was undecided is regarded as non-existent and now that one of the added Judges is also undecided, he too is regarded as non-existent. Consequently we have only three Judges who declare their opinions and therefore the law is that) we do not conclude the proceedings by three (but we should increase the number again by two more Judges). R. Jose said, You may deduce from this (i.e., from the first opinion recorded here, that we issue the verdict by three), (the law stated in Y. Shebi. X, 4(39c)) — (that) if three (Judges) confirmed (a document) and one of them dies (before they sign it), the two (Judges) sign it and they must write: Although two of us signed it, we judged (confirmed) it by three (For as in our case we do not require that four Judges offer their opinion, so too, in the case of the document we do not have to add another Judge but it suffices that two Judges sign it. Hence, this is in agreement with the First Tanna and not with R. La). Said R. Ḥaggai, the Mishna (too) states this (v. Shebi. X, 4: ‘This is the formula of a <i>Prozbul</i>: I declare before you.....................the Judges, in the place....................., that I shall collect any debt that I may have outstanding with...................., whenever I desire.’ According to Deut. XV, 2 the Sabbatical year cancels a loan and in order to protect the creditor, a declaration was made in Court to the effect, that the law of limitation by the entrance of the Sabbatical year shall not apply to the loan transacted): The Judges sign below or the witnesses (Thus we see that though the declaration was made before a Court of three, nevertheless, it is valid even if two signed the document of <i>Prozbul.</i> Likewise, in the present case where three Judges pronounced the verdict. Hence, we see that this accords with the first opinion <i>contra</i> R. La). But do we apply the rules of <i>Prozbul</i> to ordinary claims? — (Yes), he (R. Ḥaggai) found that it was taught: We apply the rules of <i>Prozbul</i> to ordinary claims.’ It is evident, therefore, that <i>Caro</i>’s opinion recorded in the present ruling, following Yad <i>ibid.,</i> accords with the first opinion in Y. <i>contra</i> R.

Resh Lakish said: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal; So-and-so are for conviction. R. Eleazar said: The defendant has been acquitted by their (the Court’s) verdict. Wherein do they differ? — Whether he shares in making compensation (in the case of an erroneous decision together with the others [v. San. 6a, 33a]). According to the opinion (that the verdict is to be phrased): He (the defendant) is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) must pay his share (because without him the other two could not issue a verdict); while according to the opinion (that the verdict should be worded): So-and-so are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, he must not make payment (because his opinion is contained in the verdict). But even according to the opinion (that the verdict should be phrased): He is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) might argue, Had you not accepted my viewpoint, you too would not have to share in making compensation! — But they differ regarding their liability to pay his share (in addition to their own). On the view (that the verdict is worded thus): He is not guilty, they pay (the entire) liability (since their view was finally adopted); but according to the view: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, they do not pay (the share of the dissenting Judge). But even on the view (that the wording should be): He is not guilty, why should they pay (the entire amount)? They could argue (with the third Judge): Had you not been with us, the trial would have had no legal consequences at all!’ This latter statement means that they say to him, ‘You should have withdrawn from the case, having noticed that our opinion is erroneous, and consequently we would not have been able to conclude the trial. Hence, by remaining you too, are to blame and must share in the payment. <i>ShaK</i> writes that we deal here with a case where the Judges are not aware what the outcome of the trial will be. But if they know what the outcome will be, he may withdraw (i.e., even if the withdrawal is not on account of fear that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty is a powerful individual and will persecute the Judge [v. <i>supra</i> § 12, 1], but simply because he has no time to wait until the trial is concluded — <i>P.Tesh</i>.) and the remaining two Judges conclude the case. <i>Nethiboth</i> contends that even the conclusion of the trial (i.e., So-and-so you are guilty etc.) must be made by three Judges.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Likewise, if at the outset more than three</i> [<i>Judges</i>] <i>were chosen and one</i> [<i>of them</i>] <i>withdrew as has been explained supra § 13 end</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Caro</i> places the law of an undecided Judge and that of one who withdraws from the case on an equal footing, viz., that in both cases the law is not decided by the remaining Judges. <i>Isserles,</i> however, rules (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1) <i>contra Caro</i> (<i>supra</i> § 13, 7) and yet in the present case he agrees with him.

Joḥanan stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he did not act (and consequently in the case of betrothal a plea of unavoidable interference is invalid <i>contra</i> divorce where such a plea would be accepted, the reason being that in the case of divorce the matter depends wholly on the husband’s consent; whereas in betrothal her consent is also required. Thus <i>Korban ‘Edah</i>). R. Simeon b.

Thus R. Jose. Said R. Judah, How can he take possession of aught that is not his, but he must seize it.’ The same controversy is found in B.B. 168a: Mishna: ‘If a man paid part of his debt and the bond was placed with a third party to whom (the debtor said), If I have not paid you (the balance) by such a date, then give him (the creditor) his bond, (and) the date arrived and he did not pay, R.

One [of the litigants] who accepted a relative<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VII, 2. Derived from Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the litigants) said to the other, I accept my father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept your father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy.’ R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages maintain, He cannot retract.’ By stating ‘father’ we derive that accepting a relative is valid.</i> or an [otherwise] ineligible person<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>ibid.</i>: ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy,’ whence we derive the law of accepting an ineligible person. For an oxherd is ineligible to judge or to testify — v. San. 25b: ‘Raba stated: The oxherds to whom (the Sages) have made reference include the oxherds of both large and small cattle.’ Therefore, we are informed that if they were accepted by the litigants, it is valid. , also <i>ibid.</i> 24b: ‘Raba stated: If one accepted a relative or an (otherwise) ineligible person (to act as Judge or witness), he may retract before the conclusion of the trial, but not afterwards.’ Gemara concludes that Raba’s statement agrees with R. Joḥanan according to the view of the Sages in the Mishna.</i> to act as a Judge<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">San. 25b: ‘For we learnt: (If one says), I accept three oxherds as trustworthy (they are acceptable [which means that otherwise they are ineligible]). Does this not (mean that ordinarily they are ineligible) for witnesses? — No, for Judges. This is also apparent from the expression <i>three oxherds;</i> for if it means eligible as witnesses, why three?’ Hence, if they were accepted, it is valid and according to the Sages, he may not retract.</i> or a witness<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">San. 23b whence it is derived that acceptance of an otherwise ineligible person to act as witness is on the same par as accepting him to judge. The entire Mishna in San. 24a deals with a case where the acceptance took place before a Court of three eligible Judges (v. Y. San. III, 5(21a)). For if outside of the Court and there was no formal agreement made by <i>Kinyan,</i> the law is that even after the conclusion of the trial, he may retract according to all the authorities — <i>Hag. Asheri</i> on the authority of <i>O</i>.Z. <i>N.Yos.</i> and <i>R. Yeruḥam</i> (to B.B. VIII) on the other hand, maintain that the relatives or otherwise ineligible persons were not accepted before a Court; but if their acceptance was before a Court, then even before the conclusion of the trial, he may not retract — <i>ShaK. Tummim</i> writes that actually there is no difference whether they were accepted before a Court of Law or not. For once the pleas are presented before them they enjoy the status of a Court and it is regarded as if the acceptance took place before a Court of Law. The acceptance of a relative is valid only where the litigant knew that this was his relative, but if he pleads that he was unaware that he was his relative, the law is that he must take an equitable oath (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 2) and may retract (<i>BaḤ</i>). However, if the litigant used to visit him and now he states that he was unaware that he is his relative, he is not regarded trustworthy (v. <i>infra</i> § 36, 2). Where the litigant claims that he was unaware that the accepted person was ineligible, the following distinction should be borne in mind: If the person is Rabbinically ineligible, in which case a public announcement is usually made in Court proclaiming him as such — then the litigant is not believed (v. <i>ShaK infra</i> § 71, n. 31) because all judicial matters are publicized; whereas in the case of an ineligible person who does not require a public announcement proclaiming him as such — the litigant is regarded trustworthy — <i>P.Tesh.</i> If the relative reveals that he is obliged to help and support the litigant, the latter’s acceptance of him is invalid (<i>Keneseth ha-Gedolah</i>). <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> reports a case concerning a woman who left instructions prior to her death that if any dissension will arise between her sons, a certain relative of hers should adjudicate their case, and the sons obligated themselves by means of ‘striking hands’ (<span>תקיעת כף</span>) to follow the decision of that relative, and now one of the sons refuses to be tried before him, claiming a) that the latter is an illiterate person who is incompetent to adjudicate such matters, or at least others should be co-opted forming a <i>Beth Din;</i> b) that this person is more favourably disposed to one of the other brothers. <i>Resp.</i>: The law is that regarding the Talmudic principle ‘It is a religious duty to carry out the instructions of a dying person’ (Ket. 68b-70a; Git. 14b, 15a, 40a), it would not be applicable in this case (v. <i>infra</i> § 252, 2; Y.D. § 232, 17, <i>Gloss</i>); but as far as the obligation effected through ‘striking hands,’ the instructions must be carried out, and as to a) he knew about this at the outset and yet accepted him; b) every vow, the release of which, brings in its wake the ‘least suspicion of sin’ (<span>נדנוד עבירה</span>), should not be annulled (v. Y.D. § 230, <i>Gloss</i>). Hence, in the present case there is still a ‘suspicion of sin’ against his mother because he should carry out the instructions of his mother, albeit in the category of ‘fulfilling his duty beyond the requirements of the law,’ although strictly speaking this is not applicable in the present case — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> — <i>Gloss</i>: <i>the acceptance is regarded</i> [<i>valid</i>] <i>only when</i> [<i>the litigant</i>] <i>accepted him to act as Judge; but if he deposited money with him regarding which they were in dispute, it is not designated</i> [<i>valid</i>] <i>acceptance</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 311 — <i>G.</i> This refers to a case where one took an oath to pay his fellow on a certain date, and when the time for payment arrived, he deposited the money with the town Judge in order to fulfil his obligation effected through the oath, and instructed the Judge not to deliver the money to the other party because he had a claim against him and the Judge was related to him. Consequently, since the litigant did not accept the Judge explicitly, the acceptance is not valid and the judgment has no legal consequences — <i>M.E.</i></i> — even if he accepted one of those ineligible on account of sin as [equivalent to] two eligible witnesses to testify on his behalf or [he accepted him] as three of a Court of Law [of] authoritative [Judges] to adjudicate [the case] for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VII, 2. Derived from San. 24a (ref. to Mishna <i>ibid</i>.): ‘R. Dimi b. R. Naḥman b. R. Joseph stated: (The Mishna has reference to a case) e.g., where he (the litigant) accepted him (i.e., one of those mentioned) as one (of the three Judges).’ According to <i>Rashi</i> this refers to R. Meir’s viewpoint and it means that even if there are two other eligible Judges, R. Meir maintains that he may retract, whence it follows that according to the Sages, both if he accepted him as one of the Judges or as three, he cannot retract. ‘An ineligible person’ is mentioned here in order to introduce a remarkable feature, viz., that even one who is disqualified to offer testimony in any other case. Much more so in the case of a ‘father,’ who is eligible to offer testimony in other cases, is the acceptance considered valid where the latter was accepted as two witnesses or three Judges — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>Gloss</i> should come after ‘he can … legal proceedings are closed’ anon — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Some differ</i> [<i>with this ruling</i>] <i>and are of the opinion that</i> [<i>this is applicable</i>] <i>only if he accepted a relative or an</i> [<i>otherwise</i>] <i>ineligible person as one Judge or as one witness; but if he accepted him as two</i> [<i>witnesses or as three authoritative Judges</i>] <i>in which case there are two irregularities —</i> [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>even after the legal proceedings are closed, he may retract</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Alfasi</i> to San.

Sheb. 42a: ‘A certain (man) said to his fellow: You are believed by me like two whenever you claim that I have not paid you. He went and paid him before three. Said R. Papa: He believed him like two but like three he did not believe him. To this R. Huna b. R. Joshua objected: Two are like a hundred and a hundred are like two! But if he said to him: Like three, and he went and paid him before four (witnesses, the lender is not believed), for since he cares to mention a certain number of opinions (that he believes him like three people) he means (exclusively) that number of opinions (for otherwise he would have mentioned only <i>two</i> who are equivalent to any number).’ There must have been a formal <i>Kinyan</i> made, for if the statement of credence was made at the time the loan was transacted it is equivalent to <i>Kinyan;</i> otherwise formal <i>Kinyan</i> is required. We thus see that as far as two are concerned the lender is believed according to all opinions, although there were two irregularities (<span>תרתי לריעותא</span>), a) he believed the lender himself; b) he considered him as two witnesses. Likewise in the present ruling there are two irregularities, a) one Judge was accepted like three; b) even he was Biblically ineligible. Hence even in the case of two irregularities, once a <i>Kinyan</i> was made he may not retract on the principle ‘nothing else is required after Kinyan is effected’ (<span>אין לאחר קנין כלום</span>).

Mishneh</i> explains that it does not necessarily mean that money had been exacted, but that since the legal proceedings are closed it is as though money had been exacted. The litigants are not permitted to retract even if they both agree, the reason being that out of deference to the Judge, the verdict must stand unless the litigants wish to make a complete remission to each other — <i>B.Yos.</i></i> provided it did not become known that [the Judges] erred [in their decision].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">San. 6a: ‘R. Abbahu stated: All concur that a decision given by two (Judges) in civil cases is not valid. R. Abba raised an objection (from the following): If one adjudicated a case by himself and pronounced the guilty, not guilty, and the not guilty, guilty, or the unclean, clean, his act cannot be upset, but he (the Judge) has to pay from his own pocket (This clearly shows that the decision of one Judge also stands)? — We deal here with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should the Judge) pay indemnity? — Because they (the litigants) said to him: Adjudicate the case for us in accordance with the law of the Torah.’ The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i>) concludes that if the Judge erred in his decision by overlooking a law stated in the Mishna, he may revoke his decision; but if he made a mistake in deciding against common pratice, his act cannot be undone and he must pay from his own pocket. It is thus evident that whenever the litigants accept the Judge, even if he is ineligible, then even if a <i>Kinyan</i> was effected, it is only on condition that no error should be made. Otherwise they may retract. Cf. Git. 14a: ‘R. Naḥman said, If a formal agreement by means of <i>Kinyan</i> was effected in error, the money must be returned.’ In a case where the Judges erred in their decision and the litigant is then permitted to retract, he is allowed to present his case anew and even alter his original pleas. Furthermore, the second Court of Law gives the litigant a new extension of time to produce his proofs or other required evidence. If the litigants accepted the Judges to adjudicate their case in accordance with strict law, and they (the Judges) made a settlement through arbitration, this too, is considered an error in judgment and even if the litigants bound themselves by a <i>Kinyan,</i> they may retract — <i>M.E., ShaK.</i></i> <i>However, if they are</i> [<i>the</i>] <i>duly appointed</i> [<i>Judges</i>] <i>in the city or the representatives of the town, he cannot retract</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For in such a case it was known that the Judges are incompetent, and consequently, when they were accepted by the litigants, it meant that their decision would be followed even if it were erroneous since they are the representatives of the town. , <i>infra</i> § 25.

So too, one who was not obliged to take an oath and stated, 'I will take an oath,' — [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> although he accepted in [the presence of] the Court [to take the oath], he may retract until the legal proceedings are closed and [only thereafter] he must take the oath. <i>Gloss</i>: <i>One who is under obligation to take an oath and stated before the Court of Law, 'I desire not to take an oath, I am prepared to make payment,' and</i> [<i>then</i>] <i>left the Court of Law, —</i> [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>he cannot retract for this is regarded the close of his legal proceedings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Sheb. 39a: ‘If he stated, I shall not take an oath (realizing the seriousness of swearing falsely), he is dismissed (from Court) forthwith (so as not to give him a chance to change his mind, and he pays the claim. Thus <i>Rashi</i>). According to <i>Tosaf.</i> (v. sources <i>supra</i> n. 26) the question whether we consider the legal proceedings closed after the litigant makes his statement before the Court and then leaves or whether the oath must be taken before the litigant leaves the Court, is applicable both in the case where one was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ or where the defendant transfers the oath to the claimant, or where one states ‘Vow by the life of your head.’ According to those authorities who maintain that if he said ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ and then left Court, he may not retract, the same principle applies equally in the other cases. Those who differ with this opinion and hold that in the case of one under obligation to take an oath, the legal proceedings are considered closed only after the oath is taken, the same principle is also applicable in the other cases. Consequently, <i>Isserles Gloss</i> presents a difficulty. For according to the present <i>Gloss,</i> the difference of opinion between the above-mentioned authorities is only with respect to one who states ‘I will not swear,’ but not regarding the other cases (v. <i>M.E., ShaK</i> and <i>W.G</i>.). This difficulty may be removed if we bear in mind that the law of one who was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not … he cannot retract etc.,’ was stated only in accordance with <i>Rashi</i>’s interpretation followed by <i>Asheri</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 29). One who was under obligation to take an equitable oath in Court and did not state that he wishes to transfer the oath to his adversary and then left Court and subsequently stated that he desires to transfer the oath, is permitted to do so — <i>Tur.</i> Even if he stated ‘I will not swear’ and then left Court, he may subsequently transfer the oath, because we assume that what he meant is this: ‘<i>I</i> will not swear but I will transfer the oath,’ provided he did not say, ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ — <i>M.E.</i> If the defendant was under obligation to take an equitable oath and he stated in Court ‘I will swear’ and before taking the oath, he left, the law is that he subsequently cannot transfer the oath — <i>M.E. ShaK</i> rejects the latter ruling of <i>M.E.</i> For only where he stated ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ he may not retract if he left the Court, because as soon as he says ‘I will not swear etc.,’ it is regarded as an admission of guilt; but where he stated ‘I will swear’ it is as though he said ‘I am prepared to carry out the verdict,’ but it does not mean that he actually accepted to take the oath. Hence, he may subsequently transfer the oath. And this is the adopted custom in many Holy communities (v. <i>P.Tesh</i> conflicting views regarding this custom). This holds good only with respect to an equitable oath, but in the case of a Biblical oath where legally one may not transfer it (v. <i>infra</i> § 87; Sheb. 41a), if one said to his fellow ‘Swear and collect’ and the latter stated ‘I will swear’ and then left the Court or even where he did not leave the Court but the Judges had already commenced the discussion of another case, he may not retract — <i>Nethiboth.</i></i> <i>Some</i> [<i>authorities</i>], <i>however, differ</i> [<i>with this view</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">, <i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Cf. previous note.</i> <i>One who was under obligation to his fellow to take a Biblical oath and he said to the latter, 'Take an oath and collect,' and</i> [<i>then the latter hurriedly</i>] <i>took an oath without holding a</i> [<i>sacred</i>] <i>object,</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>he</i> [<i>the defendant</i>] <i>cannot retract</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And say ‘I will swear and be exempt,’ but the plaintiff must take another oath while holding a sacred object.

As long as the litigants are [still] standing before the Judge, he is believed when he states, 'I have pronounced this party guilty' and 'I have pronounced that party not guilty.' [As soon as] they are dismissed from his presence, he is not believed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Kid. 74a: ‘A Judge is believed when he states, I have pronounced this one not guilty; I have pronounced that one guilty. When does this apply? Only if the litigants are (still) standing before him; but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed. But let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour (since they gave a written verdict to each litigant)? — It refers to a case where the written document was torn. Then let us give them a re-trial? — (It refers to a case of) discretionary judgment (i.e., the Judge based his verdict on discretion and could not decide on the basis of any law. In this case we cannot be certain that a re-trial will result in the same decision).’ , Ket. 85b. An arbitrator is likewise not believed when he states that the settlement was according to such and such terms if the litigants are no longer before him (<i>RaShBA</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> , <i>Isserles</i> anon. This is based on the following case cited by <i>B.Yos. supra</i> § 12: <i>A</i> gave <i>B</i> a gift of bonds and took an oath that he will not collect any of the debts covered by the bonds. Subsequently <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were in dispute concerning other claims and they accepted an arbitrator on condition that whatever settlement he reaches within a certain time limit should be effective and the latter arbitrated the case and ruled that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> should remit their claims by means of a written document excluding the case of the bonds that <i>A</i> had made a gift to <i>B</i> which are to remain in effect as of the day of arbitration and later it was discovered that <i>A</i> had collected money on the strength of the bonds given to <i>B</i> and the latter contends that the money collected by <i>A</i> should be returned, to which <i>A</i> responds that since he collected the money prior to the date on which the document of remittal became effective, notwithstanding the fact that he presented the bonds to <i>B</i> on condition that they remain in their original force, he should be exempt from returning the collected money especially since it states in the document of remittal drawn up by the arbitrator that the settlement excludes the bonds as of the date of arbitration. The arbitrator was consulted and he agreed with A. <i>Responsum</i>: The law accords with <i>B</i>’s claim because when the other claims between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were submitted to the arbitrator, it was unknown that <i>A</i> had collected money on the strength of the bonds, for it was presumed that the bonds were intact since <i>A</i> took an oath to this effect. Consequently this did not enter into the remittal. And as to the statement of the arbitrator, he is not believed because he did not make this declaration when the litigants were still before him as in the present ruling with regards to a Judge. <i>Nethiboth</i> writes that the Judge is believed as long as the litigants still stand before him even if the one who was pronounced guilty could employ the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (i.e., since the the litigant could have stated ‘I did not accept you as Judge’), because since the Judge is believed as two witnesses, it would be tantamount to a <i>Miggo</i> in face of witnesses which is not effective. If the litigant contends that the Judge had pronounced judgment in his favour but the Judge and the other litigant state that the verdict had not yet been given, the Judge is believed even where the litigants are no longer before him provided that there are witnesses who testify that the litigants accepted him as Judge; but if there are no witnesses available and the litigants are no longer before the Judge, the claim of the litigant is accepted on the principle of <i>Miggo,</i> viz., that they did not accept him as Judge. And in this case the principle of <i>Miggo</i> in the face of witnesses (i.e., if we accept the statement of the Judge as equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses) is not accepted since the litigants are no longer before the Judge, in which case the latter is not regarded as equivalent to two witnesses — <i>Nethiboth.</i> However, the Judge is believed as one witness, provided he is not a relative or an otherwise ineligible person, and hence places the litigant who contradicts him under an oath and exempts the one who supports his statement from taking an oath. If the Judge died or left and the litigants contradict each other, each one stating that judgment was pronounced in his favour, — the law is that if one is the possessor (<span>מוחזק</span>) of the disputed article, the onus rests on the other party to produce evidence in order to substantiate his claim; if both are possessors, they divide the disputed article; if both are not possessors, the stronger of the two obtains possession or they make a settlement — <i>M.E.</i></i> And [this refers to a case] where the written verdict is not in his [the litigant's] possession,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Kid. <i>ibid.</i> , previous note beg. This means that if the litigant has the judgment writ, the Judge is believed even if they are no longer standing before him. Accordingly, the question in the Gemara <i>ibid.,</i> ‘Let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour’ refers to the latter part of the cited Baraitha (i.e., ‘but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed’). <i>RITBA,</i> however, refers this question to the first part of the Baraitha (i.e., ‘the Judge is believed only if the litigants are still standing before him’). In other words, why rely on the Judge if we can see the judgment writ. For if it refers to the latter part of the Baraitha, the following difficulty arises: If we do not believe the Judge, why accept the judgment writ? — <i>ShaK.</i> Where the judgment writ held by <i>A</i> contains an undefined statement, e.g., ‘The land of So-and-so belongs to you,’ and <i>B</i> claims that the judgment writ was in his possession but he lost it, then the Judge is believed when he says, ‘I ruled in favour of this party’ — <i>ShaK.</i></i> and [this ruling is applicable] only to a case of discretionary judgment;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Kid. <i>ibid.</i> , <i>supra</i> n.  According to <i>R.

However, even if the litigants accepted the Judge to give a verdict based on discretionary judgment, it is still doubtful whether a re-trial would result in the same verdict — <i>ShaK, Nethiboth.</i></i> but in [the case of] a verdict which depends upon the pleas [of the litigants], reliance [on the Judge] does not apply, for in accordance with [the restatement of] the pleas the one who deserves favourable judgment will be so pronounced<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And even while the litigants are still before the Judge, the latter is not believed, but he must clarify the matter by stating, ‘So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and So-and-so, you have pleaded thus and accordingly, You are not guilty and You are guilty’ — <i>M.E., ShaK</i> a.o.</i> provided he [the litigant] does not upset his former pleas.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">e., there is a controversy between them, viz., the Judge says, You pleaded thus, and the litigants contradict him, in which case the Judge is not believed when they are no longer before him (and according to <i>ShaK</i> even if they are still before him) — <i>M.E.</i></i> This entire [ruling applies] only to one Judge;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., an authoritative Judge (<i>Mumḥeh</i>) or where they accepted him as Judge (according to <i>ShaK</i> by means of <i>Kinyan,</i> but <i>M.E.</i> maintains that <i>Kinyan</i> is not necessary) — <i>M.E.</i> Thus <i>Tur, Asheri</i> and <i>RIBaSh</i> in <i>Resp.</i></i> but two [Judges] are always believed,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For then their statement is equivalent to evidence and they are believed — <i>M.E.</i> Even if it is not a case of discretionary judgment — <i>Nethiboth.</i> Cf.

Every Judge<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">‘Judge’ is expressly stated to indicate that we deal here only with one who is an authoritative Judge (<i>Mumḥeh</i>) or one who is not a <i>Mumḥeh</i> but was accepted by the litigants to try the case, or three laymen even if they were not accepted by the litigants. However, the decision of one or two laymen is not considered valid even if authorization was obtained from the <i>Resh Galutha</i> (Exilarch) and even if the decision was not given in error — <i>M.E.</i> Thus <i>Alfasi,</i> viz., that the litigant may retract even if they (one or two laymen) did not err. But if it is impossible to retract, e.g., where one left for abroad or the like (v. <i>Caro</i> anon), the Judge must make restitution from his own pocket even if he did not take aught from one litigant and give to the other litigant with his own hand. For even where the Judge took and gave with his own hand, and in reality this should be returned by the litigant who received it in error, the Judge must pay the litigant who suffered a loss, and then collect from the other litigant who received payment on account of the erroneous decision of the Judge. <i>RaZaH</i> contra <i>Alfasi</i> rules that since the decision is invalid, then even if the layman Judge took and gave with his own hand, he is exempt from making payment, for the litigant is responsible since he knew well that the decision of such a Judge is invalid. If the Judge compelled the litigant to give aught to the other litigant, he is considered a robber and must make restitution. <i>ShaK</i> rules in accord with <i>Alfasi</i> where the Judge took and gave with his own hand.</i> who adjudicated monetary cases and gave an erroneous decision — [the law is that] if he erred in evident and known matters, e.g., laws that are explicitly stated in the <i>Mishna</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VI,  Derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘In monetary cases the verdict may be reversed (on discovering that the verdict was erroneous) either (from conviction) to acquittal or (from acquittal) to conviction.’ Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 33a: ‘But the following disagrees with it: If one adjudicated a case (by himself) and pronounced him who was guilty, not guilty, or the one who was not guilty, guilty; the clean, unclean, or <i>vice versa</i>: his verdict stands, but he must pay compensation (for any damage resulting from his erroneous decision) out of his own pocket (Mishna Bek. 28b. Thus we see that the verdict may not be reversed)? — R. Joseph stated: There is no contradiction: here it (our Mishna) has reference to a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (He had authority to upset his former decision); there (Mishna Bek.) to one who is not a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (His decision stands but he must pay indemnity). But do we reverse the verdict in the case of a <i>Mumḥeh?</i> Have we not learned: If he was recognized by the <i>Beth Din</i> as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> he is exempt from making payment! — R. Naḥman replied: Here (in our Mishna) we deal with a case where there is a Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (therefore, the superior Court can reverse the verdict of the lower Court); but in the other Mishna there is no other Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (i.e., in both Mishnahs the verdict was issued by a <i>Mumḥeh,</i> but where there is no superior Court available, one of the litigants may oppose reversing the verdict). R. Shesheth answered: Here we deal with a case where he (the Judge) overlooked a law cited in a Mishna (Hence, the verdict may be reversed); there he erred in weighing of opinions. For R. Shesheth stated on the authority of R. Assi: If he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the verdict is reversed; if he erred in weighing of opinions, the verdict is not reversed. Rabina asked R. Ashi: Is this also applicable if he erred in connection with a teaching of R. Ḥiyya or R.

Hamnunah raised an objection against R. Shesheth (v. <i>supra</i> n. 2): It once happened that a cow’s womb was removed and R. Tarfon gave it to the dogs to eat (i.e., he declared the cow <i>Terefah</i>). When the case was presented before the Sages in Yabneh, they declared her permissible (for human consumption), for Theodos (or Theodoros), the Physician said that no cow or sow leaves Alexandria of Egypt unless the womb is first cut out, in order that she may not breed (This precaution was taken so as to limit its breeding only to Egypt and thus compel buyers to come to Alexandria). Said R. Tarfon: Your ass is gone, Tarfon! (i.e., I will now have to sell my ass in order to compensate the owner of the cow for having erroneously declared it <i>Terefah</i>). But R. Akiba said to him: You are exempt from reparation, since he who is publicly recognized as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> is exempt from making compensation (Mishna Bek. 28b; San. 93a). Now, if your opinion (R. Shesheth that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict) has substance, he (R. Akiba) should have said to him: You overlooked a law cited in the Mishna (cf. Mishna Hul. 54a: If the womb is gone the animal is not rendered <i>Terefah</i>) and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict (Hence, even if R. Tarfon were not an expert, he should be exempt. Consequently, if the cow were still here, R. Tarfon could rescind the verdict and therefore the person who gave it to the dogs should be held responsible)! — He (R. Akiba) gave him two reasons: Firstly, you have overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may rescind his verdict. Secondly, Even if your error was made against common practice (Lit. ‘weighing of opinions’), you are a publicly recognnized <i>Mumḥeh,</i> and as such you are exempt from making reparation. Said R. Naḥman b. Isaac to Raba: What is the objection that R. Hamnunah raised against R. Shesheth from the case of the cow? But the cow had already been given to the dogs to eat and was no longer in existence for it to be returned to its owner (i.e., a reconsideration of the verdict would be of no avail)! — This is what he meant: Were you to say that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may <i>not</i> reconsider the verdict, it is right, for then the verdict stands and R. Tarfon was fearful and (R. Akiba) said to him: You are recognized by the <i>Beth Din</i> as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> and exempt from reparation. But if you say that he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna <i>may</i> reconsider his verdict, then (R. Akiba) should have said to him: Since if the cow were still available your verdict would have been invalid and you would have done nothing, so too, now (that the cow is no longer in existence) you have done nothing (i.e., you did not give it to the dogs yourself and it was the owner’s bad luck to have carried out your verdict [v. B.K. 100a]. Consequently, since R. Akiba did not present this argument, we conclude therefrom that if one overlooks a law cited in the Mishna, he must not reconsider the verdict).’ The present ruling accords with the interpretation of R.

However, if the Judge took and gave with his hand even without having to resort to force, he is held responsible even if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishnah — <i>ShaK.

However, if he did not take and give with his own hand and erred in a law cited in the Mishna and is a <i>Mumḥeh,</i> — then even from the point of acting beyond the requirement of the law he is exempt as in the case of R. Akiba who exempted R. Tarfon and did not consider him liable beyond the requirements of the law. If one asks the advice of a Sage whether he should purchase certain meat or fruit, and the latter informed him that the fruit is ‘clean’ or the meat ‘Kosher’ and on the strength of this advice he purchased same and subsequently, it was found that the Sage had erred — <i>ShaK</i> holds that if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the purchase is invalid and he may retract; but if he erred ‘in the weighing of opinions’ the purchaser may not retract save that the Sage or Judge is liable to make compensation if he is not a recognized authority but was only accepted by the litigants. <i>Tummim</i> disputes this ruling and maintains that the purchase is void and the vendor must return the money and take back his fruit or meat.</i> <i>And with regards to decisions in ritual law</i>, — <i>if he</i> [<i>the Judge</i>] <i>has attained</i> [<i>the age of</i>] <i>ordination, although he is not</i> [<i>officially</i>] <i>ordained, his legal status is as that of an authoritative</i> [<i>Judge</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>N.Yos.</i> to San.

Eleazar stated on the authority of R. Oshaia: The text reads, <i>If thou wilt not observe to do</i> etc. (Deut. XXVIII, 58. The verse continues: <i>That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God,</i> which intimates that one should not utter the Divine Name in vain and likewise one who curses his neighbour with the Divine Name is included in the same category). And it is written, <i>Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful</i> (v. 59). Now I do not know what is the nature of this <i>wonder</i> (peculiarity of punishment). But when it says (<i>ibid.</i> XXV, 2): <i>That the judge cause him to lie down to be beaten</i> (<span>והפילו</span> which is similar to the expression <span>והפלא</span> <i>He will make … wonderful</i>), this indicates that the <i>wonderful</i> (punishment) refers to punishment with lashes … Why not say … since he transgresses two things, first in uttering the Lord’s Name in vain and then in irritating his fellow, consequently, punishment with lashes should not suffice? — You cannot say thus, for it is written, <i>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</i> (Lev. XIX, 14 whether with or without the Divine Name).’ Thus also in Y. Sheb. IV, 10(35d) in accord with R. Jose <i>contra</i> the Colleagues. , however, <i>RaBaD</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> who on the basis of Y. <i>ibid.</i> deduces that if one cursed with a substitute he is not punished by lashes. It is only when he curses with the Tetragrammaton, although no act is performed, yet lashes are administered. , <i>Kes. Mish.</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> who defends <i>Maim.</i> against <i>RaBaD</i>’s stricture.</i> on account of [the negative precept] 'Thou shalt not curse the deaf,'<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XIX, 14. Actually the negative precept <i>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</i> includes all persons. The deaf was singled out, although he does not hear and is not subjected to any suffering, so that people should not take advantage of his infirmity. Thus Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXVI, 1 and <i>Tur</i> a.l. — <i>M.E.</i> Cf. also Sifra to Lev. <i>ibid.</i></i> and if [the cursed person] was a Judge, he receives additional lashes on account of [the negative precept] 'Thou shalt not curse the Judges.'<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ex.

Siman 28

1. Anyone who knows testimony that another has a use for, and is fit to testify, is obligated to testify if he is called to testify in court. This is true whether he is solo or has another witness with him. If he withholds his testimony, he is exempt from judgement by man but is liable by the laws of the heavens. A solo witness should only testify on monetary matters where he may require an oath or for a matter of prohibition where he is causing someone to separate from the prohibition. If the prohibition was already done, however, he should not testify because he is merely gossiping about the individual. A person is prohibited from testifying regarding a matter he does not know, even if it was told to him by a truthful person. Even if one were to tell him to merely stand with another witness, but not actually testify, in order to intimidate the borrower who will think he has two witnesses and get the borrower to confess, the witness may not do so.
2.  A person is permitted to place a cherem in the synagogue on anyone who knows testimony for him to come and testify. He cannot, however, force them to swear. If they don’t testify, they will carry their sin. Nevertheless, if the court sees a need to have them swear to say the truth, they may do so. See earlier 17:3 and later 71:7-8. There are those that say that when a cherem is placed, even relatives and the party himself must testify. There are those that disagree and this is the primary ruling. See Yoreh Deah Siman 232 regarding a king who commands the placement of a cherem for testimony.
3. If a gentile calls a Jew to secular court, and there is a Jew who is the only one that knows testimony for the gentile, and it is a situation where secular courts obligate payment based on a solo witness, the Jew is prohibited from testifying for him. If he testifies, we place a shmuti on him. The witness is not obligated to pay, however, because he can say I testified truthfully. If, however, one can determine that he testified falsely, he is obligated to pay. If the party admits that the testimony was true, we do not place a shmuti on him. If the gentile originally designated him as a witness, it is a desecration of God's name not to testify and he must testify for him.
4. If a Jew calls a gentile to court who denies the claims, and the gentile has a solo witness, he may testify for him. All the more so can two witnesses testify because even a Jewish court would obligate payment based on their words. The same applies in a situation where we would take away money based on a solo witness, and he can testify. Two relatives are like one witnesses because under our laws we do not take away money based on a solo witness.
5. If a scholar knows testimony for a Jew and is called to testify in front of a court that is inferior to him, he is not obligated to go and testify in a monetary case unless they send someone to him to have him testify. If, however, there is a possibility of having someone refrain from violating a prohibition, he is obligated to go and testify. Anyone who has a proof via witnesses is required to make the effort to bring them to court. If the court knows that his adversary is tough, and the plaintiff claims that the witnesses are afraid of testifying because of the adversary and he has proof to this claim, the court may force the adversary to bring those witnesses. The same applies to similar issues that arise for a tough person. Ideally, witnesses must stand while testifying. If a witness is a scholar, we have him sit. See later at the end of this Siman.
6. Ideally, the judges should sit while accepting testimony. They must understand the language of the testimony and they may not hear it via a translator. If they understand what the witnesses are saying, they may use an interpreter if they don’t know how to respond. See earlier 17:6.
7. We intimidate the witnesses in front of everyone. We inform them of the power of false testimony and the embarrassment a false witnesses faces in this world and the next and that he is considered lowly in the eyes of the one that hired him.
8. They subsequently have everyone go outside and they leave the eldest of the witnesses. They tell him, “tell us how you know that this person owes money to this one.” If he says, he told me he is liable, or so-and-so who is valid and reliable told me he owes him money, he has said nothing. He must say that he himself saw the lending of the money or say that the party confessed in front of me that he is liable.
9. They then bring in the second witness and examine him. If he testifies the same as the other witness, we give and take on the matter and conclude the case.
10. If the witnesses relate their testimony in the exact same fashion, we must be consider the fact that they are lying and conspired to testify. The judge must extensively investigate them. If one witnesses says his testimony and the second says "I say the same thing," it would not work unless he went overseas and he cannot testify explicitly.
11. A testimony sent in writing to the court is not testimony because the Torah states, “al pi shenayim edim”- it must be from their mouths and not from their writing. This is in fact our custom, not like those who allow it for otherwise valid witnesses who are not mutes.
12. We can decide monetary cases based on testimony from a document- even if the witnesses are not around- so that we do not ultimately shut the door on borrowers. See later 61:2 with respect to what is a considered a document. Also see later 46:10. 
13. A person may testify so long as he has a recollection of the matter. We are not concerned that he does not remember it as well because of the significant passage of time, even if he only remembers the testimony via a writing provided to him. If he wrote it in his documents so as to remember, and then forgot, and now only remembers because of the writing, he can still testify, so long as he remembers the actual matter once he sees the writing. See later 46:10.
14. Similarly, if the witness remembers the matter only after someone else reminded him, he may still testify. This is true even if the person that reminds him is the second witness. If, however, the party reminds him and he remembers, he may not testify. If the witness is a scholar, he may testify even if the party reminded him because the scholar certainly would not testify if he did not remember.
15. We do not accept testimony if the party is not in court. If they accepted the testimony, they cannot rule based on it. They can re-testify in front of the party. If they changed their testimony from the original testimony, we follow the second testimony that was in front of the party, even if they testified originally with a cherem, because any testimony not in front of a party is as if it was given outside of court. There are those that disagree and say that once testimony has been accepted outside the court, it is okay after the fact. Therefore, if the party is strong and the witnesses are afraid to testify in front of him, we can accept the testimony not in front of the party, and judge accordingly. However, if it is possible to force the strong party in the way that was explained in paragraph 5 of this Siman, that would be preferred. There are those that say that the concept of not accepting testimony if not in front of the party is only by monetary cases, but not for quarreling and fighting where we are concerned that if they testify in front of the parties they will fight with one another and with the witnesses. The Geonim instituted that for such a case we accept testimony not in front of the parties and we do not reveal the identity of the witnesses. It seems to me that this is only where the court does not want to judge strict law and punish, but instead wants to quiet the fighting and rule based on the needs of the particular dispute. If, however, they want to punish and judge one of them, they must accept the testimony in front of him, as will be explained in Even Haezer 11:4.
16. If a party or the witnesses were sick, we may accept testimony not in front of the party. If the witnesses wanted to go overseas, and the party is sent for but does not come, or he is not in the city, we may accept testimony not in front of him. If they did not tell the party, however, they may not accept, unless there was a concern that the witnesses would leave by the time they told him, as will be explained later. If the defendant is sick, we do not accept testimony if not in front of him, even if there is a concern that his properties will transfer to his orphans and the plaintiff will not be able to litigate with them, as will be explained in Siman 110. There are those that say that any time they send after someone and he does not come to court, we can accept testimony not in front of him if they began the claims in front of him, or even where they did not begin the claims if it’s a situation where he is required to be judged in front of those judges, as was explained in Siman 14. Similarly, if there is a pressing need and it is impossible to accept the testimony later, such as where the witnesses or plaintiff were sick and in danger of dying or where the witnesses are going overseas and we cannot wait to tell him, we may accept even without sending for him. This seems correct based on that which is ruled later in 140:10.
17. If Reuven makes a claim against Shimon and Reuven's witnesses are in a different place, the court will tell Shimon that he can decide whether to go to the place of the witnesses so that they can testify in front of him or, alternatively, a court in the place of the witnesses will accept their testimony not in front of him and relay it to this court where the parties are and they will judge based on such acceptance of testimony. The same applies where he located his witnesses in another city and there is no time to send for the other party or they will not be able to find them again. The court may accept the testimony not in front of the parties, and judge based on that testimony. This is the widespread custom in our countries, notwithstanding the fact that there are those that argue and hold one cannot accept testimony not in front of the parties if they did not send for the party first, even in a situation where there is a concern that the testimony will be lost if they insist on accepting in front of the party. That is not our custom- rather, we have the aforementioned custom.
18. The entire concept of not accepting testimony if not in front of the parties was only said where the plaintiff brings witnesses supporting his claim. We do, however, accept testimony from witnesses that are brought to exempt a party.
19. We do not accept witnesses against a minor, even if in front of the minor, because in front of a minor is the equivalent of not in front of him. The specifics of this rule will be explained in Siman 110.
20. Two people are not qualified to accept testimony. If they accepted testimony, it is meaningless.
21. The acceptance of testimony requires three experts who are familiar with the rules of valid and invalid witnesses and are careful that each testimony conforms with the other, as the Mishna says, “one must be careful with his words lest he learn to lie from them.” Anyone who accepts testimony and is not fit to judge, is as if he accepted false testimony. One cannot judge based on such a document. Rather, they rely on the actual witnesses.
22. It is appropriate for those that accepted the testimony to publicize who the witnesses are in the document of the acceptance of testimony. However, there is no harm if they did not write who the witnesses are.
23. If the community wants to institute that the two scribes accept the testimony and collect based on their words or if they want the signature of the scribe to count as two witnesses if a witness that was called to testify had to leave, such rules would be valid because on all these matters the public has permission to institute as they see fit in their cities.
24. If one claims that he has two sets of witnesses and one set says that they do not know anything, the party does not forfeit his rights and may be bring the second set. We only accept testimony during the day. If they accepted it at night- even where the witnesses were being chased overseas, we may not judge based on that acceptance of testimony. If, however, the parties accepted the right to accept testimony at night, we may even accept in the first instance.
25. We cannot accept testimony before the defendant responds to the plaintiff because the defendant may confess and we will not need the witnesses. There is no need to burden the court.
26. If the court was standing while accepting the testimony from the witnesses, what’s done is done. If they were leaning, it is even permitted in the first instance because leaning is like sitting. In Siman 17 we explained that today we have the custom to seat the witnesses.

Siman 29

1- Once the witnesses have testified in court (and it is past kidei dibur), they cannot retract. How so? If the witness said I erred, I made a mistake and now I remember the matter differently or I said it out of fear, we do not listen to him- even if he provides a rationale to his retraction. Similarly, he cannot add a condition to his testimony. (There are those that say he may add a condition) (Tur in the name of the Rosh). However, in a situation where it is clear that he erred, such as where the court demanded he bring witnesses to testify that he is not a fraudster, he brings them and the court asks him do you know him as a fraudster, and they say yes, and the party responds “you know that I am a fraudster?!” and they say we said you are not a fraudster, we believe their latter statement because it is assumed that a person does not bring witnesses to harm him and they certainly erred. Similarly, in any error that witnesses often make, they themselves are believed and there is no issue of re-testifying. Similarly, if they don’t contradict the substance of their words, such as where there words were vague and can be interpreted in one of two ways- one more probable than the other, we can conform their testimonies in any practical way in the same manner that we explain two witnesses that contradict each other in order that the testimonies conform. <i>RAMA: In a situation where they placed a cherem in the synagogue that anyone who has testimony should testify before he leaves the synagogue, and the witnesses come after they leave the synagogue and say we didn’t recall at the time but now we remember, they may testify since they were originally silent and never said they did not know (Mordechai). Even in a case where they said they don’t know, if they can provide a rationale as to why they said it, they may testify since they did not say the reverse of what they said later (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam and the Tur)</i>
2. Witnesses that claimed they testified falsely are believed with respect to themselves and must pay any loss they caused through their testimony.
3. Although generally saying I did not see is not a valid proof, where two people were together and one says I did not see, it is as if he told the other you did not see and it is considered a contradiction. <i>RAMA:If, however, a witness says so and so was with me and that person says he was not with him, that is not a contradiction, because a witness does not pay attention as to who is with him at the time of the incident. (Teshuvot of the Rosh).</i>

Siman 30

<b>Witnesses On Monetary Matters Do Not Require an Interrogation and the Testimony Must Be Complete</b>: Paragraph 1- Witnesses on monetary cases do not require an investigation, with the exception of witnesses on a physical altercation. How so? If the witnesses said this person lent this person money in this year, even if the month, place and type of money- whether it was this coin or that coin- do not conform, the testimony is valid. If it appears to the judge that this is a dishonest case, he must investigate in order to produce a true ruling. <i>RAMA: See earlier Siman 15. With respect to witnesses testifying on a prohibited act, see Even Haezer 17:21 and 42:4 regarding whether an investigation is required. Also see 14:4.</i>
2. Although monetary witnesses do not require interrogation, if they contradict each other on any of the interrogations, their testimony is void. If, however, they contradicted each other on the mere inquiries, the testimony is valid. How so? If one said he borrowed money in Nisan and the second says it was in Iyar or one said it was in Jerusalem and other said it was in Lud, the testimony is void. Similarly, if one said he lent him a barrel of wine and the other said it was oil, the testimony is void because they contradict each other on an interrogation. If, however, one said the maneh was black due to its age and the other says it was white (and the plaintiff is making a claim on both) (Tur) or where one says they were on the top row and the other says they were on the bottom, the testimony is valid (if the places are close enough that they can see one another) (Tur). Even if one says he lent him a maneh and the other says it was 200, he is obligated to pay because a maneh is included in 200. Similarly, if one said he has the value of wine in his possession, and the other says of oil (and the plaintiff is claiming both) (Tur), he would pay the lesser of the two. The same applies in anything similar. (R"an)(Any situation where we can explain the words of the witnesses in a manner that they will not contradict each other, we explain their words, as was explained in 29:1.)
3.  If Reuven claims 1500 gold coins and bring five witnesses: one says I saw him lend him 100, one testifies on 200, one testifies on 300, one testifies on 400 and one testifies on 500, if they all testified a specific testimony, such as where the first says it was on the first of Nissan in the first year, the second says it was a different time, etc., he must pay 700 and swear a biblical oath on the 100 with a roll-over oath on the remaining 700. If, however, they all testified on the same day and contradict each other, he must only pay 200. Similarly, if they testified without specifying, we view it as a contradiction in order to be lenient on the defendant, because the burden of proof is on the party taking money.
4. If a witness testifies that I saw this incident and so and so was with me, and that persons says I did not see it and I was not with you, that is not considered a contradiction. (See above at the end of Siman 29).
5. If one claims that his adversary has 200 gold coins in his possession as a deposit in order to make a profit for him, and the adversary denies the whole thing, but there is one witness testifying that he heard from the guardian that he has 50 and another witness testifies that he heard from the guardian that he has 150, he has been established as a liar for that money and must pay the 200.
6. In monetary cases, witnesses may join together even if they did not see the incident together. How so? If one said he lent him money in front of me on this and this day or he confessed in front of me, and the other witness says he lent him in front of me or confessed in front of me on a different day, they may join together. Similarly, if one said he lent him in front of me and the second says he confessed in front of me or the first says he confessed in front of me and the second says at a later time that he lent him in front of me, they may join together. (The same applies for a testimony on the violation of a prohibition) (Mordechai). (See Even Haezer Siman 11 and 143:10).
This - that a loan following a loan can be combined is where the plaintiff claims two manim- one that he lent him on Sunday and the second on Monday. If, however, the lender admits that he only lent him one maneh, we evaluate whether it is possible to say that one erred regarding the time of the loan. For example, if one says it was on the second of the month and the other says it was the third of the month in a situation we can say they are both testifying about the same day and they erred regarding whether the prior month was a full month, we can combine the testimony by saying that they are testifying on the same maneh. If it is clear that they are testifying on two different maneh, one of them is clearly lying and we would have the defendant take a biblical oath and he would be exempt. <i>RAMA: If one witness testifies that Reuven gave Shimon land via a kinyan and the other witness testifies that Shimon made an appropriate chazaka, we can combine them because it is like an admission after an actual loan. (Teshuvos HaRosh)</i>
8. If one claims 200 from a document and the other says he paid it back and he brings two witnesses, one saying he paid him 100 in Nissan and the other saying in Tishrei, they can combine. If the document was made prior to Nissan we assume one maneh has been paid back. Similarly, if the lender confessed in front of one that he was paid back 100 in Nissan and confessed in front of the second that he was paid back in Tishrei, or one testifies that he paid back a maneh and the second testifies that he confessed in front of him, they can be combined and the lender cannot say it was for a different debt.
9. Witnesses do not have to testify together for monetary cases. Rather, one comes in front of the court and they listen to his words today. When the second witness comes at a later date they listen to him and then combine the two and remove the money from the possessor.
10. Similarly, if one testimony was in writing and one was oral, they can be combined. If the one that did not write says I made a kinyan from him on this matter, and the lender did not come and ask me to write it, they can be combined to make it a loan in a document and the borrower cannot claim he paid back. (See later at the beginning of Siman 51.)
11. If one testified in this court and the second testified in another court, one court may join together with the other court and combine the testimony. <i>RAMA:Others that simply heard the matter, however, cannot combine, because it is hearsay.</i>
12. Similarly, if two witnesses testified in this court, then testified in another court and then testified in a third court, one person from each court may come and combine to form a new court to judge on what they heard. A judge who two testified in front of, however, cannot combine with one of the witnesses that testified in front of him.
13. Each witness must testify on a complete matter. If, however, each testifies on a partial matter, it is meaningless. How so? If they are coming to testify on someone that he is an adult and one testifies that he saw a hair on the right side and the second one testifies that he saw it on the left side, it is of no effect because each witness only testified on a partial sign. Even if two witnesses testify on each hair it would be of no effect because each set only testified on a partial matter. If, however, a solo witness testified that he saw two hairs on the subject’s right side and another witness testified that he saw two hairs on the left side, we would combine the two. The same applies to anything similar.
14. With respect to testimony via knowledge but not actual observance, it will be explained in Siman 90 (6 and 16) that there are those that say that is a valid testimony. (In monetary cases there is no distinction between matters that will eventually become known and those that will not.) (Rabbeinu Yitzchak bar Sheshet)

<b>The Laws of Numerous Sets of Witnesses:</b> Paragraph 1- In a situation where two sets of witnesses contradict each other and one witness from each set comes and testifies on another matter, the testimony is not valid because it is certain that one of them is a false witness. If each set comes in its own, we can accept their testimony.
2. If a lender has two documents against a borrower- one of a maneh and one of 200, and the borrower denies both documents and one of these sets have signed on one of the documents and the second set has signed on the other, the borrower only pays a maneh and swears on the rest while holding on to a holy item if the documents were produced together. We then take away and tear the document of 200. If the lender only produces one document he may collect it. If he subsequently produces the second document, he can also collect that one. <i>(There are those that say that it is beneficial for him to burn the smaller document so that the borrower does not make the lender swear that he has two documents where these witnesses have signed on. If two lenders each produce a document against a borrower where each set has signed onto one of the documents- one set per document, and the borrower denies both of them, each lender may swear and collect. They must swear even if the fact that the lender is believed is included in the documents.)</i>
3. If one lender produces the documents at the same time against two borrowers, each borrower takes a heses oath and will be exempt. If one confesses, the lender may collect from unencumbered property. If the lender only produces one document, he may collect with it. He can then subsequently produce the second document and collect with it as well.
4. One who brings witnesses who are contradicted and then brings other witnesses who are also contradicted- even up to 100 sets- and he ultimately produces unimpeached witnesses, we may judge based on those last witnesses. With respect to a document, however, if two individuals come and say the lender asked us to forge the document, the lender can never collect with it even it its signatures are verified, unless the document’s witnesses themselves testify on what they wrote.

Siman 32

<b>Witnesses Who Witnessed a Confession Must Relate the Words As Is and a Case Where a Party Says He Was Kidding:</b> Paragraph 1- If Reuven says in front of witnesses that he owes Shimon a maneh, the witnesses should not testify simply that Reuven confessed in front of them that he owes Shimon a maneh. Rather, they should say the words exactly as is because it is possible that Reuven can exempt himself by saying he was kidding or that his intention was so as not to make himself look wealthy in the manner that will be explained in Siman 81. The court will be able to evaluate whether or not these claims would work for these words.
2. One who hires false witnesses in order to transfer a maneh from Reuven to Shimon is exempt under human law but liable under heavenly law. <i>RAMA: This only applies where he did not, in fact, owe him money. If, however, Reuven did owe Shimon money, but the witnesses happen to be false, he would be exempt even under heavenly law, but would violate “midvar sheker tirchak.” [Meaning, stay away from a lie]. The same applies if he did not hire them but simply convinced them to testify falsely (Tosefos). This all applies to a case where the individual hires false witnesses for a friend and the friend does not confess. If, however, he hired false witnesses for himself and illegally transferred money or if the plaintiff confesses, he is required to remove the stolen item from his friend’s hand (Beis Yosef). If he claims it was done properly, but the witnesses admit they testified falsely, they would be liable to pay, as was explained above in 29:2 and will be explained later in Siman 38.</i>

Siman 33

<b>Disqualified Testimony Due To Familial Relationship or a Woman or Slave, 18 Seifim:</b> Paragraph 1- Any individual who is disqualified from judging is also disqualified from testifying with the exception of one who likes or hates a litigant who is qualified to testify notwithstanding his disqualification from judging.
2- The following are the rules of disqualifications: Brothers, whether paternal or maternal, are first connections to first connections. Their children are second to second. Their grandchildren are third to third. A third with a first is always valid, and certainly a third with a second is valid. A second and a second, however, and certainly a second and a first, are disqualified. Therefore, a grandfather with his grandsons is disqualified because a father and son are a first and first just like a person with his brother. A great-grandfather with his great-grandson is valid because it is a third with a first. The same rule applies to females. How so? Two sisters or a brother and sister, whether paternal or maternal, are first and first. Their children, whether male or female, are second and second. Their grandsons and granddaughters are third and third. (Tur) There are those that says a third and first are disqualified <i>RAMA: and this is the appropriate ruling. There are those that say it is only a rabbinical disqualification, although the other disqualifications are biblical. The practical difference is in a case of witnesses to a marriage, as will be explained in Even Haezer Siman 42 (Mordechai). There are those that says that one’s mother’s relatives are also only rabbinically disqualified.</i>
3- You are disqualified to the husband of any woman you are disqualified from and you are disqualified to the wife of any man you are disqualified from because a woman is like her husband. According to the view that a third and first are disqualified, his wife would be valid because that is far-fetched. <i>(Nevertheless, if they are judging on a case where her husband will obtain a benefit from the ruling, he is disqualified from testifying for her because whatever a woman acquires is acquired by her husband.) (Mordechai)</i>
4- The husbands of two women who are disqualified from one another as a second and a second may testify for one another because we do not use the principle of a woman is like her husband twice in a case of second and second. <i>(However, they ideally should not sign together on a document)</i>. If, however, they were a first and a first, such as where one married a woman and the other married her daughter or where they married sisters, they cannot testify for one another because there we do use the principle of a woman is like her husband twice. We even use the principle of a woman is like her husband twice in a case of a first and a second in that just as he is disqualified from testifying for the son of his wife’s sister, so too is he disqualified from testifying for his wife’s sister’s daughter’s husband. He can, however, testify for the son of his wife’s sister’s husband that he had from another wife. There are those that say that we do not use the principle of a woman is like her husband twice in a case of a second and a first <i>(and it seems to me to rule this way).</i>
5- You may testify for the other relatives of a person that you cannot testify for because he is your relative’s husband, such as his sons and brothers. Similarly, you can testify for the other relatives of a woman you cannot testify for because she is your relative’s wife.
 6- The father of the groom and father of the bride may testify for one another. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that although they are valid for testimony, they are prohibited from judging because they are like those that like or hate a litigant. The litigant may say he does not accept him, even if he is an affixed judge (Hagahos Mordechai in the name of the Itur). It seems to me that his rulings are valid after the fact. (Mahari"k)</i>
7- Stepbrothers may testify for one another because they are not related at all.
8- A man with his wife is a first with a first. Therefore, he cannot testify for her son, son’s wife, daughter, daughter’s husband, father, mother, mother’s husband or father’s wife.
9- An arus is disqualified from testifying for his bride <i>(in the name of the Rambam). If, however, he testifies for her relatives, we would not disqualify the testimony. This is only with respect to actual erusin, but he would not be disqualified in the case of a mere engagement. However, if he plans to testify that she should obtain rights to money, he may have a stake in the matter. (Hagahos Ashiri)</i>
10- This, that we disqualify the testimony of relatives, is not because we assume they like each other as we see that they are disqualified to testify whether for or against the relative. Even Moshe and Aharon are disqualified from testifying for one another. Rather, it is simply a rule from the Torah.
11- Converts have no familial relationship with each other. Even twin convert brothers may testify for one another because a convert is like a newborn child.
12- If the wife of someone you cannot testify for because he is your relative’s husband died, you are no longer related and are a valid witness, even if she is survived by children. <i>RAMA: However, if the ruling was already given while he was still related, he cannot re-litigate with this testimony of the non-relative because once the ruling is given it is final. (Beis Yosef)</i>
13- If someone knew testimony for a party before he became his son-in-law and he then subsequently became his son-in-law, he is disqualified. Similarly, if he knew the testimony while he was a son-in-law and the party’s daughter then died, he is disqualified. If, however, he knew testimony before he became a son-in-law, then he became a son-in-law and then the party’s daughter died, he is a valid witness because the beginning and end were in a valid state, notwithstanding the disqualification in the interim.
14- If someone is dying and distributes his property in front of witnesses that he is related to but are not related to his children, the distribution is meaningless since they were related at the time the testimony was given over. There are those that say they are valid witnesses.
15- The concept of the beginning and end being in a valid state does not apply to a monetary disqualification. If the witness had a stake in the matter at the time he witnessed the incident because of a benefit he would obtain, he is able to remove himself from the matter in a way that he will no longer obtain a benefit and then he may testify.
16- Witnesses that are related to a cosigner are disqualified from testifying for the borrower, whether the borrower wanted to exempt himself by denying the loan and they will testify that he did borrow the money or if the borrower claims he paid back and they will testify that the borrower confessed that he did not pay back. <i>RAMA: The relatives of a murder victim can testify against the murderer. (Hagahos Ashiri; Mordechai). Similarly, the relatives of an assault victim can testify against the perpetrator to force him out of the synagogue or some other similar punishment because there is no gain for the victim in such a testimony.</i>
17- Witness that are related to each other or to the judges are disqualified.
18- If the public appoints witnesses and institutes that no testimony is valid without them, they may testify for their relatives since they were accepted. (See later 37:22). <i>RAMA: If, however, they appoint witnesses without specifying, the intention is not that they may testify for those they are otherwise disqualified from. Similarly, judges appointed in the city may not judge for their relatives (Rivash) and this is the custom.</i>

Siman 34

<b>Witnesses Disqualified Due to Sin. 35 Seifim:</b> Paragraph 1- A wicked person is disqualified from testifying. Even a valid witnesses that knows his colleague is wicked, but the judges are unaware, is prohibited from testifying with him, even though the testimony is accurate. All the more so in a case where a valid witness has testimony for a party and he knows that his co-witness is a false witness, is he prohibited from testifying with him.
2. Who is considered wicked? One who violates a prohibition that is deserving of lashes. All the more so in a case where he is deserving of court-prescribed death. It does not matter if he violated it out of desire or out of spite. If one violated a prohibition that is not deserving of lashes, he is rabbinically disqualified from testifying.
3. If the sin he violated was rabbinical, he is rabbinically disqualified. There are those that say that one is only disqualified for a rabbinical sin that was done because of desire of money.
4. Those that have a buried a body on the first day of Yom Tov are able to testify, even if a nidui was placed on them and they repeated the violation because they believe they are doing a mitzvah and the nidui was simply for atonement purposes. The same applies to any prohibition where we are able to say that he violated it out of error. See earlier Siman 24. One who lifts his hand to strike his friend is rabbinically disqualified from testifying.
5. One who violates an oath, whether it was an oath in vain, a false oath on a monetary matter or an oath of commitment, is disqualified from testifying, even if he merely violated a cherem that the public placed on him. There are those that say that he is only disqualified if he violated an oath he made regarding an event in the past because at the time of the oath it was a lie, but an oath for a matter in the future, such as I will or will not eat this item, would not disqualify him. If witnesses testify on someone that he violated his oath, he is not believed to say he is still valid because the violation was a mistake or was done under duress.
6. If a butcher produces a neveilah or treifah animal, he is disqualified from testifying. See Yoreh Deah Siman 119 where this matter is explained.
7. Thieves and robbers are disqualified from testifying from the time of the theft or robbery until they repent, even if they returned the item. See earlier Siman 29. One who divvies up with a thief is not disqualified from testifying. See later Siman 92 regarding at what point a guardian who denies receiving a deposit is disqualified.
8. A witness who was impeached, even on a monetary case where he reimbursed the party, is biblically disqualified from all testimonies. At what point is he disqualified? From the time he testified in court, notwithstanding the fact that he wasn’t impeached until a later date.
9. Witnesses on a document cannot be impeached unless they said in court that the document was written on its date and was not delayed. If, however, they did not say that, even if the document has a date of 1 Nissan in Jerusalem and witnesses testify that the document’s witnesses were with them in Babylon on the date of this document, the document and the witnesses are both valid because it is possible that they wrote it and postdated it. We say that when they were in Jerusalem on 1 Adar they wrote this document and postdated it for Nissan. If they said we wrote it on its date and they were impeached and there are witnesses that know the date they wrote the document or there were witnesses that saw the document on a certain date, their impeachment would disqualify them retroactively from the date that we know the document had been signed because signed witnesses are considered as if their testimony was investigated in court at the time of the signature. If, however, there were no witnesses that saw them sign or saw the document on an earlier date, the witnesses will only be disqualified from the time they testified in court that this is their handwriting and it was written on its date because it is possible that it was actually signed on the date it they testified in court and they had the document around for many years and they lied and said it was written on its date. Witnesses that deliberately signed on a predated document as disqualified from testifying.
10. One who lends with interest is disqualified from testifying. Both the lender and borrower are disqualified. If it was literal interest, they are biblically disqualified. If it was rabbinical interest, they are rabbinically disqualified. There are those that say the only the lender, and not the borrower, would be disqualified if lending with avak ribbis.
11. One who lends money of orphans out with interest, even literal interest, would not be disqualified from testifying because he thinks he is doing a mitzvah by having the orphan’s property turn a profit.
12. If a witness that signed on a document had died, and witnesses testify that the deceased would lend to other Jews with literal interest and it is well-known that he was a guardian or the agent of a gentile we assume that he lent the gentile’s money with interest. Similarly, if he was a guardian, we assume he lent the orphans’ money with interest. If, however, he did not have such a reputation, we do not make this assumption until it becomes clear to us. If witnesses testify on a person who is known as valid that he lent with interest, he would not be disqualified because we assume he lent in a manner that was not prohibited or that he erred and thought the manner he did it in was not prohibited.
13. One who violates rabbinical theft is rabbinically disqualified from testifying. How so? If he stole a found-item from one was who deaf, a fool or a minor or if he is a chamsan- one who takes land or movable items without the owner’s permission and pays for it. The same applies if he is a shepherd of his own animals- whether of small or large animals. He is disqualified because there is an assumption that he participates in theft and allows his animals to graze in the fields and gardens of others.
14. A tax-collector is assumed to be disqualified because we assume they take more than they are entitled by law of the land. The collectors of the king’s tax, however, is assumed to be valid. If it is known that he took more than he was entitled to- even just one time, he is disqualified. There are those that say that the definition of a tax-collector is one who collects a tax based on his decision-making with no affixed amount. Therefore, we presume it is invalid because we assume he plays favorites with some individuals and is difficult with others. Therefore, the city-appraisers who place a tax on the all the people in the city based on their estimation must be careful not to flatter one person while mistreating another and thereby disqualifying themselves from testifying and taking oaths.
15. A sharecropper that took a small amount of the early fruits in Nissan or Tishrei, prior to the conclusion of its work and some say for a fruit that’s work was finished, even without the knowledge of the owner, is not a thief and is able to testify because a field-owner is not strict about this. The same applies to anything similar.
16. Those that teach birds how to capture other birds from a nest in a populated area are disqualified from testifying because we assume they are stealing other’s birds. The same applies to those that sit idle and then grab fruits when shmitah comes and start participating in commerce because we assume they are doing business with fruits of shmitah. The same applies to those that that gamble with stones assuming they have no other trade because they are not participating with the settling of the world and have the status of those that eat from gambling, which is quasi-theft. This does not only apply to stones, but also to those that play with nut-shells and pomegranate shells. Similarly, this does not only apply to birds but even to those that play with domesticated animals, wild animals and any type of birds and say whoever’s comes first or defeats its opponent will receive double. The same applies to any similar game assuming he has no other trade other than this game, and he will be disqualified from testifying. These are all rabbinical disqualifications.
17. One who is not familiar with Chumash, Mishna or the ways of the worlds is in the category of wicked and is rabbinically disqualified from testifying. Therefore, we do not give or accept testimony from an ignoramus unless he is established as someone who participates in mitzvos and good deeds and goes in the straight path and is civilized, notwithstanding the fact that he is an ignoramus and is not familiar with Chumash or Mishna. In sum, any scholar is assumed to be valid until he is disqualified and any ignoramus is assumed to be invalid until he is established as someone who goes in the right path. Anyone who accepts the testimony of an ignoramus before he is established as going in the right path or before witnesses come and testify that he keeps the mitzvos and is civilized, is a fool and will have to answer for his actions in the future because he is destroying Jewish money based on the words of the wicked.
18. Low-lives are rabbinically disqualified from testifying. These are people who walk and eat in the market in front of everyone. People like this go naked in the market when they are working on a disgusting matter or something similar in that they do not have any shame and are considered like dogs and do not care about testifying falsely. Included in this are those that publicly accept charity from gentiles, even though it is possible for them to be supported privately. They degrade themselves and have no care. All of these are rabbinically disqualified. Anyone who accepts payment to testify has his testimony nullified just like someone who takes payment to judge as was explained above in 9:5. No formal announcement is required. The ruling and testimony are void automatically. If he returns the money, his ruling and testimony are valid because it is not like other disqualifications where a formal announcement and repentance are required. It is merely a fine that the rabbis instituted that any action he takes should be void if he accepts payment. This all applies to witnesses that already saw the incident and are obligated to testify just as a person is obligated to judge between two litigants. However, it is permitted for someone who is not required to testify to accept payment to go and see the future incident. If a judge already ruled and a party brings him a gift for advocating for him, he is prohibited from accepting the gift. Anything a person testifies because of fear of pain has no substance.
19. A gentile and slave are disqualified from testifying.
20. One who hates another and says publicly “I will go and hand over your money to the authorities” is disqualified from testifying.
21. A mamzer, a person with crushed testicles, a person with a cut-off penis and one who is uncircumcised because his bothers died from circumcision are all allowed to testify.
22. Snitches, heretics and mumarim are of a lower level than gentiles and are disqualified from testifying. A snitch cannot testify, even if the victim forgave him, until he repents. An apostate who agrees to repent is valid immediately even if he has not yet done it.
23. The testimony of one who is biblically disqualified is void even if they did not make a formal proclamation in the synagogues and study halls. If one who is rabbinically disqualified testified before a formal announcement, the testimony is valid. Even a biblical disqualification should only be used in a case where we are certain, but not in a case of doubt, such as where he testified in court and witnesses subsequently came and testified that he violated a sin that would biblically disqualify him but we are unsure whether he violated it before his testimony or after. In such a case, we keep the individual in his original status and anything that he testified on is valid until we know that he violated the sin before his testimony. If an individual required a formal announcement for a rabbinical disqualification and he received a public punishment for the sin, such as his removal from the synagogue, it is as if they made a formal announcement.
24. If they testified about someone that he violated a specific sin, even though he did not receive a warning and therefore does not receive lashes, that individual is disqualified from testifying. This is true where he violated a sin that all of the Jews know is a sin. If, however, they saw him commit a sin on something that is close to a mistake, they must warn him first and then disqualify him. How so? If they saw him tying or untying on Shabbos they must inform him that this is a desecration of Shabbos because most people don’t know this. Similarly, if they saw him doing work on Shabbos or Yom Tov, they must tell him that it is Shabbos because he may have forgotten. Similarly, one who consistently plays with stones or becomes a tax collector or a collector that adds for himself, the witnesses must inform him that anyone that does this is disqualified from testifying because most people don’t know these things. The same applies to anything similar.
25. A person cannot disqualify himself due to sin. Rather, witnesses must testify against him because a person cannot establish himself as wicked. Nevertheless, we would not make him a witness in the first instance as is discussed later in 92:5. Similarly, we do not disqualify based on a rumor or mere suspicion such as where someone is suspect in the area of immoral relations because he often secludes himself with forbidden relations and rumors have spread. Such a person is valid for all testimony with exception of testimony for a woman. For the laws of those that are suspected, see Yoreh Deah Siman 119.
26. If a borrower testified against a lender that he lent him with interest and the borrower has another witness join with him to disqualify the lender, although a person cannot establish himself as wicked, we can split his words and we believe him with respect to the lender but not with respect to himself. Similarly, if he testifies that so and so had sexual relations with him- even if consensual, or he testifies that so and so had sexual relations with his wife or animal, he and another person may join together and testify to disqualify him. The same applies with respect to a theft victim who may testify against the thief just like a borrower can testify against the lender, so long as he gets no gain out of his testimony.
27. There are those that say that where one takes an oath to contradict a solo witness, that witness and the party that was the recipient of the oath may join together to disqualify the person that took the oath. The same applies if he took an oath to two counterparties, and they can testify against him to disqualify him. There is no distinction whether he swore to both in one oath or one after the other. There are those that disagree and hold that even if there were two counterparties who each had their own witness, they would not be able to join together once he stood in judgement and he swore on the testimony. Prior to this, however, they are able to testify against him.
28. If two witnesses testify about a person that he is disqualified based on one of these sins and two others come and testify that the person repented or received lashes, the individual is valid. If, however, two come and contradict the witnesses and say he never committed this sin and is not disqualified, the disqualification is in doubt. Therefore, he may not testify. We would not transfer money on the basis of his testimony and he may not judge until it is known that he repented. Two witnesses that testified about a person that he is invalid, such as where one said he stole and the second said he lent with interest, may combine together to disqualify him.
29. Anyone who is liable to receive lashes, once he receives the lashes in court, he returns to his valid state. With respect to other witness disqualifications that are due to money that was taken or stolen, however, even if he paid back, he must repent. He would remain disqualified until it is know that he has repented from his evil ways. When do we know a person repented from lending with interest? Once they tore up their documents on their own and made a full repentance and agreed not to lend with interest- even to a gentile. He must return any interest he took to its owners. If he doesn’t know who he took it from, he must perform public needs. There are those that say that this only applies to one who often committed theft or robberies. With respect to someone who only committed theft or robbery on occasion, however, as soon as he returns what he stole, he has repented. This is only where he returned it on his own. If, however, he only returned it because the court forced him to, his return will not help until he repents.
30. When does repentance for those that play with rocks occur? Once they break their stones and perform a complete repentance and commit not to play- even without money.
31. When does repentance for those that train birds occur? Once they break the vessels they use to trap the birds and perform a complete repentance and commit not to do trap again- even in the desert. There are those that say that both in this case and in the case of playing with rocks, they must return the profits they made.
32. When does repentance for those that deal in shmitah fruits occur? Once shmitah occurs and they refrain. They cannot just repent with words. They must write, “I so and so the son of so and so, gathered 200 zuz of shmitah fruits and I am giving them away as a gift to the poor.”
33. When does repentance of one that committed a sin with an oath occur? Once he comes to a court that does not recognize him and says “I am suspect” or when he is obligated to take an oath in a court that does not recognize him for a significant sum of money and he chooses to pay and not take the oath.
34. With respect to repentance of a butcher who supervised himself and a sold a treifah, he must wear black, cover himself in black and go to a place that is unfamiliar with him and return a lost item of significant value or get rid of a trefiah in his possession of a significant value. See Yoreh Deah Siman 119.
35. The repentance of an impeached witness is to go to a place that is unfamiliar with him, and they give him a significant amount of money to testify falsely and he does not want to.

Siman 35

1. <b>The Disqualification of the Blind, Deaf, Foolish and Minors, 14 Seifim:</b> Paragraph 1- A minor is disqualified from testifying, even if he was smart and wise, until he brings two hairs following his 13th birthday. If a long time passed from this 13th birthday before they had a chance to check for hairs and when they checked they found two hairs, he has the status of adult from the time he turned 13. If he had a full beard he does not require checking.
Paragraph 2- If one reaches the age of 20, has not yet brought two hairs and shows signs of being sterile, he is an adult and may testify. If he does not show signs of being sterile, he may not testify until most of his lifetime has passed.
Paragraph 3- If one is 13 years old and brings two hairs but is not familiar with commerce, his testimony is invalid for matters regarding land. With respect to movable items, however, his testimony is valid.
Paragraph 4- If one knows testimony while he was a minor and testifies as an adult, the testimony is of no effect. There are some matters, however, that we may rely on the testimony of an adult regarding things he witnessed as a child. These are such matters: He is believed to say this is my father’s, teacher’s or brother’s handwriting. There are those that say that he is only believed regarding these individuals, but not for anyone else.
Paragraph 5- He is also believed to say I remember that they treated the wife of so-and-so with the custom of a virgin when she got married. He is also believed to say this place was a place where a grave was plowed over.
Paragraph 6- He is also believed to say, (even if he is a solo witness) (Tur), we would go until here on Shabbos because the laws of techumim are rabbinical (Hagahos Alfasi). (The same applies to other rabbinical prohibitions). He is also believed to say that so-and-so left school so he could dip and eat terumah in the evening, that he shared the terumah with us, that the witness personally would bring challah and other priestly gifts to so-and-so the Kohen or that the witness’s father said this family is kosher and this family is not (or that they made some kind of sign to inform others that one member of the family married someone who was disqualified) (Tur, as will be explained in Even Haezer Siman 2).
Paragraph 7- If a gentile or slave testified on any of the above cases after he converted or was freed, he is not believed.
Paragraph 8- One who is insane is disqualified from testifying. An insane person is not just someone who walks around naked, breaks vessels and throws stones, (rather) it is anyone who goes out of his mind and his senses are consistently lacking on any matter, even though he can speak and act appropriately on other matters. Such a person is disqualified from testifying and is included in the category of the insane.
Paragraph 9- הנכפה <i>(One who often collapses from a disease that drives him out of his mind), is disqualified from testifying while collapsed, but is valid while healthy. This is true whether he collapses from time to time or consistently collapses without any set time, so long as his senses are not always distorted because there are those that often collapse and are out of their mind even while healthy. We must extensively evaluate the testimony of one who collapses often.</i>
Paragraph 10- Those that are very foolish and cannot recognize contradictory matters and do not understand topics that the rest of society does, and similarly those that frighten quickly and go out of their mind or are exceedingly crazy, are all included in the category of the insane. This topic is something that is dependent on the perception of the judge because it is impossible to explain these rules perfectly in writing.
Paragraph 11- A deaf person is disqualified from testifying, whether he can speak but not hear or hear but not speak, even if he is sane, because he needs to testify in court with his mouth and be able to hear the words of the judges and the intimidation they place on him. Similarly, if he became mute- even if he can be checked in the same fashion we check when it comes to divorce and we can see that his testimony matches up- and he testifies in front of us in writing, it is not valid testimony in any case with the exception of testimony for a woman because we are lenient when it comes to avoiding the chaining of a woman to a marriage.
Paragraph 12- One who is blind in both eyes is disqualified from testifying, even if he recognizes voices and people and his testimony matches up.
Paragraph 13- If one was deaf, insane or blind at the time he received the testimony, and was healthy at the time he testified- or vice-versa- he is disqualified. If, however, he was healthy at the time he received the testimony and at the time he testified, he is valid, even if he became deaf, insane or blind in the interim since he was valid at the beginning and at the end.
Paragraph 14- A woman is disqualified from testifying. One who was born without genitalia and a hermaphrodite are disqualified out of doubt. Anyone whose validity is in doubt, is disqualified from testifying. <i>RAMA: All of these disqualified individuals are disqualified even in a place where there are not a lot of valid witnesses (Rashba and the Rambam and the Beis Yosef). This is all strict law, but there are those that say that there is an ancient regulation that in a place where there are not a lot of men, such as a synagogue for women or some other temporary place that has lots of women, but not men, such as testifying that so-and-so woman wore these clothing and they belong to her and men don’t pay attention to these matters, women are believed. Therefore, there are those that write even a solo woman, a relative or a minor are believed when it comes to the assault and degradation of a scholar or other cases of quarrel and snitching because it is not standard practice nor there is enough time to call valid witnesses (Mahar"ik, Mahar"am m'Rezburg and the Kol Bo). This is all where the plaintiff claims that he is certain in his claim. (Mahar"ik, and see above Siman 28 Seif 15 and in the Rama there).</i> 

Siman 36

<b>Many Testified and One Was Discovered To Be a Relative or Disqualified, 2 Seifim:</b> Paragraph 1- If there were numerous witnesses and one was discovered to be a relative or otherwise disqualified, the entire testimony is void. When is this true? In a situation where they all intended to testify. If, however, they did not all intend to testify, the testimony can be sustained with the remaining witnesses. How do we investigate the matter? The court would ask them if when they saw the incident they were there with the intention to witness or merely to see the incident. The court would separate anyone who says they came to testify. If a relative or someone otherwise disqualified is found among those that intended to testify, their testimony is void (even if they were not aware of each other). If all of the witnesses were valid- both those that intended to testify and those that did not but happened to see- and their testimony conforms, we would rule based on their testimony. <i>RAMA:  They are not, however, able to write a document regarding the incident even if they witnessed a kinyan and the presumption of a kinyan is that it should be writing, because the party did not call them for that purpose. (Teshuvos HaRashba) (and see above Siman 39, Seif 5)</i> There are those that say that even if they intended to see in order to witnesses they would not be disqualified unless they came to court and actually testified because two elements are required: intention to see for the sake of testifying and actually coming to court and testifying. <i>RAMA: If a document contains the signature of a disqualified witness, thereby voiding the entire testimony, the valid witnesses may still testify by themselves in front of the court if they are reminded of the testimony by viewing the document. The court would then document their testimony and it would be considered a formal document (Rosh). A public regulation that has the signature of a disqualified witness or a document that contains the signature of a party, is still valid with other witnesses because these individuals did not have the intention of testifying. (Rivash) (See later 45:12-13). If the plaintiff called valid witnesses and relatives or those otherwise disqualified were standing there, the testimony of the valid witnesses would not be disqualified even if the disqualified witnesses had the intention to testify and actually testified. Similarly, when a party is in need of testimony and puts a cherem on those that know testimony to come and testify and both valid and disqualified witnesses testify, the testimony of the valid witnesses would not be void because the party’s intention was only for those that are capable of testifying.</i>
2. If a relative testified with a non-relative and the non-relative is unaware that the other witness is related, (Tur in the name of the R"if) there are those that say that the testimony of the non-relative is valid and would require the party to take an oath. The witness is believed to say he is unaware of this fellow witness’ relationship so long as he is not often together with him. If, however, the non-relative is often together with the relative, he is not believed. There are those that disagree with this and say that the testimony of the non-relative is void, even if he was unaware of the relationship of the other witness <i>(since the disqualified witness testified with him in court). (Tur)</i>

Siman 37

<b>Disqualification Due To a Potential Benefit, 22 Seifim:</b>1. A person is disqualified from any testimony in which he gains some kind of benefit by testifying. Therefore, if two people are partners in land and a third party attempts to remove the land from one of the partners by claiming that the individual who sold the land to them had originally stolen it from him, the other partner may not testify on behalf of his partner to disqualify the plaintiff’s witnesses. His testimony would not even help for his partner’s portion unless he removed himself from the field and they made a kinyan to give his portion to this partner. If the kinyan was not done until after the third party comes, it would still be valid. The testifying partner must accept that if his creditor were to come and collect from the partner that he would pay the partner the value of the taken land. He should make a condition that if a third party were to come to claim the land based on other claims, such as saying it was stolen from him or something similar, then he would not indemnify his partner. If, however, the plaintiff is only making a claim on partner’s share, such as a claim that the partner sold it to him, then he may testify because he has no stake in the testimony at all. 
2. If one makes a complaint in connection with a field that grows fruits, the sharecropper cannot testify because the sharecropper wants the field to remain in the hands of the current owner so that he could take his share of the fruits. If the field has no fruits he may testify assuming he gains no other benefit from the testimony. (Tur)
3. If witnesses admitted that they had a portion of a debt they had already testified on, the admission is of no effect. (If, however, they admitted to it before the testimony, the testimony is void). (Beis Yosef).
4. If Reuven calls two defendants claiming that he lent to them, and one the defendants denied the loan while the other confessed that both he and his co-defendant are liable, the one who confessed is not believed regarding his co-defendant if they accepted the money as partners. The party who confessed will be liable for the entire amount. 
5. If one produces a loan document against three defendants and they all claim they have already paid it back, if each one owed 10 gold coins individually and the co-defendants had no partnership in it, each one’s testimony may be used for his co-defendants.
6. If one of the partners makes a claim that negatively affects him and his partner, he has the believability of a solo witness and will obligate his partner to take an oath or will exempt the counterparty from taking an oath. If both partners testified to their detriment, they are believed regarding their other partners. (See later 77:5). 
7. There is no issue with selling a loan to one of the witnesses. (See later 123:11-12 regarding whether an inheritor and his relative may testify). 
8. Pashranim (mediators), judges and guardians are allowed to testify. (See above Siman 23 regarding the laws of judges and pashranim, as well as later 46:24. For the laws of guardians see later Siman 290).
9. Hekdesh-treasurers are able to testify as long as neither them nor their relatives have any right to the hekdesh properties or their fruits. <i>RAMA: All the more so are the treasurers’ relatives allowed to testify, notwithstanding the fact that the treasurer may hand out the money as he sees fit, according to the opinion that a kickback is not considered money. Although the treasurer may subsequently distribute the money to his poor relatives we would not void the testimony because there was no recognizable benefit at the time of the testimony. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ritva)</i>
10. Testimony is valid in a situation where in his current state the witness gains no benefit from his testimony but if he were to become rich then he would gain benefit.
11. If Reuven has a loan document out against Shimon, and Reuven gave it over to Levi via handing it over and writing down the gift, and Shimon was one of the witnesses on the gift, Shimon is disqualified. (See later 66:21-22 regarding whether one of the signed witnesses who buys the loan is considered as having a stake in the matter). 
12. If a renter has the rent in his hands and says 'whomever this land belongs to should come and collect the rent', the renter may testify for the individual who rented it to him. Once the renter has already given the rent to the owner, he can no longer testify for the owner because if land were to be given to the complainant, the renter would need to pay another rental. If the owner returns the rent money to the renter so that he can pay whomever wins the case, the renter may then testify for him. <i>RAMA: This is all in a case where there are witnesses that the renter lived in the house. If, however, there are no such witnesses, the renter is believed in all cases because he has a migu that he could have remained silent. (Mordechai)</i> [Note: A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the litigant could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie. To be effective, the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid].
13. If a complaint is brought against a borrower to remove land in his possession and the borrower does not have other land in his possession that is the value of the debt, the lender and co-signer cannot testify to keep the land in the borrower’s possession. If the borrower does have other land in his possession equal to the value of the land, the lender and co-signer may testify for him. <i>There are those that say that a co-signer who is a kablan (contractor) cannot testify in any situation. (Tur)</i>
14. An original buyer may testify for a subsequent buyer of the same seller to keep the second property in the subsequent buyer’s hands so long as the seller has another unencumbered field equal to the value of the field of the original buyer or the second buyer has another field that he purchased from the seller. <i>RAMA: Similarly, the second buyer cannot testify for the original buyer unless the seller had land equal to the value of the original purchase. (Tur)</i>
15. If Reuven sold Shimon an unsecured field and Yehuda brings a claim against Shimon to remove the field from his possession, Reuven may not testify for Shimon even though the field was unsecured because Reuven wants the land to stay in Shimon’s possession so that Reuven’s creditor may collect a debt and Reuven will not be considered a “wicked borrower who does not pay back.” <i>This is only applies where Yehuda’s claim is via the seller. If, however, the claim is via the buyer in that Yehuda says that Shimon owes him money, then Reuven may testify for Shimon. (Tur)</i>
16. If Reuven sold an unsecured cow or garment to Shimon and Yehuda brings a claim against Shimon to remove the item from his possessions on the basis that Reuven obtained it from a thief, Reuven may testify for Shimon because he gets no benefit if the item remains in the hands of Shimon since Reuven’s creditor may not collect moveable items (even if they were designated as the method of collection). In modern times, even if the borrower were to place a lien on moveable items together with real property, the lender would still not be able to collect from the moveable items that were sold. <i>RAMA: If, however, Yehuda claims that Reuven himself stole the property, then Reuven would not be able to testify if it is a situation where Yehuda would need to pay Shimon because of the regulation instituted for commerce purposes and Yehuda would then be able to go and collect the money from Shimon. (Tur)</i>
17.  If Reuven stole a garment or field from Shimon, and Yehuda brought a claim against Reuven saying that this field or garment is his, Shimon would not be able to testify that this is not Yehuda’s field or garment because Shimon just wants the field or garment to remain in Reuven’s possession because it might be easier to remove it from Reuven’s possession than it would be to remove it from Yehuda’s possession. Similarly, if Reuven sold or bequeathed the stolen field to Levi and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon cannot testify that it does not belong to Yehuda. If Shimon sold the stolen garment to Levi, Shimon gave up on reclaiming it and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon may testify that it is not Yehuda’s if Reuven had died because this garment will never go back to Shimon since the buyer already acquired it with the giving up of hope and the transfer of possession and Reuven the thief had died, so there is no one to collect the money from. If, however, Reuven was still alive, Shimon may not even testify on the garment because there is a benefit to him for the garment not to go to Yehuda so that he can bring a proof that Reuven stole it and Reuven will have to pay. Similarly, if the garment was in the possession of Reuven’s inheritors, Shimon may not testify because it will eventually go back to Shimon if the inheritors can maintain possession. The same applies to anything similar. Even in a case where Reuven died, Shimon may only testify if the sale was unsecured. If, however, the sale was secured, Reuven’s estate would be liable and thus Shimon has a stake in the testimony. Now that the rabbis have instituted that a creditor may even collect from a moveable item, a victim of theft may not even testify in a case where the thief died and the sale was unsecured because the victim still has a stake in the testimony. <i>RAMA: This all applies only where Shimon wants to testify that the field or garment does not belong to Yehuda. If, however, he wants to testify that it belongs to Reuven, he may testify in every case because once he confesses that it belongs to Reuven he can no longer bring a claim that it is his. Thus, he does not have a stake in the testimony. (Tur)</i>
18. If a person brings a claim on a bathhouse or city street against the citizens of city, a citizen of the city cannot testify or judge until he removes himself with a complete kinyan. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that is impossible to remove one’s self from an item which is a public good (Tur; Rambam) unless they have another similar item. (Rosh) This is the primary ruling.</i>
19. If a city had its Torah stolen, since the Torah is intended for listening purposes, which a person cannot possibly remove himself from, we would not use the city’s judges nor would we bring a proof from the people of that city. The same applies to anything similar. <i>RAMA: See above 7:12 which states that if the city has another Torah, it would be permitted. The same applies to anything similar, such as a synagogue or other books or something similar, in which case the judges of that city may rule on the case.</i>
20. If one says give money to the poor people of my city, we cannot use the judges of that city nor can we bring a proof from the people of that city. When is this true? When the poor people rely on the city and the city distributes charity to them. Even if two people from that city were to say we will give the set amount and we will testify, we would not listen to them because there is still a benefit to them for these poor people to become wealthier since they rely on the people of the city. The same applies to anything similar. (See above Siman 7 for the laws of taxes in a city).
21. These matters are dependent on the perception of the judges and the depth of their understanding. They must understand the primary rules, know the consequences of each matter and dig deeply to see if this witness gains any benefit from this testimony. The witness may not testify nor may he be a judge, even if it is an incredibly distant benefit.  
22. Today we have the custom to accept witnesses from the public regarding their institutions, agreements, consecrations and any other topics. They are even valid for their own relatives because they accepted them. <i>RAMA: We do not use the principle of two is like 100 on any matter which is dependent on the city custom. Rather, we follow the majority. The same applies to anything similar where we do not need literal witnesses. Similarly, we do not use the principle of “we did not see is not a proof.” Rather, not seeing is in fact a proof. (Mahari"k) With respect to living status or something similar in connection with the needs of the city, we can even judge via distant hearsay because the entire public has a stake in the testimony anyway. (Teshuvos Maimoni) See later Siman 156 and 163 regarding these laws. City activists who were appointed to deal with public or private needs have the status of judges and we cannot appoint one who is disqualified from judging due to wickedness.</i>

Siman 38

<b> Some of the Laws of Impeachment:</b> 1- If two witnesses testified about an individual that he owed so and so a maneh and two others come and contradict or impeach the witnesses, the alleged borrower is exempt. If witnesses testified in court that one owed his adversary a maneh and they later said they testified falsely, their original testimony stands because once they testify they cannot re-testify. They are, however, believed with respect to themselves and they must pay whatever loss they caused the defendant. <i>RAMA: The Mechaber summarized in an area where he should have discussed at length. Although we do not judge the laws of impeached witnesses today because it is a fine, there is still a practical importance to the laws in that an impeached witness can no longer testify as was explained above in Siman 34, whereas witnesses who were merely contradicted are valid witnesses as was explained above in Siman 31. Thus, the author of the Tur wrote a significant amount of rules regarding impeached witnesses and anyone who wants to study them should look there.</i>

Siman 39

<b>Writing a document for the borrower without the lender, and on which admissions we write, 17 Seifim:</b>  When someone lends money to another before witnesses, or someone admits before witnesses that he owes another money, this is called a verbal loan, and the lender cannot [unilaterally] collect from the borrower's real estate. When someone lends another money with a written deed, he may collect from the borrower's real estate, even if the deed does not specifically mention a lien, since we rule that [omission of mention of] a lien is considered to have been a mistake on the part of the writer of the deed. If there are witnesses that the loan was effected with a "kinyan sudar", then even without a deed the lender may collect from the borrower's real estate. <i>RAMA: See later, chapter 61 Paragraphs 2 and 10 for the definition of a deed. And see later at the beginning of chapter 225 for the laws of [omission of mention of] a lien being considered an error of the scribe.</i>
2. When someone lends to another before witnesses, they do not write down their testimony to give to the lender, so that the lender should not revert the written loan to a verbal loan [and claim on both], unless the borrower instructs them: "Write him a deed, sign it and give it to him." Even if he says this to them, they should still double-check with him after they have signed the deed, and only then do they give it to the lender. There are also those who rule that the witnesses do not have to double-check with him.
3. The above refers to a case where [the loan was effected] without a kinyan sudar. But the borrower used a kinyan sudar to obligate himself a maneh to the lender, [the witnesses] write a deed and give it to the lender even without an explicit instruction from the borrower, because it is assumed that a kinyan will be written down. Even if much time has passed before the lender approaches the witnesses and asks them to write him a deed, they may write it and give it to him, and they do not need to worry that the borrower has already repaid the debt, as long as they specifically note the time of the kinyan, or write, "We delayed in writing this document." Even if the borrower dies before writing the deed, and even if the due date of the debt has passed, they may write the deed after his death. Similarly if the lender died and his heirs come to the witnesses to write a deed for them, they may write it. There are those who differ and say that if this happens after 30 days [for a debt with no specified due date], they should not write a deed, and if there is a due date specified, they should not write a deed after that date, lest the borrower has already repaid. <i>RAMA: If the borrower did not give explicit instructions to write and hand over a deed to the lender, but the witnesses did so anyway, it is worth no more than a ledger entry (Teshuvas Rashb"a 1:211). Nonetheless, some say that if the deed was written, it is admissible evidence. See above, chapter 46, paragraph 10. This that we require explicit instructions from the borrower only applies when he is obligating himself in a debt, but if he is forgiving a debt owed to him, or releasing someone of the obligation to pay him, there is no need for this. See later, chapter 81, paragraph 29.</i>

Siman 40

1. <b> The Law of One Who Obligates Himself to His Friend, 2 Seifim:</b> If one unconditionally obligated himself monetarily to another, he is required to pay, even if he was not otherwise obligated. How so? If one tells witnesses “you are witnesses that I owe so and so a maneh,”;  if there are no witnesses but he writes in a document “I owe you a maneh”; or if he does not say “you are witnesses” but says in front of witnesses “I owe you a maneh via a document”- since he said the term “document” it is as if he said you should be witnesses for me- in all such cases he is required to pay even if both parties admit, and the witnesses are aware, that he did not in fact owe the other anything, because he has obligated himself in the same fashion a co-signer can obligate himself. <i>All the more so in a case where one writes “I accepted such and such sum of money from you with respect to the debt you owed me” would he waive his right to the loan even though we know he did not in fact accept any money. (Beis Yosef, Seif 73, in the name of the Ritvah)</i>
2. If a borrower writes a document in his own handwriting with witnesses testifying on it and he hands it over to the lender, the document has the status of a formal, valid document. Similarly, if the borrower wrote the document without witnesses, but handed it over to the lender in front of witnesses, the loan is considered a documented loan so long as his handwriting is not forgeable and the witnesses who witnessed the handing over of the document read the document. There are those of the Geonim who rule that the borrower must tell the witnesses who witnessed the handing over to sign and testify that it was handed over in front of you.

Siman 41

1. <b> The Laws of One Who Lost His Loan Document or Had It Erased, 4 Seifim:</b> If a lender’s loan document is deteriorating and will ultimately be erased, he may arrange for witnesses and go to a court who will verify the document. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that even if the document was completely erased the witnesses may testify since they know what is written in it. (Tur, in the name of the Rambam [the Rashbam] and Nikutei Yosef, Get Pashut). Witnesses testifying on a document may testify even if not in the presence of the parties. (Rabbeinu Yerucham in the name of the Rashbah).</i> The witnesses on the document themselves, however, may not write another document for the lender. They may, however, come to court and the court will verify the document. How do they verify this document? They draft another document that says, “we, the court of so and so, so and so and so and so, had produced in front of us by so and so a document that was erased and had such and such date with so and so and so and so as witnesses.” If the court wrote that they processed the witnesses’ testimony and the testimony conformed, the lender can collect with this document that they wrote for him and he would not need any other verification. If the court did not write this language, the lender would need to bring an additional proof on the original witnesses until their testimony is verified. (Until here is the opinion of the Rambam)<i>RAMA: If the witnesses are not verified, it is as if the lender produced an unverified document.(HaMagid, Chapter 23).</i> There are those that say that it must state in the verification that they tore up the original document because otherwise we are concerned that the lender will go to another court who will process another verification for him and then he can collect and recollect. With respect to a gift document that was erased, however, we would write another document even though the first has not been torn up. <i>RAMA: We would use the original date and not the date the court is writing the new document on (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosefos)</i>. In a case where the gift was secured or in a case of a transaction document, however, the court must tear up the original document or write in the second document that this document is not intended to allow for collection from properties sold to a third party or to collect from unsold properties, but simply to enable this particular field to remain in the hand of the gift-recipient or the buyer and prevent the gift-giver or seller from reclaiming it.
2. If one had his loan document erased, he may arrange for witnesses who will come to court and verify the document. This is only where there are witnesses that it was erased accidentally. If, however, the lender deliberately erased the document or he left the document in an unsafe place where it was erased, they would not verify the document for him because the fact that he left it in an unsafe place indicates that it was certainly paid back.
3. If one had a document and misplaced it and comes to court to have the document replaced, we would not write it, even if he brought the witnesses from the original document who testify that they wrote the document and gave it to him. Therefore, a court should not duplicate any document unless they see a particular need for it such as the case of an erased document. If the court wrote the outline of a document for someone and that person comes to court with it, the court would not collect based on that document until he produces the substance of the document unless there was a written reason as to why they made another document, such as because the previous document was erased or something similar and the witnesses knew the document was lost. If, however, the witnesses did not know it was lost, they would not write another document for him. Even if there are witnesses that a document was misplaced, we would not write another document because we are concerned the lender will find it unless there are witnesses testifying that the document was burnt. <i>RAMA: This is only true with regards to loan documents. With respect to unsecured transactional documents, however, we would write another document if the original was lost. We do not, however, duplicate a document for no purpose (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 68, Seif 16, 21, 23, 24). In the case of a will that contains gifts to many, where one person comes to court and asks that they document his particular gift, we would write it for him because such a document would not work to collect money with because it is not a formal document and the orphans can claim they paid it back (Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and Teshuvos HaRamban, Siman 83)</i>. We would, however, write a new document if the original document was in the hands of a third party who misplaced it because there is no concern the lender may find it considering it was not in his possession (<i>Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and see below 253 and see there Seif 2</i>). If the borrower was overseas, and the lender is concerned taking the document because he is afraid he may lose it on the road, he may come to court who will write another document and the lender will leave the original document in the court in his city. The court in the borrower’s city would inform the court in the lender’s city once the loan has been paid back and the court would tear up the original document in their possession.  If the duplicate document was misplaced while he was traveling to the borrower and witnesses are aware of the loss, they would go in front of court and testify that it was misplaced and they would return the document in their possession. <i>RAMA: (Tur) Any document that is duplicated is written letter for letter from the original. They would write on it that it is a duplicate. A court is not required for the duplication. Even two witnesses are able to duplicate (and even if they are related to one another). (Rivash, Siman 413) (This is a hosafah from the Sm"a and it is not correct what is written in Siman 100, 18)</i>
4. If one had a documented debt owed by his counterparty and he lost the document but the witnesses are accessible, and the borrower claims he paid back, the borrower would be believed with a heses oath even if a kinyan was made. The borrower is believed with a heses oath to say he paid back even if the payment deadline had not passed because the lender no longer possesses the document and we are concerned that the borrower paid back, which is why the document was ripped up or burnt. Even if a third party produced the document and the borrower claims he had dropped it after paying back the loan, he would be believed with a heses oath and would be exempt from paying, even if  the deadline for payment had not yet passed, because once the lender no longer has the document we do not apply the principle that a person does not pay back before the deadline. If, however, the lender gave the document as a deposit to a third party, and the guardian is the one that produces the document, the borrower is not believed to say he paid back and the document fell from him and the third party found it, even if the guardianship was not done in front of witnesses. <i>RAMA: If one has documents in a city that was conquered, we can assume they were lost and we would write another document. Even if the borrower were to strongly protest we would not concern ourselves. (Maharik, Shoresh 116).</i>
5. One who obligates himself to his fellow through a document and the document is lost, the witnesses are believed even though they acquired from him. If the claim the debt is paid off, this is a Heses oath. And even if the payment deadline had passed and the time for payment (or redemption) has not arrived....

Siman 42

1. <b> One Can Write a Document In Any Language and the Laws of an Unspecified Coin, 15 Seifim:</b> We do not write a loan document on something that is forgeable. If they wrote the document on it, the document is invalid, even with respect to an immediate collection. <i>This is only true with respect to a loan document. With respect to a kinyan document, however, it would be valid (R"an Perek 2 Gittin). Any document that is not made as the Rabbis instituted is invalid, even if there is no rationale to invalidate it. Therefore, if one were to make a tied-up document today it would be invalid. (Nimukei Yosef according to the opinion of the Rosh). There are those that disagree and we rule like those opinions. (Ramban and many other Poskim) (See later 44:1). </i>
2. A document can be written in any language and any script so long as the scribe is careful that there is no modification in that text.
3. The appropriate way to draft a document is to pay attention to the vov’s and zayin’s so that they are not stuffed between words lest a party forge the document and add a vav or zayin. The letters should not be far apart from one another lest a party erase one letter like a hey or ches and leave the leg in place of a vov. One must be careful with anything similar in any other language and any other script (Tur). Therefore, a scribe must be careful when writing a document to have the letters looks similar to each other and the writing should be straight and equal in all aspects so that the letters are not too far apart from each other. The scribe should not press the writing together too much nor should he press in one area and give space in another area. Therefore, witnesses are not permitted to sign until they investigate all the words of the document well and when the document is produced in front of the judge, the judge must investigate all the words and compare each letter. If the judges sees any aberration, the party may not collect with it until (the judge) investigates the matter well. (Any issue which can be explained by an erasure, is attributed to an erasure) (Nimukei Yosef). If the judge needs to strike the document-holder to get him to confess, he may to do so in order to have the true ruling emerge. There are those that say that this only applies where we are coming to take money from inheritors or buyers in which case we rule that we may set forth claims on behalf of them. If, however, the court is taking money from a borrower, seller or gift-giver directly and the defendant does not claim that there is anything wrong with the document, we would not make the claim for him.
4. The scribe must be careful not to write any number from “shalosh” to “eser” at the end of the line, lest a party turn ten into twenty or three into 30. <i> RAMA: If the scribe wrote “shlosha” or “asara” that is fine because there is no concern of forgery. (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosefos and others)</i> If the number ends up on the last line, the scribe must repeat the matter a few times until it occurs in the middle of line. Similarly, the scribe must be careful not to write it number form, such as “beis” or “daled” so that party does not turn it into a “chaf” or “reish.” <i>RAMA: If the scribe does not follow this, the document is forgeable and invalid. If, however, he wrote gematriot (i.e. math equations) or acronyms where forgery is impossible, the document is valid. (Hagahot Mordechai, Gittin)</i>
5. If the top of the document says one thing and the bottom says something else and it is possible to maintain both points, we would maintain them. If, however, they contradict each other, such as where the top says a maneh and the bottom says 200 or vice-versa, we follow the bottom so long as it is not the last line in a case where the document does not conclude with “everything is affirmed and verified.” <i>RAMA: With respect to taking away from the document-owner, however, we would make a deduction from the last line. (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ritva and the Rama). If the sum at the bottom was deleted, the whole document is invalid because it is possible that the bottom said only one dinar. (Hagahos Ashiri).</i> There are those that say if the top was counting out the amounts and the bottom contained the sum which was less or more than the top, we would say they certainly erred in the calculation and we would follow the listed out numbers. This view appears correct. When is it true that we follow the bottom? Where one amount is not dependent on the other. If, however, the document says “100, which is 200” or “200, which is 100” the document-owner would only be able to collect 100- the lower of the two- because the document-owner is in the inferior position.
6. If a letter from the bottom was erased but it was possible to deduce what was missing based on what was on top, we would make the deduction from the top. For example, if the top said a party owed Chanani and the bottom said Chanan the bottom would learn from the top and the party would pay Chanani. If, however, there were two letters missing, we would not make the deduction. For example, if the top said Chanani and the bottom said Chen- even if the top word had six letters and only two were missing from the bottom – we would not make the deduction. Given that we do not make the deduction and we know the document was erased, the document is now disqualified and one cannot collect with it. With respect to one letter, however, we would make the deduction, even if the top word only had two letters and we are using it to deduce half a word. If something was missing but there was no erasure, and the top said Chanani and the bottom said Chen, that is certainly a retraction because a scribe would not err on two letters, and the party must pay Chen.
7. If the top said the measurement of safel (1.5 seah) and the bottom said the measurement of kafel (1.5 kav), we would follow the bottom because a kafel is less than a safel. If the top said kafel and the bottom said safel, we are concerned that a fly caused the leg of the kuf to turn into a samach and the party can only collect a kafel. The same applies to anything similar because the document-owner is in the inferior position.
8. In all the above cases where we say the document-owner is in the inferior position, if the document-owner were to take possession of his adversary’s moveable items, we would not take it away from him. <i>RAMA: All the more so would we say that when it comes to possession of a receipt, the document-owner has the superior position because he is already the possessor, (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ra'ah) and not like those that disagree and say that even by a receipt we use the principle of the document-holder being in the inferior position. (There, in the name of the Ritva his student).</i>
9. We do not use the principle of the document-owner being in the inferior position except in the aforementioned cases where the document has not been completely voided. If, however, the issue is one that voids the document, the principle would not apply. For example, if the document says so and so owes so and so a maneh by Pesach, the borrower must pay him by the first Pesach and he cannot say I will pay him by Pesach in years from now. The same applies to anything similar. <i>RAMA: There are those that say this is only for matters that can be attributed to a mistake. With respect to a matter that the giver erred on, however, such as where he used a language for a gift that is of no effect, the document is certainly void.(Teshuvos HaRashba; Maharik, Shoresh 94).</i>
10. There are many commentators that write that today where we have the custom to write “this document is not an asmachta and not an outline,” we would say the document-owner is in the superior position for any doubt arising out of the language of the document. <i>RAMA: If language is included in a document to bolster the document-owner’s status and is understood by the average listener this way, we would judge accordingly, even though it is bolstering the document-owner’s status. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Teshuvos HaRashba)</i>
11. If a document says so and so owes so and so such and such amount of such and such currency and the amount was erased and unrecognizable, the lender may only collect two of that currency.
12. If a document says “selaim,” and the lender says it was five while the borrower claims it was two, the borrower must pay the two and take a heses oath on the rest. If the lender were to grab the difference, we would take it back from him.
13. If a document says so and so borrowed from so and so silver, the borrower would need to give a minimal piece of silver of the lightest weight. If the document says silver currency and silver perutos were used in that locale, the borrower must give one perutah. If silver perutos are not used in that locale, the borrower would give the smallest amount of silver currency that is used there. If the document says dinarim of silver, the borrower would give silver that is worth two dinar of gold. If the document says gold in dinar, the borrower would give gold worth two gold dinar. If the document says silver in dinar, the borrower would give pieces of silver worth two silver dinar. If the document says gold, the borrower would give a piece of gold that is the lowest weight of gold. If the document says gold currency, the borrower would give the smallest amount of gold currency that is used. If the document says gold dinarim or dinar of gold, the borrower would give two gold dinar. If the document says gold in dinarim, the borrower would give gold that is worth two dinars of silver. (<i>In today’s age there is no distinction between saying “dinarin” or “dinari.”) (Magid, end of Melaveh)(And it seems to me that we give him the lesser one)</i>
14. If one produces a document against another with a sum of 110 dinar or selaim (<i>and the currency is undefined - Tur</i>) and it was written in Bavel, the lender would collect Babylonian currency. If it was written in Israel, the lender would collect Israeli currency. If no location is written in the document and the lender produced the document in Bavel, he would collect Babylonian currency. If the lender produced the document in Israel, he would collect Israeli currency. If the lender attempts to collect the currency where he produced the document and the borrower claims he owes him silver that is worth less than this currency, the lender would take an oath and collect. <i>RAMA: If, however, the borrower proves that they originally lived in a place with a less valuable currency, he only has to give the lesser currency. (R"an end of Ketuvot)</i> If the document says 100 silver but does not say if it is selaim or pundyon, the lender would collect whatever the borrower desires.
15. If the document simply says an amount, we would follow the custom that they typically use in that locale. For example, there was a document that said 600 and zuzim and it was unclear whether it was 600 istira and a zuz or 600 zuz and a zuz, we rule that the borrower gives 600 istirii, which is less. We would not, however, entertain that it was 600 perutos because people don’t include a sum total of perutos in a document. We follow any language that is often in used documents, even if it was not an institution of the Rabbis but a language that the common-folk use in that locale. Even if the language was not written, we would judge the case as if it was. <i>RAMA: The same applies for any institution by the community or any city custom. (Rambam, Ishot Perek 23) If one raises an orphan in his home and writes “my son” in a document or the orphan writes about the individual that raised him “my father” or “my mother,” it is not considered forged and it is a valid document because it is appropriate to write this considering that he raised him. (Teshuvos Maimoni, Siman Mishpatim, Seif 48)</i>

Siman 43

1. <b>The Date Must be Written in a Document and the Specific Laws of Postdating and Predating, 29 Seifim:</b> The date of the loan must be written in the document so that we will know which third-party buyers the lender may collect from because the lender cannot collect from buyers that purchased from the borrower prior to the loan. If there is no date in the document, the lender may collect with the document but he cannot collect from third-party buyers because the buyers can argue that they purchased the land prior to the loan. There are those that say if the third-party purchased the land after witnesses had seen a written and signed document, the lender may collect from them. <i>A receipt without a date is valid. The receipt-holder is in the superior position. (Teshuvos HaRosh, 20, 73)</i>
2. If the scribe omitted mentioning that the years in the document were from creation of the world, (<i>Beis Yosef who heard it from the Poskim</i>) or even if he omitted the 5,000 or the hundreds and just wrote the ones, the document is valid. <i>RAMA: If, however, the scribe wrote the thousands and the ones, but omitted the hundreds or tens, the document is invalid. *Rivash, Siman 322)</i>
3. If the scribe wrote thousands but omitted “five,” the document is valid.
4. If the scribe wrote “on the fourth, on the 20th day of Shevat,” and omitted “of the week,” the document is valid.
5. If the scribe wrote “on the 4th day of the week, on the 22nd of Tishrei,” and those days do not conform because Wednesday in Tishrei of that year fell out on the 24th, the document is still valid.
6. A document written in the borrower’s handwriting does not require a date.
7. Predated documents are invalid because the lender may illegally collect from third-party buyers. Thus, the Rabbis penalized the lender and he can only collect unencumbered land with a predated document as a gezeirah lest he collect from the predated date. If the borrower claims he paid back, we apply the same rules as we do for other documents. If the borrower claims the loan never occurred, the borrower is established as a fraudster. <i>There are those that say that the document is completely invalid. (Tur, in the name of the R"i; and the Rosh; and the Rivash, Siman 382; and see the Rivash regarding delay, and what he wrote in his books, see there.</i>
8. When do we say the lender may collect from unencumbered lands? Where the witnesses did not intentionally predate the document. <i>RAMA: (Tur; and the R"an in the name of the Raz"ah; and Rebbe Shimon ben Beteira) There are those that say that witnesses are believed on this issue, even if we have a copy of their signatures from another source. The same applies to any error that witnesses often make and they are believed to say they erred. (R"an). There are those that disagree. [see in the Tur two opinions </i>If, however, the witnesses intentionally predated the document, the lender can certainly not even collect from unencumbered land because the witnesses are invalid witnesses who signed falsely.
9. If a gift-document should have said “year 58” but said “year 57,” and it’s evident from within the document that it was the scribe’s error because the document says “give to so and so, my son-in-law,” and the recipient was not the giver’s son-in-law yet, and one of the signatories was a person who is pious and great in Torah, none of this would save the document from being disqualified. Nevertheless, if the witnesses are around and we don’t have their signatures from another source, they can sign another document from this second date. If we have their signatures from another source, they are no longer believed, but the recipient of the gift is believed to say it was an error migu [<i>Ed. Note: The source for migu is provided by the Gemara in Ketuvot 22a which empowers a father to testify about his minor daughter's husband.]</i> that he could have said it was a good document and that the kinyan was made in year 57.
10. A predated document that stated before the signatures, “this document was written on such and such date but not signed until such and such date,” is a valid document.
11. Even if the witnesses had observed the lender lend to the borrower and the borrower told them to write and sign a document and give it to the lender, if there was no kinyan, the witnesses would write the date the document was handed over and not the day of the loan.
12. Postdated documents are valid because they hurt the document-owner’s ability in that he can now only collect from the date of the document. The document is valid, even if it did not state that it was postdated. When is this true? Where the document says “that I will acquire.” If, however, it does not say “that I will acquire,” the document is invalid (and the same is written in Siman 258) unless it explicitly says “we wrote the document and delayed it.” <i>One should not delay any document in the first instance because it appears like a falsehood. (Rabbeinu Yerucham) </i>
13. This, that a postdated document is valid, is only with respect to loan documents. With respect to transactional documents, however, even a postdated document is invalid unless (it is written) the delay was explicit. <i>(The Shach, see above, any shtrar is not allowed to be postdated initially, etc)</i>
14. A document whose date falls out on Shabbos or the 10th of Tishrei is considered a postdated document and is valid. We are not concerned that it may be predated and was really written on Sunday or the 11th of Tishrei. Rather, we uphold the status of the document because it’s well known that one cannot write a document on the Shabbos or the 10th of Tishrei and that is why they delayed it. There are those that say that if the borrower tells the lender to swear to him, the lender is obligated to swear. This is only true for a verified document. If, however, the document was unverified, the document-holder has the burden of proof.
15. Any document that appears in front of us is assumed to be given on the date that it is written except where something negative occurred that calls its status into question, such as where the document fell, in which case the document-holder would not be able to collect if there was no kinyan until he brings a proof that he received the document on the date that was written, because a negative occurrence affected the document’s status.
16. If a document was written at night and signed on the following day, the document is valid because the day follows the night. If, however, it was written by day and signed at night, the document is invalid. When is this true? When they were not dealing with that topic. If, however, they were dealing with the topic, the document is valid. This is only where the party did not immediately take the item with a kinyan. If, however, the party took the item with a kinyan, the document is valid, even they did not sign until much later. Therefore, if witnesses observed a kinyan and delayed writing until later and they remember the date of the kinyan, they should write the date from that day. If they do not remember, they should write the date the document was written.
17. There are those that say that this that a document is valid where they were dealing with that topic is only with respect to loan documents. With respect to obligatory documents- where a party obligates himself with a kinyan or document- however, the document would not be valid.
18. When the witnesses write the date of the kinyan, they juxtapose the date of the kinyan [note: version of the Shach and Sma] to that day. They write, “we made a kinyan from so and so on such and such date and we wrote and handed over the document to so and so.” When they write the current date, they juxtapose the writing to the date. They write, “we made a kinyan from so and so and we wrote and signed on this date and gave it to so and so.” If they don’t do it this way, it appears like a falsehood. <i>(If, however, they simply wrote “in such and such place we made a kinyan from so and so” it does not appear like a falsehood.) (Rabbeinu Yerucham; Tur)</i>
19. If the witnesses do not remember the date of the kinyan, they cannot say we are certain that it was in Tishrei but we are just not sure what date, so we will write the beginning of Cheshvan, because that has the appearance of a falsehood. There are those that say that if the witnesses remember that they made a kinyan in the beginning of Tishrei, the middle of Tishrei or the end of the Tishrei, they can write the first-third of the month, the middle-third or the last-third.
20. If witnesses received testimony in one country and were documenting their testimony in another country, they do not write the place they received the testimony but the place they are signing. This is only true where they are not writing the date of the kinyan, but the date of the writing. If, however, they remember the date of the kinyan and are writing it, then they should write the locale where the kinyan took place, because if they were to write the place where it was written, they would be found to be fraudsters and will be disqualified. When they write the place of documentation, they write, “this is what so and so told us and we wrote it in such and such place.” If, however, they are writing the place where the testimony was handed over, they write “so and so told us” or “we made a kinyan from so and so in such and such place and we wrote and signed it and handed it over to so and so.”
21. This that we said, that the witnesses write the place of documentation even if the kinyan was in another place, is only where there is no distinction in the currency used in the place of the kinyan and the currency used in the place of the documentation or even if there is a distinction but they write in the document “the currency that is used in such and such place.” If, however, there is a distinction between the currency used in the place the testimony was given and the place of the kinyan and the document does not say it is the currency used in such and such place, the witnesses should only write the place where the testimony was received because the party owes the currency of that locale and if they were to write another place, the party would owe the currency of the place where the document was written.
22. A document that does not state where it was written is still valid. <i>(Pay attention to the above, Siman  42, Seif 14)</i>
23. If Reuven and Shimon both had a document against Levi and on Reuven’s document it said 5 Nissan and on Shimon’s it simply said Nissan, and Levi only has one field that cannot cover both loans, we would give the field to Reuven because Shimon’s document may have been written at the end of Nissan. Similarly, Shimon cannot collect from third-party buyers who purchased land from Levi in Iyar or later because the buyers can tell Shimon that they left him a place to collect his loan- the field that Reuven collected illegally because Shimon’s document was before Reuven’s. Therefore, if Reuven and Shimon were to write a joint power-of-attorney, they would be able to collect from third parties who purchased land in Iyar or later.
24. Even if a receipt were to omit the document-witnesses and the date of the document, since the sum of money in the document and receipt are identical we say the receipt was written on this document.
25. If a document dated Nissan was produced against someone, and that individual produces a waiver document dated 18 Nissan, the waiver has the power to nullify the debt.
26. If Reuven produced a document against Shimon dated on a specific date and Shimon produces a receipt on that document with the same date, the document-holder is in the inferior position.
27. If Reuven produced a loan document on Shimon dated 5 Nissan and Shimon produces a receipt that was written on 5 Nissan which states that Reuven waived all claims he had on Shimon until that date, Reuven may collect with such loan document because common usage of “until” does not include that date. If, however, the document stated that Reuven waived all claims that he had against Shimon until now, the matter is in doubt and we would not take away money based on doubt.
28. If two documents were created in a leap year and one simply says Adar and the other says the second Adar, and the borrower does not have enough property for both loans, we would give the property to the document that says Adar. If both documents simply said Adar, it is as if they were both written in the first Adar and we would give the land to the document-holder with the earlier date of the month. (See Orach Chaim Siman 427 regarding how we write it. See Even Haezer Siman 126). Any date that is written in a document, such as “until Pesach” or “until the harvest” is judged the same way we judge the case with respect to vows.
29. If a document says “until after Pesach,” that means until most of the days between Pesach and Shavuos had passed. (Until then, day 21).

Siman 44

1. <b> The Laws of Summarizing the Document On the Last Line and How We Verify Erased and Hanging Letters, 11 Seifim:</b> When writing a document, one must repeat the content of the document in the last line because (<i>we do not deduce anything from the last line - Tur</i>) due to the fact that the witnesses are not capable of ensuring that their signatures are immediately juxtaposed to the text. We are concerned that the witnesses left space the size of a line and a forger wrote what he wanted there. If the document did not review the content, it would not be disqualified over this, but we would not be able to deduce anything from the last line. <i> RAMA: This view is not like those that say that the entire document would be disqualified because it was not written in the way the Rabbis had instituted, even though there is no logical reason to disqualify it. (Tur, in the name of the Rosh; Tosefos) This, that we do not deduce from the last line, is only in a situation where we are concerned of a forgery. If, however, the last line negatively impacts the party that produces the document, we would deduce from it because it was certainly not forged. (Nimukei Yosef, in the name of the Rivta and the Ra"a)</i>
2. If the entire document was written in the handwriting of the party that is obligated, we would deduce from the last line. If, however, the document was in the hand of another person and the obligated party signed on bottom, we would not deduce from the last line.
3. If the document concluded at the end of a line and the witnesses distanced their signature a full line and signed in the middle of the second line, we would not deduce anything from half of the last line nor from the complete line before it. <i>RAMA: [This is] if something was discovered to have been written in the half row before their signatures or the row before it. This is only where the witnesses signed one on top of the other. If, however, they signed one following the other, the entire document is invalid as will be written later in 45:10.</i>
4. If the document states “this is affirmed and verified,” we would deduce from the last line (<i>and they would not need to repeat the content on the last line - Tur)</i>
5. If a document has erasures, hanging letters or words that were written over, it would need to be verified before the document states “affirmed and verified.” <i>They would not have to write “and this is their verification.” (Mordechai; Tosefos)</i>  If these edits were not verified, the document would not be disqualified. We would just not deduce from them. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that an unverified erasure would invalidate the entire document because perhaps something negative was written against the document-holder and it was erased, unless it is evident what was erased, in which case the entire document would not become invalid. (Tur; Nimukei Yosef)</i> If the edits were in the essence of the document- i.e., the name of the borrower or lender or the amount of money- the document would be invalidated if they did not verify the edits. If the edits were in the date and were unverified, the document has the status of an undated document.
6. If a document has a scrape in the back or between the lines in a place where they have the custom to document repayment on the back or between the lines, the document is valid, but we must intimidate the document-holder. There are those that invalidate the document.
7. There are those that say that we would not verify erasures other than with a writing that is identical to the writing of the document, but not with a writing that is lighter [in content] than the writing of the document.
8. If the erasure was in the penultimate line and was the size of “affirmed and verified” or larger, the document would be invalid, even if the erasure was verified, because perhaps a party erased and replaced with a forgery and then verified in the space between the text and the witnesses. This is only true where there is no line-size space between the witnesses and the document in which case we are concerned that the party added something in the space the witnesses had left. If, however, there is a line-size space, the document is valid and we are not concerned that they had left two lines of space and the party added what he wanted in one line and left the other line-size space blank. This is only where the witnesses are established as knowledgeable. Otherwise, we would in fact be concerned.
9. Nowadays, we have the custom to write the verification of erasures and hanging letters after “and they have made a kinyan” because today the practice is for all documents to say “affirmed and verified” so it is impossible to forge, we deduce from the last line and we do not need to review the content of the document on the last line. Thus, a document that does not say “affirmed and verified” would be invalid. Witnesses should not sign a document unless it says “affirmed and verified.” If the document says “affirmed and verified” twice, it is still valid <i>(but one should not do it in the first instance. Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 68, Siman 18)</i>
10. If a document had written on a scrape in its verification, “nun vov” and they checked and investigated the document letter by letter and could not find those two letters, the document is valid.
11. If a document contains erasures and the witnesses forgot to verify them at the end of the document and they wrote “affirmed and verified” and one witness signed, but before the second witness signed they discovered that they did not verify the erasures, the way to correct this document is to write, “we are witnesses that after one of us had signed before verifying such and such erasure contained in the documents, we verified appropriately and everything is affirmed and verified” and then both witnesses sign. <i>(All the more so would a document be valid if they wrote something below their signatures and signed again). (Mordechai)</i>

Siman 45

1. <b> That Witnesses Must First Read the Document and the Laws of A Document on Paper and the Witnesses on Erased Paper, 23 Seifim:</b> Witnesses sign on the bottom of the document and not from the sides or on top.
2. If the head of the court knew the substance of the document and had his scribe read it to him, he may sign the document even though he did not read it himself since the judge believes his scribe and intimidates his scribe. No other person <i>(or other head of court or scribe - Tur)</i> is permitted to do this. The witness much read the document word for word. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that two may read in front of the witnesses and the witnesses will sign. (Tur; Rosh; Hagahot Maimoni, Perek 24) If the witnesses do not understand the language of the document, those reading it should translate the document and the witness can sign. (Beis Yosef) This seems to me to be the primary ruling. There are those that say we can read in front of the public and have the witnesses sign because people are afraid of lying in public so it has the status of the head of court with his scribe. (Hagahot Mordechai and Ashiri, Chapter 2 of Gittin)</i>
3. If a confession was given in a party’s handwriting but the document was a gentile form, and it is clear that the party cannot read it and there are witnesses that he did not read it, the party still obligates himself to whatever is written in it.
4. If witness do not know how to sign and they carved out a space on empty paper and the witnesses signed via impression, we would give them mardus lashses and the document would be invalid. <i>(There are those that say the document is valid.) (Tur and the Maggid, Chapter 24, in the name of the Rashba; and also see the R"an Perek 2 of Gittin)</i>
5. In a place where they have the custom to have the scribe sign based on the word of the witnesses by writing, “so and so the son of so and so signed with the handing over of the pen” or the document states “so and so the son of so and so commanded to sign” and the people of the city accepted that this form of testimony qualifies as the testimony of a witness, the document is valid. If the people of the city did not accept this form of testimony, it is of no effect. Any document that is produced in front of us where the witnesses testify on their signature would be verified because there is a chazaka that witnesses do not sign on a document unless they read the document and know how to sign. If the witnesses are in front of us and we know that they cannot read, but they said one who knows how to read read it to them, we would rely on their testimony. <i>(If the witnesses do not say this, we would investigate their testimony orally. If it conforms to what is written in the document, we would verify the document.) (Tur)</i>
6. The witnesses should be careful not leave a two-line space from the text. If they left a two-line space, the document would be invalid even if it said “affirmed and verified, ” it was known that nothing was added or forged and the space was filled with dots of ink, so that they don’t say the witnesses signed on the dots and not on the text.
7. This that we said that if the witnesses leave a two-line space the document is invalid is only with respect to collecting from encumbered properties or non-encumbered properties where the borrower claims he paid back. A party, cannot, however, claim the incident never occurred.
8. The aforementioned two lines refers to the size of the witnesses’ handwriting, which is large, but not the scribe’s handwriting because anyone who forges does not go to the scribe.
9. These two lines include the lines and their airspace, such as the lamed on the top line and the chof on the bottom line, which comes out to two lines and three airspaces.
10. There is one that says that if the document finished in middle of a line and they left that line and another line and then began signing on the third line, the document is invalid because a party can write what he wants on that half line and then recap the substance of the document on the last line. Similarly, if they finished the document at the end of a line and the witnesses distanced a full line and then began in the middle of the second line, the document is invalid if they signed one after the other on that half-line because a party can write “so and so borrowed a maneh from so and so” on the empty half-line before the signature and the document would be one which has the text and witnesses on the one line which is valid, and the party will cut off the entire top of the document. <i>RAMA: See 44:3. If the document concluded in the middle of a line, the witnesses can sign, one next to the other, on the remaining half of the line and we would then deduce from the half line before their signature and the line on top because there is nothing at all to be suspicious of. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashbatz)</i>
11. If there is a blank space before the witnesses’ signatures, they must be careful to sign one after the other on the same line because a party may write what he wants on the blank space before their signatures and cut off the top, and the document will be one in which the text and witnesses are on the same line. What should the witnesses do? They should fill the blank space with ink. We would not say that the witnesses have signed on the filled space unless the filled space was between the document and the witnesses. If the witnesses began signing in the middle of a line and they cut off the space before the signature, the document would be invalid because perhaps something that hurt a party or a condition was written there and the party cut it off. If, however, the document said “affirmed and verified” above at the end of the line, the document would be valid so long as the witnesses sign one under the other. If, however, they signed one following the other, the document would be invalid because perhaps the document was one where the text and witnesses were on one line, the party cut it, it was blank on top and the party wrote what he wanted to.
12. If a document had many witnesses and one of them was a relative or otherwise disqualified or two of the witnesses were related to each other and the witnesses are not around and they have a clear testimony that they all sat down to sign with the intention of testifying, the document is void. If they do not have such testimony, the testimony can be verified with the remaining witnesses because it is possible the valid witnesses signed and they left room for the elder to sign and a relative or someone otherwise disqualified signed without their knowledge, even if the disqualified witness was the first to sign. <i>RAMA: No relative or disqualified witness should sign on a document in the first instance. (Tur) There are those that say that a document with a disqualified witness is invalid unless the last two witnesses are valid. (Tur, in the name of his father the Rosh; and see Siman 100:23)</i>
13. If a document is disqualified due to the signatures of disqualified witnesses and the valid witnesses remember the testimony by viewing the document, the valid witnesses may testify and the court will write as what was written in the document, and it will be considered like the first document.
14. If the witnesses were more than two-lines removed from the text and the space between the text and witnesses were filled with relatives or disqualified witnesses, the document is valid because it cannot be forged. If the court saw the document before it was filled with relatives or disqualified witnesses, there is nothing that can be done to validate the document. If, however, it was filled with relatives before it came to court, the document would be valid, even if the lender filled it on his own without the knowledge of the borrower. There are those that say this only applies where they filled it with the knowledge of the borrower. If, however, they filled the document without the borrower’s knowledge, it would be invalid.
15. This, that we validate a document without a kinyan where it was filled with relatives or disqualified witnesses, is only if it was filled in on the day it was written. If, however, it was filled in the next day or later, the document would be invalid, even if filled in with the knowledge of the borrower.
16. If after a document was paid back, the party claimed the document was invalid because the scribe distanced the signature more than one line from the text, his claim is of no effect.
17. One who obtains a claim via a gentile has the status of the gentile with respect to collecting from a document where the witnesses are more than two lines from the text if the gentiles have the custom to collect with such a document.
18. If a document is produced where the entire document is on one line and the witnesses are on another line, it is invalid because perhaps the witnesses distanced one line from the document, the party cut off the entire document and wrote this document on that line, thereby having the witnesses be signed on that line. <i>RAMA: Similarly, if the document was on two lines but the first line does not begin at the beginning of the parchment, we are concerned that they perhaps finished the document in middle of the line and left the remainder blank as well as the line below it, the witnesses signed, the party cut the entire document and forged what he wanted on the line and a half, thereby having the witnesses be signed on it. (Mordechai)</i>
19. If the entire document with the witnesses was on one line, the document is valid because there is nothing to be concerned about. If, however, the document and the witnesses were on one line and there were two witnesses on another line, we are concerned that perhaps a party cut the entire document above which the lower witnesses had signed on, in the line between the document and witnesses he wrote a document with its witnesses and with the witnesses on the second line he’ll say his intention was to increase the amount of witnesses. Therefore, when a document like this comes in front of us, we would not verify it from the witnesses on the second line but from the witnesses on the first line.
20. If a document is produced with the text and witnesses on erasure, the document is valid, so long as there is no distinction between the document and the place where the witnesses have signed. If there was some kind of distinction, we are concerned that perhaps a party erased and wrote what he wanted to and the fact that it was erased twice explains the distinction. Therefore, witnesses should not sign on an erased document unless it was erased in their presence because otherwise we are concerned that the place to sign was erased twice and the place of the document was only erased once, and when the party erases the document a second time and writes what he wants, it will come out that the document and place of signature have both been erased the same two times. <i>RAMA: They must be careful to have everything erased on the same day, because a one-day old erasure is not comparable to a two-day old erasure. (Beis Yosef)</i>  If there is a space between the signature of one witness and the other the size of “We the witnesses signed on erasure while the document was on paper,” the document is disqualified because perhaps the document was on paper, the witnesses were on erasure and between the witnesses it stated “we the witnesses, etc.” and the party erased it, erased the document and subsequently wrote what he wanted. <i>(If, however, there is no erasure at all, the document is valid, even if there is a large space between the signatures.) (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rivash, Siman 49)</i>
21. If a document is on paper and its witnesses are on erasure, the document is disqualified because the party might erase the document and forge it, resulting in the text and witnesses both on erasure. If the witnesses write, “we the witnesses signed on erasure while the document was on paper,” the document is valid, so long as they wrote it between the signatures of the first and second witnesses. If, however, they wrote it before or after their signatures, the declaration would be of no effect.
22. If a document is on erasure and its witnesses are on paper, the document is disqualified, even if the witnesses wrote “we the witnesses wrote on paper and the document is on erasure” because ultimately the party can erase the document and write what he wants. Although it will have been erased twice, it would not be evident because a one-time erased document, which would allow us to see the distinction, is not adjacent to it.
23. In a locale where they have the custom to document repayment between the lines, one must be careful that there should be no scrape between the lines because if there were, we would be concerned the party paid back and it was erased. All the more so are we concerned in a case where the repayment was between the lines on erasure because perhaps the repayment was more than documented and the party erased it and wrote what he wanted. If there are witnesses that the repayment is the borrower’s handwriting, the document is valid because there is nothing to be concerned about.

Siman 46

1. <b>Witnesses That Said We Were Minors or We Were Disqualified or the Document Was Given on Trust and All the Laws of Verifying Documents, 38 Seifim:</b> If one produces a loan document against his counterparty, so long as the document has not been verified the borrower can claim the document is a forgery and he never instructed anyone to write it. Even if the borrower confesses and says it is true that he instructed it to be written but he paid back, it was given on trust or he wrote it with the intention to borrow but he never borrowed or anything similar, he is believed because if he wanted he could have said the loan never occurred and the document is only verified on his say-so. He must swear a heses oath and will be exempt. If the lender later has the document verified, the document will be like any other document. <i>(See later at the beginning of Siman 82).</i>
2. There are those that say that this - that we believe a borrower with a migu - is only where the document does not contain a believability clause for the lender. If, however, the document does contain a believability clause, there would be no migu. There are those that say that even if the document contains a believability clause the borrower is believed <i>(with a migu that he could have claimed the document was forged. This opinion is logical.) (Tur)</i>
3. What is the verification process? The witnesses of the document come and testify in front of three judges- who may even be laymen- that this is their signature and the judges will write on the bottom, “we were three who sat as one and so and so and so and so came and testified in front of us regarding their signatures and it became clear to us that this is their signature. We uphold and affirm as is appropriate,” and they sign on bottom.
4. We cannot verify a document other than in front of three individuals because it is considered judgement. Therefore, we do not verify documents at night. <i>RAMA:  If two people verified a document, there is no verification. (Mordechai, Perek 'Hasholeach'; Hagahot Mordechai, Kedushin; Nimukei Yosef, Perek 'Chazakat HaBatim') There are those that write that now that we have the custom that a designated Rabbi verifies documents solo, this kind of custom supersedes the strict law. This is in fact the widespread custom in these countries. The rationale seems to me to be that we hold that a solo expert has the status of three laymen with respect to the rabbinical verification of documents and is therefore considered a court as was explained earlier in Siman 25. Although we do not have expert individuals today, with respect to verification of documents, however, we can rely on this. This is what seems to me to be the reasoning behind the custom.</i>
5. We may verify a document even if not in the presence of the parties. Even if the party is standing and yelling that the document is forged and should not be verified, we would not listen to him.
6. Although the document is verified, the court must recognize the signature of the two witnesses or two of the judges. If they do not, the document does not have the status of being verified. There is, however, a purpose to the verification in that because there are two witnesses and three judges that have signed on it, it is much easier to find someone who recognizes the signatures.
7. A document can be verified in one of five ways: (i) the judges recognize the witness’ handwriting, (ii) the witnesses sign in front of the judges, (iii) the witnesses that signed on the document come and each one says, “this is my handwriting and I am a witness on this matter,” (iv) witnesses come and testify that this is the handwriting of these witnesses and they may testify this testimony in writing and do not need to testify verbally, (Rivash, Seif 382) or (v) their handwriting is produced from other documents and the court will compare this writing to the writing in other documents and determine that those witness’ handwriting is the same as these witnesses. We do not verify a document from other documents except from two documents of two fields where the owners consumed a public consumption for three years without any fear or trepidation from any claim in the same manner that all field-owners consume their fields or from two kesubos, so long as the documents are produced from a third party and not from this individual who is looking to verify the document because he may have forged all of them. <i>(We would not verify the documents if they were produced from the party’s hand, even if both documents were verified. (Tur; Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi) There are those that disagree. (R"an according to the opinion of the Rambam) </i> Similarly, we can verify a document from a single document that was protested against- <i>(there are those that say that even if no one protested, but the document was simply verified as we have later in seif 37)</i>- and was affirmed in court just as we verify from documents of two fields or two kesubos. <i>RAMA: There are those that say we can verify a document from a book that the witness wrote but not from a letter that he wrote. (Rivash, Siman 136) There are those that say that we cannot even verify from a book unless he signed it at the end, in which case we can verify from the author’s signature. (R"an, Chapter 2 of Kesuvos)</i>
8. If the court wrote, “we sat as three and the document was verified in front of us," the document is verified even if they did not write the form of verification they used. The custom is to write the form of verification used.
9. When a document is verified with others testifying that this is the witness’ handwriting, if one witness testifies on one signature and a second testifies on the other, the document is not verified because we require two witnesses on each one of the signatures. If there is a third witness among them who will testify on the signature of both witnesses, the document is verified.
10. If one signed on a document and comes to court to testify on his own handwriting and he recognizes his signature with certainty but does not remember the testimony at all and he cannot recall that this party ever borrowed from this one, he is prohibited from testifying on this handwriting that is in this court because a person does not testify that this is his handwriting but that this party owed that party the actual money in the document. The handwriting is merely a form of reminding him of the incident, but if he does not remember he cannot testify. Thus, if a document was produced in court and witnesses come and say this is our handwriting but we never knew of such testimony and we have no recollection that this party borrowed from or sold to the other, the document would not be verified and the witnesses have a status of the deaf until they recall their testimony. Any judge who does not judge accordingly does not know between his right and left when it comes to monetary law. If, however, the witness’ handwriting was produced from another place or there were other witnesses that testified that this was their handwriting, we would verify the document and we would not pay attention to the words of the witnesses that say we don’t recall the testimony because the document is being verified without their words. This is the reason we are able to verify all documents and we do not require to bring the witnesses and ask them if they remember the testimony or not because even if they were to come and say we don’t remember the incident, we would not listen to them since we can verify the document without their words. These were the words of the Rambam. There are those that disagree and say that even if they do not recall that the party borrowed or that they ever signed on this document and we do not have their handwriting from any other source, since they are testifying that this is their handwriting, we would verify the document based on their words. Under this approach, when the witnesses themselves are coming to testify that this is their handwriting, if they forgot the loan and do not remember signing this document at all, we would require two witnesses on each signature. Therefore, we would need each witnesses to testify on his signature and on his co-witness’ signature or a third party should join them and testify on both their handwriting in order to have two witnesses on each signature. <i>RAMA: We do not require a witness to remember his testimony except in a case of a solo witness or with two witnesses when it comes to verifying the document. With respect to two witnesses that sign on the document, however, if they did not remember the incident at all and the document was not written as was instituted, there would still be a testimony of witnesses (Mahar"iv, Siman 94; Hagahot Mordechai, Kesuvos) and if the document was verified we would follow whatever is written in it. Although this document does not have the status of a complete document, it is considered a document with respect to not having the testimony considered as written testimony as was explained above in 28:12. (Teshuvos Rashba, Siman 1000; Rabbeinu Tam) There are those that disagree as was explained above in the beginning of 39:3. </i>
11. If one of the witnesses says this is my handwriting and he and another testified on the second witness’ handwriting, the document would not be verified because ¾ of the money is being collected via the testimony of one witness.
12. Similarly, if the brother or father of the first witness testifies with another on the handwriting of the second witness, the document would not be verified because ¾ of the money is being collected via the testimony of relatives.
13. If two people signed on the document and one of them died, we require two individuals from the street to testify on the deceased’s signature. The surviving witness cannot join with another to testify on the signature of the deceased because that would result in ¾ of the money being collected via him. If only one other witness is found with the surviving witness, the surviving witness may write his signature even on pottery in front of witnesses and set it forth in court until his signature is established in the court- <i>(all the more so would it be effective if there are witnesses that can verify the surviving witness’ signature- (Nimukei Yosef, Perek Chazakat HaBatim)</i> so that the witness will not be need to testify on his signature. He can then subsequently testify with the other witness regarding the deceased’s signature.
14. If the court does not recognize the witness’ signature or the signature of the judges who signed on the verification and one of the witnesses of the document testified on his handwriting and two witnesses testify on the signature of one of the judges or the judge himself and another witness with him testified on his handwriting, it would be of no effect because that which this person is testifying on is not the same as to what the other witness is testifying on. This witness is testifying on the maneh in the document, whereas the judge is testifying on the witness’ signature. <i>(Similarly, if the handwriting of the scribe and one of the witnesses is verified, there would be no verification). (Beis Yosef, in the name of the R"i)</i>
15. If two of the verification judges testify on their own handwriting, the document is verified.
16. If one witness from the market testifies on the witnesses in the document and one judge testifies on his signature, they would combine because the witness and judge are testifying on the same matter. The same rule applies where the judge does not testify on his signature but two individuals from the market testify on the judge because all of the testimonies are one and the same.
17. The witnesses on verification may be related to the witnesses on the document. Moreover, if a father that signed died while his child was a minor, the child may join with another witness and testify on his father’s signature after he becomes an adult. Similarly, one may testify on his brother’s or his teacher’s handwriting that he saw while he was a child. There are those that say he may only testify for the aforementioned examples where he was frequently with them. With respect to the handwriting of another, however, one is not believed to testify while he is an adult about a signature that he recognizes from his youth.
18. The witnesses of verification must not be related to the judges of verification. There are those that permit it. <i>RAMA: The verification witnesses may be related to the witnesses that testify on the signatures of the judges who verified the document. (Beis Yosef) The verification witnesses may not be related to one another. (R"an, end of Perek 2 of Kesuvos)</i>
19. Verification witnesses that are related to the lender or borrower are disqualified. There are those who permit it. <i>RAMA: Verification judges that are related to the borrower or lender - their verification is disqualified. (R"an, Chapter 2 of the Laws of Gezerot; Rivash, Siman 382; Rosh, Klal 80:4; Nimukei Yosef; Mordechai, Perek 2 of Kesuvos)</i>
20. <i>(R"an, there)</i> Judges who sign on a document verification may sign even without reading the document. They do not have to read what is in the body of the document, but they still need to see who the borrower and lender are so that the borrower and lender are not related to the judges or the witnesses testifying in front of them. There are those that say that they do not need to read it at all; <i>(so long as they write who the verification witnesses are so that if they were disqualified to the lender or borrower they will later be able to realize it.) (Nimukei Yosef, in the name of the Ritva)</i>
21. Judges who judge on conditions or other areas with respect to the actual loan must not be related to the witnesses on the document.
22. The verification judges must not be related to the judges that judge the actual loan. There are those that allow them to be related.
23. Verification witnesses may be related to the judges on the loan.
24. If three individuals sat down to verify a document and two of them recognize the witness’ signatures while one does not recognize the signatures, prior to the judges signing the two who recognize may testify in front of the one who does not recognize, and he can then sign the verification. Once the two that recognized have signed they cannot testify in front of the third judge and have him sign. They are permitted to write the verification of the document before the document is verified because the writing is not the primary aspect of the verification; the signing is. There are those that disagree.
25. If witnesses came and testified that at the time of the verification the judges were not in one siting but that each judge accepted the testimony by himself, the verification is invalid. <i>The judges themselves are not believed to say that they were not together and that they did the verification improperly. (Teshuvos Ramban, Siman 94)</i> There are those who validate such a verification.
26. If three individuals sat to verify the document and two witnesses came and protested that one of the judges is a thief or something similar, and two other witnesses came and testified that the judge repented, if the witnesses of repentance testified before the other judges had signed the verification, the judge in question may sign with him because they are three valid judges. If the witnesses of repentance testified after the other judges had signed, he cannot sign with them because it is as if he was not there at the time the other two had signed.
27. When is this true? Where the witnesses protested due to the judge’s sin. If, however, they protested regarding a flaw in his lineage, such as where they said his mother was never freed and he is a slave or she did not convert and he is a gentile, and we discovered after the other two judges had signed that there was in fact no flaw in his lineage and that he is valid, he may sign with the other judges because this is merely a revelation to what which was true earlier.
28. If they wrote the verification and it turns out one of the judges on the verification is invalid, they cut up the verification but the document itself remains in its valid state.
29. If three individuals sat to verify a document and one of them died, they must write, “we were three sitting as one and one is no longer with us” so that an observer does not say a court of two verified the document. This is true even if the verification says “in court” because the observer will say perhaps they believed two qualifies as a court. If there is some implication that they were three, the language is not required. There are those that say that if they did not write “and one is no longer with us” the document is still valid. Nevertheless, everyone agrees that if the verification states, “a court with three sitting,” nothing else is required, the two remaining may sign and it suffices. <i>RAMA: If all three signed they do not need to write, “three were sitting.” (Nimukei Yosef; Rivash; Shach; Rashba; R"an) Even if the verification merely states “this document was verified property” that is enough. (Teshuvos Ramban, Siman 91).</i>
30. Even in a case where one of the judges did not die we have the custom to write “and one is not with us” in order to make it easier on the judges so that only two have to sign. <i>RAMA: If the validation says “we were three…” and three judges signed and one of them turned out be a relative or otherwise disqualified, there are those that say the validation is valid because we presume that three others sat down and only two of them signed and the third individual who was related or disqualified signed later (Rivash) as was explained above in 45:12 with respect to other documents. There are those that say the validation is invalid. (Rosh) A verification that says “we are witnesses” is valid because since we see that three signed we can observe that it was a court. (Rivash)</i>
31. The verification by the court must be adjacent to the handwriting of the witnesses, on the side of the document or on the back opposite the writing. <i>Therefore, if the paper had little room on bottom they can write the verification on the side or on the back. (Rambam; Magid)</i> If there was a one line and a two airspace space between the verification and the document, only the verification itself would be disqualified because perhaps the party will cut off the verified document and forge what he wants and forge two witnesses on that line resulting in a forged document with verification.
32. <i>(This Din is in the name of the Rambam, and see also the Perisha)</i>If they had the verification one, two or more lines removed from the document and they filled up the entire space with scrapes of ink, the document is valid because it cannot be forged. We are not concerned that the court verified the scrapes; rather we assume they verified the substance of the document. There are those that say that we do have this concern.
33. A document that has the document and witnesses on erasure and the verification below on the paper, we do not verify the document using the verification judges. Rather, we verify with the witnesses that are above because perhaps the verification was far removed from the document, the space was filled with scrapes of ink, the party cut off the substance of the document and wrote the document and witnesses on the erasure. There are those that permit verifying it with the verification judges.
34. If a witness signed a document before becoming a thief and then later became a thief, he cannot testify on his own handwriting. If, however, there are others who testify that they recognize the witness’ signature and they saw his signature on this document prior to his becoming a thief, the signature is valid. If, however, they did not see the signature until after the witness became a thief, the document would not be valid because we are concerned that the witness forged it now and signed. <i>RAMA: If there are no witnesses that recognize the thief’s signature, he can write his signature and we will verify based on that as was explained above in Seif 13. The same is true if the witness became an apostate after signature. He is treated just as if he became a thief. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ritva)</i>
35.  If a witness signed on a document before becoming a party’s son-in-law and then later became his son-in-law, the witness cannot testify on his own handwriting. Others, however, may testify that they recognize his signature, even if they did not see it until after he became the party’s son-in-law. There are those that say that this is only where the document was produced by a third party. If, however, the document was produced by the witnesses, they cannot testify on their signature.
36. If a witness signed when he was healthy and now has become mute, he cannot testify on his handwriting but others may testify on it.
37. If two people signed on a document and died and their handwriting has not been produced from another source and two individuals come and say that this is the witnesses’ handwriting but they were minors or otherwise disqualified, they would be believed and we tear up the document unless a party argues that he should be given a set time to verify the document. If there were witnesses that this was the deceased’s handwriting or their handwriting was produced from another document that was called into question and later affirmed in court, we would not tear up the document. There are those that say that we do not require the document to have been called into question because it suffices that it was affirmed in court, even if the document was not called into question. <i>RAMA: This is all where the witnesses have already died. If, however, the witnesses were alive and two other witnesses come to disqualify them and say that the witnesses were disqualified, even the document itself would be disqualified notwithstanding the fact that their signature has been produced from another source. (R"an; and the Tur in the name of Tosefos) There are those that disagree and say the document is valid. (Ibid., in the name of his father, the Rosh) This, that the latter witnesses are not believed where the handwriting of the document witnesses is produced from another source, does not mean that the document is valid to collect with. Rather, if a party were to grab movable items on the basis of it, we would not take it away from him. (Tur in the name of Rashi; the Rosh) </i>If the witness’ handwriting was not produced from another source, and the witnesses said this is our handwriting but within kidei dibur they said we were forced by threat of life, we were minors, we were disqualified due to familial relationship and we are no longer related, he nullified the document in front of us or the document had a condition that we did not see fulfilled, the witnesses are believed. Even if one witness says there was no condition and the other says there was a condition and it was not fulfilled, the second witness is believed and only one witness remains. <i>If the document says, “we the witnesses testify that there is nothing omitted from the document,” they cannot say there was a condition because witnesses cannot re-testify. If they say, however, that this that they said that there was no omission was not meant to nullify any condition but just that nothing was omitted from actual sale, they would be believed. (Tur) Similarly, they may explain their words in the document in any manner that does not contradict their words. (Nimukei Yosef) If, however, the witnesses said they were forced via monetary threat, the document was given on trust or they were disqualified due to sin, they would not be believed even if they’re claiming they subsequently repented. Although they are not believed to void the document, they are believed with respect to themselves and they would be obligated to pay the borrower the loss they caused him by signing. If they said that at the time they signed that they were unaware that the document was given on trust and it later became clear to them that it was, they would be believed. If their handwriting was produced from another source or there are witnesses that this is their handwriting, they would not be believed regarding anything they say to void the document except if they said the party nullified the document in front of us.</i>
38. Witnesses that signed on a document and said that the borrower was a minor at that time, are not believed. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that this, that witnesses that signed on a document are considered as if their testimony was investigated and they cannot retract, is only with respect to two witnesses. If only one witness signed, however, he may retract. (Rivash)</i>

Siman 47

1. <b>One Who Claims the Document Was Given On Trust or Was Paid Back, 2 Seifim:</b> If a lender says that the document in his possession was given on trust or was paid back, the lender owes other people money and has nothing else to pay them back with other than this document, the document contains a believability clause and the document was affirmed in court or was being held by a third party, the lender is not believed. Even if we were unaware at the time of his admission that he owed others money and we only discovered this later, he would not be believed since he is coming to negatively impact others. The lender is not even believed where he is negatively impacting himself too, such as where the document is for 200 and he only owes others 100. If after the lender said the document was given on trust, he paid back his creditor and he now wants to use this document to collect from the borrower we analyze the situation. If he said it was given on trust when his creditor came to collect from this document then we say his intent was certainly just to push away his creditor. <i>(If, however, he confessed that the document was given on trust without his creditor making a claim) (Tur), then he cannot retract and collect with the document.</i>
2. If the lender says this document is accurate in that the borrower told the witnesses to write it for 1,000 dinar but he trusted me to only claim 500 dinar, the document is valid. If, however, he says that witnesses erred when they wrote 1,000 dinar, the document is considered like pottery. Even if the document contained a believability clause, the borrower would take a heses oath and be exempt. <i>(If one says that the a document in his possession belongs to others, see later Siman 99.)</i>

Siman 48

<b>That We Write the Outline of Documents, 1 Seif:</b> If a scribe desires to write outlines of documents so that they will be accessible to him, he may do so. He can write everything that is contained in the document: the names of the borrower and lender and the description of the money. He must leave the place for the date blank so that the document will not be predated. With respect to a document that was written for one loan and was paid back, however, one cannot re-borrow with it even if it was all on the same day and was therefore not predated because once the lien is waived one cannot re-borrow with the document. If the borrower paid back a portion of the loan, he cannot use the same document to re-borrow that portion because that lien on that portion was already waived. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that concept of the lien being waived only applies for the original kinyan. Thus, if the borrower made a second kinyan, he may re-borrow with the document. (Mordechai, Perek 'Kol HaGet') This applies even if they did not actually make a kinyan but the borrower simply gave the document to the lender in front of witnesses according to the view that the witnesses of transfer are primary even with respect to ordinary documents. (Mordechai Perek 'HaKotev') (See later Siman 51.</i>

Siman 49

1. <b>The Witnesses Must Be Familiar With The Names of the Borrower and Lender and the Laws of Errors In Names and Calculations, 10 Seifim:</b> If the borrower or lender have two names, there is no need to write anything other than the primary name. If they only wrote the secondary name, the document is valid. They do not need to write a suffix of a party’s name or the fact that he is a Kohen or Levi unless there were two individuals in the city with the same name.
2. The witnesses must be aware that the name of the borrower is in fact so and so the son of so and so. They must know the name of the seller in a sale document. In the case of a loan document without a kinyan, they must also know the name of the lender. If the witnesses do not recognize any of the foregoing, even a woman or relative would be believed to say that this is the individual's name. In a case where they relied on a woman or relative and it turns out the witnesses erred, we would believe this error occurred where the witness is a scholar <i>(because it is not the practice of scholars to investigate the specifics) (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashbam). There are those that say this is only true with respect to a woman because scholars are not familiar with women considering that it is not their practice to gaze at women, as will be explained in Even Haezer Siman 110. With respect to other matters, however, there is no distinction between a scholar and anyone else. The author of the Shulchan Aruch wrote in his sefer Beis Yosef that this view is in fact the primary view. Thus, it is a bewilderment that he takes the opposite approach here).</i> With respect to other individuals who do have the practice to investigate the specifics, we would not accept them because they certainly were cautious originally and now they are retracting and lying. <i>RAMA: The same applies with other errors by the scribe where it is obvious that there was an error, and the document would be valid. We say that that the scribe erred just as we say with respect to the lack of a lien in a document (The Rosh Klal 58, Siman 32) (as was explained above in the beginning of Siman 39.)</i>
3. We can write the name of anyone whose name was established in a city for 30 days. We are not concerned that he may have changed his name for fraudulent purposes.
4. If an individual was called by a name and responded to it, we assume that is his name with respect to anything that negatively impacts him. For example, if he referred to himself as Reuven, and he wrote a document against himself saying Reuven borrowed from Shimon and now claims that his name is not Reuven, if they called him Reuven and he responded, he is obligated to pay, notwithstanding the fact that his name has not been established as Reuven for 30 days in the city.
5. If a document is produced in front of us and the borrower claims that he does not owe anything and perhaps a fraudster used my name as his name and confessed to this loan or if the borrower says I do not owe this person money, but rather another person, and this lender is a fraudster who used my creditor’s name as his own, since it is not established that there are two people in the city with identical names, we do not pay attention to the words of the borrower.
6. If someone had a nickname established in the city and they wrote a document using that nickname and it later became known that he had another nickname, in a case where they erred in the name of the borrower or lender and wrote Reuven instead of Shimon or vice-versa or in a case where they erred with respect to the amount of money, they should write another document. <i>(The same applies to any other error).</i> We do not say the witnesses have already performed their mission. <i>(There are those that say that even in a case where the witnesses wrote a valid document, the concept of the witnesses already completing their mission would not be applicable) so long as the kinyan has not yet been documented and the document has not been given over to its owner. (R"an, Perek 'Hamekabel') There are those that say that the entire concept of the witnesses completing their mission does not apply to documents. (Nimukei Yosef, in the name of the Rashba) </i> There are those that say that in a case where it is obvious that there is a scribe’s error, the document is valid even if they did not write another one.
7. If two individuals in the city both had the name Yosef ben Shimon, neither of them can produce a document against the other if the document contains a kinyan because the defendant can say that this document that you are producing against me is mine and I returned it to you when you paid me back for the money you owed me. <i>RAMA: The Mecahber’s words contradict each other because there is no distinction between a document with a kinyan and one without if the reasoning for the foregoing is that one can say this document is mine and I returned it to you. There are those, however, that explain the reasoning that one cannot produce a document against the other (to be used) because we write documents for a borrower even if not in the presence of the lender so we are concerned that the party that produced it is the borrower. This concern would only apply to a document that contains a kinyan as we said above at the end of Siman 39. That is why the Mechaber wrote that this only applies for a document that contains a kinyan, Thus, his words are contradictory).</i> A third party cannot produce a document on either of them because each one can say it was not written against me but against the other, unless the document’s witnesses themselves come and say that this is the document we testified on and this is the party that we testified was involved in the loan. If other witnesses testify in that way, the loan has the status of a verbal loan. If one of the Yosef ben Shimons was a minor on the date of the document, we would collect from the other. What is the way to rectify this issue? They should write the names of their grandfathers. If their grandfathers also had the same name, they should write some other sign. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that if they are from different cities then they can produce a document against each other because they must write the name of the borrower’s city or the lender’s city in the document. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Yeshayah) There are those that say that we do not write the name of the city in the document (Rambam, Perek 17; Tur, Siman 61) and this is in fact the custom. However, if they are from two different cities and they wrote the name of the city of one of them, this is certainly no worse than a sign and there is no room for error. This is what appears correct to me. If there are two Yosef ben Shimons in one city and one of their fathers had died and in the document it says yv’s, shli’t or nr’v like we write for someone who is alive and the witnesses wrote “Yosef ben Shimon shli’ta told us” that would qualify as a sign. If, however, the document says, “I, Yosef ben Shimon shli’t” or something similar, “borrowed from so and so…” and the witnesses signed below, that would not qualify as a sign because perhaps the second Yosef ben Shimon wrote this with trickery and the witnesses did not pick up on it because they are not signing on everything in the document. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba)</i> If, however, they were to produce a document against a third party, that third party would not be able to say 'I did not owe you but instead owed the other person who has the same name as you', because we assume that the person who produced the document is the rightful owner of the document. <i>RAMA: If, however, Yosef ben Shimon did not produce the document, he would not be able to take away money from the borrower (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ritva), even if the borrower confesses that he owes one of them, unless the two Yosef ben Shimons were to write a power-of-attorney to each other. </i> If the borrower is in possession of a receipt from one of them, neither of them can make a claim against the borrower because the borrower can tell each one that you wrote this receipt for me. If, however, they were to write a power-of-attorney to each other, one of them would be able to collect because the borrower admits that he only paid one back. If the borrower claims he paid back both of them but only demanded one receipt because it would suffice to show that receipt to whichever one comes to him to claim the loan, the claim would be valid and the power-of-attorney would not be effective.
8. When is this true? Where they do not put third generations in either documents or receipts. If, however, they put third generations in documents but not in receipts, the receipt-holder has the burden of proof.
9. If one lender lent to both Yosef ben Shimons in two different documents and the documents contained three generations so each one’s document was recognizable and the lender [version of the Sma and Shach] had a verified receipt stating that the document of Yosef ben Shimon was paid back but the receipt did not have a third generation and both documents were discovered among the lenders’ torn up documents, the documents’ strength has been weakened and both documents are assumed to have been repaid.
10. If one Yosef ben Shimon borrowed from a third party and a field that was purchased by one Yosef ben Shimon from the other was discovered or the two Yosef ben Shimons were partners in a field, the lender cannot collect from the field by saying that had he lent the current owner then he certainly can collect and had he lent the other, considering that the other did not have unencumbered land, the current owner has purchased his lien. Similarly, where the two are partners, the lender cannot claim half of the land on the basis of the fact that he is owed that amount in either instance because a debtor’s properties are only mortgaged as a co-signer to the loan and a co-signer is only indebted to the lender in an instance where the lender can claim from the borrower himself. Since in this case the lender cannot claim from the borrower himself, he cannot collect from his properties either. In effect, in a case where one is a co-signer to two Yosef Ben Shimons- whether there are two lenders or one lender- the lender cannot claim from the co-signer just as he cannot claim from the borrowers.

<b>A Document That Says “I Borrowed a Maneh From You”, 1 Seif:</b> If a document with witnesses states, “I so and so borrowed a maneh from you,” whomever produces this document may collect the maneh. If, however, the document does not have witnesses but was written with the borrower’s handwriting, the borrower is believed to say he did not borrow from the document-holder but from someone else who dropped it and the document-owner simply found it because the borrower would have been believed to say he paid it back. <i>RAMA: The same applies to a court ruling that states that a person is obligated to pay his adversary and he would be required to pay the individual that produces the ruling. (Mordechai; Piskei Raknati; Teshuvos Maharam) The same applies to a document that states that so-and-so owes money to so-and-so or to whomever produces the document and the borrower would be obligated to pay whomever produces it. This only applies if the person producing the document is making his claim via the so-and-so, unless the document explicitly stated that there is no distinction whether the person is claiming via so-and-so or not. (R"i) If a receipt was written on any person with respect to this document, no person may subsequently collect with the document. (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the R"am and the Ritva) If a document states that a person is obligating himself to anyone who produces this document against him, he is obligated to pay the person who produces it, even if it was known that he never owed him anything, because he obligated himself (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 68, Siman 9 and 11) as was explained above in Siman 40. See later 60:10.</i>

Siman 51

<b>1. A Document With Only One Witness or One Disqualified Witness, 7 Seifim:</b> A written witness and an oral witness (without a kinyan) (Tur) may be combined. If the witness that did not write his testimony said that he made a kinyan from the party on this issue and the lender did not request he write his testimony, the witnesses can be combined to make the loan a documented one and the borrower would not be able to claim that he paid back. If the party that testified orally says that the document was given over in front of him, the document is a complete document and can be used to collect from encumbered properties. <i>RAMA: This is only true where they are able to say that the document was also given over in front of the written witness so that you now have two witnesses on the transfer. If, however, the document was only given over in front of one witness, (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rosh) the witnesses would not be combined to allow for collection from encumbered properties, even if there were two separate documents which each had one witness and were each handed over in front of one witness. (Tur)</i>
2. If one produces a loan document on another with a single witness and the borrower claims he paid back, he is obligated to swear but he is unable to do so and therefore must pay. If the borrower says that the lender should swear that he did not pay back, the lender must swear. If, however, the borrower claims he never borrowed, he would swear to refute the witness and would be exempt. There are those that say that the borrower is believed with an oath, even in a case where he claims he paid back.
3. If a document only contained two signatures and one of them turned out be a relative or otherwise disqualified, the document has the status of pottery, even if there were witnesses to the transfer. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that it has the status of a document with only one witness. This is only in a situation where the entire testimony would not become void as will be explained shortly.</i>
4. If a document contained numerous witnesses and one of them was discovered to be a relative or otherwise disqualified and the witnesses are not around to be interrogated, and there is clear testimony that they all sat down to sign because they had the intention to testify, the document is void. Otherwise, the testimony can be verified with the remaining witnesses because it is possible that the valid witnesses signed and left space for an elder to sign and this relative or disqualified witness signed without their knowledge. <i>(All of this was already explained above in 45:12).</i>
5. If a will was discovered to have a relative or an otherwise disqualified witnesses <i>(and is voided in the manner that was explained)</i>, the non-related witness may come in front of the court and testify if he remembers the testimony. If there is another witness that heard the will being given from outside, he can join with this witnesses to testify even though the deceased did not designate them as witnesses.
6. If one writes all of his property to two different individuals in one testimony and the witnesses are related to one of the recipients but not the other, the document is invalid because it is one testimony unless the recipient whom the witnesses are disqualified to withdraws himself from that money.<i>(Oral witnesses in such a case may testify for the recipient who is not their relative). (Mordechai Perek 2 of Gittin; Teshuvos Ritva; Beis Yosef Siman 37, 14)</i>  If, however, one document says “I gave Reuven this courtyard and I gave Shimon this courtyard,” and the witnesses are related to one but not the other, the gift is valid with respect to the recipient that they are not related to because these are two separate testimonies, notwithstanding the fact that it is one document. <i>RAMA: Similarly, if a document had two or three matters written in it and the document was voided for one matter, the other matters would not be voided. <i>(Moharam Padua Siman 44)</i></i>
7. If a document was given over in front of two witnesses, the lender can collect from encumbered properties with it, even if the witnesses <i>(did not)</i> sign the document. Nevertheless, if the witnesses that signed were discovered to be disqualified- even if only one witness was disqualified- the document is invalid even if it was given in front of two valid witnesses because it is inherently forged.

1. <b>A Document That Contains Interest or a Ripped Document, 2 Seifim:</b> A document that contains explicit interest cannot be used to collect the interest but may be used to collect the principal, even from encumbered properties. If, however, the lender included the principal with the interest, the document is invalid because the lender will come to also collect the interest. <i>RAMA: If the defendant confesses, however, he must pay back the principal. (Maharik Shoresh 17) And there are those that say that he is exempt because we fine the lender and therefore the borrower does not have to pay. (Ibid, in the name of the Mordechai; and so also writes Tosefos there and in other places) If, however, the lender lent the money via a messenger and the messenger made the document and included the principal with the interest, the lender may collect the principal because he can say to the messenger, “I sent you to benefit me and not to harm me by including the principal with the interest.” (Maharik there) See Yoreh Deah Siman 161 for more on these laws.</i> If a document is brought in front of us with a tear made by a court, which is a tear in the place of the witnesses, date and the substantive parts of the document or if it was torn vertically and horizontally, the document is invalid. If it is evident that the tear was done with a knife, the document is invalid even if it was not done vertically and horizontally. If the document was torn into two, it is worse than a court-made tear and would be invalid. <i>RAMA: If there are witnesses that the document was torn accidentally, the document has the same rules as a case where the document was erased, as was explained above in Siman 41. If the tear was not court-made but [version of the Sma] it appears to the judge that the court tore it and a party added to the tear in order to hide the court-made tear, one could not collect with it. Otherwise, we would not be concerned. (Baal HaTerumos there 57)</i>
2. If a document was erased or blurred out and the form was still recognizable, the document is valid. Otherwise, it would be invalid. If the document rotted or was made like a sieve, it is valid. <i>RAMA: If a moth or mice ate the document at the top, so long as the names of the lender and borrower and the primary part of the context is at the end, the document is valid. (Teshuvos HaRosh Klal 68 Siman 29; Teshuvos Maimoni on Mishpatim Siman 62)</i>

Siman 53

1. <b>Not To Modify the Document, 1 Seif:</b> If a person has a document against his friend for one maneh and he says to modify it to two documents of 50 each or if he has two documents of 50 each and says to make one document of 100 for him, we would not listen to him. <i>RAMA: It is forbidden to modify the document, even if they know that the first loan has not been paid back, unless they have the consent of the borrower. (HaMagid, Perek 23; Rabbeinu Yerucham)</i> Even if a lender has one document of 100 and says to tear it up and replace with a document for 50, we would not listen to him, because the borrower may have paid back the 100 and the lender gave him a receipt and now the lender will produce the document of 50 and say this is a different document and he will be able to collect with it.

Siman 54

1. <b>The Laws of Asmachata, Whether We Write a Receipt and How We Write a Receipt (And the Laws of a Payment Via Receipt), 5 Seifim: If one paid back a portion of his debt and the lender so desires, the court will create a document for him of the remainder that the borrower owes him. They will write the new document with the original date, but not with the original witnesses on the document <i>RAMA: Even if the borrower consents. (Rashbam) Following the date of repayment, however, the witnesses can make another document with the consent of the borrower. (Hagahos Ashiri) </i>If the lender wants, they will write a receipt for him. <i>The lender must pay the cost of having the scribe write the receipt. If the lender does not have a document and the borrower asks for a receipt, the borrower must pay the cost. (Nimukei Yosef)</i></b>
2. If one comes to pay back his loan and the lender says he lost the document, the borrower may not say that he will not pay back until the lender returns the document. Rather, the lender will write a receipt for him and the borrower will pay back the entire debt. The borrower does have the power to place a general cherem on anyone who hides a document and claims that it is lost. If the borrower claims with certainty that the document is in the lender’s possession and that the lender is leaving it in his wallet, the lender must take a heses oath that he lost the document. Following the oath, the borrower will pay the debt and the receipt will be written.
3. If the lender says he does not have the document in his possession right now but it is in another city and he will write a receipt, there are those that say that we do not listen to him because the document is in existence so the borrower does not have to pay back until the lender returns the document. <i>RAMA: All the more so would the borrower not be required to pay back until the document is returned in a case where the lender has the document in his possession and does not want to return it. Even if the borrower swore to pay back he would be exempt from complying with the oath. (Teshuvos Rashba, Aleph 110) If the lender says to pay him back first and then he will return the document and the borrower says to first return the document and then he’ll pay him, the borrower is in the right. (Ibid., and in Siman 113) It seems to me that if the lender does not trust the borrower he may give the document to a third party until the repayment has been completed. If one owes another a maneh in a document and confesses to 50 but has a claim on the other 50 and the possessor of the document says to give him the 50 the borrower admits to and he will bring a proof for the other 50 and the defendant says that he is not paying anything back until the lender returns the document, if the plaintiff has the ability to bring his proofs now and proceed with the case with the defendant, (See above Siman 24) then the defendant is in the right. If, however, it is impossible for the lender to bring his proofs now or be judged now, as determined by the court, and there is no trickery involved or where the court needs to be patient in ruling, the plaintiff is in the right and the borrower must pay what he admits to immediately and the lender will provide a receipt. (Ibid., Siman תתק"ל) If a document states that it shall remain in force so long as it has not been torn up with a tear of the court and does not contain a confirmation of repayment on the document, a receipt would still be effective. (Maharik, Shoresh 89) </i>When writing a receipt, if they recall the date of the document, they would write “receipt on the document dated such and such.” If they do not recall the date, they would simply write “on the document whose amount was such and such” and they would not write a date on the receipt lest the witnesses postdated the date of the loan in the document, which may result in the date of receipt preceding the date of the document and the lender will produce the later loan document and collect with it. Therefore, witnesses should not write a date in the receipt unless they remember the date of the loan. A receipt that simply says, “so and so paid back so and so” nullifies that any document that the lender has against the borrower. <i>RAMA: Similarly, if a borrower has witnesses that so and so has a repaid document in his possession, such so and so would not be able to produce a document against the borrower and say that it was a different document that was paid back. Rather, all of this lender’s documents have the status of being repaid. (the Rosh in his Teshuvos, Klal 18, Siman 19)</i>
4. If the document and receipt are dated for the same day, the law was explained in 43:26.
5. If the receipt just says “dinarim,” it nullifies any document that has dinar in it. If, however, it says “such and such dinarim” and the amount was erased or if the amount was written on erasure and was not verified, we would judge it as if it had the lowest possible amount under that language.

Siman 55

1. <b>The Laws of One Who Paid Back a Portion of His Debt and One Who Gives His Document to a Third Party, 2 Seifim:</b> <i>(The words of the Rambam, Perek 11 מה' מכירה)</i>One who paid back a portion of his debt and gave the document to a third party and said “if I do not pay you back by such and such date, give the lender the document” and the borrower did not pay at that time, the third party should not give over the document because this is an asmachta, which is not a valid kinyan. [<i>Ed. Note: An Asmachta is a conditional commitment or promise that a person makes, but actually has no intention of keeping. The agreement is not considered binding, and the commitment is considered null and void.</i>] If they made a kinyan on it in a prestigious court, the party would acquire the document, so long as his rights were being held by the court and an unforeseen occurrence did not occur. How so? If the court is holding on to his document or receipt and they made a kinyan from him that if he does not come by such and such date, then it should be given to his adversary, and the day comes and he does not show up, the court would give it. If he was held up by a river or by a sickness, they would not give it. The same applies to anything similar, so long as it was in a prestigious court. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that we do not require the court to hold on to his document if they have a made a kinyan in a prestigious court, which is three individuals who are experts in the laws of asmachta. (Tur in the name of the Rosh and the Moharam) See later Siman 207. If a third party gives over a document to the lender that he was not supposed to, we excommunicate the third party until he accepts any damages that result to the borrower because of this. (Teshuvos Rashba Aleph 52) If the court is aware that it was returned illegally, they would not judge on the basis of that document. (Beis Yosef in the name of Rashba) If the court was unaware and they took all the money from the borrower and it subsequently became known that the third party returned the document illegally, the third party is exempt because it is an indirect damage. (Teshuvos Rashba Aleph 52)</i>
2. When is it true that we give the document to a party’s adversary? Where he says, “If I do not pay back by such and such date, the money that I gave shall be considered a gift and the document shall remain in its original state,” because otherwise it would be a document whose lien was waived for the portion that was paid <i>(See Siman 100:4) (and the lender would not be able to collect anything other than unencumbered properties). (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rosh)</i>

Siman 56

1. <b> Laws of a Third Party, 7 Seifim:</b> A third party, so long as he has the item that was given to him in his possession, is believed as if there were two witnesses, even if he is related. He is not required to take an oath. <i>RAMA: Even if the handing over to the third party was written in a document, we do not say that they are not relying on the concept of a third party. Rather, here too the third party would be believed. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba)</i> Even if the timeframe given to hand over the document has passed and the third party has not given the document, he still is a third party and he is believed. The third party is believed even if one of the parties contradicts him and says he never made him a third party. The third party is even believed where both parties contradict him so long as there is no dispute between the parties and the third party regarding the amount of money in his possession, because otherwise the third party would have a stake in the matter and would not be believed <i>RAMA: In a case where the third party does not have a migu. If, however, the third party has a migu, he is believed. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaChovel') [Ed. Note: A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the litigant could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie. To be effective, the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid.] The parties may force him to swear, even with an uncertain claim. (Hagahos Mordechai, Gitin)</i> If the third party had the document, produced it in court and says it was paid back, he would be believed even if the document was verified because had he wanted he could have burnt or torn the document. Similarly, if the third party died and a writing was discovered in the third party’s possession saying the document that he had was paid back, the document is considered paid back even if there are no witnesses on the writing. <i>(See later Siman 65 with respect to these laws)</i>. If, however, a writing was produced from the lender’s possession saying that so and so’s document was paid back, it is treated as a joke, even if it was written in the lender’s handwriting. <i>(The plaintiff must pay the expenses of the third party). (Hagahos Mordechai)</i>
2. If witnesses contradicted the third party and said this was not the condition you were made a third party over, the witnesses would be believed. When is this true? Where the third party says, “on this and this day the third-party-item was handed over to me with such and such condition,” and the witnesses contradict him. If, however, he simply says this is the condition on the item which was given to me, he would be believed, even if the witnesses say that there was no such condition when it was handed over because the parties may have come to the third party later and made the condition after it was handed over. Even if the third party does not make this claim, we make the claim for him so that he will not be contradicted by witnesses. <i>RAMA: With respect to a third party, there is no distinction between a case where both parties gave it to him or just the lender gave it to him to be a third party. (Beis Yosef in the name of Teshuvos HaRashba)</i>
3. The third party should only give over the item in court and explain the terms of the handing over to the third party because a disagreement may arise among them and when the item is produced by the third party he will only be believed like a solo witness [version of the Sma]. Therefore, the court must write and sign the details. <i>RAMA: This - that the third party is believed like a solo witness even though the item is not his possession - is only where the parties have removed themselves from him and do not have any complaints against him. If, however, they have complaints with respect to the handing over of the item, the third party now has a stake in the matter and has no believability at all. The same applies if the third party was related or otherwise disqualified. (Tur)</i>
4. If a document is produced by a third party and the borrower claims that the document is forged or was paid back and they cannot verify the witnesses’ signatures, the third party is not believed, even if he testified that the lender and borrower gave it to him and told him such and such amount was remaining in the document that was required to be paid back.
5. If a document was given over to a third party so that the borrower would pay back by such and such date and the time has passed and the borrower claims he paid back in time or the borrower died, we assume the document has not been paid back and the third party will return the document to the lender. If the borrower had died, the lender can only collect with an oath as is the rule for anyone who comes to collect from orphans. If one obligated himself to another in a document with a kinyan and the obligated party deposited the document with another and died, the third party should not give the document to the lender nor return it to the borrower’s inheritors.
6. If a third party was created via a messenger, such as where the borrower came with another who had a collateral or document in his possession and that other person tells the third party that the lender made him a messenger to bring this to you and hand it over on such and such condition, and the third party accepted the item and the lender later comes and contradicts the messengership and says he never made this individual a messenger for this matter, the third party can do what the messenger told him to. <i>RAMA: If the lender does not contradict the messengership, but the third party does not want to accept it and the item remains in the possession of the messenger, the messenger does not have the status of a third party but that of a messenger and he must return the item to the party that gave it. (Beis Yosef in the name of Teshuvos HaRashba) The third party must always comply with the terms of the handing-over, even if one of the parties later has a claim on it. How so? If Reuven agreed with Shimon, who owed him money, on a (payback) date and deposited the document with Levi on the condition that if Shimon does not pay back by a certain date then Levi will return the document and be able to collect everything in one shot and Shimon did not pay by the prescribed time, Levi must return the document even if he knows that Shimon has claims on this because he is not a judge- just a third party. Therefore, he must return the document to Reuven and before he produces it he should describe in front of witnesses how the document came to him and what the conditions were. The witnesses will write and sign the details and provide it to the third party who will give it to Shimon, and Shimon can now claim what he wants. (Tur in the name of Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 105, Seif 6) And therefore, any third party who returns a document should not be concerned that he acted improperly or that he was not an expert in the laws of a third party unless there was some other negative factor. (Teshuvos Rashba, Siman תתק"א)</i>
7. If a woman was transacting within the home or a guardian was appointed on the homeowner’s properties and the homeowner died and the woman or guardian knows that the homeowner was in possession of other’s properties that was now in their possession and they know who it belongs to, the woman and guardian must return each one of their properties. If they did not return the properties and they were brought to court, they would be believed with a migu.

Siman 57

1. <b>The Law That One Is Prohibited From Retaining a Repaid Document, 2 Seifim:</b> One is prohibited from retaining a repaid document in his home <i>(and the same applies for a document whose lien has been waived). (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 78)</i> If a party does not want to return a repaid document, it is appropriate to place a nidui [i.e. may shun him] on him until he returns it. A party may not hold on to the document in order to obtain reimbursement of the cost of the scribe. <i>RAMA: And in a place where the borrower does not pay for the scribe’s wages, the lender is not required to return the document so long as he tears it up. (Beis Yosef, Siman 61 in the name of the Rashba)</i> A lender may, however, hold on to a document of a maneh even though the borrower has paid back 50. The lender must write a receipt on top of the document for that which was repaid or write a separate receipt and provide it to the borrower.
2. A document that one borrowed with and repaid cannot be reused to borrow again, as was explained in Siman 48. If the borrower says he paid back and the lender says it is true but the lender gave the borrower the money back, the lender has admitted that the lien has been waived and he cannot collect with the document. If, however, the lender says I returned the money to you so that you could exchange it because the money would only be accepted in a pressing situation, the document is still valid.

Siman 58

1. <b>One Who Produces a Loan Document Against His Adversary, 4 Seifim:</b> If one produces a verified loan document against his adversary and the adversary says he paid it back and the lender admits that he was paid but says there was another verbal loan that was still outstanding and he accepted the money for that other loan and this document remains in its valid state, the lender is believed if the borrower did not pay back in front of witnesses. The lender may collect without an oath if the document contains a believability clause. If the borrower later brings a claim that the lender took the money illegally, the lender would take a heses oath and be exempt. If the document does not contain a believability clause, the lender may only collect with an oath. If the borrower did not personally pay back but sent the money via a messenger, the messenger is required to pay back the borrower that sent him, whether the borrower had said to take the document  <i>(And see later Siman 130, Seif 5)</i>and then give the money or give the money and then take the document. <i>(Ibid.) RAMA: There are those that say that since the messenger is required to pay, the lender cannot hold on to the money if he says the borrower owes him for something else, unless the lender claims the messenger gave it to him for that other debt. There are those that disagree and hold that the lender may claim the borrower owes him for something else in all cases. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaKotev Shtei Hedeyot') Similarly, if one gave a deposit to another, and the guardian says that the deposited item belongs to a third party who owes the guardian money and the guardian claims that such third party gave the depositor the item as a messenger, the guardian has the right to claim up to the value of the item with a migu that he returned the item, notwithstanding the fact that the depositor will need to reimburse the third party. If, however, he says that the depositor did not mention the third party and simply deposited the item with him but the guardian claims that the item really belongs to the third party, the guardian cannot hold on to the item since we cannot prove that the third party owed the guardian money. (Rivash, Siman 293) There are those that say this is only where the item came to the guardian as a deposit. If, however, he grabbed it from the depositor and he has a migu, the guardian can say that the owner of the item owed him money and the depositor would be liable to pay the owner because he was negligent. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 84 in the name of the Ritva; and the Ritva writes more in Perek HaKotev, see there)</i> If, however, the borrower did not mention that the messenger should take the document, the messenger would be exempt <i> since the borrower did not tell the messenger to give the money in front of witnesses. (Tur)</i>
2. If the borrower claims he paid back in front of so and so and so and so and those individuals come and testify that he paid back but did not mention the document, and the lender responds that it was a different loan that the borrower paid him back for, the document is void. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that the document is not completely void and if the lender were to grab the money we would not take it away from him. (Tur, in the name of the Rosh and the R"an) This seems to me to be the primary ruling. </i> When is this true? When the witnesses testify that the borrower gave the money to the lender as repayment. If, however, they saw the borrower gave the money but did not know if it was for repayment, a deposit or a gift and the lender says the payment never occurred, the lender has been established as a liar and the document is void. If the lender says the repayment was for a different debt, he would be believed and he would swear and collect what is in the document because he was not paid back in front of witnesses and since he could have said the money was a gift he is believed to say it was repayment for a separate debt. <i>RAMA: There are those that disagree and say that even in such a case the document has been weakened. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Tam and the Rosh; and so writes the Rav the Magid in the name of the Ramban; and so write the R"an) And this seems to me to be the primary ruling because the burden of proof is on the party taking away the money. This is all where the money was given in front of two witnesses. If, however, it was given in front of a solo witness, we do not say the document was been weakened. (Tur, in the name of the Ramban) And see later Siman 70.</i>
3. If the borrower says 'this debt was for the value of the ox I purchased from you and you collected the value of its meat', and the document-holder says 'it is true that I collected that money but it was for a different outstanding debt', because he admits that the debt was for the ox and he collected from the ox, the document is void if there were witnesses that the borrower paid him the value of the ox. There are those that write that even if there are no witnesses that the borrower repaid from the ox, the borrower can take a heses oath that he paid back. <i>(The primary view is the first opinion). (If it is known that the borrower gave some of the money on one debt, the lender cannot claim that other money was for a different debt). (Maharik, Shoresh 120)</i>
4. If one owes another two debts and the borrower pays back without specifying, the lender has the ability to say 'I accepted it for such and such loan'. Moreover, even if the borrower were to say at the time of repayment, “here is the money for such and such loan,” and the lender accepts it without comment, the lender may later say that he took the money for a verbal loan or another debt. <i>(See later Siman 83, Seif 5).</i>
5. If the borrower gave the lender a maneh to give to another creditor, the lender may keep the money for himself.

Siman 59

1.<b> A Verified Document Where the Borrower Claims It Has Been Repaid and the Lender Says He Does Not Know, 1 Seif: If a lender produces a verified loan document and the borrower claims he paid it back and the lender says he is unsure, the lender cannot collect with it. If the lender later says 'I investigated my records and I now remember with certainty that the document is unpaid', he may collect with it.</b>

Siman 60

1. <b>The Laws of a Lien on Movable Items Via Real Property and the Laws of a Lien On an Item That Has Not Yet Come Into Existence, 12 Seifim:</b> If one comes to collect a debt from the borrower and the borrower does not have the funds corresponding to the entire debt, the borrower may collect from real property that the borrower had at the time he borrowed from this lender, which he later sold or gave away. With respect to real property that the borrower purchased after he borrowed from this lender that he later sold or gave away, however, the lender may not collect such land. If the document states that the borrower is mortgaging properties that he has already purchased and those that he will purchase in the future, the lender may also collect from them. There is no security, however, on movable items, even those that the borrower had at the time he borrowed, which for the time being he has sold or given away, and the lender may not collect from them. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items that the borrower has via his real property and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document”- see later Simans 113 and 202 – then the lender may collect from movable items that he had at the time he borrowed just as the lender may collect from the real property. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items via the real property that he currently owns and that he will own in the future and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document,” the lender may even collect movable items that the borrower purchased subsequent to the loan which he later sold or gave away just as he may collect from real property. This is all the law under the Talmud. Today, although we have the custom to write in all documents that the borrower is mortgaging movable items via real property, the custom is not to collect from movable times which the borrower sold, gave away or gave as collateral because of a “market regulation.” Even under this custom, if the borrower had a loan document on a third party which he sold, the lender may collect from that loan because the “market regulation” is not applicable considering this is an uncommon case. Similarly, if the borrower gave away all his properties to a third party and did not retain anything for himself, it is clear circumstantial evidence that he did it just to avoid the debt and the “market regulation” is inapplicable. See later 99:6.
2. If one obligated himself to an unspecified amount, such as where he obligated himself to support or clothe his friend for five years <i>(or where there is no set amount of years) (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashba)</i>, the Rambam is of the opinion that he is not obligated, even if a kinyan was made. All those that came after the Rambam disagreed with him and said that he would be obligated and this is how we rule. See later at the end of Siman 207.
3. If one obligated himself to support his friend and the giver wants to provide fruit whereas the recipient demands money, the recipient is in the right. If the giver explicitly conditioned to support the recipient on the giver’s table and the recipient does not want to eat with him, the giver only is required to give him based on the cost of having the recipient eat in the giver’s home. <i>RAMA: If, however, the hold-up is not coming from the one being supported but from the obligated party, the obligated party must give the complete cost of the food. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Ritva) If the recipient gets sick, the giver does not have to pay his medical expenses and must only pay the value of the food that the recipient received while healthy. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 207 in the name of the Ritva, Perek 'HaNoseh') There are those that say that where one simply agrees to support his friend, the language implies he will support him his entire lifetime or so long as he needs it. (R"an, Perek Mi She'Achazu; Beis Yosef in the Tur Even HaEzer Siman 114 inb the name of the Rashba) There are those that say that if one simply agrees to support the other or provide him with 100 gold coins for the year, he will be exempt from just one year of his agreement. (Teshuvos HaRosh 26, Siman 24) If one accepts to support his friend based on his prestige, the court will evaluate what the recipient was accustomed to prior to the obligation. (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 75; Tur Siman 207) Dress is not included in the category of food unless the giver says he will feed and support because clothing is included in support. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba) If one writes to his friend that he will support him for a set amount of time or give him 100 dinar and he supported him a little bit but then stopped, the giver does not need to provide 100 dinar. Rather, he must reimburse for the difference between the value for the food given and 100 dinar, but no more than 100 dinar, because he certainly did not intend to give 100 dinar unless he did not provide any support. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashba) If Reuven accepts on himself to support Shimon and his wife and began supporting them and Shimon’s wife died, Reuven is exempt from providing her support. Even if Reuven had set up a set amount for the support of Shimon’s wife, he is still exempt from that portion. (Teshuvos HaRashba) </i>
4. If one obligates himself simply to support his friend or to support him on his table and the giver dies, the inheritors are required to support him in the same manner the deceased was required to <i>(because “his table” is not literal).</i>
5. If two individuals obligated themselves to support one person, the law is the same as where two individuals borrowed from one person. See Even Haezer 114:7.
6. If one obligates himself for a matter that is not yet in existence or is not available to him, he is still obligated notwithstanding the fact that one cannot make a kinyan on a matter not yet in existence because that is only with respect to a kinyan made in the language of a sale or gift. Even where one writes a lien on a field, mortgages all of his properties or even gives it as a collateral, it is of no effect. When one uses a language of being obligated however, such as where he says “you are my witnesses that I am obligated to so and so, such and such,” he would be obligated, so long as they made a kinyan from him. If Reuven produces a document with a kinyan against Shimon which says, “because I gave him 100 gold coins and mortgaged all my properties for him to collect from,”<i>( but did not obligate himself personally) (Beis Yosef)</i> and Shimon claims that at the time the document was written against him he did not have the money and a person cannot make a kinyan on something not yet in existence and the gold coins in the document are coins that people generally transact with, the coins cannot be acquired via chalipin [barter]. If that country does not generally transact with those gold coins, they could be acquired via chalipin  - see later 211:6- but they must have been in Shimon’s possession at the time of the kinyan. If it is unknown whether it was in his possession, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. <i>RAMA: If the plaintiff claims with certainty that it was in the defendant’s possession and the defendant denies it, the defendant must swear. (Tur, in the name of the R"if) The defendant is believed to say he gave it already it with a migu that he could have said it was not in his possession at the time of the loan. However, this is all according to the reasoning of the R"if and some others. Many others, however, disagree with this and hold that anyone who says 'I gave so and so, such and such', is an admission by a party and has the status of 100 witnesses. We do not investigate how it was given because once he was confessed we assume he gave it in an effective manner and the recipient would acquire it. (Tur, in the name of the Raavad; the Rosh, end of Klal 36; R"if and see in the Beis Yosef)</i>
7. If Reuven lent a maneh to Shimon and some time after that, Shimon wrote a document for Reuven with a kinyan that states, “because I borrowed from so and so, such and such, I am obligated to him and I am giving my land as collateral,” so and so would acquire the collateral.
8. If Reuven produced a document that Shimon borrowed from Levi, Reuven claims that Levi was Reuven’s messenger and Levi just used his own name and Reuven did not object, Shimon claims that he has no privity with Reuven because Reuven does not have a power-of-attorney from Levi, (Tur) Levi admits to Reuven that he was a messenger and Levi’s admission does not cause harm to any others, we would force Shimon to pay Reuven. If Levi were to waive the loan to Shimon, the loan would not be waived.
9. If Reuven lent money to Levi and at the time of the loan Reuven tells Levi that the witnesses should write the document in Shimon’s name but give the document to Reuven, and when Reuven makes a claim from Levi at the prescribed time Levi claims that he has no privity, Reuven is in the right. If Reuven makes a claim against Shimon that he should write a sale document on this document that is written in Shimon’s name, we would not force Shimon to do so. Even if Shimon were to agree to write the sale document, he may retract. If, however, Reuven told the borrower at the time of the loan, that he is giving the loan on the condition that you write a document for me in Shimon’s name and when I decide you will replace it with one in my name, we would force the borrower on this point. Even if Reuven did not explain his words and just told the witnesses in front of the borrower that they will write another document for him, we would obligate the borrower to write another document in Reuven’s name. If a document was written in Reuven’s name and at the end before the witnesses’ signature the document states, “this money is from the congregation’s property,” and Reuven claims that since it was written in his name the congregation must have given him this document on money that he had entrusted with them and the congregation contradicts him, the congregation is in the right.
10. If Shimon owed a maneh to Reuven and they compromised to have Shimon create a loan document for Levi of 20 dinar and subsequently Reuven created a waiver document for Shimon on all monetary claims, and Shimon now claims that because it was not Levi who lent him money, but Reuven, and Reuven has waived all monetary claims, this debt is included, Shimon is in the right.
11. If one lends another with a collateral on real property and the lender instructs to write the property in the name of the lender’s minor son, and now the borrower is claiming that the lender has no privity with him, there is no substance in the borrower’s words.
12. If a woman claims on real property that her husband left behind that half of it is from money that she inherited from her father’s home and the documents are written in both of their names, the woman is in the right. If the documents are written exclusively in her name and she claims they’re all hers, they all belong to her.

"You have a Maneh of mine from a certain loan, and another Maneh from another loan which I lent you at a different time, such and such," and the defendant responds: "I have none of your money, for I paid you back for the first loan such and such, and for the second such and such" and the Beth Din realized from their claims that he still owes him twenty dinars from those two loans -- it is like [the case in the Talmud where] there are two witnesses who testify that he owes fifty, for the Beth Din are witnesses to what he has admitted that he still has not repaid, and the defendant makes a biblically ordained oath on the remainder. Rem"a: And specifically in the case where the Beth Din realized that the defendant admitted to still owing some of it according to his own accounting, but if he is obligated in the remainder because his claim is not believed -- that is not a partial admission (Bet Yosef in the name of the Rashb"a) and see below 87:5.

In what case does the above apply? When they are gripping the edge of the garment, such that neither of them is holding 3 (fingers) by 3 -- then we split it, even if the garment is embroidered with gold and the gold is nearer to one of them, yet he cannot say "split it horizontally; so that the gold will be in my portion", rather we split it lengthwise, so that they will receive it equally. But if each has some of it in his hand, and he says "all of it is mine" and he says "all of it is mine", he receives until the point that his hand reaches and he receives until the point that his hand reaches, and the remainder is split equally, and they swear upon it, as we shall explain, and each one of them can make the other swear that what they took they took lawfully, by way of the oath upon the remainder.

They must distance a fixed threshing floor fifty cubits from the city so that the wind does not bring the chaff while they are threshing and damage the people of the city. And if the threshing floor existed prior to the building of the city, the people of the city may remove it and pay him its value. If it is doubtful [which came first] he must remove it without payment. And from here there is one who learned with regard to a Duke from a city that decreed against the Jews that the Jews living in certain small villages must live under his rule or he will expel them all, that they must fulfill the directives of the duke in order to remove the potential damages to the many, and that first they must go to the Duke and only after can they sue the other Jews if they were damaged by this (Hagahot Mordecai, Kiddushin). And similarly, a person may not put a threshing floor on his own property unless there are fifty cubits in each direct, so that the chaff does not damage his friends plants or furrow. 

Siman 156





The residents of an alleyway can force one another not to set up among themselves, [a shop of] a tailor, a tanner or any other of the types of craftsmen. If there was one of the residents of the alleyway who was [already working as] a craftsman and they did not protest against him or if there was [already] a bathhouse or a shop or a mill, and someone comes and makes another bathhouse next to him, [the owner of the first cannot] prevent him, saying, "You are cutting off my livelihood." Even if [the owner of the second] is from another alleyway, they cannot be prevented, since that type of craft is already in their midst. <i>Gloss: And [according to] the many that say that the residents of the courtyard or a dead end alleyway may protest, the craftsman may [nevertheless] not protest and say, "You are cutting off my livelihood" (Beit Yosef in the name of many decisors).</i> However a stranger from another country who comes to open a shop next to [a pre-existing] shop or a bathhouse next to [a pre-existing] bathhouse, may be prevented by them. But if [the stranger]  has contributed along with them to the royal tax, they cannot prevent him. <i>Gloss...</i>

The residents of the city may prevent merchants from bringing their merchandise into the cities for retail sale, in the way of shopkeepers. But if [these merchants] sell only on the market day, they cannot be prevented, provided they do the selling in the market; but they must not go from door to door even on a market day. If they have a debt [to collect] in the city, they may sell as much as they need for their livelihood, even when it is not a market day, until they collect their debts and leave. <i>Gloss: And likewise concerning lending with interest to [gentiles] may they prevent [outsiders]. But they may not prevent them if they come on the market day and lend with interest to the people of the [many] cities who gather there to come to the market (Tur and Hagahot Maimoniot, Chapter 6 of the Laws of Neighbors). If they have a debt [to collect] in the city, they may lend as much as they need for their livelihood, so that they can collect their debts (Tur and Beit Yosef in the name of Tosafot and the Rosh). There are those who say that the ability of residents of a city to [prevent] residents of another place [from opening a business in their city], is only when there will be no loss to the buyers; whereby [the proposed new business] would sell [at the same prices] as the other residents of the city, and that their merchandise would likewise be no better than that of the residents of the city. However if they were to sell the merchandise for cheaper or it were to be better, such that the buyers would benefit, the [original] merchants may not protest (the Rosh and Tur in the name of Rabbi Y. HaLevi). And this is only when the buyers are Israelites, but not for gentiles that would benefit (Rabbenu Yerucham 31:6 and Hagahot Maimoniot, Chapter 10 of the Laws of Neighbors). [Additionally, if the new business] would bring different merchandise, which the residents of the city did not have - even if not cheaper in price or better - they may not prevent [them] (Beit Yosef in the name of the decisors)...</i>

<b>Two people that share a courtyard and are coming to divide [it], how should they build the wall. And there are 13 clauses in it.</b> A shared courtyard that is subject to the law of division, or that they divided willingly even though it is not [large enough to be] subject to the law of division - each one of them may compel his fellow to build a wall in the middle so that his fellow not see him when he is using his portion. And even if they remained like this many years without a partition, he may compel him to make a partition anytime he wants. <i>Gloss: And even if there is a custom in the city not to make it, they do not follow it and compel him to make it (Tur in the name of the Rosh, and Nimukei Yosef at the beginning of Bava Batra). And even if one of them said, "I assumed possession like this without a wall, and you pardoned me," it is not effective unless there are witnesses that they pardoned each other for the damage to visual privacy. [Then] they may no longer protest (Tur in the name of the Rosh).</i>
A place that is not subject to the law of division, in which those sharing it wanted to divide it - even though they acquired it from [each other] - each one can retract about it, as this is [only] a verbal acquisition. But if each one chose his portion, one wanting direction x and one wanting direction y, and they acquired it from each other like this, they can not retract. And likewise, if this one went by himself and assumed possession over his portion and that one went by himself and assumed possession over his portion - even though they did not acquire it from [each other] - none of them may retract towards his fellow. Some say that even if he assumed possession not in front of his fellow and did not say to him, "Go and possess and acquire it," he acquired it. And even if only one assumed possession, the other one acquired the other portion. <i>Gloss: And see below in Paragraph 171, about the laws of the places of synagogues.</i>

The residents of a town can force one another <i>(even the minority can force the majority - Rabbneu Yerucham 6:31)</i> to put up a wall with gates and a bolt for the town; and to build a synagogue and to buy a book of the Torah, Prophets and Writings so that anyone from the community may read from them. <i>Gloss/Rema: And the same is true for all the needs of the town and see Orachot Chaim 55 - Laws of Hiring a Cantor for the People of the Town; and also ibid., 53. And the residents of the town can force one another to provide hospitality for guests, distribute charity to them and to contribute to the charity container (Mordekhai on Bava Barta: Chapter 1; Teshuvot Maimoni on Mishneh Torah, Acquisition 59). And see above Choshen Mishpat 4 and Choshen Mishpat 7 regarding whether if the people of the town have a case with an individual, they can judge him. And... And regarding expenses that were spent to get rid of a talebearer, all of the residents of the town are obligated to give towards this (Rosh in a responsum, Principle 6: 21, 27  and repeated below Choshen Mishpat 288). And with a matter that the community is not able to be in agreement about, all the heads of households that pay taxes should convene and accept upon themselves that each one proclaim his opinion for the sake of heaven, and [then] go according to the majority. And if the minority [refuses to go along], the majority can force them [to comply] - even through the laws of the idolaters - and to extricate money form them, and they must give their portion. And backed by the ban (cherem), the opinion of one who refuses to state his  opinion is nullified, and we follow the majority of those stating their opinion (Responsum of Mohoram, Sefer Kinyan 27; Hagahot Maimoniot on MT, Prayer 11). And see Yoreh Deah 256, as to when he is obligated to give to the charity container.</i>

Chapter 227 (Topics): Until what amount is considered forgiven or requires return of the defrauded funds; and a representative that errs; and brothers that that erred in dividing (an inheritance). In this chapter are 39 sections.                                One is prohibited from defrauding his friend, whether in buying from him, whether selling to him. Whichever of them defrauds, whether it is the buyer or seller, violates a negative commandment. 
How much must the defrauding be, for one to be required to return it? One sixth, exactly. How so? If one sold an item worth six for five, or an item worth seven for six; or worth five for six, or worth six for seven; these are cases of defrauding. And the item is purchased and the party that defrauded is obligated to return the defrauded amount to the one defrauded. 
If the defrauded amount is less than this (1/6) by even the smallest amount, for example an item worth seventy went for 60 plus one perutah, he is not obligated to return anything; as anything less than exactly one sixth, as a rule is forgiven by all.

Siman 228

Just as there is oppression in commercial transactions, so too is there oppression with words. And verbal oppression is more serious than financial oppression, because money can be returned, whereas words cannot be returned; and one has to do with a person's self, whereas the other [just] has to do with their money. So one who cries out (in prayer) over being verbally oppressed is answered immediately. <i>Gloss...</i>
One must be extra cautious with respect to afflicting a convert, whether afflicting him personally or his property, because the Torah prohibits it in many places.
One must be cautions with respect to afflicting his wife because her tears are readily available.
What is affliction with words? A person should not say, “how much are you willing to accept for this item,” when he has no intention of purchasing it. If donkey-riders were looking to purchase grain, one may not say to them to go to so and so when he knows that person has nothing to sell. If someone had repented from his earlier ways, one may not say to him “remember your earlier actions.” If one is the son of converts, one may not say to him, “remember your father’s actions.” If a person was suffering a person may not tell him what Iyov was told by his friends, “is your fear of heaven not your confidence? Do you remember, please, anyone innocent who was destroyed?” If one is asked a question on a certain subject he should not tell someone who is unfamiliar with that subject to give an answer on this matter. The same applies to anything similar.
One must be careful not to give a negative nickname to another person. Even if the person is regularly called by that nickname, if your intention is to embarrass them, then it is prohibited. 
One is prohibited from defrauding another in commerce or misleading them. For example, if the item has a defect, he must inform the buyer. Even if the buyer is a gentile, he cannot sell non-kosher meat with the presumption that it is kosher. One cannot mislead others with words by showing that he is doing some for him when he is not. How so? A person should not invite someone to eat with him where he knows he won’t come. He should not send a lot of gifts where he knows he will not accept. He should not open barrels that he is opening for a storekeeper and the other will assume he opened them for him. Rather, he must inform the other that he did not open for him. If it is something that the other should have realized was not being done for him, and he mislead himself by assuming it was done for his honor, such as where he meets someone on the street and assumes he came specifically to greet him, he would not have to inform the other.
One may not say, “smear oil from this jug” when the jug is empty or go to a mourner’s house with an empty vessel and the mourner will think it is full of wine. If he does it to bring honor to the mourner it is permitted.
One may not sell skin of an animal that died with the understanding that it was slaughtered. One may not send a barrel of wine with oil floating on top to another.
One may not artificially adorn a person, animal or vessels, such as by dying the beard of a slave that is being sold so that he looks young or feeding an animal bran-liquid which will fatten the animal and make its hairs stand up so that it looks fat. Similarly, one many not comb or rake an animal so that its hairs stand up or dye old vessels so they look like new. One may not blow up innards so they look fat and wide. One may not soak meat in water to so that it should look white and fat.
One may not combine a few inferior fruits with many beautiful fruits in order to sell them as beautiful, even if he would be combining new fruits with new fruits. It goes without saying that one cannot combine new with old or even old with new, even if the old was more expensive than the new, because the buyer wants to age them.
With respect to wine, the authorities permitted one to combine strong with weak only in the winepress, because it makes the wine better. All the more so would one be permitted to combine weak with strong. If the taste can be detected, one can combine anywhere because anything where taste can be detected will be discovered by the buyer and thus can always be combined.
One may not combine water with wine. One who had his water combined with his wine may not sell it in a store unless he informs the buyer. He may not sell it to a merchant, even if he informs him, because the merchant may defraud others.
In a place where the custom is to combine water in the winepress, one is permitted to combine the amount that is the practice to combine.
In a place where the custom is that anyone who purchases something first tastes the product, one is always permitted to combine. If not everyone tastes, however, that would not apply.
One may not combine wine sediments with wine. Even if one is purchasing two barrels of wine, the seller may not combine the sediments of one barrel with the other. If they purchased a barrel of wine by a specific amount per measurement, when the buyer comes to measure, the seller may mix the sediments with the wine and sell everything together.
A merchant may take from five threshing floors and place it one place or wine from five winepresses and place it in one barrel because everyone is aware he did not grow them all in his own property and that is the presumption of those that buy from him, so long as he does not intentionally purchase the majority from a superior location so that he earns a reputation that he acquires everything from a superior location, when he is actually purchasing from an inferior location and combining.
One is permitted to remove the waste from grits and beans so that they look nice because this is something visible and a buyer will be able to see and understand how much more the product is worth because the waste has been removed, so long as the seller does not remove the waste on top and leave the waste on bottom.
A storekeeper is permitted to distribute toasted grain and nuts to children to get them to buy from him frequently. Similarly, he may sell below market rate to get people to buy from him, and the others in the market cannot stop him. See above 156:5.
One is prohibited from combining any amount of sediment with either wine or oil.
If one sells refined oil to another, the buyer does not accept the sediments. If he sold oil without specification, the buyer would accept 1.5 lug of sediments for every 100 lug. He would also accept other sediments of murky oil that rises on top of the oil in addition to the know sediments of that location. When is this true? Where the buyer gave money in Tishrei when the oil is murky and took the oil in Nisan using the Tishrei measurement, which is larger because of the oil that congeals on top. If he purchased using a Nisan measurement, which is small because the oil is already clear, however, he would only accept the sediments. There are those who say the seller would not have to deduct the sediments. Rather, the seller is permitted to combine the sediments in his barrels. If he did not combine, however, he cannot deduct the sediments other than those floating on top. When is this true? Where the seller sold them when the oil was murky. If he sold it when it was clear, however, he would not even be able to deduct the sediments floating on top.

One who sells to his friend one species of  fruit and gives him a different species, there is no sale and both can exchange back items. How so? He sold him white wheat and they were found red, or vice versa. Or wine and it was found vinegar or vice versa. Or olive trees and they were found sycamore or vice versa. However, if he sold nice looking wheat and they were found bad, the buyer can return them even if he was not tricked about the price. The buyer cannot give them back even if they became more expensive. If the buyer sold bad wheat and they were found to be nicer, even if there was no deceit around the price, the seller can retract and the buyer cannot retract even if they were made cheaper. If he sold him bad and they were found to be bad, or if he sold him nice and they were found to be nice 

Siman 234



However, one who sells to his friend something that is prohibited to eat from the Rabbis, if they were fruit that existed, he returns the fruit and receives his money. If he ate them, then he ate them and the seller does not return anything to him.
Any prohibition against benefit whether it is from the torah or it is from the Rabbis, he is returned his money and there is no aspect of laws of a sale at all.

<b>About which thing is one obligated to announce [its finding] and which thing is it the finders. And there are 21 paragraphs about it.</b>

One who finds a lost object is only obligated to announce something that has an identifying mark on itself, or when its location, its knots, its amount, its measurement or its weight is fitting to give as an identifying mark. But if it has no identifying mark, even in its location - such as if it is clear that it was not placed there intentionally, but rather came there in the manner of being dropped: If it something that can be assumed that its owners noticed very soon [after] it fell from them - either because of its heaviness or because of its significance and he is always feeling for it, so he notices when it falls - it is surely the finders. As behold, [the owner] abandoned [it] immediately when he knew that if fell, for it has no identifying mark. Hence it came to the hand of [the finder] permissibly, as its owners had abandoned it. But if [the object was] not [like this, the finder] is obligated to return it - even though [the owners] abandoned it afterwards - since it came to his hand before [its] abandonment.



If one found scattered produce: If [they are] in the manner of being [intentionally] placed, he should not touch them; if [they are] in the manner of being dropped, they are surely [the finders].
One who finds bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner, dyed wool fleeces, pieces of meat or fish that have an identifying mark - and likewise anything that has an identifying mark - is obligated to announce [it]. 
One who found small bundles [of grain] in a public area, they are certainly his - since they have no identifying mark. But if he found them in a private area: If they came there in the manner of being dropped, they are surely his. But if it was in the manner of being placed, he is obligated to announce [them], as their location is an identifying mark. But if he found large bundles - whether in a public area or whether in a private area - he must take and announce [them]. <small>Gloss: As their location is an identifying mark. However a location in which everyone is accustomed to place [their items] there, such as a barrel on the riverfront, is not an identifying mark - since everyone unloads their barrels there....</small>

If someone deposited money or objects with his friend [to watch them], and when he comes to reclaim them the friend says "I don't know where I put the thing," or "I don't know where I buried the money, give me time to find it, " he is considered negligent and must pay immediately.

One who hires workers and said to them "work from dawn till dusk", cannot force them to do so if that is not the custom of the area, even if he adds to their salary. This is because he did not make this stipulation at the moment he hired them. [Rema: (meaning that it was not the case that) there was not a particular custom in the city or that he said to them "I hire you according to Torah law and you are obligated to leave from your houses at sunrise and work until nightfall" (Tur 331:4). (In these cases) on the eve of Shabbat the worker goes home early so he can fill a barrel of water and roast a small fish and light the Shabbat candles (Tur 331:5 based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). If there was no custom in the city but the majority of the men in the city come from an area where there is a custom, we go according to the custom of the city from which they come. If they came from a place where the custom is to work from dawn to dusk to a place where that is not the custom, or the reverse, we go according to the custom of the place in which they were hired (Nemukei Yosef on the beginning of Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia, "One Who Hires Worker", based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). Something is not a custom unless it a common practice and has been done many times, however, something which has been done only once or twice is not considered a custom (Rivash siman 475).]
A place that is accustomed to nourish, nourishes; to provide in dried figs or dates and it is like he has fulfilled his obligation in them, he will provide; everything according to the custom of the state.

When does the above apply? With regard to work that does not involve an immediate loss. If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract (a maid or a servant of the employer considered an immediate loss since the employer is not able to do the work himself, therefore he suffers a loss) unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill (him or his wife or his children) or he heard that a close relative died. (However the employer does not have to pay the full wage, but only for their work, they {the workers} have the upper hand. If the employer re-employees the workers after the circumstance is over without specifying anything, and they come back to do their job then he pays them in full and does not deduct anything. If not, then the employer deducts all the sick or unfortunate days, even though he didn't back out. The same ruling is for a teacher who fell ill, you deduct the sick days. However if the worker or teacher already received their payment then some say that he does not have to return. A teacher who backs out is considered 'immediate loss' the same applies to a scribe who accepted to write a book and backed out in the middle, is considered 'immediate loss'. Teachers are classified like other workers who need to act as is customary to start and to finish work, as explained in Siman 331. He is prohibited from doing other work while he is teaching or to stay up at night excessively or to minimize or add in food, and whoever changes has the 'lower hand' and is removed. A teacher who was hired for a set period of time has the laws of a worker. If he was hired to teach a book or half a book then he has the laws of a contractor, see Siman 33, 34 &amp; 35 regarding the laws of a teacher.) If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them. (If he found other workers to hire and he deceived the original workers then he has to pay them based on his last agreement.) What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: "I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work." Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount. (A volunteer can back out, even if it causes 'immediate loss'.)
What is meant by hiring others on their account? He hires other workers who complete their task so that he will not suffer a loss. Whatever he must add to pay these later workers beyond the amount the first workers agreed upon, he may take from the first workers. To what extent are the first workers responsible? For their entire wage. Moreover, if they have money that is in the employer's possession, the employer can use that money to hire workers to complete their work until he pays each worker 40 or 50 zuz a day although he originally hired the worker at three or four zuz. (If the employer does not hire other worker's on the expense of the first workers, then they are not responsible to pay for the damage. Some say, be is nly allowed to hire new workers on the previous ones expense, up to 40 or 50 zuz, is only if the employer has their tools, but nothing else. The limit of 40 or 5 zuz only applies to an 'immediate loss' that is not monetary like a teacher or similar. If the loss is monetary then the workers have to cover the cost of all of the damage.)
When does the above apply? When there are no workers available to hire at the wage to be paid the original workers. If, however, such workers are available and the original workers tell the employer: "Go out and hire from these to complete your work so that you will not suffer a loss," whether a worker or a contractor is involved, the employer has only complaints against them. To determine the wage that should be paid, we follow these guidelines: For a worker, we calculate the work he already[ performed and for a contractor, we calculate the work that must be performed

Siman 334

One who hires a worker to water the field from this river, and the river stops up for half the day, if there isn’t any way to stop or even that his way is to interrupt and the worker knows the way of the river, the loss of the worker and the employer doesn’t give him anything, even though that also the employer knows the way of the river. But if the worker doesn’t know the way of the river, and the employer knows, he gives the worker workman’s comp. Note: and similarly in every case of extraordinary circumstance that happens to the worker, whether the two of them knew that the way of the compulsion to come or the two of them didn’t know, it comes to be the loss of the worker. But if the employer knows and the worker doesn’t know, it comes to be the loss is of the employer. And if a naturally occurring complete disaster comes consider above siman 321. Someone that rents a house to live in it, and dies within the time of the rental, doesn’t have to pay only the time that he dwelled in it, because  the owner of the house comes to be like the worker, and he should have made it a condition. There are those who disagree. Therefore, if he received all the rent payment, there is no need to return them all, so it seems to me. If they run away because of a change in weather, it comes to be like the other forces, and it comes to be the loss of the worker or the teacher. 


Who that hires a teacher for his son, and the student is sick, if it isn’t a chronic sickness [and the same applies if the boy dies], and even if it is regular and the teacher is from the city and is aware of it, the loss is of the teacher. But if it is a regular sickness, and the teacher is not aware of it, for example that he isn’t from the city, the loss is on the one who hires him, and he gives to him all the owed wages. [Note: of all the students of Torah find it more comfortable for them to learn than to have their nights filled with nothingness. And consider below, Siman 335. etc]

A worker who does labor in a food-related industry may eat from what he does, even if he doesn’t work on it with his arms and legs, but only carries it on his shoulders, it is forbidden to prevent him from eating.

















A worker is not permitted to do work at night and to hire himself out in the day. He cannot go hungry or undergo privations and yet feed his children with his food because he lessens his employer’s work. At a diminished strength he will not have the strength  to do the employer's work.

The Mitzvah is to give a hired worker a wage in its time, and after that, he transgresses a negative commandment; whether paying man or for a beast or tools. But for paying for ground, there are those who that say that there is no transgression.  

Which time is this, hired by day, the time to give it to him is all night; if it is not given to him, he [the employer] transgressed it in the morning because of the prohibition of holding onto the wages (from Vayikra 19:13). Hired by night, the time to give it to him is all day; it is not given to him, he [the employer] transgressed it in the evening, because of “At this day you shall give him his hire” (Devarim 24:15). Note: And the workers to them, that there isn’t making work until night, since that investment upon him a hot transgression upon him because of “At this day you shall give him his hire”; at night, and if he made work until night, he has time even though that his didn’t pay him according to his proper fee. 
Hourly workers, if its paid to him on the day he has to pay him every day; if its paid to him at night he has to pay him every night.
A weekly worker, monthly worker, yearly worker, weekly worker, he will go out on height of the day every same day; he will go out on the height of the night every same night.
He gives shawl to the artisan to fix it as a contractor, and he finished it, all the time that the shawl is in the hand of the artisan you do not transgress [by withholding pay]. He [the artisan] gave it to him [the owner of the garment] even in the middle day, until the sun sets [you have until the sunset to pay for the mend], he transgressed because of Bal Talin/Don’t withhold, that contractor is like his hiring to repay on time.

Everything is forbidden in order that he not accustom himself to this. 
Anyone who steals even on par with a penny’s worth transgressed not stealing and he is obligated to pay, one that steals money of a Jew or who steals money of a non-Jew and one that steals from the great or from the small. Note: a gentile’s mistake, for example to mistake in counting or repaying his loans, is permitted, and provided that he doesn’t know, so that there is no blasphemy.

Any item that is assumed to be stolen, it is forbidden to buy it. And so, if the majority of that item is stolen, we don't buy it. Therefore, we do not buy wool, milk, or kids from shepherds. However, we do buy milk and cheese from  them in the wilderness, but not in the settled area. And it is permitted to buy four sheep or four shearings of wool from shepherds, from a small flock, or five from a large flock, since it is not assumes to be stolen. In general, anything that the shepherd would sell if the owner was monitoring him is permitted to buy, and if not, is forbidden.

Siman 359

It’s forbidden to steal or exploit (even) any amount, whether from a Jew or a non-Jew; And if it is an object that is not concerning, it is permitted; such as to take from the package or [taking a splinter] from the fence to brush his teeth with; and even this is prohibited by the Jeruselamite (Talmud), as a quality of fervency.
It is prohibited to steal, even on condition of fair payment from (for) it. And there is one who says, (that) this is if the payments are not evident; because if they are evident, since they (the payments) are preferred over the object since they attain a right for him and he would confer them onto the owners by way of another.
Anyone who steals from his friend, even a penny-worth, is considered as having taken his soul.
Even if he's in dire danger and needs to steal from his friend in order to save his soul, he should not take it unless with the intent to pay.
Even the one who takes via borrowing, without the knowledge of the owners, is called a thief.

What is a robber? Someone who takes a person's money by force, such as snatching things from his hand or entering someone's property against the will of the owner and taking objects from there, or taking someone's slave or animal and using them, or going down to someone's field and eating of its fruits, and so on:

 A Robber Who Comes to Repent, Whether We Accept from Them; this has four sections:  A well-known robber (who was thoroughly engaged in this and for whom repentance is difficult) who comes on their own to repent: if the robbed item still exists, one should not accept it, in order not to prevent them from repenting, but if [the robber] wanted to fulfill Heavenly standards and returned it, we do not prevent the person who was robbed from accepting it. Rema’s gloss: Similarly, if [the robber] did not come on their own to repent, but was sued by the person they robbed, then we do require them to return it. 
 For shepherds, tax collectors, and customs collectors, repentance is difficult, because they robbed the masses and do not know to whom to make restitution. Therefore, they should use it for public necessities, such as wells, ditches, and caves.

Siman 369

Paragraph 1- It is forbidden to purchase from robbers and bandits, and to derive benefit from their money; and what is Dina deMalkhuta Dina (government law) - 11 paragraphs. One is prohibited from a purchasing a robbed item from a robber. One is prohibited from assisting the robber to change the item so that he acquire it because anyone who does such a thing or something similar strengthens the hands of sinner and violates the negative commandment of, “do not place a stumbling block in front of the blind.” If one purchases movable items from him, it has the same law as one who buys from a thief, which was discussed in Siman 356.
Paragraph 2- One is prohibited from deriving benefit from a robbed item, even after the owner gave up hope. This assumes he knew with certainty that this item was the actual robbed item. How so? If he knew this animal was robbed, he is prohibited from riding on it or plowing with it. If the robber robbed a house or field, one is prohibited from passing through it or entering the property in the summer because of the sun or in the rainy season because of the rain. If he lives there he must pay rent to the owner if it was a property generally rented out. If the robber stole palm trees and made a bridge with them, one is prohibited from crossing the bridge. The same applies to anything similar. If the robber gave it to the public, however, one may derive benefit from it because there is a giving up hope along with a change in possession. If a king cut down trees of a homeowner and made a bridge, however, one is permitted to cross the bridge. Even if the king instructed his servants to cut a set amount from each person and they went and cut everything from one person, he is permitted to cross the bridge. Similarly, if the king destroyed houses and created a path or wall, one is permitted to derive benefit from it. The same applies to anything similar because the instruction of the kings is law, so long as his control spreads to those lands because the people of those lands have in effect agreed that he is their master and they are servants, because otherwise he would just be a strong robber.
Paragraph 3- One is prohibited from deriving benefit from a robber because there is a presumption that his money came via robbery. If a minority of his properties belonged to him, even though most of his money was a result of robbing, one may derive benefit from him unless he knows with certainty that this item in his possession was robbed.
Paragraph 4- One is prohibited from deriving benefit from people who are presumed robbers and all their money is presumed robbed money because their work is that of robbers, such as tax collectors and bandits, because the presumption of such work is robbery. We would not combine dinar from their box because everything is assumed to be robbed. With respect to the what they have in the house or market, but not in the tax-collector’s box, however, that may be combined. Even from his box, if he is required to pay ½ dinar and he only has one dinar, he may give it to him and take the ½ dinar from the collector-box because it is like he is rescuing from the collector’s possession.
Paragraph 5- If tax collectors took one’s garment and replaced it with another, he may keep it because it is like it was sold to him. There is a presumption the owner gave up hope and he doesn’t know with certainty that this was robbed. If he was careful and stringent on himself, he would return to the original owner. Where it was known that the owner did not give up hope, he would need to return it at no cost.
Paragraph 6- When is it true that a tax collector is like a bandit? Where the tax collector is a gentile, he created the tax on his own or the tax is from the king but has no set amount and he can take what he wants. If the tax was set by the king and was a set amount, however- even if the king instructed that the Jew give more than the gentile, it is still considered a set amount for each person- and the king appointed a Jewish collector to collect for him and this person is known as trustworthy and would not add anything to what the king instructed, he is not presumed to be a robber because the law of the government is the law. Moreover, one who evades the tax violates “do not steal” because he has stolen the king’s gift, whether the king was Jewish or a gentile. Similarly, if a Jew acquired the tax from the king, if one evades the tax he is robbing the Jew who acquired the rights to it. There are those who say that even where it is known that the Jew takes more than the set amount, one is still prohibited from evading the set amount, because it is like he is robbing a robber, which is prohibited. If a gentile acquired the tax, however, one is permitted to evade because it is like evading a loan which is permissible where there is no desecration of God’s name. There are those who say that even if the tax collector is Jewish, if he did not acquire for himself and just collects on behalf of the king, although one is prohibited from evading because of the government law, if a person were to evade the collector cannot force him to give because is like evading a loan, which is permissible. If there is any concern that he is afraid of the king, however, he is certainly able to force him to give.
Paragraph 7- Similarly, if a king placed a tax on the residents of a city or a set an annual tax on each individual or each field, or if he decreed that if anyone violates a certain matter then all his properties will be given to the king or that anyone discovered in a field during the threshing seasons must pay a tax, regardless of whether he owns the field or not, or anything similar, there is no issue of robbery and a Jew who collects such taxes for the king is not presumed to be a robber and is in good standing. This assumes he does not add, deviate or take anything for himself.
Paragraph 8- Similarly, if a king becomes angry with one of his servants or assistants from his jurisdiction and he took his field or courtyard, it is not robbery and one is permitted to derive benefit from him. If one purchases it from the king, it belongs to him and the owner cannot remove it from him. If the king took a field or courtyard from one of his citizens not in compliance with the laws he set up, he is a robber and if one purchases it from him, the owner may remove him from the property. The general rule is that any general law that the king sets up for everyone, and not just for one person, is not robbery, and if anyone takes property from one person not known to comply with the laws that are not know to all, then it is robbery. If the law was set for just one industry, such as were he made a law that a certain item can be loaned with interest, there are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law because it was not set for everyone. There are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law except with regards to taxes and property-taxes because the king decrees that people can only live on his lands in this fashion. With respect to other matters, however, we would not apply such a principle. There are those who disagree and hold we apply the principle that the law of the land is the law on all matters. Thus, if one lends on collateral, he may sell the collateral after a year because that is the law of the land. This is the primary view, as was discussed above in 356:7.
Paragraph 9- Thus, if the king’s collectors or officers sold fields because of the set tax on fields, the sale is valid. With respect to tax on the actual person, however, they may only collect from the person himself. If they sold a field for the individual tax, the sale is not valid unless that was the king’s law. See above Siman 68 regarding the law of the land, as well as more on this law in 104:2.
Paragraph 10- If a king had a law that anyone who does not pay the tax assessed to their field, then the field will go to whomever pays the tax, and the field-owner fled because of the tax, and another came and gave the required tax to the king and consumed its fruits, it would not be robbery. Rather, he may consume the fruits and pay the tax until the owner returns because the law of the king is the law, as we have said. Similarly, it is the king’s rule that whomever is discovered in the field must pay the tax for the entire valley and he will collect from the others or that he collect the annual tax from one person.
Paragraph 11- Similarly, if the king decreed that anyone who pays the affixed personal tax on behalf of another, then the person that paid has rights on the person he paid for, and one paid the tax for a poor Jew, the donor may work him more than is typical because the law of the king is the law, but he may not work him like a slave. If a Jew owed a gentile, and the gentile sold the document to a Jew, although he is prohibited from litigating with the other Jews in the presence of gentiles, and although he is coming via a gentile, the Jewish judges would still rule for this Jewish creditor that which the gentile would have profited from the gentile judges because this Jew is coming via the gentile judges, which is the government law. If one marries a woman in a place where they judge with secular law, and his wife dies, the wife’s father or other inheritors cannot say that anyone who gets married does so with the understanding that they will follow local custom and that any matter should be litigated in secular courts so that if she were to die her husband would not inherit her or something similar. The principle of government law does not apply here because we do not say the principle except for something where there is a benefit to the king or it is a regulation for the citizens, but not that they litigate in secular court, because if that were to happen all Jewish laws would become void.

1. One who tells another "tear my garments, break my vessel, on the condition that you are exempt"- he is exempt (and there are those who say that even if he did not say "on condition that" explicitly, rather that he said words of similar meaning, for example if he said to him "break my vessel" and the damager said "on condition that I am exempt" and the one who suffered damage said "no" we can say that he said so sarcastically, and he is exempt).  And if he did not say to him "on condition that you are exempt" then he is liable, even though he gave him permission to destroy.  When is this true?  When the items first came into his hand to be guarded, in that they had been lent or given for safekeeping.  But if they did not come to be guarded, for example, if he said "take this vessel and break it, take this garment and tear it" and he did it, behold he is exempt, even though he did not say "on condition that you are exempt."

Distinction between causal damages and the law of direct causality, and the law of one who throws a vessel off a roof. There are 4 subsections within:   We rule like Rabi Meir that adjudicates on direct causality.  Gloss: However, only in regards to human caused damages.  Animal caused damages are exempt, in all opinions.  Therefore, if one pushed another's coin in a manner that it fell into the sea, although he didn't pick it up [prior, thus acquiring it], he is liable.  Similarly, one who minimizes [the weight] of another's coin and removed the image [on the face of the coin], is liable, even if he didn't diminish the value.  So too, one who sells a debt document and subsequently forgives the debt, the debt is forgiven and [the seller/lender] must pay the purchaser, as explained in ~ 66.
So too, one who burns another's loan document must pay the full debt that was in the document.  Even though the document itself isn't money, he caused the loss of money. However, the damager must admit the document was authenticated, and [admit to] the amount that was written therein.  Since it is burned the debt cannot be collected therewith.  If [the damager] doesn't believe [the lender], he doesn't need to pay other than the value of the paper.  Gloss: This [is true] is there are no witnesses that know how much was written therein, for if there are witnesses, they can rewrite the document, as explained in ~ 41.
So too, one who throws his own vessel off the roof and there were pillows and blankets beneath them, in a manner that if [the vessel] fell onto them they wouldn't break, and another person removed [the pillows] before [the vessels landed] and the vessels hit the ground and broke. The one who removed [the pillows] must pay [the damages].  So too for all similar cases. Gloss:  Some consider this causal damage and is exempt [in court but responsible by heaven].  Similarly, pushing the coin into the sea and minimizing the coin image are exempt, because they are causal damage. Therefore, even if one threw [another's] vessel from the roof while there were pillows beneath them and he himself removed the pillows, yet he is exempt [in court]. He is not liable for the throw because it wouldn't break through this action. The removal [of the pillows] is but a causal damage.  A scribe that wrote a document and wrote one hundred in place of two hundred, or if one damages another with [bad] advice, or an escrow that handed over a document [to one party] that he should not have handed over, all these are exempt [in court but responsible by heaven].  They are only causal damage.  However, [the damager] is excommunicated until he removes the damage, as in all cases of causal damage.  Some say that all common causal damage must be paid as a penalty.  Therefore, some say, if Reuven sells and item to an idolater, then Shimon says to the idolater that he overpaid [and the idolator keeps the item and the money (see Sha"ch), Shimon] must pay him.  Some say that is like a Moser (see ~ 388).

<i><b>Rema</b>: Regarding those guilty of the death penalty in our days, we have no power to give them lashes, exile them, kill them, or beat them. Instead we censure them and distance them from the community (<b>Tur 68</b> from Natronai Gaon). Thus far regarding [strictly Torah] law. However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2. This regards those instances involving capital punishment which necessitates a beit din. Cases in which the death penalty can be implemented even without a beit din, are still judged in our days, as will be explained (ibid.).</i> One who pursuses his fellow in order to kill him, and was warned, and continued in his pursuit: Even if the pursuer was a minor, every Jew is commanded to save the pursed, even at the cost of one maiming one of the pursuer's limbs. If it is impossible to save the pursued without killing the pursuer outright, then the pursuer should indeed be killed, even though he has not yet performed the act. <i><b>Rema</b>: (<b>Tur 67</b>) One who "tunnels [into a house] in order steal" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him. See further in the Tur in this paragraph regarding one who endangers the public, such as a Jew who engages in forgery in a land where the authorities take a strict approach to such action, such a person constitutes a "pursuer" and it is permitted to turn him over to the authorities (<b>Nimukei Maharam MiRizburg</b>), as explained above in 388:12.</i>

Siman 426

The obligation for a man to save his friend in body, money, or the like.  One who saw his fellow drowning, or threatened by thieves or by a wild animal, and could have either saved him himself or hired others to save him – and he did not – or someone who heard that gentiles or informants are plotting against someone or preparing to ensnare him – and he did not reveal this to his friend and tell him – or someone who knew that a gentile or violent man was approaching his fellow, and he could have appeased him and changed his attitude towards his fellow – and he did not appease him – in all such situations, he has transgressed, “Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor.”

Siman 427

It is a positive commandment to make a fence on one's roof as it says "and you shall make a fence for your roof". This applies if it is a dwelling place, but a storage house or a cattle house and the like do not require one.
Any house that is not at least 4 cubits by 4 cubits is exempt from making a fence.
A house of two partners is obligated to have a fence around its roof, as it says “lest any one fall from it”.   This is applicable whenever someone is liable to fall.  If so, why does it say “your roof”?  To exclude synagogues and study halls, since they are not made for residence.  
If a public road is higher than the roof, a fence is not required. As it says: "lest the one who falls will fall <i>from it</i>".
The fence must not be shorter than ten handbreadths so that one will not fall from the roof, and the fence must be strong so that a man can lean on it and will not fall.
All that do not build a fence on their roof violates a positive commandment and a negative commandment. As it says, "do not place blood in your home".
Both a roof or anything dangerous where it's probable that someone will stumble upon and fall, for example if there was a well or a hole in his yard, whether there is water in it or not, one is obligated to make an embankment ten-handbreadths high, or to cover it, lest a person fall into it and die.
Likewise, one has a positive duty to remove and guard oneself of any life-threatening obstacle, as it is said "beware and guard your soul".  If one did not removed said obstacles, one has cancelled a positive commandment and transgressed "do not bring bloodguilt" (Deut. 22:8).
The sages prohibited many things because of danger to a person.  And some of them are explained in the Tur.  Additionally, there are other things and these are they: A person must never put his mouth to a pipe spouting water and drink; he must not drink from rivers or ponds at night, for fear that he might swallow a leech without seeing.  <i>Rama: I have already written these in Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 116:5</i>
