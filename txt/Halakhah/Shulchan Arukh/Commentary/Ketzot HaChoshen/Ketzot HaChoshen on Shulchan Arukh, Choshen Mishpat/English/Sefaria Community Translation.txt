Ketzot HaChoshen on Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat



Siman 1



Seif 1

The laws of admission and loans. This is the language of the Tur; "The explanation is that he sues him with witnesses of admission [who testify] that he admitted before them or he borrowed from him before them." See the Taz where he says "Our teacher [the Tur] made sure that you wouldn't make a mistake in explaining according to the other explanation of Rashi on partial admission and complete denial. And experts are needed for something that is a Rabbinical ordinance. Therefore he brought the explanation of admission and loans which is not in this path [of thought]". <br>But to me it seems that since in any case we hold that with regards to swearing of hesit, his property is not forcefully liquidated if he refuses to swear rather he is excommunicated until he swears. Therefore it does not matter with regards to the swearing of hesit, because even by those things which he is not judged on, he is excommunicated for based on the regulation of the two schools. Therefore he [the Tur] brought the explanation of admission, that he is sued with witnesses of admission. Therefore, what the Sm"a says, "And so too is the case where he is sued without witnesses, in the case of the hesit swearing", according to what I wrote, there is no difference with regards to hesit because even with those things that he is not judged he is excommunicated.

Regarding the matter of a domesticated animal causing damage (Shekhita), the Shakh and the Hagahot Nizkain in the name of the Maharshal in Perek Cheit of Bava Kamma, Siman 5, and according to my humble opinion, it seems that according to the ruling of the Ashri in Perek HaChoval, he ruled that the laws of fire and pit are similar. However, he brings in the name of the Maharit that there is a doubt, and from the words of the Tosafot, it appears that they are of the opinion that the laws of fire and pit are also different. See there in Perek Kama of Bava Kamma, page 14, where it is taught in the Mishnah, "Before a court" (in the context of liability for damages), excluding a court of laymen. The Tosafot write there, and this is their opinion, that even though one may argue that the Mishnah mentions an ox goring with its foot and biting with its teeth, it is not referring to a penalty; even so, it teaches it, and the Mishnah does not apply to it, as it teaches "Before witnesses," and the Gemara states separately, "excluding one who admits [liability] under a penalty," and afterwards, witnesses come into play. See there. And if we say that the laws of fire and pit require experts, then it is well understood why the Mishnah does not apply to them since the laws of fire and pit are among the four primary categories of damage. However, it is certainly logical to say that the laws of fire and pit do not require experts. And if so, since the Tosafot's interpretation is clear, there is no doubt that it excludes something specific. And if that is the case, the laws of fire and pit do not require experts.
