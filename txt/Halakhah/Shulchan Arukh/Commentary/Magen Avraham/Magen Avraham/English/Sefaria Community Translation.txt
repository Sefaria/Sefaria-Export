From this language we learn that even if he cannot eat, for example he has a weak constitution, still since others his age can eat, we need to distance ourselves (from the extriment to read shema). This requires analysis as we have not found this in any posek, and in addition the gemara indicates that if he was older, even though he cannot eat a kazayit in the alloted time of a Peras, we still need to distance ourselves from his excrement. This implies that for a child if he cannot eat it then it would be permissible (to say shema). Therefore it appears to me that the law is that if someone his age can eat, the assumption is he can also. And if we know that he cannot because he is weak etc, even if he is 3 or 4 years old we don't need to distance ourselves. And if he was an adult, even if he cannot eat, we still need to distance ourselves.  The Bach adds that we also don't distance ourselves from (extrement) of a minor if we know that that specific extrement did not come from grain, for example he hasn't eaten grain for days like Rashi writes. The poskim write like this. And if we know he has never eaten grain, even if he is a few years old, you don't need to distance. Rashi writes that all 5 grains are called dagan and the feces smells. In yoreh death 265:8 it seems that it is better to distance oneself from extrement, even of a minor, even if he is 8 days. The Maharshal says it is not proper to read Shema next to a baby as it is probably dirty from garbage. End of his words. It seems to me for a different reason, that they don't clean themselves properly, and feces around the anus, even though it is covered is forbidden (to read by it). Look at siman 76:6

6. On days that they say piyutim (before the chazans repetition) on should take (3 steps) forward when the chazan begins his repetition (Lechem Chamudos). The Kesef Mishna writes (9:4) if one wants he can just continue standing where he ended up (after taking the steps back) and not take steps forward. However according to the one explanation of the three steps brought in the Beis Yosef you really need 6 steps (and we include the steps you take forward). Therefore according to this opinion one must take three steps forwards. For this reason were careful not to have people pass infront of others when there standing in there place (after taking three steps back) to not interrupt between the six steps (Lechem Chamudos). See siman 95 sif 1 (where the Rama brings an opinion that need to take three steps forward before Shemoneh eshrei aswell. If so you already have 6 steps, 3 before shemona esrie and 3 after). And also see siman 124 (sif 1 brings from the kesavim to take 3 steps forward at kedusha and wait there until tachanun) and siman 131 sif 2 (where he says if one doesn't have a seat where he took 3 steps to then should take the steps back to get to his seat to sit).

Siman 124




4.The explanation of this phrase is that you won't finish all 18 berachot of shemoneh eshrei within the time your allowed to daven in (Lechem Chamudot). And he (the Rama) also writes this in siman 232 at the end of sif 1 (if not enough time chazan should begin repetition immediately).

“…He has to hold…” In (Sefer) Kavanot it is written that before the blessing he shall hold the two handles (of the scroll) and during the blessing he shall take away his left hand to give strength to his right hand. And in these manuscripts (?), it is written that during the blessing he shall hold with his two hands the writing sheets of the Torah through the wrapping (around the scroll) and after the blessing he shall remove the left (hand).

Either way, one is not allowed to pour hot water into the wine since one is focused on being precise and that would be too much of a loss of focus (tosfot 106b, and Bach). This law applies to anything similar to this.  It is also written there in the name of Rabeinu Tam that it is forbidden to do these on a week day as one my lose focus and leave to do other things, but on the Shabbat when the table is all set, one can wash hands and then make kiddush. The same law applies to making havdala and then eating. See what is written in siman 174
The Shela writes that each day, before washing for bread, a person should give a prayer for the food he receives from G-d, and if he forgot to say this prayer until after he washed he is allowed to say it before saying the beracha on bread. And the world has a custom to say tehillim 23 between washing and hamotzi (see Siman 235:2 - where the Rema says that one doesn't break within the meal but one does break before hamotzi to say Shema and other prayers that were missed).  The Rashal writes that the host should let the greatest man wash last (to allow him to talk until the end/or to not cause him to pause for too long..), but if he was asked first to wash and he chooses to wait till later, this is a transgressions since he is causing others to have a break, rather he should wash and sit down and not speak, and if they ask him a dvar tora he is permitted to stop. End of words of Rashal. See Sman 167:5 (where the SA lists thing that should be at the table in preparation for the beracha). And the Bach writes that it is forbidden to speak, even with divrei Torah, and even the sitting down is a hefsek as the Rema writes (ie, waiting more than 22 amot). With this in mind, a great man can choose not to wash first since we are more concerned when the person saying the beracha has to wait, as opposed to those that are listening. If the guests see that it is taking too long, they can take a piece of bread and recite the blessings for themselves 
The tosfot in Sota prove this point from the case of a Metzora. A metzora was not able to do semicha on the sacrifice immediately before the slaughter as they were not allowed to enter the Azara. What they did was do semicha outside the entrance gates (Nikanor gates) and then the kohanim to walk the animal to the Mizbeach for the sacrifice. The distance between the gate and the alter is 22 amot and we see it was not a hefsek (the semicha needs to be just before the sacrifice). But I have a problem. This braita is brought in zevachim 33a to argue prove that a small amount that enters is not considered entering until the entire person enters (otherwise, why doesn't the metzora put his hand inside for smicha and then do shchita right there at the entrance). This question is origonally based on the assumption that we are talking about chachamim that you can shecht anywhere in the Azara, and then concludes that it is according to R Yehuda that only by the mizbeach is fine.  But I have an issue, let us just say...... (not sure), rather we must conclude that if you move from one place to another (ie the 22 amot) it should be a hefsek. Even small amount of walking. That is how the mishne in Middot (end of ch2)  seems to imply that in the place of smicha you need shchita. This needs analysis. (Look at siman 8,13 where the SA says that if you make a blessing in your home on tzitzit and then walk to shul you need another blessing for tallis as the walk is a hefsek. Look also at Siman 181:6 about waiting after mayim achronim). And it requires analysis on what it says in Yora Deah 19 where the psak is (if the slaughter house is messy) to say a bracha outside of the slaughterhouse at a distance of 4 Amon as it needs to be in its place (even bracha achrona 184 needs to be in its place. All the more so the first bracha. I looked at the Aguda in chulin (where it says 4 amot) and the 4 amot seem to be in the same house. This is what is mentioned in Shabbos "someone who wants to drink in the washhouse, should bless in the outside room since it is like a corner to a corner". But according to tosfot even corner to corner would be a hefsek and this is the prevailing opinion since it is no less that speaking. Therefore the position of the Rema in Yore Dea needs further analysis. 

Siman 167

......
Bless "Hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz" [Who takes out bread from the ground] - (And if many people are eating together, the people dining should direct their heart (intention) to the person saying the beracha, and answer amen, and the person saying the beracha should give intention to the amen - Or Zarua). And one pauses slightly between the word "lechem" [bread] and the word "min" [from].
Do not bless "Hamotzi" before grasping the bread.
Put both hands on the bread when you are about to bless "Hamotzi"; for the 10 fingers are reflective of the 10 mitzvot that are dependent on bread. Additionally, there are 10 words in the blessing of "Hamotzi" and 10 words in the following verses: Psalms 104:14, "He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and grass for the service of man: that he may bring forth bread out of the land." Psalms 145:15, "The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food at the proper time." Deuteronomy 8:8, "A land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey." Bresheit 27:28, "May G!d give you from the dew of heaven and fat of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine."









The Beis Yosef writes in the name of Tosafos [who] quotes the Medrash, that when the Jewish people are sitting and waiting (after washing) for each other before making Hamotzie, and they are without any mitzvos, The Satan stands to prosecute them. The covenant of salt protects them. Also see Siman 166 [where it states] that it is better to talk words of Torah that to sit idle. and better than both is to avoid an interruption altogether.

A Bar Mitzvah - It happens when a boy becomes 13 years and one day old. Now it is customary to bless when the young man leads prayers or reads Torah on shabbat for the first time, because then it is known publicly that he is bar mitzvah (Lechem Hamudot). Yalkut Hadash says that a person is commanded to make a feast on the day his son becomes a bar mitzvah, like the day he gets married. It is obvious that it happens when a boy enters his 14th year. In Yam Shel Shlomo, chapter 7 of Bava Kamma it says that if the young man gives a dvar torah it is a seudat mitzvah even if it doesn't happen on the day [that he turns 13 and one day].
From this punishment - The explanation is that until now the father was punished when the son sinned because he did not educate his son. The Levush explains the opposite - until now the son was punished for the father's sins. See there.

Not only bloodletting, but anything to do with healing is a cause for this blessing. And one who sneezes, and his friend says <i> "Assuta!" </i>(healing!), s/he should respond 'Blessed be you', and then say 'I hope for Your salvation, God' . For one who prays for another is answered first.

She blesses after lighting, because if she blesses it becomes an acceptance of Shabbat and it would be forbidden to light. Therefore on Yom Tov, she should bless and then light - this was written in the [introduction to the] Drisha in the name of his mother. But woman have no intelligence, etc. Our sages made no distinction between these cases, as we see in siman 158, see there, and the Tosafot in Pesachim 7b.
<b>And to make a blessing on it.</b> Because lighting [Shabbat] candles is obligatory, for the sake of peace at home (<i>shalom bayit</i>), that one not trip over wood or stone (Mordechai). And even those who say that the candle of Yom Kippur does not require a blessing, in any case, here it is used for the necessities of eating—preparing their utensils and dishes, which is not the case on Yom Kippur. And all the more so for us, who believe that one does make a blessing on Yom Kippur, because we think that <i>shalom bayit</i> applies even without eating (Mahari”l, Responsa, No. [144] 155).

31. "It is forbidden to hint." And so similarly it is prohibited to say something such that he [the idolater non-Jew] will thereby understand that he should perform a prohibited act. (Rakna"t Section 99) And thus it is prohibited to tell the idolater non-Jew "wipe your nose" such that he thereby understand that he should remove the soot from the head of the lamp, for specifically to say to him something by which he will understand that he should perform the act after Shabbat is permitted as written in subsection 7. But if the non-Jew does it on Shabbat, it is prohibited -- for even if the non-Jew performs labor on his own for the sake of  a Jew, it is prohibited to benefit from it (the labor), as is written in Section 325; all the more so to hint to him, as against the Bach (look there), and look at what is written in subsection 14 in the name of Rm"m, for there we don't prohibit it because it was asked of an idolater non-Jew but rather that he told him that he can't read it.

41. <b>THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE LAW OF STONES, ETC.</b> This is what the Mordechai wrote, that there is no difference and to the contrary, he wrote there that there are those who say specifically regarding branches there is a disagreement. But stones are different because they do not move. And we heard a little bit about this in the R"an ספי"ז. Therefore we can say the opinion of the Rosh on all of this, ועמ"ש סי' שכ"ה סי"א וצ"ע, how can you say there is no disagreement regarding stones? There is a disagreement specifically in the Gemara Shabbos 125! Therefore it seems to be that certainly because they (stones) do not move, certainly it is permitted to sit on them because according to everyone, it is not forbidden to touch Muktze.

Women are patur: because it is a mitzvah aseh shehazman grama. And even though they fulfill all the mitzvot aseh like Sukkah, nonetheless they do not fulfill this one, because they caused the moon to wane (Shelah) see what he wrote at the end of #296. And in Sanhedrin ch. 5 it says regarding blessing the moon “our women also make this blessing”, somewhat implying that they make the blessing, but possibly this is a figure of speech.

I have a difficulty. How can we say on Shavuot that it is "the day of the giving of our Torah"?! Do we not conclude like R. Yose (Shabbat 86b) that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan? After all, we do conclude that separation from sexual intercourse [of man and wife, in regard to certain laws of Tumah] requires six half-days, as is written in Yore Deah 196. [R. Yose's opinion -- that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan -- is based on a need for husband and wife to separate a full three days. Since the Halakha today requires a 3 days for this particular separation, presumably R. Yose is correct about the date of Revelation.] (And I believe I've seen this question before in some Poseik's writings.)  But in our calendar, Shavuot is always on the 6th of Sivan!     In truth, the Rambam rules in the Laws of Avot haTumah Ch. 5, that we require only three half-days [of separation]. The Kesef Mishna comments there that in the Talmudic text of the Rambam and the Rashba, the Sages only require three half-days, and that the Rambam rules according to them. See there. If so, our custom is in line with the Rambam. What is written in Yoreh Deah, supporting R. Yose, is but stringency [chumra; it is the advised practice, but not the actual letter of the law].       A further difficulty: the Torah was given on the 51st day of their counting! For they left Egypt on the fifth of the week (Wednesday night / Thursday) and the Torah was given on a Shabbat. In this regard, the [book] HaAsarah Maamarot already answered, that it is meant to hint at the Second Day of Yom Tov of the Exiles. In fact, it’s possible that that’s the reason why Moshe added a day of his own accord, but this isn’t the place to discuss it.        ........ It says in the Zohar that the original pious ones would be awake all the night working in Torah.  And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.  Therefore, we need to fix this. 



Spread out plants: And if Shavuot starts at the end of Shabbos, spread out the plants before Shabbos in accordance with the Maharil.  It is customary to place trees in the the synagogue and in houses, and it seems to me that the reason is so people remember that judgement of fruit trees occurs on Shavuos, and that they should pray for them. 
There are many reasons for eating dairy, I will copy the reason written in the Zohar: the previous seven weeks were in parrallel to the seven clean days a woman counts before immersing in the mikvah, we know that blood becomes milk, this is parallel to the movement from judgement to mercy, and the practice of our fathers is in our hands to fulfill. However, it is important to be careful not to violate any prohibitions (see Yoreh Deah 89)...

Rambam rules (Beit HaBechira, chapter 6) that the holiness of the courtyard and of Jerusalem is eternal. See also Yevamot 82 in Tosafot and the Raavad disagree in various places. In the Mishnah (Mishnah maaser Sheni 1:5) it says that if there is no mikdash it [maaser] should be left to rot. If this is so, there is no holiness even for he that enters there, and there is no [penalty of] karet. [...] The words of the Rambam are correct that one who enters the place of the mikdash is liable for karet because we are all tamei met.

"For the ill" - And this law also applies, that when varicella (chickenpox) blossoms in babies and they die, one should decree a fast, and the Gaon Rabbi Moshe already wrote a prayer for this, and the Shla"h wrote that that one should take one's children out from the city during a time like this, and if one does not do this, they are obligated with their lives (i.e. it involves a serious punishment).

<strong>A Man and His Wife.</strong> Such is apparent from the beginning of Arakhin [Arakhin 3b] where they say that priests are exempt from the Sukkah during the <i>Avodah</i>, see there. And this requires further study, for in Sukkah 28b: Since you might have thought, sit such as you dwell, since one dwells husband and wife, so too Sukkah must be husband and wife, so you have learned that women are exempt. And it should be said, that anyway the husband is not obligated in the Sukkah but where he can dwell there with his wife, and if not, he is <i>Mitzta'er</i> (discomforted) and is exempt from sleeping there, and such wrote the Shela"h, see there. But anyway, this is still difficult, since if he made the Sukkah in a place where he cannot sleep, he has not fulfilled his obligation [when he sits in it], as is written in the Rem"a in Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 640:14, and if so, if he does not have a Sukkah which is isolated [so that he can sleep there with his wife modestly] he has not fulfilled his obligation at all [even when he eats therein], and another difficulty is that in the Gemara we say that "all of Israel are fit to sit in one Sukkah", see there. And it must be said that since he can sleep there alone, the Sukkah is valid, for it is a residence, but he is anyway exempt, for he is considered discomforted.

<b>It</b> is the practice for the poor to circulate to [people's] doors (to ask for charity) on Chanukkah. And in the book, Chanukkat HaBayit, [its author] wrote a reason for this. <b>Women:</b> Specifically women, since the miracle happened through them (Mateh Moshe).
