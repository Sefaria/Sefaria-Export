(Section 43) After she asked about this. It seems apparently that we are talking specifically about after she asked and found a stain and then wore another cloak and also found a stain in it. If these two stains were found together, why shouldn't one rely on the other? However, one could say that from where did the stain on her cloak come? Whether from her body or if she passed by and didn't know about it. Then, the stain on the borrowed cloak also likely came from the same place. Even if the stain on the borrowed cloak was found first and then on her cloak, we can still say that if the other stain is not from her body and she passed by without knowing about it, perhaps she passed by before the stain was found on the borrowed cloak, and when she passed by, everything got stained. Hence, we talk specifically about when it was found in the borrowed cloak, she knew that in her other cloak there was still no stain. (And if one stain is red and another is black, it seems to depend on the disagreement of the decisors which I wrote above in 97 about above and below the belt, whether we rely on one kind of stain for another kind). However, I have a difficulty with this since her stain was found right after the finding of the stain on the borrowed cloak. Otherwise, why do I need that she is the owner of the stain and from the reason that it is not from her body? Even a clear proof would not help as later in 51. And if so, how can it be said that we are talking specifically about the moment she found the stain on the borrowed cloak, it is known that until then her own cloak was not stained, and immediately she found that her own cloak was also stained. To say that we don't rely on this because we don't clearly know that the stain came from her body is impossible since it is known that at that moment she did not pass by, and this requires further study.
