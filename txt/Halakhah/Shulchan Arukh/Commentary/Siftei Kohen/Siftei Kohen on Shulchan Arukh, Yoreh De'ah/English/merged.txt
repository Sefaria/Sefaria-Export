'There is no prohibition from the Torah [in regard to meat and milk] unless it is in a manner of cooking, etc." but not by pickling (כבוש כמבושל does not apply) or salting (מליח כרותח does not apply), since they are not generally how one cooks.

Seif 2

"All meat and milk [mixtures] ... are permitted to benefit from." See the Tur and Issur v'Heter. It is also the opinion of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) in seif 3 that eating chicken in milk is a rabbinic prohibition and is permitted for receiving benefit even rabbinically. This is also the opinion of HaRav Aharon HaLevi in the Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 113. It is also the opinion of the Rambam in chapter 9 of Hilchot of Forbidden Foods explained there, he also explains in his commentary of the Mishnah in Chapter All the Meat (Hullin). It is also explained by HaRav HaMaggid (Vidal of Tolosa in the Maggid Mishneh commentary on Mishneh Torah). It is also understood by Maharshal in Chapter These Forbidden Things (אלו טריפות) siman 100. And the remaining Acharonim hold like the Rambam, and not like the Bach who held that the Rambam actually thought that chicken in milk is prohibited for receiving benefit rabbinically just like eating. And HaMordechai held this in chapter אין מעמידין and noted in the final chapter of Avoda Zara that through pickling or salting it is permitted to receive benefit. and this is how the Mechaber below holds.

Seif 3

"But meat of a pure animal in milk that is impure etc." The Tur says, 'but pure meat (of a kosher animal) in impure milk (milk from a non-kosher animal) or impure meat in pure milk, and meat of a chicken and non-domesticated kosher animal in pure milk is only a rabbinic prohibition for eating and are permitted to cook and receive benefit.' And the Beit Yosef writes, '[the Tur] did not intend to write this language since we don't see this language, that it is only rabbinic, for the first two cases, but only for the non-domesticated animal and chicken in pure milk. This is because in the case of pure meat in impure milk or the opposite, the Rabbis did not prohibit to eat because of mixing meat and milk. They did not establish any Rabbinic prohibitions [in this case], since it is already a Torah prohibition to consume impure meat or impure milk.' This is the corrected way to understand the text [of the Tur] and it is the proper understanding. However, the Bach understands the Tur as is written, that the first two cases are rabbinic prohibitions of mixing meat and milk. The practical reason being 'the piece becomes carrion'/ChaNaN (חנ"נ\ חתיכה נעשית נבילה explained in siman 92) which only applies in the case of mixing meat and milk and also to the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' look there. This is the opinion of the Perisha. According to this, which is how we hold, ChaNaN applies to all forbidden foods, as the [Rema] writes in siman 92 seif 4 see there and search. This is also clear from Rashi and the Ran (Chapter All the Meat - Chullin 113a in the mishna) that [ChaNaN] is not a prohibition based on mixing meat and milk at all even rabbinically, and there is no reason at all that the Rabbis would prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. It makes sense that the Rabbis prohibited mixing chicken with milk, lest one think they can also eat other meat milk, as the Rambam states there. However, the notion to prohibit pure meat with impure milk or vice versa has no reason to worry  about transgressing another prohibited act. This seems to be the intention of the Beit Yosef in not prohibiting [pure meat and impure milk or vice versa] on the basis of mixing meat and milk, unlike the Bach, since it is already forbidden by the Torah and there is no reason to make a decree [fence to protect against another act]. The Beit Yosef is saying that there is no practical case to prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. And this is also the ruling for the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' which explained later in seif 110. Also the Drisha writes at the end there that there is no place that pure meat and impure milk or vice versa has a rabbinic prohibition and is considered carrion on a rabbinic basis.

Seif 4

"Meat of a wild animal and of fowl...and even eating etc." It is the thought of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) that meat from a wild animal and chicken is not forbidden to eat [with milk], even cooked, [from the Torah,] but only Rabbinically. And is permitted for benefit or to cook. The Maharshal and Bach relied on the Maharai (HaRav Isserlin of Temurat Deshen) on his Commentary on Shaarei Dura (Siman 76) who states that it is difficult to be lenient because of the Tosafot (Chullin 104a). Therefore, they held that meat from a wild animal and chick with milk is a Torah prohibition. In my book, I brought sources proving it is Rabbinic from the Talmud, and I brought there many opinions supporting this. Even the Maharai actually held that is only difficult to be lenient based on Tosafot regarding eat cheese immediately after chicken, but he generally agreed that mixing chicken and milk is Rabbinic. As he wrote in his Commentary of Shaarei Dura (Siman 69) that fully developed eggs are permitted to eat with milk since mixing chicken and milk is only Rabbinic [thus allowing us to be] lenient.....

Seif 5

"But fish etc..." The Ateret Zekenim (Menahem Mendel Auerbach 1620-89) writes, "in all situations [we] do not eat fish with milk because of the danger [of tzara'at], as it is explained in Orech Chaim siman 173." Really it follows the Beit Yosef that says this, however it is a scribal error since it is actually written about fish and meat being prohibited because of the danger [of tzara'at] with no mention of milk. Everyday it is common practice to cook fish with milk and eat it. Also the Darchei Moshe rejects the Beit Yosef [the danger is only in cooking together, but eating one after another is fine see Darchei Moshe on the Tur Yoreh De'ah 116] as does Be'er Sheva daf 100 and other Achronim reject him in this, as does the Talmud in Chapter How do we roast (Pesachim 76b). We conclude that is apparent that [eating fish and milk is allowed and] it is not even a worry of danger [of tzara'at].

Seif 6

1. In other words, according to all opinions, regarding the blood of fish, it is permitted completely. Even so, if one covers it in a vessel, it is forbidden because of ma'arat ayin [note: meaning possibly giving someone the impression that something is permitted when forbidden, etc] unless there are fish scales in it which indicate that [this] blood is fish blood. The blood of flesh is forbidden from the Torah; therefore a person who sees [this blood] will say to eat the blood of an animal which is forbidden from the Torah. But fowl with milk is specifically rabbinical and we have to be concerned for ma'arat ayin. 

Seif 7

According to the opinion of the Rav where he says that "all the more so [is it forbidden ab initio to cook meat in impure milk]," we need to resolve that which is written in the Tur Seif 3 that [meat and impure milk] are permitted to cook together and to derive benefit from. This is based on a literal Mishnah in chapter Kol Habasar [chapter 8 of Hullin]. And this is agreed upon by all the Poskim, meaning that it is permitted in practice according to Halacha. However, due to the concern for mar'it ha'ayin (appearance of impropriety), it is not advisable to do so. A practical implication would be situations where there is no concern for the appearance of impropriety, such as in the case of medical treatment and the like. Like that which the Maharshal wrote in 25:102, that [cooking] breastmilk [with meat] for health reasons is permitted, "even if there is no danger at all, since there is no prohibition involved except for mar'it ha'ayin." There are also other situations where there is no concern of mar'it ha'ayin. And this resolves what was left unanswered in the Torat Hatat regarding the Rashba. Indeed the words of the poskim who wrote generally that [milk from a non-kosher animal] is permissible to cook imply that even regarding mar'it ha'ayin, there is no concern. And such is found in the writing of the Maharshal, Perek 25. And this is the implied opinion of the Mechaber, who did not write that the milk of an impure animal is forbidden because of mar'it ha'ayin. Therefore, it seems clear to me that there, it is different since in any case, one of them (i.e., either the milk or the meat) is prohibited to eat, since there is definitely no issue with cooking per se, because you could have been cooking for medicinal or other purposes. When we say it is forbidden to cook them, we mean to eat them. What the mehaber says in seif 5 "it is forbidden to cook them," that must also mean to eat them. We see often in Scripture and Mishnah that eating is referred to as cooking. It's only in these cases [of eating] that there is mar'it ha'ayin. 

Seif 8

1. We find this opinion in Seif 3. However, according to what is written in Siman 100:6, even with chicken there is reason to worry. And this is the holding of the Rashbah and the Mechaber. And there is no difference between an animal or fowl (i.e. between meat and chicken).

<b>It is forbidden when one gives to taste:</b><br>Meaning, he should let a cook taste whether there is in it taste, as we established earlier in the beginning of siman 92 and 98, and such is written in the Beis Yosef. And the Rama goes according to his own reasoning, in that he writes in those places that we are not accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-jew. Therefore he writes <i>"And one needs to measure against the whole pot"</i>.<br>And although it is implied in many places that that there is not in the volume of the amount contained in the utensil (the pot) sixty times the whole utensil (the walls and floor of the pot), one might answer that nevertheless, he is saying that one needs to measure it against the whole pot, and that therefore it will (always) be forbidden.<br><br>Alternatively, we find sometimes that the width of the pot is so big that it holds an amount of water that will be sixty times it (the walls and floor of the pot). For example if the copper (the material the pot is made of) is thin, but very wide, and like the Beis Yosef writes.<br><br>But in any case, this that we would need to measure (the contents of the pot) against the whole (walls and floor of the) pot, is by a used pot, that we don't know how much it has absorbed. But if we know how much it has absorbed, one need only measure against that amount that it had absorbed, as is said in 92:5 in the Rama, and in 94:6 and many places. And the same goes for when it was used, and we don't know how much was absorbed, but we know how much was cooked in it within 24 hours from the cooking of this milk, since what was cooked in it before 24 hours is <i>nosein ta'am lifgam</i>. And even if some meat was cooked in it within 24 hours of cooking the first meat, one does not need sixty times anything other than the second meat, and consider this.

Seif 2

AGAINST THE WHOLE POT: And later in Siman 98 he will explain that there is no difference between a pot of metal or of earthenware, one always needs to measure it against the whole pot, see there.

Seif 3

BUT THE POT IS FORBIDDEN TO COOK IN IT, NOT MEAT AND NOT MILK: Since it has absorbed both of them. Therefore, it is forbidden to cook meat in it from the outset (lechatchila) even after 24 hours from cooking now, the same way it is forbidden to cook milk from the outset in a pot of meat after 24 hours. However if he cooked meat in it WITHIN 24 hours of cooking milk in it, it's obvious that the food will be forbidden (even after the fact). But if he cooked milk it's obvious that it will be permitted after the fact. <br><br>However, other things that aren't of meat or of milk (pareve items), such as vegetables and fish and things like that, are permitted to cook in it even from the outset.<br><br>And later in 94:5 the Rama writes that the custom is to forbid a utensil that had been left for 24 hours even for other things (pareve), even when one had only dipped a spoon that had been used within 24 hours. If so, certainly (the custom applies) here where one cooked actual meat in it. We must explain that here he minced words regarding the halacha. And see what I wrote there in siman 94.

Seif 4

AND IT IS A STRINGENCY WITHOUT ANY REASON <br><br> Nevertheless, in Toras Chatos 85:4 he writes a bit of a reason according the ones stringent, which is that they hold that the prohibitions of steam (see 92:8) and smell (see 108) are stronger than that which is on account of taste itself. However Maharshal in his book of Issur Veheter siman 35 rejects another similar reason, and through his rejection rejects this reason as well, see there.<br><br> And he writes (quote) that it is only with those covers that are short (confined) on top, and which have in them something like a cavity as there is in many covers, and are therefore impossible to to clean well enough to be pure of any steaming or simmering that ascended there. But those that are wide (easily accessible) on top, and one's hand is able to reach in them to scrub them well, we do not say that there is physical issur (leftover), and it is permitted, end quote. <br><br> And according to his words we are forced to say that even though that which is in the confined space is a small amount (which should generally be batul beshishim), nevertheless the steam of the meat rises above (into that confined space) less than 60 times it, until it makes the physical amount (in the confined space) neveila, and subsequently the cover itself becomes neveila, as in 98:5, that there may not be 3660 times, minus a bit, the physical amount (in the confined space), and it is similar to what we said earlier in 92:5, see there. <br><br> But at any rate one definitely need not be so stringent when dealing with a cover, just as the Rama says here. And this is what is said in Aphei Ravrevei 61a, that in extenuating circumstances, or if there is any other reason to permit it, or if it is a wide cover, or if it is perforated on top, it would seem that one may permit it. And in addition, the Darchei Moshe screams bloody murder about this minhag, since it is a mistaken minhag, and it has no reason to explain it. And even the Ateres Zahav calls foul on this minhag.

Seif 5

<b>If  it starts to steam:</b> And it would seem that it needs to be hot enough for the hand to avoid in the steam, and like we said earlier in 92:8 in the <i>Rama</i>.

Forbidden Foods etc. that mix with Fat: We infer that its Fat pronounced with a Zeirei which means fat (not Milk). So this is also implied by the Tur. Tastes of fat and meat are not the same. There is an opinion that is brought down elsewhere that the taste is the same - the answer to that theory is that it's referring to fatty meat. We have a Psak in the following paragraph that food that mixes with unalike foods, as long as the gives taste to the other it becomes prohibited. If so, why would we trust a gentile who speaks without intent? It clearly states in the Gemara that a Gentile who speaks without intent is not trusted in regard to Halachic prohibitions with exception to Testimony regarding a woman.

The following is still questionable - 

Seif 2

A Gentile should taste it etc: He mustn't know that we are relied on him to determine the Halachic decision. In the Beis Yosef it was established that Gentiles who are not expert Chefs, we trust when they are speaking without any intent. Regarding someone who is a Chef, even if he is speaking with intent we will trust him because lying could damage his reputation. It's explained that here we are referring in this scenario to someone who is not an expert; Therefore he cannot know that we are taking into account his opinion. The following paragraph it says when one food mixes into another food of a different type (Issur), it makes it forbidden M'daraisah if taste is apparent. "How do we trust a gentile to determine the Kosher status?" (The only time a gentile is trusted when speaking nonchalantly is regarding "Eidut Eisha, the other allowing opinions don't consider taste to be of a biblical standard rather majority being the ruling factor). Theres also a question on the Rashba that hold that biblically it needs to be nullified by 60x. The Rashba believes a gentile who speaks nonchalantly

...And the Poskim write that the reason for this is that a doubt (ספק) that is dependent on a lack of knowledge can not really be considered a doubt (ספק), for this is merely the [faulty] knowledge of stupid people , which is not true of the first case that comes from a doubt (ספק) connected to spilling the substance.

Prohibited for benefit etc. It is explained in Talmud Avodah Zarah (74a), things which are forbidden for benefit, for example milk and meat, if they were large enough to be served as an entree their mixture would make it prohibited to derive pleasure from the whole bunch, even up to 1:1000. So is written by the codifiers, see Ran ad loc. and see 109:5. However it would be permitted to sell the bunch to a gentile aside from the value of the actual forbidden food, as I wrote in siman 110:2.

Seif 2

If it is doubtful etc: Since the rule against nullifying an entree sized item in a majority is Rabbinical, and we are lenient when in doubt about Rabbinical prohibitions. This is specifically is it is doubtful that he item is large enough, however if it is clear that the item is large enough and the doubt is whether the item forbidden, it cannot be nullified, as stated in 110:9, see there.

Seif 3

Milk and meat: For although each on its own is permitted, yet through their mixture they as one new forbidden item. 

Seif 4

It does not have the law of Chaticha Hare'uya Lehitkabed: The codifiers explain the reason, that in any case the absorbed prohibited matter would not be large enough to serve as an entree.

It seems that the opinion of the Mechaber and the Rav in this entire siman is that there is no prohibition with the bread of oved kochavim unless it was baked by an oved kochavim. As the B"Y wrote, the opinion of the Rambam and Rashba is that even tough the dough was kneaded and arranged by an oved kochavim, as long a Yisrael did any action of baking, it is permitted. Therefore, the Mechaber did not write any laws of kneading or arranging, as was written in B"Y, which was only according to the opinion of Ran and Tur (as opposed to the Rambam and Rashba)

The one who is suspected of eating [non-kosher food, etc.]. The Ra'ah in his book Bedek Habayit objected to this saying, 'What is it saying? If he is suspected of this thing, it is obvious and we don’t need a reason that he is suspected of what the majority are not lenient about. And if he is not suspected of this thing, but is suspected of other things that the majority are not lenient about, what then? Isn’t a person who transgresses one thing not considered a transgressor in other things?'
The Rashba in Mishmeret Habayit objected to him and wrote, 'Certainly, if he is not suspected of something that the majority are not lenient about, even though he is lenient in a matter that the majority are lenient about, we entrust him with that very matter and we are not concerned about substitution, because this is not called a transgressor for that thing. As what he is lenient about in this matter is not considered by him as transgressing and as a transgressor for that [specific law], etc. But one who is suspected in a matter that the majority are not lenient about, like non-kosher meat and similar, we do not entrust him with that matter if it is of Torah origin until it has two seals.'
The Rashba basically holds that being suspected of substituting because he is considered a transgressor in that matter, but in a matter that the majority are lenient about, he is not called a transgressor for that matter. Otherwise, he agrees with the Ra'ah that a transgressor in one matter is not considered a transgressor in other matters. Why didn’t the Rashba write that someone who is suspected in a matter that the majority are not lenient about is considered a transgressor in all prohibitions? Certainly, it is obvious that being suspected in one matter does not make one suspected in other matters, as implied by the entire discussion in Tractate Chullin and in Bava Kamma, and as appears in several places in the Talmud and in the words of the decisors, and the Tur in Section 4 clearly implies this in the words of Rabbi Yerucham at the end of Netiv 15, and all this is obvious in my eyes. I didn’t need to write it, but because I saw that the Bach in Section 2 took a different approach and understood that what the Rashba holds, that being suspected of substitution, is because he holds that one who is suspected in a matter that the majority are not lenient about is suspected in all of Torah. Therefore, he left the words of the Rashba in doubt and the Tur is astonished about their conclusion and wrote that one who is suspected in one thing is not suspected in other things, and we didn’t clarify the matters that need extensive clarification, and I didn’t come to a final understanding and the matter is clear as I said, and see in Section 151, Subsection 'Moreover, from the laws of suspicion'.

<b>And it is prohibited to enter therein.</b> Maimonides wrote in his Commentary to the Mishna, "Thus know that every city of an idolatrous nation which has an idolatrous house of prayer which is a center of idol worship is certainly forbidden to pass through intentionally, all the more so to dwell there. However, during this time when we are under their hand due to our sins and thus reside in their lands we are coerced in this matter. In this way is the verse, "There you will worship other gods, the work of mere man, gods of wood and stone." (Deuteronomy 4:28) If the law is such for the city <i>a fortiori</i> a center of idolatry itself which it is prohibited for us to even look at, all the more so to enter it."

If one places their mezuzah on the inside of the door, retroactively it is valid - this seems to be the opinion of the Tur and of R. Moshe Isserlis, but according to the Nimmukei Yosef and to the Rambam it would be invalid, and this was also the ruling of the Beit Yosef. Therefore, if one did so one should put it up again in the proper place on the outside. However, in the book Maadanei Hamelech (76a) he describes houses open to the public domain where idolators live, and as a result the Jews put up their mezuzot behind their doors. He writes that those who do so have on what to rely upon, namely the words of the Tur and Isserlis.
