Teshuvot Min HaShamayim



Siman 1

I asked [in a dream] regarding those women who recite a blessing before shaking the Lulav , and about reciting a blessing before blowing the shofar for them - is there a transgression or a superfluous blessing in these cases, since they are not fully obligated?
They responded: <i>"How pious are these generations!" (Yevamot 39b:15) "All that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice!" (Genesis 21:12) "Go and say to them, return to your tents and bless your God!" (Deuteronomy 5:27, Nehemiah 9:5)</i> The proof is from Channukah candles and megillah reading. They explained to me that just as in these cases, since the women were involved in the original miracle they are obligated to perform the commandment and recite the blessing, so too with the Lulav, we find that the [entire] Jewish people have only one heart directed to their Father in heaven (Sukkah 45b.9). So too with the Shofar, we are taught that the Holy One said: bring me [verses of] kingship, that I may be your king, and [verses of] remembrance, that the memory of your ancestors come before Me favourably, and all of that, with a Shofar. (Rosh Hashanah 34b.7) Now, women also need to be remembered before Him favourably. Therefore, if they recite the blessings for these commandments, they have permission to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">This is also the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, quoted in Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 33a:5</i> 

Siman 2

Regarding the blessing of the <i>tefillin</i>, I asked whether the law followed the opinion of R. Isaac Alfasi, that if there was no interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i> no additional blessing needs to be recited: i.e, the blessing 'to don <i>tefillin</i>' is recited when putting the first one on the arm, and for the head, nothing is said at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rif Menachot 8a.6</i>  Or perhaps, the law follows those geonim who say that even if one did not speak between the two, one needs to recite the blessing 'on the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>' before placing it on the head, and if one did interrupt with speech, one recites two blessings when putting it on the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, quoted in Tosafot on Menachot 36a:3 .</i>  
They answered:<i>"Reason is not with the aged, and counsel is not with the young." (Shabbat 89b:4) "For Abraham knows us not, Israel does not recognise us" (Isaiah 63:16), rather "my covenant will be made with Isaac." (Genesis 17:21), "I have singled him out," (Isaiah 51:2) "and will give him the birthright," (Psalms 89:28) "and he shall be blessed." (Genesis 27:33)</i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">These verses seem to support Isaac, i.e, R. Isaac Alfasi, over the Abraham and Jacob, perhaps referring to Rabbeinu Tam.</i>  

Siman 3

Regarding the order of the paragraphs inside the tefillin, I asked the following question [in my dream]: Please, great and awesome King, sage of the mysteries, who reveals the concealed and guards his covenant of kindness - increase your kindness with us and instruct your holy angels to inform us about the doubt we have with regard to the order of the paragraphs in the tefillin! For some sages say that the paragraphs beginning with the words <i>'vehayah'</i> should be in the middle, and if they are not, the tefillin are invalid<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, quoted in Tosafot on Menachot 34b:10</i> , [while others hold the opposite, and the verses should be in chronological order<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi on Menachot 34b:10</i> ]. Now, King of Kings, order your holy angels to instruct me according to whom is the halacha, and whose words You enjoy!
They responded as follows: <i>"These and these are the words of the living God!" (Eruvin 13b)</i> Just as you dispute below, so we dispute above. For the Holy One, blessed be He, holds that the paragraphs beginning with the words <i>'vehayah'</i> should be in the middle of the tefillin, and all of the heavenly host say that they follow their chronological order. <i>"This is what He meant in saying, Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.” (Leviticus 10:3)</i> - His glory is in the paragraph of his Kingship being first.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">This was a widespread debate throughout the Jewish world. See, for example, a question sent from the community of Lunel to Maimonides asking a similar question to the one posed here, quoted in Kessef Mishneh on Mishneh Torah, Tefillin 3:5. The last comment seems to allude to the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, with the paragraph of the Shema (termed a phrase of Kingship in Rosh Hashanah 32b:16) on the outermost side, the first one from the perspective of the one wearing the tefillin on their head.</i> 

Siman 4

Regarding the principle of <i>shhvut d'shvut</i>, a double rabbinic commandment. I examined and asked [in my dream] about carrying a lit candle on Shabbat, which is forbidden because of <i>shvut</i>, a rabbinic prohibition. I asked whether it is permitted to ask a non-Jew to carry the candle from place to place, since even for a Jew the only reason to refrain from doing so is the rabbinic decree<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Isaac Alfasi seems to hold such an opinion in cases of need, see Rif Shabbat 56a</i>, or whether asking a non-Jew to do something on Shabbat is always considered <i>shvut</i> even when the action being requested is not forbidden by the Torah itself, since the rabbis forbade making such requests<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of R. Isaac of Dampierre ("the Ri"), quoted in Tosafot on Bava Kamma 80b:15</i>. 
They answered: <i>"Now you stand here with me" (Deuteronomy 5:27) "And I shall give you the instructions and the laws that I have written to inform them" (Exodus 24:12) "Let no hand touch it, for stoned or shot" (Exodus 19:13) will be anyone who touches their words, "it is like touching the pupil of their own eye." (Zechariah 2:12)</i> For in many places, the sages made their own laws stricter than those of the Torah. All this they responded to me. 

Siman 5

Regarding the ritual immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i>, one who had seminal emissions. For it was taught that the laws of ritual immersion for seminal emissions were abolished, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira (Berakhot 22a). Some of the Geonim wrote that this applies to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the study of Torah, but for prayer one needs to immerse or be washed with 9 <i>kav</i> of water<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rav Hai Gaon, quoted in Rif Berakhot 13b:6</i>. And some are lenient and say that even for prayer the practice was abolished<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion of the Ri is quoted in Tosafot on Berakhot 15a:4</i>. They rely on the Talmudic discussion, where both washing and sexual activity is forbidden on Yom Kippur (Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 8:1). The question is raised regarding the superfluity of both these activities being mentioned, and is resolved by saying that it applies to those localities where immersion was not necessary after seminal emissions. I asked [in my dream] whether it was  possible to rely on the Jerusalem Talmud, and say that the decree of Ezra to immerse was not universally accepted, and only in those places where it was accepted do they need to immerse or rinse before prayer, and in those where it wasn't they don't. Or whether perhaps the law follows the more stringent opinion of the Geonim who say that one always needs ritual immersion or to be washed with 9 <i>kav</i> of water before prayer.
They responded: <i>"Worship the Lord your God" (Exodus 23:25) - this refers to prayer! (Bava Kamma 92b)</i> Can somebody impure offer a sacrifice? Do not say that this impurity is any different, because it is intentional and because it comes from within. Ezra, who made this decree of immersion before prayer, saw with the holy spirit before making this decree. Regarding that text in the Jerusalem Talmud, if [Ezra] would stand with them they would not know what to say. In fact, they retracted their words, and said that the entire problematic text was referring to the time before Ezra. This situation [of praying without immersion] is what causes the long exile, for if the prayer of Israel was performed correctly it would have been heard long ago. Only the trials of the exile,  and acts of righteousness, and study of the Torah - these are what Israel have to rely upon. Later, they again responded and said: we have heard a voice from behind the Heavenly curtain saying: To purify all of Israel together may not be possible, but if at least the prayer leader is pure, even that will hasten the redemption. <i>"In every place where a pure offering is dedicated to Me" (Malachi 1:11) "I shall come to you and bless you" (Exodus 20:21).</i> After seeing all this, on Tuesday night, the 19th of the month of Kislev, I asked whether it had come to me directly from God or not. This was my precise question: Please, exalted King, great and mighty and awesome God, who keeps the covenant and kindness with those He loves. Maintain your covenant and kindness with us, and instruct your holy angels who are assigned to answer dream-questions to respond to my question. May it be a true and correct response, let them speak with clarity and explanations, revealing the law and leaving no doubt. For regarding what I asked about the immersion of one with seminal emissions, did this response emanate from the holy spirit? Do they have practical value, and should I reveal them to my son-in-law, Rabbi Yosef<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Keset Hasofer ad loc., who identifies this son-in-law as Joseph ben Kalonymus</i>, and instruct him to inform all the sages of the land? Or do they come from another spirit, and have no practical value, and it would be better for me to conceal and guard them? They responded: True were the words of God. These words are ancient, the Ancient of Days spoke them, <i>"Today is the day of revelation, and we have waited until the light of day" (II Kings 7:9).</i> Later they responded: <i>"And the one who willingly refuses to listen to the serving priest, that man shall die," (Deuteronomy 17:12)</i> and <i>"I am with you, and I shall guard you in everything you do." (Genesis 28:15)</i>

Siman 6

Regarding our Torah scrolls. Even though Rabbeinu Yaakov of blessed memory permits processed parchment, even without the use of gall<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Tosafot on Menachot 31b:2, where this ruling is cited in the name of Rabbeinu Tam</i>, there still remains a doubt. For when our parchment is processed, it is not done with the intention of becoming a Torah scroll, and I asked whether one can recite the blessing on reading from such scrolls that weren't processed with the correct intention, or not<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Tur Yoreh Deah 271 where both sides of this debate are presented in a gaonic responsum</i>. 
They responded: we hold this tradition, that while certainly anything processed with the wrong intention is invalid, if it is neutral it is valid. They explained to me the following: if the one processing the parchment did so with the intention of writing other books, and then changed their mind and wrote a Torah scroll, that would be invalid. However, if they were processed with any intention of the final book, but only to sell them as parchment to whoever would buy it, and somebody purchased it with the intention of writing a Torah scroll, this would be valid. 

Siman 7

Regarding reciting a blessing on a Torah scroll not processed with gall. Some sages permit such a scroll, since our contemporary processing of the parchment makes it strong and durable on account of the slaked lime used, and the writing is more permanent than on parchment processed with gall, as required by the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the argumentation of Rabbeinu Tam, cited in Tosafot on Megillah 19a:1</i>. Other sages forbid reciting a blessing on such scrolls. I asked: which opinion is correct?
They responded: By God! The Rabbi has declared it fit for all of Israel.

Siman 8

Regarding the Talmudic debate (Megillah 5a:2), in which Rav held that the Megillah can be read by an individual on Purim, while Rav Asi held that at all times it requires the presence of ten people, and that in practice Rav followed the opinion of Rav Asi. The Rif subsequently ruled that the halacha follows the opinion of Rav, that in its proper time the Megillah can be read by an individual<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rif Megillah 3a:2</i>, while other sages ruled that the halacha follows Rav Asi, that even at the proper time it requires ten people<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here might be to R. Zerachiah Halevi (see Hamaor Hakatan on Megillah 3a), to the author of Halachot Gedolot or to Rav Amram Gaon, both quoted in Tur Orach Chaim 690</i>. On this matter, I wish to ask whether the halacha follows the first gaon, or whether it follows the sages who disagree with him.
They responded: <i>"These days are recalled and observed" (Esther 9:28)</i> - just as they are observed by an individual, so too are they recalled by an individual. They also said: <i>the reading of the Megillah is like Hallel (Megillah 14a)</i> - just as the recitation of Hallel at its time is done by an individual, so too with the Megillah. As it is written (Psalms 22:3) <i>"My God, I cry by day—You answer not; by night, and have no respite"</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This Psalm is attributed to Esther, see Yoma 29a:4</i>  - all this in first person singular. So too, "This is my God, I shall glorify Him" (Exodus 15:2) - first person singular. Some time later they responded again: <i>"Isaac spoke and said, why have you come to me, and you hate me, etc." "And they said to him, behold we have seen that God is with you etc.," "And we shall send you in peace, for you are now blessed by God." "Let there be a bond between us, and let us make a covenant with you." (Genesis 26:27-29) "Like an apple among the trees of the forest is my lover among men, I craved to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my tongue." (Song of Songs 2:3)</i> All this they reported to me in truth, in my dream, exactly as I have written.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The last set of verses seems to be an account of a conversation in the heavenly Yeshiva, where the Rif (Isaac) defends his position from that of the others.</i> 

Siman 9

Regarding the holy name of 42 letters, I asked whether it is permitted to use it to adjure the angels responsible for the Torah to become wise in everything one studies and not to forget anything learned, and also whether one can use it to adjure the angels responsible for wealth and defeating enemies and finding grace in the eyes of ministers - or whether it is forbidden to use it for all these purposes.
They answered: <i>"Holy! Holy! Holy! is the Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 6:3) - "that alone will provide for you" (Exodus 12:16), "for all your needs" (Beitzah 28b).</i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">It seems that the response is to trust in God rather than using angels.</i> 

Siman 10

Regarding the Torah-study blessing, [I asked in my dream] whether one needs to recite the blessing each and every time one sits to study, as in the case of Tefillin, where one says the blessing each time they are worn<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Raavad, cited in Rashba on Berakhot 11b</i>; or whether one need not recite the blessing, and the blessing recited as part of the morning prayers covers all acts of study throughout the day<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Ri, cited in Tosafot on Berakhot 11b.10.1</i>. 
They responded: <i>"The glory of God, conceal the matter," (Psalms 25:2) "And all who bless are blessed" (Sotah 38b) "By the true God." (Isaiah 65:16).</i> I was unsure of the meaning of this response, so I asked my question again. They responded: the blessing for Torah-study is different to that of other commandments. Since enjoyment of the Torah is constantly part of human life, it was endowed with three separate blessings - <i>"La'asok," "Veha'arev,"</i> and <i>"Asher Bachar"</i>. The blessing of <i>"La'asok"</i> relates to the commandment; that of <i>"Veha'arev"</i> is a prayer that we merit to learn and teach, while <i>"Asher Bachar"</i> is a blessing of thanksgiving, since all Israel is required to give thanks to God who chose them from among the nations and gave them the Torah. There were also two blessings instituted before the recitation of the Shema, in the morning and in the evening, whose essence is also about enjoyment of the Torah. Other blessings however have a short formulation, and they are recited each time after an interruption in the action they refer to. This explains the blessing instituted in honour of the Torah reading in the synagogue, which is <i>"Asher Bachar"</i>, and the sages didn't require us to recite the blessing <i>"La'asok"</i> on fulfilling a commandment, or the blessing <i>"Veha'arev,"</i> which is a prayer. And since it is in the form of a prayer, all three were instituted as part of the morning prayers.

Siman 11

Regarding bottles, which the 'Sages of the Mountain' <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis of Montpellier</i> said can be made kosher with a small amount of boiling water, which is poured into the bottles and shaken around<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to be have been the ruling of Rabbeinu Tam, at least in extraordinary cases. See Kol Bo 96:111 and Tosafot on Zevachim 95b:4</i>. Other sages forbid this practice, and say that they need to be filled with boiling water if one wants to render them kosher, and just shaking some water does nothing to change their status, unless they are completely full. Otherwise, they need to be soaked in water for three full days <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, 72 hours. This is the opinion of the Rif Avodah Zarah 12a</i>. I asked [in my dream] whether the law follows those who forbid or those who permit.
They responded: <i>"Abundant waters are drained by them" (Psalms 73:10) "If you care for your soul" (Psalms 23:2).</i>

Siman 12

Regarding the morning blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">listed in the Talmud, Berakhot 60b:5</i>, we have a doubt. Some say that each and every one should be recited at its appropriate time, and only if there is an opportunity to do or encounter the action that the blessing refers to. For example, if one did not hear a rooster crow, one would not recite the blessing <i>"Who gives wisdom to the rooster."</i> If one sleeps in their clothes, they would not recite the blessing <i>"Who clothes the naked."</i> Similarly, if one walks barefoot, such as  on Tisha B'av or on Yom Kippur, they would not recite the blessing <i>"Who has provided all my needs."</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion, with caveats, is cited in Tosafot on Berakhot 60b:5</i>. I asked [in my dream] if this is  truly the law, or whether it follows those who say that one recites the full set of blessings even after the action or even if the action does not present itself that day.
They responded: <i>"Do not disdain your mother of old" (Proverbs 23:22) "and take the customs of your fathers in your hands" (Beitzah 4b)</i>. For these blessings were originally instituted in order to complete the 100 blessings that one is required to recite daily<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This statement about the requirement to recite one hundred blessings is brought immediately after the list of morning blessings in Rif Berakhot 44b:2, perhaps the impetus for this association</i>, and there is no need to be meticulous to say the blessing before the action they refer to. We are not meticulous about the exact timing of the blessing for sitting in the Sukkah, which is required over a cup of wine. Similarly, if one did not hear the rooster or one slept in their clothes, they say the blessing anyway. The proof is from the daily Amida blessings. Even if one doesn't have a sick person in their household, they are required to say the blessing <i>"Who heals the sick, etc."</i> And even one who is rich and has no need for income says the blessing for the prosperity of the year.

Siman 13

Regarding alleyways open at both ends, whose width does not reach 16 cubits, would it be possible to make an 'eruv', combining them into provide domains, and make it permitted to carry through them on Shabbat by means of a door-frame on one side, and a post and perpendicular protrusion on the other side?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion held by the Rif Eruvin 2a</i> Or is this not possible?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion given in Tosafot on Eruvin 6b:2, named as the opinion of the Ri in Tur Orach Chaim 364.</i>
They responded: If you allow this, you have negated the laws of carrying on Shabbat.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Eruvin 64a:1</i>

Siman 14

Regarding one who pauses in their Shabbat lunch, recites the blessing usually said after a meal, and then continues to eat their third meal straight away.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Such a practice is quoted in Halakhot Gedolot 7:31, and attributed to the Rosh in Tur Orach Chaim 291.</i> Some say that doing so does not fulfill the commandment to have three meals on Shabbat, for even though they recited the blessing after the meal, it is still considered one long meal - three meals refers to evening, morning and afternoon.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion cited in Tosafot on Shabbat 118a:1</i> I asked whether this practice was valid or not.
They responded: <i>"Let me enlighten you and show you the way,"</i> (Psalms 32:8) for this matter can be learned from the Torah of our teacher Moses. For it is written (Exodus 16:25) <i>"Eat it today, for today is a sabbath of God; you will not find it today on the plain."</i> Just as the days are separated from each other<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, the three mentions of the word 'today' in the verse</i>, so too do the times of the three meals need to be separated from each other.

Siman 15

Regarding those who have the custom to say the <i>Shehechiyanu</i> blessing in the morning of Purim when reading the Megillah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the custom of the Ri, cited in Tosafot on Megillah 4a:8 (attributed to Rabbeinu Tam in Tur Orach Chaim 692)</i>. For some only recite this blessing at nighttime, which is the case for all other festivals, and therefore they hold it should not be recited before the morning Megillah reading<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the ruling of Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Megillah vChanukah 1:3</i>. I asked [in my dream] which opinion should be followed.
They responded: <i>"Do not disdain your mother of old." (Proverbs 23:22)</i> For these correct customs were instituted by wise and pious sages, and they have a reason even when it is not apparent. They gave the reason for this practice: in the evening, one recites the blessing for having arrived at the time of the Megillah reading. In the morning however, we say the blessing on having arrived at the time of feasting and exchanging gifts of food, for the rabbis said (Megillah 7b): "One who eats their Purim feast in the evening has not fulfilled their obligation." If you ask why then we do not recite the blessing at the time of the feast itself, it is lest one transgresses, because of the engagements of the day, and forgets to recite it. Therefore, they instituted its recitation in the morning, at the time of the Megillah reading. 

Siman 16

Regarding a linen tallit with linen tzitzit. Does the law follow the Gaon who held that one fulfils their obligation by wearing such a garment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rif Menachot 13b:3</i>, or does it follow those who disagree, and hold that one is required to wear a wool robe with threads of wool, and that linen threads don't fulfill the commandment even if it is the same material as the garment itself<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, cited in Tosafot on Menachot 40a:1</i>?
They responded: <i>"O Generation! See the word of God!" "Why do you argue about Me? You have all sinned before me!" (Jeremiah 2:29-31)</i> They explained their words as follows: <i>"O Generation"</i> - are you as the generation who crossed the desert, which argued about the <i>techelet</i> dye?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Midrash Tanchuma, Korach 2, quoted by Rashi on Numbers 16:1 </i> Why then do you argue then about wool and linen? <i>"You have all sinned before me!"</i> - for neither will wool nor with linen [<i>techelet</i> threads] do you come. <i>"See the word of God!"</i> - See what is written in the Torah. Does is not say <i>"see... and recall... and perform"</i> (Numbers 15:39)? The time of performing this commandment of tzitzit is the entire day <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, throughout the daylight hours, when one can 'see'.</i>, yet you rid yourself of this obligation after a single hour. The early pious ones are testimony to the habit of not walking even one moment without wearing tzitzit. All this they truly responded to me, and my heart was disturbed over this response. I gathered my strength and asked again before the King, that he might instruct them to inform me whether a woolen tallit is more acceptable than a linen one, or whether they are equal, or whether linen is invalid. They responded: the halacha is well-established among us that wool and linen are equal, and for each one, the threads are valid for the garment of that type. The reason comes from what is written (Numbers 15:38) <i> "They shall make for themselves tzitzit on the corners of their garments." </i> Why does it specify 'for themselves'? It means that any garment that is common among them. For the Torah does not want to be oppressive and require something that not everybody has. Rather, it allows whichever of these two materials their garment is made of, wool or linen. Some time later they responded again: <i>"It is because of the anger replaced in our bags, to make us roll and to condemn us."</i> (cf. Genesis 43:18) They were precise about this word 'anger', spelling it out to me <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The original verse has the word 'kessef', money, while here they say 'ketsef', anger.</i>  They explained that the Great King is angry with us on this matter of tzitzit, that we should have paid attention to and have worn it on the corners of our garments. Now we are being brought to the Day of Judgement, 'to make us roll and condemn us'.

Siman 17

Regarding wine made by non-Jews, [I asked in my dream] whether a minute quantity of it makes an entire mixture forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Maimonides in Mishneh Torah Forbidden Foods 16:29</i>, or whether it is nullified by sixty times its volume<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam and the Ri, cited in Tosafot on Avodah Zarah 73a:2</i>.
They responded: Even though non-Jewish wine is forbidden by a rabbinic decree, the Torah is more stringent with issues of idolatry than with any other prohibition, as it is written (Deuteronomy 7:26): <i>"Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, etc."</i> Any person who is strict with a decree ordained by the sages will have merit on the Day of Judgement. It is also written (Kohelet 7:27): <i>"See, this I have found, said Kohelet, one to one to find an account."</i> They explained to me that every decree ordained by the sages is exactly equivalent, 'one to one,' to the core biblical commandment. Why did they make these decrees? 'To find an account,' large and full of merit when coming before the Great King on the Day of Judgement. This is the meaning of 'one to one,' the equivalence of decrees to observing commandments, 'to find an account' of merit. All this they responded to me in truth. 

Siman 18

Regarding those who plant vegetables in their vineyards. They rely on that which was said (Berachot 22a:13) "Common practice follows the opinion of Rabbi Yoshiya with regards to <i>kilyaim</i>, forbidden mixtures in the vineyard, and one is not punished unless one sows wheat, barley and grape-seed all at once." They say that since the Talmud uses the term 'common practice', it seems that sowing only wheat - and even more so, vegetables - in the vineyard is permitted. Moreover, even in the land of Israel itself, planting vegetables in the vineyard is only a rabbinic prohibition, it therefore stands to reason that outside the land it should be permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion cited in Tosafot on Kiddushin 39a:12, attributed to the Ri in Beit Yosef on Yoreh Deah 296. The Meiri on Kiddushin 39a:9 mentions that "the rabbis of France are lenient on this matter."</i>. And there are those who understand this differently. They say that when the Talmud made this comment about common practice regarding <i>kilyaim</i>, as well as two other examples of 'common practice' (that of following Rabbi Ilai's opinion concerning wool offering and that of following Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira's opinion regarding immersion before Torah study) - the sage who gave all these examples of 'common practice' was worried and concerned about the people  who were permitting what was forbidden. I asked [in my dream] whether we can rely on those who are permissive, or whether the law follows those who forbid.
They responded: <i>"Israel has sinned" (Joshua 7:11) "And what they have sinned regarding the sacred" (Leviticus 5:16) <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">the word 'kodesh' is used both for sacred objects and places, but also refers to the forbidden plants in the vineyard, cf. Deuteronomy 22:9</i>  "They will pay sevenfold" (Proverbs 6:31)</i>

Siman 19

Regarding the common practice of reciting the Shema in the evening before the appearance of stars in the sky. They rely on the re-reading of the first paragraph of the Shema before going to sleep<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi on Berakhot 2a:1</i>. This is questionable, for in doing so they say the blessings before and after the Shema at the improper time, while the Shema at its proper time <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, the one before going to sleep</i> is recited with no blessings at all, and consists of only one paragraph. There are those sages who do not say the blessings before and after the earlier Shema, and do are not concerned about praying the evening prayers early, and they wait until the correct time for the recitation of the Shema <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, after nightfall</i> to say it with its blessings. They are also not concerned about reciting the evening prayer before the Shema, since by doing so they manage to pray together with the community<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Amram Gaon is quoted in Tur Orach Chaim 235 as requiring blessings for the bedtime Shemaץ See also the responsum of Rav Hai Gaon quoted ad loc</i>. I asked [in my dream] which of these two ways is preferable: reciting the Shema with its blessings earlier, together with the community, and praying afterwards, despite this not being the correct time, and relying on the shorter night-time recital before going to sleep, or whether the other custom I described is better.
They responded briefly: <i>"Together we offer our hearts, bless the name of God forever." </i> <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is found in early Ashkenazi prayerbooks before the evening prayer (see Machzor Vitri, Preludes for Maariv 431). It seems that the response gives support for the first option, privileging the communal prayer at the 'wrong' time, and not concerned about the superfluity of the earlier blessings.</i>

Siman 20

Regarding the permissibility of a Jew telling a non-Jew before Shabbat: Here are some coins, go buy me some fruit, geese, and chickens! Do we say here that since the coins were given during daytime on Friday, it is permitted, in accordance with Beit Hillel<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnah Shabbat 1:8</i>? Or do we consider this to be close to a transgression?
They responded: even though this is permitted, we only share this ruling with the pious, lest it is seen is public and the masses come to transgress.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The language of the question comes from a responsum of Rav Saadia Gaon, who forbids this practice of asking a non-Jew to buy on Shabbat. The responsum is quoted by the Rosh on Bava Metzia 7:6:1, and although Saadia's reasoning is rejected, it seems that he agrees with the ruling - although maybe the ambiguity reflects something of the answer given here.</i> 

Siman 21

Regarding the scalding of poultry in boiling water, without first salting anything but the slit throat. There are those who allow pouring boiling water on them, while others hold that the boiling water has to be in a vessel in which the bird is scalded<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the distinction between pouring boiling water and soaking, see the opinions of Rashbam and Rabbeinu Tam cited in Tosafot on Zevachim 95b:4 . They do not mention, however, only salting the throat.</i>. I asked [in my dream] if there is permission to act in this [first] way, or whether it absolutely forbidden because of the blood that is absorbed in the flesh and is not released in subsequent salting.
They responded: <i>"My son, do not walk on a path with them" (Proverbs 1:15)</i>, for every transgression is loathsome, and this transgression is criminal.

Siman 22

Regarding the Talmudic tale of Bar Haddaya (Berachot 56a:2), who when given a fee would interpret dreams positively, and when not paid, would interpret them as negative omens. It is also said there (ibid.) that Rava found a book that fell from his hands, and in it was written 'All dreams follow the mouth'. We are astounded by this and ask [in a dream] whether it is possible that heavenly decrees are affected by human interpretation. Is this meant to be understood literally, that dreams depend on their interpretation, for better or for worse? Or is it not to be understood this simple way, since heavenly decrees do not change? For Bar Haddaya himself was nothing but a dream interpreter, and why was it then written in his book that 'all dreams follow the mouth'?
They responded: <i>"It is a decree" (Daniel 4:21) - examine and you shall find!</i> I asked again, and they responded in the same way. I was upset at this, and repeated my question as before.
They responded: Do you not know, and have you not heard, that there are some people whose birth-sign accords them poor eyes or tongues? Others are given weak legs. Many sicknesses originate from bad eyes, and many die from it, as it says (cf. Talmud Yerushalmi Shabbat 14:3) "Ninety nine die from the evil eye, and one in the way of the earth." So too, sometimes Satan is given permission to wreak destruction, as in the case of Miriam the Hairbraider<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Who was the mother of a sorcerer, according to the Talmud in Shabbat 104b:5. She is misidentified as the mother of Jesus in uncensored versions of Tosafot on Chagigah 4b:11.</i> Others have well-functioning legs, as it says (Genesis 30:30) <i>"God has blessed you at my feet."</i> Do not wonder, for there are those whose birth-sign allows them to interpret dreams and their interpretation is true, for better or for worse, as long as they fit the issue at hand. Bar Haddaya was such a person, and the interpretations that came true were not because of him but because of his sign. It was for this reason that Rava was angry and cursed him (Berachot 56a:16). As to what he found written in the book, that 'all dreams follow the mouth', only applies to those born under such a sign. All this they responded to me after the third time I asked. After some time they said: Do not ponder too much on our words, for we have informed you the truth and mystery is deep.

Siman 23

Regarding a prayer leader who leads the congregation when they rise early to plead on the Ten Days of Repentance. Is it permitted to recite the thirteen divine attributes in the presence of less than ten people, or is this not permitted? And is an individual allowed to recite this in his private supplications throughout the year, or is this also not permitted?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This debate is quoted in Tur Orach Chaim 565, where Rabbi Natan [of Rome?] is cited as forbidding the recital by an individual. In Terumat Hadeshen, Part I:8 the same question is asked, and an early responsum is quoted that allows for its recital by individuals.</i>
They responded: It is known in every crowd, that all sacred acts are among ten, precisely. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Megillah 23b:6</i> 

Siman 24

Regarding a community that vow to accept upon themselves taxes and charity, but did not include a conditional clause about being released from the vow. For some hold that they can not be released after they declared, in the original vow, that it was 'with the consent of God, blessed be He.'<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Nachmanides, cited in Beit Yosef, Yoreh Deah 228:38.</i> One could also reason that they only mentioned the consent of God to strengthen the force of the vow and enforce it for as long as they have that intention, but when they agree to be released from it they can be<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion cited in Tosafot on Shevuot 29b:1</i>. 
They responded: <i>"As it absorbs, so it releases. Just as it absorbs with sparks, so too does it release with sparks" (Avoda Zara 76b:1)</i>. They explained to me that the words of the community and their accord are like sparks of fire, whether to bind or to release.

Siman 25

There are some places where Kiddush is not recited in the synagogue when there are no guests present. I asked [in a dream] whether they are correct, and whether it is better to prevent people reciting Kiddush in such a case, or whether it is better to recite Kiddush and Havdala in the synagogues, as is the prevalent custom<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion forbidding the public recitation without guests (attributed to Ri in Tur Orach Chaim 269) and the opinion encouraging it brought in the name of Rav Natrunai Gaon are both cited in Tosafot on Pesachim 100b:5</i>. 
They responded: Even though Kiddush is only recited in the place where a meal is eaten (Pesachim 101a:3), it is nonetheless a commandment to recite Kiddush and Havdala in the synagogue. For <i>"in the multitude is the glory of the King" (Proverbs 14:28).</i> Moreover, Channukah candles are also lit in the synagogue, even though each person lights in their own home. So too, there are some people who don't know how to recite Kiddush and Havdalah, and when they hear it in the synagogue, they are encouraged and learn it, and later recite it at home.

Siman 26

Regarding those who do not put on tefillin all day long<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., those who do not wear tefillin daily. Context seems to prefer the emendation offered here, but both readings are possible.</i>. Is this a great sin with a severe punishment? Is it similar to the Talmudic case (Ketubot 86a:10), where if one is told to build a Sukkah and doesn't, or one is told to take a Lulav and doesn't, they are beaten without limit, until their soul departs or they perform the commandments? Or do they perhaps have a claim, since for tefillin one needs to have a clean body, and not to flatulate or fall asleep while wearing them, and for this reason they do not put them on all day?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the opinion cited in Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 17a:10, attributed to Rabbeinu Tam by Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 37.</i>
They responded: we do not make comparisons between commandments. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Bava Batra 130b:11, אין אומרין בטרפות זו דומה לזו.</i> For there are simple commandments, such as Sukkah and Lulav, and the punishment for negating them is severe, because it is tantamount to a rejection. Negating part of a commandment is not the same as negating all of it, for 'the Torah was not given to heavenly angels'.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah is not stricter than normal people can bear. Cf. Yoma 30a:2 etc.</i> All this they responded to me in truth. It seems that the punishment is not as severe as for one who negates the commandment of sitting in a Sukkah. Nonetheless, we are still at fault. For we do not put on tefillin for fear lest we flatulate or fall asleep while wearing them. Yet it is better to negate part of a commandment than all of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">A similar ambiguity is noted by Tosafot on Shabbat 49a:6 - without denying that Tefillin should ideally be worn all day long, they note that 'we are lax with tefillin, just as they were lax in Talmudic times too'.</i> 

Siman 27

Regarding blankets made from linen, and between each of the strips, combed wool is placed. It is not woven in, but everything is sewn together. I asked whether it is forbidden to cover oneself with or to lie on such blankets, on account of them being somewhat <i>kilayim</i>, a forbidden mixture of threads<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam cited in Tosafot on Yevamot 5b:5</i>; or whether perhaps they are permitted, since the wool isn't woven in<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi on Yevamot 5b:5:1, at least that this would not constitute a biblical prohibition</i>.
They responded: <i>"Kohelet sought to find desirable words... he balanced and examined and invented many parables." (Kohelet 12:9-10)</i> They explained to me that Solomon created fences around what is forbidden, including any similarities. Two hours later, they responded: <i>"Remove these garments of filth! An angel of the Lord spoke: see, I have removed your guilt from you and dressed you with grand robes." (Zechariah 3:4)</i>

Siman 28

Regarding cutting sidelocks. Did the Torah forbid this even with the use of scissors? The Torah only says "Do not round off" (Leviticus 19:27), not 'do not destroy.' Is there any sense in the argument to permit this, based on the source in the Tosefta,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Sifra Kedoshim 6:4, Makkot 21a:6</i> whereby the laws pertaining to haircutting are juxtaposed to the laws pertaining to beard-shaving, and in both cases, one is not liable unless a razor-blade is used<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This argument is rejected by Tosafot on Shevuot 2b:12</i>. 
They responded: <i>"For the thirsty, pour water!" (Isaiah 21:14)</i> For those thirsty and desirous for words of Torah, pour some water. They further responded: the Torah only forbade the shaving of the head in order not to appear as idolaters, and anyone who is lenient in matters concerning idolatry, Heaven is lenient with his lifespan. Likewise, all who are strict with this, his days and years will be numerous.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The reason for this commandment as idolatry is brought by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12:1, and rejected by the Tur Yoreh Deah 181. Maimonides also allows the cutting of the sidelocks with scissors (ibid., 6).</i>

Siman 29

Regarding those men who wear rings on their hands, and walk out wearing them in the public domain on Shabbat. They rely on the Mishnah (Shabbat 6:10) "One may go out with a locust’s egg, a fox’s tooth, and a nail from the cross of a convict for purposes of healing." They say that gold, too, is carried for the purpose of healing. I asked [in my dream] if their reasoning makes any sense. If it doesn't, they are liable for a transgression, as in the ruling of the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Shabbat 6:1. Rashi and Tosafot disagree on the Talmud's reinterpretation of the mishnaic text (Shabbat 62a:9). The reading proposed here fits Rashi on Shabbat 62a:9, as well as Rif Shabbat 28b</i>, whereby wearing a ring with no signet is considered carrying for a man, and he is liable to bring a sin-offering.
They responded: <i>"No hand shall touch it, for  he shall be stoned." (Exodus 19:13)</i>, and they continued, <i>"The voice is the voice of Jacob and the hands are the hands of Esau," (Genesis 27:22)</i> and it is therefore clear that it is forbidden to go out wearing them.

Siman 30

Regarding the practice in Narbonne to buy from non-Jews bundles of grapes made in <i>cordoans</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of French uncertain. Perhaps referring to a type of leather made in Cordoba, cf. Rashi on Chagigah 4a ד"ה המקמץ</i>, even though the non-Jew squeezed the grapes in them. Is this permitted? Or is it forbidden, in the same way that we have the custom not to buy them unless Jews have pressed the grapes, and we also do not leave the bundles of grapes after they have been pressed? I asked [in my dream] which of these customs is good and proper, and whether there is any element of transgression in the practice of the community in Narbonne. 
They responded: it is a well-known halacha that something is only considered 'wine' once the liquid begins to flow to the mouth of the winepress (Avoda Zara 55b:3). But the squeezing of grapes inside a vessel is no different to packing a sack of wheat in order that it hold as much wheat as possible. So too, the squeezing of the grapes here is only to pack them in tightly, and there is no hint of transgression. Somebody who purposefully refrains from doing something permitted is considered vulgar. But as for you, "Do not disdain your mother of old," (Proverbs 23:22), and those who are stringent in this regard will be blessed, while those who are lenient, [Heaven is] lenient with the length of their days and years. All this they responded to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Avodah Zarah 75a:6) seems to say that vessels that carried grapes need to be rinsed, and while this line is omitted by the Rif, Rabbeinu Tam (cited in Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 138) requires it too. Perhaps this is the source for the discrepancy of customs being discussed here. As usual, the heavenly response gives great importance to local custom.</i> 

Siman 31

Regarding the ruling of R. Abraham b. David of blessed memory, who held that in the case of a non-kosher spoon or vessel, when it comes into contact with [hot] kosher food, we only calculate the actual amount of non-kosher taste released from the spoon or vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, in calculating the ratio of forbidden taste to determine whether it is nullified by sixty times its volume of permitted food, rendering the mixture permitted. Quoted in Bedek Habayit in Beit Yosef, Yoreh Deah 94.</i>  So too in the calculation of the permitted food, he held that only the volume of the food in the vessel is calculated. We, however, are accustomed to view the entire spoon as if it is a forbidden object<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">and calculate proportionally to the volume of the entire spoon</i>, and if it stirred the food in the pot, we calculate the [volume of] all the food in the pot and the pot itself, as if it were permitted food<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Torat Habayit HaAroch, Fourth House, First Gate 1, we find "The French rabbis have rejected the opinion of R. Abraham b. David." As for including the volume of the pot in the calculation, this is a debate between Rashi on Chullin 97b:7:3 and the rabbis cited in Tosafot on Chullin 97b:7</i>. I asked [in my dream] whether it would be correct to instruct according to the ruling of the aforementioned sage, or whether to instruct according to our practice.
They responded: <i>"Say to Wisdom, my sister are you!" (Proverbs 7:4) - "if something is as clear to you as the prohibition of your sister, only then speak it." (Sanhedrin 7b:2)</i> And who can truly examine and calculate how much flavour was exuded from a spoon? Some time later they responded: <i>"One was Abraham," (Ezekiel 33:24) "Incline after the majority." (Exodus 23:2) </i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the opinion of R. Abraham b. David is rejected.</i>

Siman 32

Regarding the permissibility of writing one's correspondence during the intermediate days of a festival in an unusual manner<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion is quoted and mostly rejected in Tosafot on Moed Katan 19a.2</i>. I also asked [in my dream] about those scholars who interpret a verse or innovate a detail of halacha, and write it down in the usual way during the intermediate days of festivals. They say that there is no better example of something that could be lost<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">and is therefore permissible work on these days in its usual manner, see Moed Katan 12b:2. Such an argument regarding words of Torah is brought in the name of the Tosafot by the Rashba, see Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 545</i>, since if they don't write it now, it will be forgotten. I asked whether it is permitted to write such commentaries or not.
They responded: <i>"God loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob." (Psalms 87:2) - God loves those gates distinguished by halacha (Berachot 8a:17).</i> I did not understand this answer, and the next night I repeated the question, and asked them to give a clearer response. They then responded as they had done previously, and explained: 'God loves those gates distinguished by halacha' - when one makes a halachic innovation and has it rest on solid foundations. Such gates are beloved by the Great King more than all the dwellings of Jacob<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Understood by the Talmud to refer to synagogues.</i> , in which the other commandments are fulfilled. Anybody who thinks and reasons in complex areas of abstract and applied halacha is beloved and desired by the Supreme King. This is the meaning of the Talmudic statement <i>"The reward of learning is for reasoning" (Berachot 6b:13)</i>. These words and thoughts are like precious stones in His eyes, and if for the sake of the loss of a coin or something of its value the Torah allowed work during the festival, how much more so may those who stand to lose these precious stones write them down permanently that they may be preserved. Those who write and seal such words will be rewarded - all this they responded to me in truth. And it seems to me that one's business correspondence, where one doesn't stand to lose anything, should not be written even in an abnormal way. But a letter in which one asks about the wellbeing of their friend, and informs them of news - this makes the person happy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the understanding of Rif Moed Katan 10b:4, contra the opinion of Rashi on Moed Katan 18b:5:3</i>. For the sake of such happiness, the Sages permitted to write personal correspondence, because they demand wellbeing. 

Siman 33

Regarding the obligation to recite the blessing on washing the hands every time one exits the toilet and wishes to study Torah or recite the afternoon or evening prayers. For just as in the morning one recites the blessing, so too every time that hand-washing is required, one should recite the blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">There are at least two questions here: whether each of the three daily prayers should be preceded by hand-washing, and whether study of Torah requires ritual hand-washing too. On the first issue, see Rosh on Berachot 9:23 who holds that the blessing on hand-washing should be recited before prayer, but not after going to the toilet otherwise. Rashba reports this issue as a dispute between the Raavad, who required the blessing each time after going to the toilet, and the Ramban, who only required it in the morning (see Teshuvot Hameyuchasot LaRamban 173). See also Tosafot Yeshanim on Yoma 30a:1, where Rabbeinu Tam and his father Rabbeinu Meir hold that handwashing is sometimes required after the toilet, but not a blessing, while others did require it. On the issue of Torah study, see Sefer Mitzvot Katan 181:2, where 'our rabbis' are said to have washed their hands before studying Torah. </i>

Siman 34

I also asked [in my dream] regarding the blessing that begins <i>Asher yatzar</i> ('who created'). Does one recite it every time one relieves oneself in the lavatory, or is the morning recitation sufficient?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See footnoted sources in siman 33 above, as well as Tur Orach Chaim 7, which also discuss whether Asher Yatzar is always recited after the toilet, or only in the morning, and whether there is a distinction between what activity was done and the blessing afterwards.</i>
They responded to the first question: <i>"Lift your hands to the sacred!" (Psalms 134:2)</i> Namely, wash your hands whenever you want to speak sacred words or study Torah. <i>"And bless God!" (ibid.)</i> - with the blessing instituted for washing hands. As for the second question, they responded: Do you not know that four need to give thanks (Berachot 54b:12), and this includes one who was sick. And none are more sick than such a person [who relieves themself], as it says (Isaiah 51:14): <i>"Quickly the crouching one is freed."</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Rashi on Isaiah 51:14</i> 

Siman 35

Regarding wine made by non-Jews. Is it nullified in sixty times its volume, as one of the sages wrote?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Siman 17 above, and the views of Rabbeinu Tam and the Ri cited in Tosafot on Avodah Zarah 73a:2 .</i>
They responded: <i>"Do not carry false rumours." (Exodus 23:1)</i> They then repeated again, this time in Aramaic: Do not accept a false report.

Siman 36

Regarding those who cut their beards with scissors. Is this forbidden or not? For there are some sages who hold that the Torah only forbids shaving with a razor<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion cited in Tosafot on Shevuot 2b:12:2 . Compare Terumat Hadeshen 265 who forbids cutting the beard with scissors, because of the doubt that it can be performed correctly.</i>.
They responded: The Torah declared <i>"Do not destroy the corners of your beard," (Leviticus 19:27)</i> - referring to anything that can destroy. And to the destroyers, go tell them: Where is your King and the Rock of your strength?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Deuteronomy 32:37.</i>  A commandment that can be fulfilled so easily, and you have forgotten it?

Siman 37

I asked again [in my dream] regarding bread made by non-Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. 'star-worshippers'</i>, whether it is sufficient that a Jew adds a piece of wood to the fire of the oven [for it to be considered baked by a Jew]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Rif Avodah Zarah 15b:1</i>. Is there nonetheless a hint of the transgression of baking with vessels of non-Jews? For I was doubtful regarding the meaning of the response I had received the first time I asked, when they responded: <i>"Is this not a brand saved from the fire?" (Zechariah 3:2)</i> They explained:  in truth the bread does not become permitted through throwing wood into the fire, unless the fire dies down to embers, and then the flames are rekindled<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion is mentioned by Nachmanides (Chiddushei Ramban on Avodah Zarah 35b), who also cites Raavad as holding that the kindling added by the Jew needs to have a significant rather than symbolic function</i>. Therefore we said that one can be saved from all transgression by means of the fire<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, if the act of adding wood is done correctly, as described here, then one is saved from the transgression of eating food cooked by non-Jews</i>. <i>"See, we have inquired into this and it is so. Hear it and accept it!" (Job 5:27)</i> All this they responded.

Siman 38

Regarding a place in which there are priests fit to recite the priestly blessing, and they do not do so even once a year. I asked concerning this [in my dream], whether this is a transgression, or whether we can rely on the opinion of R. Yaakov, who said that the priests have no obligation to recite the blessing unless the people call on them to do so<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion cited in Tosafot on Sotah 38b:4</i>.
They responded: Both these and these are sinners. The people, who do not call on the priests to bless them, seem like they do not care for the blessing of their Heavenly Father. And the same can be said for the priests, who do not recite the blessing on their own accord<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is similar to the opinion of R. Manoach ben Yaakov, cited in Beit Yosef, Orach Chaim 128</i>. For the Torah says <i>"I will bless those who bless you" (Genesis 12:3)</i> - this implies that the inverse is also true.

Siman 39

Regarding those who eat between the afternoon and evening prayers. Is there a transgression involved in this, as R. Yaakov of blessed memory ruled, or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafot on Berakhot 4b:2 simply notes that once night falls, and the obligation to recite the Shema begins, it is forbidden to start a meal. Perhaps the question is referring to a practice of reciting the afternoon prayer late and the evening prayer at the earliest possible time - if so, then a meal in between might be considered forbidden.  </i>
They responded: <i>"And you shall eat your fill and bless the name of your God, who has dealt so wondrously with you." (Joel 2:26)</i> - and the proof can be found in Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av and other fast days. I believe the proof that they refer to is the Talmudic statement (Shabbat 24a:4): "On fast days, one recites the regular evening, morning and afternoon prayers, and includes a mention of the event of the day in the <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> blessing." Now, it can't be that this additional paragraph for fast days would be recited in the evening prayer if one was going to then eat afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This applies to fast-days that strictly begin at sunrise. It would be permitted to eat at night, but the blessing wouldn't be relevant unless the meal was earlier and not intended for after the evening prayer</i>. Rather, it must be that it applies to those who eat after the afternoon prayer, and only then recite the evening prayer with the additional relevant paragraph for fast days included within. Therefore, we see that it is permissible to eat between the two prayers.

Siman 40

Regarding the blessing for Hallel on Rosh Chodesh and the intermediate days of the festivals. For there are some sages who say that no blessing should be recited, even in public, and even by changing the terminology of the blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., to say 'to read the Hallel' rather than the usual 'to complete the Hallel', cf. Tosafot on Berakhot 14a:4</i>. It is comparable to the Arava [at the end of Sukkot], for which there is no blessing because it a custom just like the recitation of Hallel on Rosh Chodesh<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the argument brought in Machzor Vitry (Rosh Chodesh 230), citing Rashi, after quoting R. Asher bar Meshulam of Lunel who disagrees and holds that the blessing should be recited.</i>. I asked whether the custom we practice is correct<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosafot on Taanit 28b:7, where Rabbeinu Tam holds that the blessing should be recited</i>, or whether it should be stopped.
They responded: I have already informed you that the blessings of Israel are like incense before Me, and the Mishna (Menachot 13:11) teaches <i>"Whether one brings much or one brings little, as long as their hearts are directed to heaven."</i>

Regarding those who are lenient, and say that one who does not wear a four-cornered garment has no obligation to wear tzitzit, for the obligation is conditional on the person wearing such a garment, and if they don't, the obligation does not exist<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the conclusion of the Rif Menachot 12a:2</i>. Do we rather say that every person is required to purchase a four-cornered garment in order to be obligated to wear tzitzit?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Such an argument is made in Sefer Mitzvot Gadol, Positive Commandments 26, where even though it is a conditional obligation on the person, it is fitting to purchase a tallit. Similar arguments are made at the beginning of Tur Orach Chaim 24.</i>
They responded: <i>'Such an argument need not enter here' (Bava Metzia 16a:18)</i>, since the Torah says <i>"In order that you shall remember" (Numbers 15:40).</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore there is a positive commandment to perform an action of remembering, namely, to wear tzitzit.</i><i> "Nonetheless, leave the Jews alone, it is better than they sin unintentionally than intentionally." (Bava Batra 60b:21)</i>

Siman 42

Regarding one who shaves with a razor around the neck, is there somewhat of a transgression in doing so, or is it completely permitted?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Talmud (Makkot 20a:10) mentions that there are five parts of the beard that are forbidden to be shaved with a razor, it is unclear what those five are. Rabbeinu Chananel is said to have included the Adam's apple (see Tur Yoreh Deah 181:11), this is also the opinion of Sefer Mitzvot Gadol, Negative Commandments 58. Rabbeinu Yonah Gerondi (cited in Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 181) writes that "all the rabbis of France" would be careful not to shave their throats, even though it is not forbidden biblically.</i>
They replied: <i>"Go, eat your bread in gladness, and drink your wine in joy; for your action was long ago approved by God." (Kohelet 9:7)</i>

Siman 43

Regarding covering food up [to keep it warm on Shabbat]. Is there a hint of a transgression in our contemporary stoves, whereby we cover up the pot and sprinkle ash on top of the coals? Also regarding those who bury the pot in the ground, and bury hot coals around the pot, is all this permitted or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosafot on Shabbat 48a:1, which starts by questioning the practice of burying food, even when the coals are covered with ash. The Ri then gives a reason for allowing contemporary buried ovens (called אשטר"א, l'âtre or l'aistre) that have space built in between the walls and the coals. This practice and reasoning is repeated by the Rosh on Shabbat 4:2.</i>
They responded: We have already indicated to you the chosen authority<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly referring to R. Isaac Alfasi (cf. Siman 2). However, the text of Rif Shabbat 22a is ambiguous on this point in question</i>, <i>"And you shall act in accordance with the instructions given to you," (Deuteronomy 17:11) "For he is an angel of God of Hosts, and rulings are sought from his mouth." (Malachi 2:7)</i>

Siman 44

I also asked [in my dream] if crushing mustard during the festivals is permitted. For there are those who say that if they are crushed in advance before the festival, they do not release their flavour [as much as if they are freshly crushed on the day.] So too with salt, there are some who say that it needs to be ground in an unusual way.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rif Beitzah 6b:4, who holds that spices can be crushed on the festival in a normal fashion, while salt needs to be done tilted or in an unusual way. In Tosafot on Beitzah 14a:6, the Ri is cited as being strict about grinding any spices, but since the Rif and Rav Yehudai Gaon before him allow it, the author blesses those who refrain and permits those who have this practice. Mustard here is compared to pepper and other spices that are better fresh, see Tur Orach Chaim 504.</i>

Siman 45

I also asked [in my dream] regarding those who send their maidservant to milk the animals without the oversight of a Jewish person. Is this permissible, since there are no non-kosher animals in the herd?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mordechai and Rabbeinu Peretz (cited in Beit Yosef, Yoreh Deah 115) both quote a common custom to be lenient in this situation, while ruling against this practice. Sefer Mitzvot Katan 223 rules similarly against this. Sefer Mitzvot Gadol quotes a Rabbeinu Yaakov (Rabbeinu Tam?) who was angry upon hearing that someone was sending his daughter to oversee the milking of their animals, and most or all of the milking was done before she came.</i>

Siman 46

I also asked [in my dream] regarding non-Jewish households where it is well-known that they do not set their cheeses in animal stomachs, nor with the rennet from the stomach lining, but rather with a known flower [that curdles the milk]. Is it permissible for a Jew who is being hosted by them to eat their cheese?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam in Tosafot on Avodah Zarah 35a:14, where the Geonim of Narbonne are said to have permitted cheeses set with flowers. Outside of Narbonne, where it is set in animal stomach, Ri ben Chaim is cited as saying that there is a slight prohibition (יש טעם קצת לאסור), because of the salt transferring the taste of meat to the milk.</i> For perhaps we should be wary of the possibility that they bought their cheese from elsewhere, or that other cheese was given to them as a gift and became mixed in their own stock. 

Siman 47

I also asked [in my dream] about those who hire shepherds to watch their animals, and on Shabbat they go and milk the cows and start curdling the milk to make cheese, all while in the employment of a Jew. It is well known that we are not allowed to have anyone in our employment doing labour on Shabbat with our possessions. If so, how do we allow them to milk and curdle, since milking is prohibited under the category of <i>mefarek</i>, separating, while curdling falls under the category of <i>boneh</i>, building. I asked these four questions together.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Hagahot Maimoniot, on Mishneh Torah Shabbat 8:10, where Meir of Rothenburg  and the Gaon Rav Cohen Tzedek rule that one can ask a non-Jew to milk. Kol Bo 31:21 also quotes Meir of Rothenburg as saying that the milk needs to be bought back symbolically, and also cites Rabbeinu Peretz who says that the milk cannot be used on Shabbat itself.</i>
They responded: Mustard and spices can be crushed in their usual manner in a stone mortar, because they release their flavour [when fresh].
Regarding the second matter, they responded: <i>"Do not walk on a path with them" (Proverbs 1:15)</i>, for even though it is not forbidden, it is not right to breach the fences of tradition.
Regarding the third matter, they responded: <i>"It is not common to trust a non-Jew." (Chullin 133b:4)</i>, and we should not rely on their testimony, and it has been said (Bava Batra 91b:6): <i>"One who relies on them falls into their hands."</i>
Regarding the fourth matter, they responded: We have learned in a Mishnah (Shabbat 16:6): <i>"A non-Jew who comes to extinguish a fire on Shabbat is neither told to extinguish not not to extinguish."</i> To avoid monetary loss, the sage instructed that they should not be prevented from extinguishing a fire. This is similar to this shepherd who milks and curdles on his own accord, we have no obligation to prevent him from doing so, on account of monetary loss and the suffering of the animals. You could argue that it is similar to that which was taught (Shabbat 16:8): <i>"If a non-Jew lights a lamp, a Jew may benefit from the light. But if it was lit for the Jew, they may not benefit from it. If the non-Jew draws water for his own animal, a Jew may have his animal drink from it. If it was drawn for the Jew, this is forbidden."</i> It would seem from this that the results of labour done by non-Jews are forbidden for Jews when done for their sake, even if it was not asked for. Similarly, the shepherd milks and curdles for the Jew, how then should it be permitted? <i>"Consider well what is before you." (Proverbs 23:1)</i> For when it was taught that the results of actions done for the sake of Jews are forbidden, they are only forbidden for that same day: the animal is forbidden to drink from the water filled for it until the night after Shabbat. So too with the shepherd who milks and curdles - certainly, the milk is forbidden on Shabbat itself, but after Shabbat it becomes permitted. However, in the case of a Jew who bought the yearly milk supply of a non-Jew's flock, then anything the non-Jew added would now be done for the Jew - it is forbidden to keep these cheeses and milk produced on Shabbat. For we know the tale (Shabbat 139b:8) of one scholar who went to sleep on a ferry, and thus crossed the river and inspected the fruits of his orchard, while claiming that he just intended to sleep. We ruled there that a Torah scholar who will not come to transgress biblical violations of Shabbat is allowed to use such tricks to get around rabbinic prohibitions. From this we learn that common people are not. 

Siman 48

I also asked [in my dream] regarding the commandment of tefillin. We have learned<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">see Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 13:9:7</i>: <i>"One who wears tefillin is like one who reads from the Torah, and one who reads from the Torah is exempt from wearing tefillin."</i> We are unsure about the meaning of this phrase. Does it mean that one is truly exempt from wearing tefillin if one reads from the Torah, or studies even a single halacha or a single verse? For most people regularly read a halacha or a biblical verse. Or does it mean that at the actual moment that one is reading from the Torah, one is then exempt from putting on tefillin, because of the principle that someone engaged in one commandment is exempt from another<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Sukkah 26a:2 . Tosafot on Sukkah 10b:5 makes the precision that only if the fulfilment of one commandment would lead to the annulment of another is this principle applied</i>? Moreover, I was unsure regarding those who claim that wearing tefillin requires a cleanliness of the body comparable to Elisha (Shabbat 49a:6), and therefore exempt themselves on this ground. Yet perhaps all that is required is not to flatulate or to sleep while wearing them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion in Teshuvot Maharam 649 and of Rabbeinu Tam cited in Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 17a:10. See also Siman 26 above.</i>. We were also unsure regarding what was taught (Rosh Hashanah 17a:10): <i>"Sinners of Israel who sin with their bodies - these are those skulls that do not don tefillin,"</i> which was interpreted by the commentators to refer to those who never wear tefillin at all. I asked about this [in my dream], whether it was as they claimed, that if one wore tefillin even once a week they would not be considered a sinner; or whether it is as is written in the literature, that the term applies to anyone who could be wearing them and isn't<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Rabbeinu Tam, ibid.</i>. I asked all these questions together.
They responded: <i>"My son, do not envy sinners in your heart," (Proverbs 23:15-17) "Happy are those who abide by His laws," (Psalms 119:2) "Lift your hands towards the sacred," (Psalms 134:2) "Blessed is God day by day," (Psalms 68:20) "Test Me by this, if I do not pour down blessings upon you ceaselessly." (Malachi 3:10).</i> Some time later, they responded: <i>"Any passage stated and then repeated is only repeated to teach something new." (Sotah 3b:2)</i> - and the sages did not come to take away, but only to add and to encourage. <i>"One who is vigilant is praiseworthy," (Yoma 84b:8) "And then you shall find delight in God," (Isaiah 58:14) "And He shall grant you the desires of your heart." (Psalms 37:4) </i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps this answer follows the line of reasoning of Eleazar of Worms (Sefer Haroke'ach 369, quoted by Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 38), whereby the meaning of the sentence 'One who wears tefillin is like one who reads from the Torah, etc.' is understood to give those who do both the reward of both commandments.</i>

Siman 50

I also asked [in my dream] regarding those who shave with a razor, leaving one [line of] hair below. Is this a transgression or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides (Mishneh Torah Avodat Kochavim 12:6) writes that he has a tradition that forty hairs can be left on the corners of the beard. The Tur Yoreh Deah 181 cites Maimonides, but writes four hairs instead of forty. Beit Yosef ad loc understands this as the minimal width of the beard, and reads Rashi on Makkot 20b:6:2 in this light, but says since there is doubt about the meaning, the beard should be left unshaved.</i>
They responded: <i>"Your hair is like a flock of goats, all are aligned and not one is missing." (Shir Hashirim 4:2-3)</i>

Siman 51

I also asked [in my dream]: when we respond, during the blessing after meals, with the phrase "Blessed is He, of whose food we have eaten" - do we need to refer to the name and kingship of God, or not?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, should the formulation use one of the names of God and the word referring to God as king. See Berachot 40b:6 . The Raavad (cited in Rashba on Berakhot 54a) suggests that the reason that kingship is not recited in the this phrase of the blessing after meals is that it will be mentioned in the subsequent paragraphs. I have not found any other early sources claiming that kingship should be recited here.</i> 
They responded: <i>"Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is God from of old, creator of the earth from end to end." (Isaiah 40:28)</i> - for if you do not crown Him, in what way shall you bless Him?

Siman 52

I also asked [in my dream] whether it was permitted [in counting the minyan] to include two additions  of older children, i.e., ten- or eleven-year olds, since they are already rabinically required to be educated, or whether it was forbidden to do such a thing, even if there was no minyan without them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosafot on Berakhot 48a:2, who permits including one child in the minyan. Rabbeinu Tam is reported as holding this opinion but not allowing it in practice. He specifically rejects the idea of more than one minor. Abraham ben Natan quotes R. Zerachia Halevi who would permit two children to be added to the minyan (cited in Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 55). This is also reported in Kol Bo 11:144, where "even two or three children" are permitted to be counted in difficult situations. It's possible that this tradition reflects a manuscript variant (or vice versa), where the word סניף, 'addition', is written in the plural in some manuscripts of Berakhot 47b:15. We find the word סניפין, 'additions', in the following manuscripts: Firenze 7, Munich 95, Oxford 366, Paris 671.</i>
They replied: <i>"The young with the old, may God increase your numbers!" (Psalms 115:13)</i>

Siman 53

We were also unsure regarding the statement in the Mishnah, "The afternoon prayer may be recited until evening" (Berachot 4:1). Does this refer to sunset, or to the time when the stars become visible? For when reading the words of Rabbi Yehuda carefully, he claimed that the prayer could be recited until <i>'plag hamincha'</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">a point in the day ten and three-quarter hours after sunrise</i>. In the Talmudic discussion (Berachot 26b:15), they ask whether this word 'until' includes the whole last portion of the day, or means up until that point of time. They then argue that if 'until' includes the last portion of the day until the twelfth halachic hour, then Rabbi Yehuda would not be in disagreement with the other rabbis [which he seems to be]. Therefore, it seems that when the rabbis say 'until evening', they also mean until the twelfth hour, which is the time that the stars are visible in the sky<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> according to the understanding of the Talmud in Berachot 2b:4</i>. Regarding all this I asked [in my dream] whether, in the case of a headache<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">meaning of Hebrew unclear</i> or in other extenuating circumstances, one could recite the afternoon prayer until the time the stars are visible?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud finishes its discussion of the correct time for the afternoon prayer inconclusively (Berakhot 27a:14), yet the question here assumes a normative practice of finishing it early, before 'plag mincha', and is asking about extenuating circumstances. R. Hai Gaon quotes the contemporary practice in the Babylonian academies to recite the afternoon prayer up to nightfall when necessary (Shibbolei Haleket 47). The 12th-century provençal work Sefer Hashlama writes that people were not consistent, and sometimes said the afternoon prayer late or the evening prayer early (cited in Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 233). The contradiction between these two practices is discussed in Tosafot on Berakhot 2a:1. </i>
They responded: <i>"It shall be neither yours nor mine; cut it in two!" (I Kings 3:26)</i>, and within the vision they explained that it shall follow neither the stringent ones nor the lenient. Rather, the time between the setting of the sun and the appearance of the stars should be divided in two, and this point is the midpoint of twilight referred to by Rabbi Yehuda<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Shabbat 34b:3</i>.

Siman 54

I also asked regarding the bones<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions have 'parched thigh-bones', meaning unclear</i> of the thigh, and the small and large intestines. Is it correct for a pious person to abstain from eating these, because we are not experts in the removal of the forbidden fats and sinews around the intestines, or are they permitted?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There is a tradition from the Gaonim not to eat the fats around the intestines because of small veins that might not be removed (see Halachot Gedolot 65:2) Later authorities permitted them (see Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 65).</i>
They responded: <i>"They do not issue a decree  on the people that the majority are unable to withstand," (Horayot 3b:6) "and one witness is credible in matters of prohibitions" (Gittin 2b:5) </i>- as long as they are knowledgeable. And all who abstain from something when it is not appropriate to abstain, their actions are considered foolish.

Siman 55

Regarding that which the sages of France decreed, that cheese can be eaten after meat in the same meal, if one washes their hands and cleans out their mouth<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam cited in Tosafot on Chullin 104b:12. Halakhot Gedolot 1:116 holds likewise.</i> - is this correct, or is the halacha like the sage who forbids such things?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reference seems to be to  R. Isaac Alfasi, see Rif Chullin 37b:4 . R. Zerachia Halevi (Hamaor Hakatan on Chullin 37a) understands the Rif differently, and also rules that washing hands and cleaning the mouth is sufficient, and writes that "this is the practice of all the sages of France."</i>
They responded [in my dream]: <i>"You are not wise to ask such a question," (Kohelet 7:10) "for the ways of the Lord are upright, the righteous will walk their paths, and the wicked shall stumble" (Hosea 14:10), "Have I not written it three times?" (Proverbs 22:20) "Incline after the many" (Exodus 23:2)</i> - and the majority today forbid such things. In the Heavenly Yeshiva, there is no dispute on this subject, and we all rule that this is forbidden.

Siman 56

We are also unsure regarding <i>'mayim acharonim'</i>, the hand-washing at the end of the meal. There are some sages who hold that since we no longer use fine oils<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> to anoint hands during the meal, see Berachot 53b:31</i>, we thus do not need to meticulous about the final hand-washing. I asked [in my dream] regarding this, whether they had anything to rely on in saying so or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Some contemporary sources use similar language but cite the lack of dangerous 'Salt of Sodom' [and not the lack of oil] as the reason not to be meticulous about washing hands (Tosafot on Berakhot 53b:32). See also Rosh on Berakhot 8:6 for a similar argument regarding lack of oils.</i> 
They responded: <i>"Who is this who has spoken that which God has not commanded?" (Eicha 3:37)</i> The final hand-washing is an act of sanctity, and as with all acts of sanctity, Heaven is lenient with the lifespan of those who are lenient in this regard. This is what they truly responded.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">See Tur Orach Chaim 181 and Raavad on Mishneh Torah Blessings 6:2 who quote Gaonim that insist on a final hand-washing with a blessing.</i>

Siman 57

We were also unsure regarding the liturgical poems (<i>krovitz</i>) added on festivals within the first three blessings of the Amida prayer, and within the blessings before and after the recitation of the Shema. Is it correct to recite them<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Permission to recite such liturgy is given in Tosafot on Berakhot 34a:10, citing Rabbeinu Hananel and Rav Hai Gaon since it is a public and not a private request. (This opinion in attributed to Rabbeinu Tam in Rosh on Berakhot 5:21 and to Ri in Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 112.) </i>, or is it better to refrain from doing so?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to be the opinion given in Halakhot Gedolot 1:49.</i>
They responded: <i>"Then Moses and the children of Israel sang... I will sing to God." (Exodus 15:1)</i> What is the significance of 'I will sing'? It means that I will sing before Him with any kinds of praise and poetry that I am able to sing.

Siman 58

I also asked [in my dream] regarding woolen garments purchased from non-Jews. Is it necessary to be concerned that they might be sewn together with linen threads<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This seems to be the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam in Tosafot on Yevamot 5b:5</i>, or do we say that sewing linen is only a rabbinical prohibition, and therefore in any case of doubt we should be lenient?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi on Yevamot 5b:5, and of his son-in-law Rivan (see Tosafot ad loc.)</i> Together with this question, I also asked [in my dream] regarding leather which is known to be sewn with linen threads, and which is then attached to woolen robes. I asked whether there is a prohibition to attach them to wool once they are sewn with linen<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is possibly the opinion of Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Kilayim 10:3. R. Hezekiya (possibly Hezekiya ben David, a contemporary of Hai Gaon) is reported to have been stringent with such leather (Terumat Hadeshen 297)</i>, or whether it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of R. Samson of Sens (Rash Mishantz on Kilayim 9:9)</i>. 
They responded: <i>"At the head of the crowds she calls, she raises her voice in the streets," (Proverbs 1:20-21), My children have cursed me. "O that I were as in months gone by," (Job 29:2) when I was beloved by My children.</i> Why should you stand by leniencies? If only they would guard my strictures!

Siman 60

I also asked [in my dream] about our uncertainty regarding the three Talmudic statements of Rabbi Zeira (Rosh Hashanah 20b:4) on the calculation of the calendar. First, that the night and the day need to belong to the new month. Second, that if the <i>molad</i>, the lunar conjunction, occurs before midday, the moon will certainly be visible close to sunset. Third, that the moon is invisible for twenty four hours [between the lunar cycles]. We have encountered the fundamental secret of the calendrical calculations, as elucidated by R. Zerachia<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">see Hamaor Hakatan on Rif Rosh Hashanah  5a</i> . It was on a Monday evening, the first day of the month of Tammuz, when I asked whether it is better to rely on the interpretations offered by Rashi<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Rosh Hashanah 20b, where he gives his own understanding of the calendrical calculations, and cites R. Saadia Gaon</i>, or whether the better interpretation is that of the great Rabbi Zerachia.
They responded: <i>"How quickly have you found your desire, my son," (Genesis 27:20) "Shining ['Zarach'] in the darkness is light for the upright ['Yesharim']." (Psalms 112:4) </i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly, the meaning here is that R. Zerachia is in the darkness, while Rashi (the letters of his name are in the word Yesharim) is in the light and should be followed. Another possibility is that the first verse, spoken by the biblical Isaac, is a reference either to Rashi (R. Shlomo Yitzhaki) or to the Rif, R. Isaac Alfasi, who omits the statements of Rabbi Zeira in his Talmudic commentary. See Keset Hasofer ad loc. It is also unclear here to what extent the question here is theoretical. Maimonides omits the calendrical calculations as a commandment, while Sefer Mitzvot Gadol 47 seems to hold that it is a positive commandment incumbent upon every Jew who is able to make such calculations.</i> 

Siman 61

I also asked [in my dream] regarding the lung of an animal which is found to be stuck to the ribs by the sectioning of the lobes<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Chullin 48a:7</i>, which is kosher, but only when the lung is attached to the flesh [of the ribs] and not to the bones<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Chullin 48a:8 and Rif Chullin 12a:2</i>. Is it however enough that it is attached to one of them, the flesh <i>or</i> the bones, to be considered kosher?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Gershom, cited in Tosafot on Chullin 48a:8</i>

Siman 62

I also asked [in the dream] regarding the validity of an animal whose lung was found attached to the rib-cage, whereby the majority of the tissues were connected to the minor lobe and the minority to the major lobe. Since the majority came from above the connection of the lobes, even though a small portion of the major lobe was attached to the rib-cage, perhaps we can ignore that small amount and claim that all the tissues came from the minor lobe. Do we need to be concerned about the small amount coming from the major lobe?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion that decisions such as this follow the majority is held by R. Isaac of Marseille in Ittur Soferim, Shechita 42a. For others who followed this method, including sages of Lunel and Provence, see Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 39</i>

Siman 63

I also asked [in the dream] whether the lung needs to be taken out and inspected to remove any doubt about its appearance, such as the shade of black<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud states that if the lung is 'black as ink', it is not kosher, but if it is a dark blue it is (Chullin 47b:3), see Rif Chullin 11b:3</i> . For some are stringent and say that it cannot be declared kosher until there is absolute certainty regarding any doubtful issues<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 39 who brings a number of early authorities, includng the Halachot Gedolot and R. Eliezer ben Natan, who hold that the rules of majorities don't apply in inspection of animals</i>. Others hold that after [the lungs] are inspected manually, no doubt or assumption can be cast on the validity of the animal<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion of Rashi on Chullin 12a:1 is that since the majority of animals are kosher, most of the 18 disqualifications don't need to be examined, and even regarding the piercing of the lungs, if it is not possible to examine them then they are assumed to be valid. Samuel ben Isaac  rules like Rashi (Sefer Haterumot 19). See Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Shechitah 11:11, where he quotes the prevalent custom in Spain and North Africa is not to inflate the lungs unless there is a reason to do so</i>. I asked whether one should be concerned about the stringent opinion or not. 
They responded: the halacha is well known - <i>"A slaughtered animal is presumed to be kosher" (Chullin 9a:8), and "We do not presume things to be prohibited" (Rif Chullin 18a:4).</i> Yet all who are stringent regarding the lungs will merit to sit in the Heavenly Yeshiva. 

Siman 64

I also asked [in my dream] regarding an individual Jew living in a non-Jewish city surrounded by a wall, where the gates of the city are locked at night. Is this person allowed to carry on Shabbat within the city? For we have a tradition that the habitation of a non-Jew is not considered a habitation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">for the definition of public space on Shabbat, cf. Eruvin 62a:4</i>, and even though the rabbis decreed it nonetheless forbidden to carry on Shabbat among non-Jews, the decree was not made for individuals (Eruvin 63b:12). So too, regarding a Jew who lodges on Friday night in such a non-Jewish city, whether he is permitted to carry since it is surrounded by a wall and the gates are locked at night<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Mordechai (Siman 507) in the name of Rashi, quoted in Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 382. See however Terumat Hadeshen 76, who says that this statement of the Mordechai was not present in the manuscripts in Austria</i>. Is it nonetheless preferable to be stringent on this issue?
They responded: we have learned this law from Nehemiah, who warned the entire people in exile: <i>do not to take anything out of your home on the day of Shabbat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The language in Nehemiah 13:19 is slightly different, this quotation is from Jeremiah 17:22</i>. Even at that time there were many places where Jews lived in entirely non-Jewish cities.

Regarding the permissibility of soaked beans that don't contain worms. Some forbid these because there is a part that seems to move when they are wet. I asked [in my dream] whether in this case we should be concerned for the opinion of those who forbid<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Yerucham 15:27, </i>, or should we say that they are permitted, since when they are dried nothing is to be found.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The question discussed in Chullin 67a:15 is whether insects that grow inside detached fruit are forbidden under the category of 'those that swarm upon the earth" (Leviticus 11:41). See Tosafot on Chullin 67b:5, where Rabbeinu Tam and Rabbeinu Netanel reject this distinction, and cite Halakhot Gedolot 62 and Sheiltot of Rav Achai as supporting it. Nonetheless, the source in Tosafot add that 'beans known as <i>pois</i> are permitted by all'. This is also the opinion of a responsum of Rashi cited in Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 84.</i> 
They responded: <i>"Are you any better than those who came before you?" (cf. Judges 11:25) "And your people, all of them righteous, shall possess the land for all time; they are the shoot that I planted, My handiwork in which I glory." (Isaiah 60:21)</i>

I also asked [in my dream] regarding beans and other legumes that contain insects known as <i>kanetons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">possibly referring to the French <i>hanneton</i>, the insect or larvae of  Melolontha beetles. Cf. Rashi on Avodah Zarah 28b:5 . Mishnah Machshirin 6:1 refers to an insect called כנימה, which Rashi on Chullin 13a:4 explains as 'the <i>coçons</i> (cocoons) that grow in beans and lentils'</i>. They may be forbidden, since we might assume that the insects developed while the food was attached to the plant, and the insects are therefore classified as the forbidden "things that swarm upon the earth."(Leviticus 11:29). We might also assume that the insects developed after they were picked, and therefore do not fall into this category and are permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See previous question for the discussion of whether the insects were created while the fruit was attached to the ground renders them as 'swarming on the earth' and thus forbidden. Rashba (Torat Habayit Hakatzar III:3) describes two kinds of insects that may be present in beans, one that develops while the bean is attached and the second once detached, and thus recommends soaking the beans before cooking.</i>
They responded:<i>"Why do you ask this, it is unknowable!" (Judges 13:18) "Leave Israel alone, it is better that they sin without intention than with." (Beitzah 30a:9) "But put a knife into your jaw if you are given to appetite." (Proverbs 23:2)</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps a play on the double meaning of 'baal nefesh', a man with appetite or master of a soul. In the second, positive, sense, it would imply that a pious person should refrain from such food - it is used in this sense in the Talmud Chullin 6a:2 .</i>

I also asked [in my dream] regarding a slaughtered animal in which the major lobe of a lung was found stuck to the minor lobe. Is the halacha according to those who permit<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Ri ben Yakar cited by Rashi on Chullin 46b:12:3, and of R. Judah al-Barceloni, cited in Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 39</i> or those who forbid<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam cited in Tosafot on Chullin 46b:12, where Halakhot Gedolot and R. Moses of Pontoise are also named as forbidding. The Tosafot (ibid.) also mentions that in the locale of Rashi, such animals are permitted, and elsewhere they are forbidden.</i>? Also concerning the extra lobe known as 'the little rose lobe' (Chullin 47a:5), if it is missing or if there are two of them, is this animal permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbeinu Efraim permits a second such lobe in Tosafot on Chullin 47a:5, where it is also noted that the dominant practice follows Rashi and forbids this, and also that an animal with no such lobe is permitted. The Rosh on Chullin 3:16 quotes the Geonim who would permit an animal with no such lobe, or with two or three</i> or forbidden?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi on Chullin 47b:1, who notes that this is a great controversy among earlier authorities. Cf. Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 35.</i>
They responded: There is a great principle in the kashrut of animals: "One who adds, will have added life, and one who does not add, let him be gathered away." (Taanit 31a.4) It seems from this that one who is stringent is blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The opposite principle is mentioned in Chullin 54a.10, see Mishneh Torah, Shechitah 10.12</i>

On the eve of the twenty-ninth of Elul of the year 4963<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">September 1203 in the Christian calendar</i>, an animal was brought before us with its lung attached to the rib-cage, and we forbade the animal. Afterwards, the learned Rabbi Mordechai came and showed that one of the ribs was broken. Then the butcher came to remove the lung, and when it was detached in pieces, a small piece was left stuck to the broken rib. We were unable to inspect the lung further, and we were unsure about this matter. For some say that there are manuscripts<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">of Chullin 48a:3, see Rashi on Chullin 48a:5 for his version without the following line. See also the discussion in Hamaor Hakatan and Milchemet Hashem on Rif on Chullin 12a on this issue and the different versions in Spain and France</i> that claim that only if the lung was inspected can we attribute any defects to a damaged rib and even if there is no damaged rib, we can also presume the validity of the animal, unless the lung is perforated. We learn from this that when there <i>is</i> definite proof of a broken rib, there is no doubt about the lung and every imperfection is attributed to the rib, even if the lung was not inspected. Inspection of the lung, according to this, is only necessary when there is no damage to the ribs. This is especially so in our case of the lung, since it originally inflated completely when one blew into it except for the one place where it was cut too much. There are those who disagree, however, and say that even when there is proven damage to the rib the lung still needs thorough inspection, and if the lung cannot be inspected the animal is declared invalid<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Hasagot HaRaavad on Mishneh Torah, Shechitah 7:5</i>. I asked [in my dream] which opinion is correct, and whether the lung that came before us is permitted or forbidden.
They responded: Even though it is essentially permitted, it is unwise to permit it publicly. <i>"I honor those who honor Me, but those who spurn Me shall be dishonored." (I Samuel 2:30)</i> [Before saying this, they had responded so: <i>"There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice." (Shir Hashirim 2:9) "Why should My beloved be in My house?" (Jeremiah 11:15)</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The continuation of this verse speaks about distancing oneself from certain meat - perhaps this is the intended reference here.</i> On the basis of this response, we forbade the meat of the animal, and only some time later, we received the response "Even though it is permitted," etc.]

I also asked [in my dream] regarding those who destroy their beards while leaving one hair on each of the corners<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e, the five parts of the beard that are not allowed to be shaved with a razor, see Makkot 20a.10 . See Siman 50, and notes there. Perhaps the style of cutting in this question is the same as the one referred to there, with a single line of hair remaining on the edge of the beard. Maimonides requires forty hairs to remain on each of the corners (Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship 12:6), but see Beit Yosef Yoreh Deah 181 for discussion of manuscripts that have 'four' instead of 'forty', and compare Rashi on Makkot 20a:10 where the minimal amount is much greater.</i>. Afterwards, they cut those remaining hairs with scissors, and it seems as if they had shaved their whole face with a razor<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">On the issue of using the blade of scissors in place of a razor, see Mishneh Torah, <i>ibid.</i>, who permits scissors unconditionally, and Tosafot on Shevuot 2b:12</i>. I asked whether this was a grave transgression, in which case I should protest as much as possible, or whether it is not so grave, and not worth fighting over<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Hagahot Rabbeinu Peretz on Sefer Mitzvot Katan 70, who calls those who leave one hair on their beards 'destructive infants' (בנים משחיתים)</i>.
They responded: My child! You were right to ask this. It is written in the Torah and repeated by the prophets. Even though this transgression is grave, they have repeated it over and over until they think it is permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yoma 86b.13</i>. Leave Israel alone, it is better that they sin without intention than with<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Beitzah 30a.9</i>.

Siman 70

I also asked [in my dream] regarding chametz on Pesach. Does the halacha follow those who say that even a minute amount of it in a mixture can never be annulled?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is an argument here of how to read the Talmud. Rashi on Pesachim 30a:1 reads that it is forbidden even in a minute quantity, Rif Pesachim 7b has a slightly different version of the text (See Baal Hamaor ad loc for his discussion of the textual differences and their ramifications), and Rabbeinu Tam, cited in Tosafot on Pesachim 30a:1 , would himself practice stringently even though he held chametz was essentially annulled in sixty times its volume. Rav Ahai Gaon (Sheiltot, Tzav 80) also permitted mixtures where the chametz was less than one sixtieth of the total. Raavad, in his work known as 'Issur Mashehu', held that eating chametz was forbidden in any amount, while benefit from a mixture was permitted when less than one in sixty.</i> 
They responded: the commandments around chametz were the first given to the children of Israel; they were accepted with love and warmth and joy, and they were guarded strictly down to the most minute details. You can see that the Torah was stringent to the level of prohibiting even seeing and owning it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:19 and Exodus 13:7 .</i>. This is not the case for any other prohibition except for idolatry, where it is written <i>"Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house" (Deuteronomy 7:26)</i>. All who increase their meticulous observance shall have the days and years of their life increased too.
He also asked [in his dream] regarding the end of days, but upon awakening he did not find an answer written for him.
I have copied all these responsa from a manuscript on parchment.
