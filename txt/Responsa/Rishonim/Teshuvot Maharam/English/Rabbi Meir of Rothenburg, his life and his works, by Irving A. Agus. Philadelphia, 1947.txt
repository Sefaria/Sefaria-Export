Siman 1

<i>Q</i>. A claims he deposited a pledge with B to secure a loan, and now wishes to redeem it. B claims that the pledge had to be redeemed before a certain date or become forfeited. When the time of payment arrived, A asked for an extension of time and said: "Take formal possession so that the pledge henceforth be yours if I do not repay you before that date". A made no payment on the date due after the extension; B, therefore, claims that the pledge became forfeited. A denies having said, "Take formal possession.……henceforth".<br><i>A</i>. Usually a statement, such as A is alleged to have made, is classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is not binding. But since B is in possession of the pledged articles, and since B has done a favor to A in lending him money, this satement is no longer classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is binding. Therefore, if B takes an oath that A made the statement: "Take formal possession..…henceforth", the pledge belongs to B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 1; Pr. 91; L. 333; Rashba I, 1103; <i>Tashbetz</i>, 490; cf. Mord. B. M. 321.

Siman 2

<i>Q</i>. B was interrupted in carrying on his duties as tutor to A's son as a result of the son's illness. Is A permitted to deduct from B's wages for the period of the son's illness?<br><i>A</i>. The law provides that when a tutor is prevented from carrying on his duties by his own illness, he is entitled to his pay; but if he is so prevented by the pupil's illness, he is not entitled to his pay, unless the pupil is a sickly child. Since a child is usually healthy, the burden lies with the tutor of stipulating at the time of the agreement that he is to receive his pay in the event the child is sick.<br>This Responsum was addressed to Rabbi Yekutiel.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 2.

Siman 3

<i>Q</i>. B engaged A as tutor to his son. B said to A that since he, B, was unlearned and did not know whether or not A had sufficient knowledge to tutor his son, A must go to his (B's) relative C to be examined before entering upon his duties. A came to B's house and began to tutor B's son. Subsequently B discovered that A had never been examined by C. He, therefore, summoned A to court. A now declares himself ready to be examined, but B argues that A's present knowledge is no proof of his previous fitness for his position. Moreover, one witness testifies that at the time A undertook to teach B's son, he was not qualified to do so because of insufficient knowledge.<br><i>A</i>. If A has now sufficient knowledge to teach B's son, the burden of proof lies on B that A did not have such knowledge at the time he was engaged. However, since B has one witness to support his claim, A must take an oath to the effect that he had sufficient knowledge at the time of the agreement. If A takes such oath, he will be entitled to collect his full wages from B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 3; Pr. 488; Mord. B. B. 621. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B. M. 172.

Siman 4

<i>Q</i>. B constructed a stone duct near A's wooden house. A objected and B made a written promise to compensate him for any damage the duct might cause to his house. A now demands that B remove his duct because it occasionally permits water and sewage to flow into his house, and he objects to being forced to sue for damages every time it occurs. B claims that water flows into A's house only when the duct breaks. He promises to keep the duct in good condition, but refuses to remove it.<br><i>A</i>. B must remove his duct from A's wall for a distance of 3 <i>tefahim</i> (hand-breadths). If the water should, nevertheless, continue to flow into A's house, it is for A to protect his wall by whatever means he sees fit, but he can demand nothing of B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 3, 4; Pr. 92; L. 357; Mord. B. B. 520.

Siman 5

<i>Q</i>. Is it proper to permit a Gentile servant to warm the winter house on the Sabbath, when he does it of his own accord?<br><i>A</i>. Although in France such practice was not objected to, and Rabbi Jacob of Orleans even permitted one to tell a Gentile explicitly to fix the fire, it is not to be permitted in our country where many are accustomed to consider it a desecration of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">R. Meir adds that in his own home he constructed an enclosure for his stove, which he would keep locked on the Sabbath to prevent his servant from making a fire in the stove.</i><br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 5; Pr. 92; Rashba I, 857; Hag. Maim., <i>Shabbat</i> 6, 6; <i>Kol Bo</i> 31 (p. 30c); Maharil, <i>Responsa</i> 166.

Siman 6

<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle "the law of the land prevails" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: "The law of the land prevails".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered "law of the land" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

Siman 7

<i>Q</i>. B, C and D with the help of D's father, A, lent money to a Gentile on a pledge that was worth less than the amount of the loan. The Gentile, therefore, put up Gentile sureties for the entire loan. A, originally, agreed to negotiate with the Gentile on condition that he (A) be free from any responsibility should B, C and D sustain a loss through his intervention even though it be as a result of his wilful neglect. Subsequently, A wrote to B and C to return the pledge, and the latter did so. Meanwhile, one of the sureties showed A and D a letter signed by B and C instructing them to release the sureties. Thereupon, they released the sureties. B and C claim that the letter was forged and demand their money from D.<br><i>A</i>. D had no right to release the sureties until he was absolutely certain of B's and C's instructions. He was not to rely on a letter nor on any signature. Although the sureties were still legally responsible for the payment of the debt until released by B and C, D's release afforded the Gentiles an excuse to evade payment. Since A cannot be held responsible, D must make good B's and C's losses, the amount of which is to be evaluated by the court (not the face value of the loan since it was a bad debt and not worth its face value). If, however, B and C returned the pledge to the Gentile after the release of the sureties by D, though they had no knowledge of such release, the loss of the pledge is to be borne by them <i>pro rata</i>. Any additional loss, over and above the pledge, is to be borne by D alone.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 7; Pr. 93; L. 314; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nezikin</i>, 12.

Siman 8

<i>Q</i>. A claims he has no cash and wants to repay his debt to B with goods. B demands that A swear that he has no cash. Is it not true that the court can not require an oath from A since no actual loss of money to B is involved?<br><i>A</i>. The fact that there is no actual loss of money to B does not, of itself, absolve A from taking an oath. A is not required to take the oath for another reason. B can not claim to be certain that A has cash, and no one is required to take an oath when his opponent is not certain of his claim.<br>This Responsum is addressed to Rabbi Asher b. Moses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 7, 8; Pr. 109; L. 360. Cf. Am II, 224.

Siman 9

<i>Q</i>. A had no settling-rights in T. Nevertheless, relying on the overlord's protection he moved to T and stayed there for over three years. He now claims to have acquired settling-rights in T, since B failed to voice his protests during this period.<br><i>A</i>. Undisturbed possession is no proof of rightful ownership unless it be accompanied by a claim of rightful acquisition. Since A does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, settling-rights from B, his undisturbed possession thereof is of no consequence. Moreover, if witnesses testify that A had originally settled in T by resort to violence, even a claim, by A, of rightful acquisition would be of no avail, for a person known to be a robber cannot claim undisturbed possession as proof of rightful acquisition.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R. Joshua.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 9.

Siman 10

<i>Q</i>. A refused to contribute to the community charity fund or to pay his taxes together with the community. He insisted on paying his taxes directly to the authorities and on distributing his charity funds as he saw fit.<br><i>A</i>. If there is an established custom in the community, of which A is a member, that every member pays his taxes directly to the authorities and distributes his charity as he sees fit, the community can not force A to abandon this practice unless A agrees to the change. But if the custom was that all the members were to pay their taxes and distribute their charities collectively, A must abide by this custom. Where the community is new and no custom exists, talmudic law prevails which provides that the majority may force the minority to pay their taxes collectively and to establish a community charity fund to which every member must contribute.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 10; Pr. 918; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Kinyan</i>. 29; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 297, d. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B. B. 15; Menahem of Merseburg, <i>Nimmukim</i> (23); Israel Bruno, <i>Responsa</i> 163; Isserlein, <i>Pesakim</i> 144.

Siman 11

<i>Q</i>. A's window is narrow on the inside and wide on the outside. B, his neighbor, wants to build a wall alongside A's wall and extend it, as far as he is permitted, up to A's window. But, what is considered the window proper? Is it the narrow, inside, opening or the wide, outside, opening? We are inclined to the opinion that the wide, outside, opening is the window proper; some of our Rabbis (colleagues) disagree with us but their reasons for disagreeing are not convincing. Therefore, we want your opinion.<br>Signed: Eliezer b. Shlumiel, Mordecai b. Joseph, Simon Solomon b. Baruch.<br><i>A</i>. The narrow part of the window is the window proper, for two reasons. First, anything a person can build in his house without his neighbor being able to object to it, can not be used as a restriction on such neighbor when he wants to build on his own property. Secondly, a person may increase his lights by beveling the outside border of his window as long as he does not touch the inside border of the window (or vice versa) without his neighbor being able to object to it. Surely one may make his wall very thin without his neighbor being able to object to it; the thinning of the wall has the same effect on the visibility of the window as the bevelling of the border of the window. If one is permissible, so is the other. The neighbor, then, cannot be restrained from placing his wall exactly in the same position he could have placed it before the person widened the outside of his window. B, therefore, may extend his wall up to one <i>tefah</i> of the narrow part of A's window.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 11; Pr. 321; P. 528; Mord. B. B. 523; Hag. Maim., <i>Shekenim</i>, 7, 3.

Siman 12

<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A "in his work"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him "in his work."<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the "officers" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the "treasurers" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the "treasurers" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the "officers" directly because of the "lien of R. Nathan" (garnishment). But, if the "officers" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the "officers." k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him "in his work." Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of "the lien of R. Nathan." Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the "treasurers", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the "treasurers" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the "treasurers."<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that B released his (A's) debtor and sureties without his knowledge or permission. B avers that A had instructed him to release them.<br><i>A</i>. If witnesses testify that the debtor owed money to A at the time B released him, B must reimburse A with the amount the debt was worth before the debtor and the sureties were released by B. If there are no witnesses to determine the value of the debt, B must state under oath the extent of the damage he has caused to A, and must compensate him for this damage. But, if A can produce no witnesses to testify that the debtor owed him money, B is free from obligation. We must be satisfied with B's explanation of his act, since he could have denied his act altogether, and since A might have instructed B to release his debtor for the simple reason that the debtor had repaid his debt.<br>This Responsum is addressed to Rabbi Yedidyah.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 13; Mord.

Siman 14

Rabbi Samuel of Eisenach, a relative of R. Meir, permitted the eating of ritually slaughtered chickens with which a <i>trefah</i> chicken was mixed up. He based his decision on an opinion he said he had received from R. Jacob, that the law stated in Mishna Ab. Z. 5, 9, and interpreted in the Talmud Ab. Z. 74a, is the accepted law governing mixtures. This talmudic interpretation implies, that only objects possessing both characteristics: a) items usually sold by the piece, and b) forbidden objects, the profitable use of which is prohibited (<i>issurei hanaah</i>), are never neutralized in a mixture. However, objects lacking one of these characteristics do become neutralized in the proper mixture.<br>R. Meir took issue with R. Samuel, pointing out, that the accepted authorities never mention the foregoing view as the final law. On the contrary, these authorities decide that items usually sold by the piece, even though they be not forbidden objects the profitable use of which is prohibited, are never neutralized. Moreover, R. Samuel contradicted himself and ruled that a "piece fit to be offered a guest", even though it be not <i>issurei hanaah</i>, is not neutralized; but a whole chicken is also considered "a piece fit to be offered a guest". R. Meir, therefore, pleads with R. Samuel to acknowledge his mistake, and change his decision, lest it become a misleading precedent which may be followed by future generations.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 14; Am I, 75.

<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A "in his work"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him "in his work."<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the "officers" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the "treasurers" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the "treasurers" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the "officers" directly because of the "lien of R. Nathan" (garnishment). But, if the "officers" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the "officers." k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him "in his work." Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of "the lien of R. Nathan." Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the "treasurers", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the "treasurers" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the "treasurers."<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. I was wondering at your method of taking <i>Hallah</i> from unleavened cakes; for, after they were baked you put all the cakes into a basket and took one cake as <i>Hallah</i> for the rest. It is true that in the Mishnah (<i>Hallah</i> 2,4.) R. Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <i>Hallah</i> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them. But R. Eliezer never meant his law to be a palliative measure. I, therefore, take a small piece from each quantity of dough that is separately mixed, and then join the small pieces into one piece as <i>Hallah</i>.<br>Signed: R. Isaac b. Simeon.<br><i>A</i>. Throughout France <i>Hallah</i> is being taken from unleavened cakes by uniting them in a basket.

<i>Q</i>. A drained the water in his yard by means of a ditch which was adjacent to B's stone wall. B claimed that when the ditch was full, the water had flooded his house. He, therefore, demanded that A fill up his ditch. A claimed that the ditch had been in his yard for a period of twenty-four years and that B had never protested before. B, however, contended that the ditch had not previously caused him any damage. A's father bought the property with the ditch from a Jew who, in turn, had bought it from a Gentile.<br><i>A</i>. If A removes his ditch one <i>tefah</i> from B's wall, he is free from further obligation. But even if A does not do so, he is free from any obligation since he inherited the ditch from his father, who, if alive, could claim that he bought the right to maintain the ditch from B. Moreover, A is not required to take an oath to the effect that he never heard his father say that he did not buy from B (or B's father) the right to maintain the ditch for the following reasons: <i>a</i>) Orphans are not required to take an oath in order to free themselves from a money obligation; b) the oath of orphans is a rabbinical decree and the Rabbis did not decree anything disadvantageous to the interests of the orphans.<br>The fact that A's yard originally belonged to a Gentile, has nothing to do with the case since B does not claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally. If B does put forth the claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally, it will avail him nothing, since, again, the court will have to put forth the claim, for A's benefit, that A's father bought the right to maintain the ditch from B or B's predecessors.<br>This Responsum was sent to R.

The fact that B is responsible for A's deposit and would have to compensate him for its loss, does not make B the owner of the deposited money.

R. Meir, however, pointed out that C also committed a sin in seizing the property of another, for the talmudic dictum "a person may execute judgment on his own behalf" merely means that a person may retrieve his own valuables which he finds in the hands of others; but a creditor is not permitted to seize the valuables of his debtor without a court order.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 26–7; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A drew up a legal document in which he used the following words: "Effective as of today, but to be executed after our (meaning himself and his wife, L) deaths, our daughter R shall inherit an equal share with her brothers, those already born and those that might be born, in whatever will remain of my estate." After A's death, his children and his widow, L, interpreted the document to mean that A had appointed L trustee over his estate. When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement.<br><i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B's part of her share) immediately, while B's two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L's death.<br>Although the brothers are entitled to manage R's share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L's death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <i>ketubah</i>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R's share. R may not claim that her father has made her an outright gift, free of any lien or obligation, since A did not intend to give R a greater share than that of his sons. After L's death, R may exact an oath from her brothers to the effect that they did not retain for themselves anything belonging to her.<br><i>Q</i>. L's trustee claimed that L's property which she had given to her husband, had been given only to gratify him, but had not been intended as an outright gift. Therefore, this property had belonged to L; and she gave it to her mother by right.<br><i>A</i>. This property was not listed in L's <i>ketubah</i>, and was thus considered <i>niksei melug</i> regarding which a woman may not claim that her gift thereof to her husband was not actually meant to be binding but was given in order to gratify him (B. B. 50a). Therefore, the gift was binding, and she no longer had any claim to said property. She had no right to give it to her mother.<br>This Resp. is addressed to: "My teacher Rabbi Eliezer b.

When community leaders claim that a member of their community owes a certain amount of taxes to the community and the member denies owing anything and refuses to pay, the leaders usually break into his house, often with the help of Gentiles, and forcefully take away valuables as pledges to secure the payment of the taxes demanded. Where do the community leaders get that right?<br>A. Taxes levied by the secular government are considered to be in the possession of the government even before actual collection of same. The community [the collecting agency of the government's taxes] possesses the same rights as the government and is, therefore, allowed to impound a person's valuables in order to have actual possession of the tax money.

<i>Q</i>. A demanded from B sixty pennies he owed him. B admitted the indebtedness, but claimed that through A's wilful neglect, he, B, was not able to collect a debt of four pounds and sixty pennies. B, therefore, demanded that A pay him four pounds. The judges ordered A to swear that he did not willfully cause any damage to B, and ordered B to swear that A did willfully cause him a loss of at least sixty pennies. After the judges rendered this decision, B put forth his claim that, in partnership with A, he, B, loaned eight and one half pounds to Gentiles, and that, without his permission or consent, A relinquished that debt to the Gentiles. A, however, claimed that B gave him permission to do with B's share whatever he would do with his own. Moreover, A claims that B informed against him; a Jewish witness, the servants of the Bishop, and the burghers, support A's claim in this respect. The judges, however, demand that their former decision be carried out and that A and B present their new claims in another suit.<br><i>A</i>. The decision of the judges that A must take an oath to the effect that he did not cause B to lose his investment by willful neglect, is correct. But if A released B's Gentile debtors (even though B gave A a blanket permission to do with his, B's, share whatever he, A, would do with his own), A must pay B as much as B's share was worth before A released the Gentiles.

<i>Q</i>. Some members of the community made statements before the bishop [probably regarding their financial status] and swore to the truth of these statements. Subsequently they denied having made such statements. The bishop became enraged and threw some of them into prison. A and his mother-in-law, who had no part in this affair, asked the community to ransom the prisoners and offered to pay their part of the ransom money. The community tried to rescue the unfortunates, but the bishop would not free them. Finally they were freed by the grace of God. The bishop then became reconciled by receiving a certain amount of money, as a fine from the community. The community demanded that A and his mother-in-law contribute their share of the fine. A and his mother-in-law complained to the bishop, who, in his anger, increased the fine. The community now demands that A pay his share of the original fine plus the entire increase of which he was the cause. A claims that the community committed the first wrong by asking the bishop to put the tax on the entire community, after the bishop explicitly imposed the fine only on those members who were guilty of the perjury.<br><i>A</i>. If the bishop originally imposed the fine only on those members who took the false oath, those who did not take such an oath are not obliged to pay any part of the fine. As to the increased fine, if A's claim is true, he is not to be held responsible for it. If, however, his claim is false, the community may collect from him any losses it has suffered on his account. The amount of the loss must be established by witnesses. If, however, the community cannot produce any witnesses, and A claims that he caused it no losses, he may take an oath and be free from obligation. But if he admits having caused it some loss, the community may take an oath as to the amount of the loss, and collect that amount from A.

However, before paying money to the Gentile, let B perform a valid act of possession (such as locking a door, fixing or breaking part of the fence, etc.); otherwise A will acquire rights to window lights during the interval between the paying of the money and B's taking formal possession, since during such interval the Gentile's property will be <i>res nullis</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 63–64; Pr. 28–29; L. 338; Mord. ibid.

Therefore, the estate should be divided in the following manner: The amount recorded in L's <i>ketubah</i> as dowry, shall be divided equally between her brother and A's brother; L's private property, if any, shall go to her brother, while the remaining property shall go to A's brother. However, if A's daughter is still a minor, the estate should not be divided until she reaches majority. Then, if she still persists in her apostasy for one hour, the estate must be divided between the brothers; for a minor does not forfeit her rights as an heir upon apostatizing, since the persuasion of a minor is tantamount to inexorable compulsion.<br>The author adds: For further details see the Responsum appended therewith which I have sent long ago to Frankfort regarding a similar question.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 82.

<i>Q</i>. B claims that he gave A fifteen pounds to lend it on interest for two years and then give the principal and the interest to B's son if he should consent to marry A's daughter. B's son, however, refused to marry A's daughter and B wants his money back. A claims that he had originally accepted B's money as a dowry for his daughter, that he had taken possession of the gift for her, and that the money, therefore, belongs to her.<br><i>A</i>. A dowry gift becomes the property of the donee only if the marriage takes place. Therefore, neither A nor his daughter has ever gained title to B's money, and A must return the principal plus the interest to B. Even if B expressly stipulated that he will forfeit the 15 pounds if the marriage does not take place, such a stipulation is considered an <i>Asmakhta</i> and is not valid. B, however, must pay A for his trouble in managing B's investments.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 86; Pr. 285; Mord. B.B. 615; <i>Agudah</i> B.B. 198.

<i>Q</i>. L, A's widow who has had no children with A, gave away his books to religious (or charitable) institutions of two or three communities, before she took the required oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i>. A's heirs summoned her to court claiming that she had taken from A more than was due her according to her <i>ketubah</i>. L appeared in court and was ready to take the required oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i>, but died before she could do so. L's trustee asked the judges how to dispose of the books that were entrusted to him, and the judges instructed him to deliver them to the donee institutions. Now A's heirs demand the return of these books.<br><i>A</i>. This is a highly controversial subject. The court of Würzburg — and I believe also of Speyer, following a decision by R. Simha — usually follow the decision of R. Eliezer (Shebu. 48a) which in our case would be in favor of the donees. However, we follow the ruling of Rav and Samuel (ibid.) that the entire estate belongs to the heirs. According to our opinion, therefore, even if the donee has already taken possession of the widow's gift, it should be returned to the heirs; but, if the donee has originally taken possession of the gift at the instruction of a court, we usually uphold the court's decision on the assumption that the court has followed the opinion of R. Eliezer (ibid. 48b). However, you state that the court has also decided that L's heirs have no claim on A's estate; they followed, therefore, the opinion of Rav and Samuel. Thus their decision in favor of the donees can no longer be construed as following the opinion of R. Eliezer, and must be considered a mere error.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 88.

<i>Q</i>. What is the value of the one hundred pounds that a person obligates himself, in the <i>ketubah</i> document, to pay to his wife in case of death or divorce?<br><i>A</i>. In Würzburg a well established local custom is followed to permit a woman to collect two hundred <i>marks</i>. This custom, however, is not logical, for the term "pound" is thus interpreted to mean a pound by weight (16 ounces) which is equivalent to two <i>marks</i>. But if this interpretation is correct why do we not explicitly write in the <i>ketubah</i>: "one hundred pounds by weight"? Thus, I once saw my teacher and relative Rabbi Judah haKohen order the insertion of such phrase in the <i>ketubah</i> of one of his relatives. Since, however, we unqualifiedly write "one hundred pounds", we probably mean the coin "pound" and refer to the largest money unit current in the particular town. Rabbi Simha established the custom of paying the widow or divorcee one hundred <i>marks</i> as her <i>ketubah</i>, thus interpreting the above mentioned phrase to mean one hundred pounds of heavy coins (<span>ליבריינ"ש</span>), one pound of which is equivalent to a <i>mark</i>. Indeed, I have heard that in Worms only one hundred pounds <i>Heller</i> are paid; this custom of paying pounds current in the particular town seems to me preferable to all other customs. However, one must follow the custom of his locality. In the absence of a local custom, the custom of the town where the wedding took place should be followed. If no custom exists in this town either, one should pay one hundred pounds of the coins current in his present place of abode or in the town where the wedding took place — whichever is of lower value<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The last statement is quite obscure since the talmudic source quoted in its support is in complete disagreement therewith.</i>.<br><b>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 95.</b>

<i>Q</i>. A formally released his mother, L, from the obligation of taking the required oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i>, and gave her the right to will the property to whomever she might please, to sons and to daughters, to give more to some and less to others, on condition that she transfer to A a particular piece of real property forthwith. Immediately after the formal release, however, A said to his mother that since this real property was mortgaged, her release was not to become effective till she redeem it for him. L promised to redeem it. Now, however, she refuses to do so.<br><i>A</i>. Unless L redeem the above property, her agreement with A is void, for A's last stipulation proves that he had originally agreed to release L on condition only that she transfer the property to him unencumbered by mortgages. Moreover, a stipulation made immediately after an agreement is concluded, but while the matter is still being discussed, becomes part of the agreement (B.

Subsequently, L, one of his daughters, and her husband said to A that he still owed them three <i>marks</i> worth of gold which he had promised them before their wedding. A answered incoherently, for he was losing consciousness, that he thus intended to repay them, but died before finishing his words.<br><i>A</i>. A's last words are of no consequence since he was not in his right mind while uttering them. Therefore, if A's daughters admit that A had promised L three <i>marks</i> as part of her dowry and had not paid it to her, L is entitled to collect three <i>marks</i> in addition to the <i>causa mortis</i> gift, for while A, on his death-bed, gave presents to his other daughters, he probably intended to make no exception in his dealing with L. But, if the other daughters disclaim any knowledge of A's debt, they must take an heir's oath.

Is this collection of a mother's <i>ketubah</i>, called <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i>, enforced nowadays?<br><i>A</i>. Many <i>Geonim</i> are of the opinion that the <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is not collectible nowadays. But R. Hai Gaon is of the opinion that it is collectible; and I am inclined to decide, in accordance with the opinion of R. Hai, that it is collectible even from movable property, unless a custom exists in a particular community that it is not collectible.<br>This decision is based on R. Meir's Responsum as recorded in Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to Nashim 26; and the opinion expressed in Mord. Ket. 162. But Cr. 116 records the following decision: Since a difference of opinion exists between the <i>Geonim</i>, the burden of proof [to prove according to which authority the law is to be decided] lies on the person who wants to collect money from the other person.<br>Tesh. Maim. <i>ibid</i>. continues: The <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is collectible nowadays from both real property and from personal property. As the ordinance of R. Tam, providing that a woman's dowry be returned to her heirs if the woman dies within the first year of marriage, is enforced; surely the ordinance of talmudic scholars, of a similar nature, should be enforced. According to the custom of the communities, the dowry is thus returned to the woman's heirs if she died within two years after her marriage. But R. Meir is of the opinion that the dowry should not be returned to her heirs, but to those who have given it originally. Similarly, R. Meir gave a dowry to his granddaughter Rachel. When she died in the second year of her marriage, R. Meir demanded that the dowry be returned to him although she had other heirs. In some communities only half of the dowry is returned when the woman dies in the second year of her marriage. The ordinance of the communities, which bears the signature of R.

<i>Q</i>. B informed the community of T that he wished to move out of town. He did move out of town, but settled within one mile of T. He continued to lend money to the nobles, his customers, asserting that he was unable to collect his debts from them unless he lent them additional funds. Subsequently, a heavy tax was imposed on the community by the overlord of T. The community protested to the overlord that B, the man who formerly used to defray half of the taxes imposed on the community, had moved out of town [outside of the overlord's jurisdiction], but their protests were of no avail. The community, therefore, demands that B pay his share of the tax.<br><i>A</i>. If it is true that B left town before the overlord demanded the tax, he is under no obligation to pay it, since he lived outside of the city limits, even though within one mile of T. I have known many instances where men who have left their town and moved to places scarcely half a mile away, no longer paid their taxes to the community. Formerly, when the country had a king, the Jews of the surrounding territory — even those who lived eight miles away from town, in fact those who lived in the entire bishopric — would pay their taxes to the king collectively with the community. [But this is no longer done.] However, if, while B was still living in T, the community passed a ruling [regarding the payment of taxes, or the lending of additional funds to debtors, by the Jews who move to the surrounding territory], he is still bound by such a ruling. The community, on the other hand, did an improper thing by informing the overlord that B used to bear half the burden of the community taxes. They should merely have informed the overlord that B had moved out of town, and should have been satisfied with whatever reduction the overlord would have granted to them on this account. Regarding B's business transactions, however, if B could not have collected his debts from the nobles unless he lent them additional funds, he is under no obligation to pay taxes on such investments.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 121.

The matchmaker is only entitled to reasonable compensation for the time and effort he has spent. However, if because of his preoccupation with this match, he was hindered from devoting himself to other matches (from which, it is reasonable to expect, he would have earned a similar amount), he is entitled to the two <i>marks</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 123.

<i>Q</i>. A engaged a tutor for his son for one year. After the tutor had entered upon his duties, he was requested by A to leave. When the tutor had gone, A changed his mind and demanded that the tutor return to fulfill the terms of his agreement. The tutor, however, refuses to return, and claims that A released him from all obligations when he ordered him to leave.<br><i>A</i>. A verbal release is not binding when the obligation is personal [such as the obligation of a slave or a tutor]. Moreover, the tutor is under an obligation to A's son, and A had no right to release the tutor from such obligation.

<i>Q</i>. Does the clause of the <i>Ketubah</i>: "and I will labor, honor, nourish and sustain thee" provide that a husband may be coerced into hiring himself out as a laborer in order to support his wife?<br><i>A</i>. A number of legal proofs have been marshalled to the effect that a husband may be forced to work in order to support his wife; but none is conclusive.

a) <i>Q</i>. A married L in Mayence, or in another locality, where the <i>ketubah</i> is valued at two hundred <i>marks</i>. They then removed to a different locality where the <i>ketubah</i> is valued at much less. They lived in the latter place until A's death. How much money is L entitled to as her <i>ketubah</i>?<br><i>A</i>. The opinion of R. Simon b. Gamaliel (Ket. 110b) is accepted that a woman is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> current in the locality where her marriage took place.

Siman 128

b) <i>Q</i>. After A died L took over, and managed, his estate. Why, then, did you write that the estate was considered, nevertheless, to be in the possession of the orphans?<br><i>A</i>. R. Hananel decided that the estate managed by the widow is considered to be in the possession of the orphans. The widow is merely a managing trustee. Therefore, all the profit accruing because of her management, belongs to the orphans and she can not collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. When the widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> she loses her right to receive her sustenance from the estate. She must, then, take an oath while holding the Scroll of the Law; and whatever she thus states under oath to have given away, or to have retained for herself, to have given to her daughter, or to have given to charity, is deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>.

Siman 129

c) <i>Q</i>. L lent some of the money to lords and "men of violence", and it is doubtful whether the latter will pay their debts.<br><i>A</i>. L is responsible for these bad investments. Ordinarily when heirs pay the <i>ketubah</i> to a widow, they may give her in payment any kind of property, or any object even bran; but they cannot pay her by transferring to her money due them from others, since the collection of debts often involves litigations to which a woman is not accustomed. However, in our case, the orphans may transfer to L the money she has invested with the lords and the "men of violence", in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, since she had no right to make such unsafe investments.

Siman 130

d) <i>Q</i>. While L managed the estate she gave presents to certain persons thinking she had the right to do so. Are the orphans entitled to take back the presents?<br><i>A</i>. The recipients are entitled to retain these presents since they may claim that L gave them out of her own property, and since it appears that the market ordinance (<i>takkanat hashuk</i>) was to apply to property given away as presents.

Siman 131

e) <i>Q</i>. Do we put forth the claim for the benefit of the orphans that L may have been a widow when she married A, or that A may have paid her one <i>Mina</i>.?<br><i>A</i>. We surely put forth the above claims for the benefit of the orphans. However, if a report circulates that L was a virgin when she married A, she is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin, since the majority of women are married while virgins. [The principle of "a majority of cases" presumes that what is true in most instances, is also true in our case.] Although in litigation over money matters the principle of "a majority of cases" is not a factor, it is so when the claimant is in actual possession of the litigated money. In our case, L is in actual possession of the money; therefore, the combination of a "majority" and a "report" in her favor, is conclusive.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 127–8–9–30–31; L. 480–1–2–3.

<i>Q</i>. A widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> and a creditor demands his money from an estate. Who has priority in collecting from the estate?<br><i>A</i>. The creditor has priority over the widow. Moreover, even when the estate consists of assets only to satisfy one of the claimants, the creditor is paid in preference to the widow. In our times, since the creditor as well as the widow collects from unencumbered movables, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from such movables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 140; P. 283.

<i>Q</i>. A [moved out of T but nevertheless] lent money to his customers there. The community of T, therefore, forced him to pay taxes. He now claims that the community had no right to collect these taxes from him since he had made no new investments in T but merely had lent additional funds to his customers in order to be able to collect his old debts from them. The community representatives aver that A could have collected his debts without lending additional funds to his debtors.<br><i>A</i>. If A could not have collected his debts unless he had lent additional funds to his debtors, he had a right to lend them such funds, and these transactions should have been tax-free. The members of the community, as interested parties, are not qualified to serve as witnesses in this matter. Therefore, either every member of the community must take an oath to support the claim of its representatives, or the community must permit A to take an oath in support of his contention. However, if the community can produce even a single, independent, witness — one who has no financial interest in this trial, or one from whom the community shall agree to take a certain specified amount as his share of the tax regardless of the outcome of this trial — in support of the claims of the representatives, or to the effect that A freed the community from the obligation of taking an oath, no oath will be required.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 156.

A claims that his representative caused him to lose his case against B by willful neglect, for the representative pleaded in court those arguments which A asked him not to plead, and neglected to plead those arguments which he specifically asked him to.

But, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A's arguments, A would have had to swear and be able to recover, or swear and be free from obligation, and now the case is that the oath has either been transferred to B, or that now B may collect without taking an oath, the representative is free from obligation, since the damage to A's interests is not clear and remains problematical, as no one can be sure that A would have taken the required oath. However, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A's arguments, A would be free from obligation and would not be required to take an oath, and now B collects from A without being required to take an oath, the representative is guilty of willful neglect.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 157; Pr. 242; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A had a sickly, epileptic daughter. He promised B a large dowry, and for this reason B married her. A's daughter died within the first year of her marriage, after having given birth to a child who, in turn, died before he was thirty days old. Since A's daughter left a child when she died, we decided that B was entitled to collect the dowry from A.<br><i>A</i>. Since the child died before he was thirty days old, his viability has not been established. Therefore, his existence was of no consequence. Thus, I am greatly surprised that you considered the existence of the child a determining factor in the case. Moreover, Rashi and R. Tam hold conflicting opinions regarding the question whether a widower is entitled to collect the dowry his father-in-law had promised him (<i>Tosaphot</i> Ket. 47a, s. v. <span>כתב</span>). I am greatly surprised, therefore, that you dare decide between the two conflicting opinions; for whenever there exists a difference of opinion between authorities, we do not enforce the collection of money by either party. Your contention that since A's daughter was a sickly person B had a stronger claim on her dowry, is also baseless, for the law draws no distinction between a healthy and a sickly wife. Indeed, the <i>takkanah</i> of R. Tam to the effect that when a wife dies within the first year of her marriage the husband must return her dowry to the original donors, is only valid in those communities where this <i>takkanah</i> was accepted. My decision in this case, however, is not based on this <i>takkanah</i>, but on Rabbinic law which is valid everywhere.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 159.

If L refuses to accept a divorce, Rabbi Eliezer is permitted to marry another woman. Rabbenu Gershom had intended that his prohibition against bigamy should apply only when the first marriage was legitimately contracted; but he had not intended to protect by his <i>takkanah</i> the marriage of a loose and immoral woman. Those who impute such intentions to Rabbenu Gershom will receive severe punishment from Heaven for defaming this saint's character and malignantly ascribing to him silly ordinances in order to make him appear ridiculous and thus discredit his other <i>takkanot</i>. Thus, the Rabbis are intent upon breaking up the marriage of a man to a woman pregnant by another. Would, then, Rabbenu Gershom protect such a marriage by his <i>takkanah</i>! I am even inclined to the opinion that the betrothal itself was invalid since the bridegroom was ignorant of facts, the knowledge of which would have prevented him from marrying L.

When B's wife asked A to ransom her, she assumed responsibility for all damages A might suffer on this account.

<i>Q</i>. When A demanded of B the return of the money he had given him, B repaid part of it and provided A with a surety for the rest. The fact that B provided A with a surety is attested to by witnesses. Now, however, B claims that this money was originally given to him by A not as a loan but as an outright gift, that consequently he owes nothing to A, and that when he provided A with a surety he acted "inside the line of justice."<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of the witnesses to the effect that B provided A with a surety, is convincing proof that A had given the money to B as a loan. Although a person will sometimes buy what by law belongs to him in order to avoid litigation, this principle applies only when the rightful owner is not in possession of the disputed property, while in our case B was in possession of the money. Moreover, even if there were no such witnesses, we would have put no credence in B's assertion that he provided A with a surety only because he acted "inside the line of justice." For the principle of <i>Miggo</i> — that we ought to believe B's present statement since, were he inclined to lie, he could have denied altogether having provided A with a surety — does not apply to this case, since we are thoroughly convinced that had B not owed the money to A, he would not have repaid part of it.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 166; Am II, 164.

A, then, said to B that he would not be expected to pay taxes on the original value of the debt. Subsequently some members of the community summoned B to court regarding the tax on the debt, and the court reached a certain decision. A, however, was not satisfied and, as a member of the community, summoned B to court again. The latter claims that A's statement mentioned above proves that A had no case against him. A, on the other hand, contends that B swore to pay a tax on the value of the debt at the time the tax was collected. B denies this claim, while A has no disinterested witnesses to support his contention.<br><i>A</i>. If A was in town when B was first summoned to court, he should have appeared in court at that time to press his claims. Even if A was out of town at the time, if B has complied with the court's decision in the matter, he is under no obligation to A. B is not required to take an oath denying A's claim, since no oath is imposed for the purpose of forcing compliance with an alleged former oath. On the other hand, A's statement to B did not, in itself, absolve B from obligation to A, since a person, sometimes, does not reveal his real arguments and claims to his opponent until they both appear at court.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 167; Am II, 136.

<i>Q</i>. A bought silver from B. Having no money to pay for it, he gave B a quantity of gold on condition that should he fail to pay B within three days, B would have the right to raise money against such gold by using it as security on an interest-bearing loan, or by having the money-changers exchange it for money, or by resorting to any other possible manner of raising money. B, however, pledged the gold with C on condition that it become forfeited after two weeks shall have elapsed, should A fail to redeem it within that time. A did not redeem his gold within the stipulated time. Now A demands that B return his gold since he never intended to allow B to pledge his gold on such unusual, and extremely unfavorable, conditions. By the phrase "any other possible manner" he meant to permit the employment of customary methods of raising money against security, and no more. Moreover, B did not necessarily have to raise a loan. He could have taken off a piece of the gold commensurate in value with the money due him, and returned the remainder to A; since gold bullion lends itself to such treatment without the necessity of appraisal [by a court]. B, on the other hand, claims that knowing what a dilatory debtor A was, he refused to do business with him until A gave him the gold and specified that it could be used to raise money "in any possible manner", the last phrase to be taken literally. He further claims that he could not raise the money in any other way than on the terms made with C, and that he informed A about this transaction with C, and that A agreed to it. A, however, denies B's assertions and claims that he was informed of the transaction with C after he had mounted his horse and had been ready to ride on his way, and that he did not realize at the time the meaning of B's words.<br><i>A</i>. Even assuming the truth of B's version of his agreement with A, such agreement is considered an <i>asmakhta</i> and is not valid unless accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court. Therefore, B must pay to A the difference between the value of A's gold and the amount due B.

<i>Q</i>. A, his four daughters, and his wife, were killed when the house they occupied collapsed. A's heirs claim that perhaps the wife died first and that therefore they now were the only heirs to A's estate. The wife's brothers, on the other hand, claim that perhaps the wife died last and that therefore they were entitled to her <i>ketubah</i>. Some Rabbis are of the opinion that the wife's heirs were entitled to one-twelfth of the estate; while other Rabbis, computing probabilities, believe that they were entitled to one thirty-second of the estate.<br><i>A</i>. It is my humble opinion that the wife's heirs are entitled to one-half of the estate, because of the talmudic principle <i>Kol Kavua kemahaze al mahaze domi</i>, meaning: whenever an event is about to befall (or has befallen) one of a number of fixed persons or objects, each person or object has a fifty-fifty chance that the incident will befall (or has befallen) him or it. Therefore, legally, there is a fifty-fifty chance for each one of the six persons involved that he or she died last. Had the daughters been married and had their husbands appeared to demand their share, the estate would have had to be divided into six parts. But, since only two persons demand their share, the estate should be divided between the two. Although a woman has to take an oath before she is entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, no such oath is required in this case since A died suddenly and we have no reason to suspect that before his death he had deposited with her valuables to be used in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 172; L. 378; Mord.

R(achel), another relative of L, took care of L during her sickness, and received from her the keys to everything in the house. After L's death it was learned that R appropriated some of L's money and articles. A summoned R to court where she claimed to have received said valuables from L as a present.

If the valuables can be identified as having definitely belonged to L, and if witnesses saw such valuables in R's possession, R must prove that L gave them to her as an outright gift (not <i>causa mortis</i>) before she will be entitled to retain them. But, if the articles can not be so identified, or, if no one saw them in R's possession, R must take an oath that she received them as an outright gift. We would have to accept such an oath because of the principle of <i>Miggo</i>, since, in the absence of witnesses, R could have denied the charge altogether. However, if witnesses testify, or R herself admits, that the gift was made to her <i>causa mortis</i> — R must return the valuables to A, since L's final statement before the witnesses voided all previous <i>causa mortis</i> gifts.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 180; L. 249; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A's wife bound herself by a ban in the presence of the people of the town, not to do a certain thing. The terms of the ban were written down, and all the townfolk signed the document. Subsequently she transgressed the ban several times, as attested to by witnesses. A transgressing woman, if properly forwarned, loses the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. We are doubtful, however, whether A's wife had to be properly forewarned before losing her right to the <i>ketubah</i>. We are inclined to believe that no such forewarning was necessary since she was warned at the time the ban was pronounced that she would lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i> should she transgress the ban, and she agreed thereto without inserting any qualifying conditions. Does A's wife lose the right to her <i>ketubah?</i> Furthermore, is A permitted to divorce her against her will?

<i>A</i>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <i>ketubah</i>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <i>Sotah</i> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <i>ketubah;</i> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately.<br>The question was again sent to R. Meir: A's wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage).<br><i>A</i>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife's sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor's children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A's wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 185; L. 393; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A claimed that C owed him two denarii (Cr. reads: one pound), and that he refused to go to the Jewish court. When C wanted to leave the city, A complained to the judge,<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Probably a Gentile judge.</i> who retained C's money until he would appear before the Jewish court and comply with its decision. B then interposed in C's behalf, became surety for him, took pledges from A (and, probably from C) and promised A by solemn hand-clasp that should C fail to appear in court and to comply with its decision, B would return the pledges to A. A believes he has witnesses to this effect, and demands the pledges from B. B, however, claims that he only guaranteed that C would return to the city before a certain date, that C did come to the city before that date, and that he (B) was thereby released from his obligation.<br><i>A</i>. If A, through the testimony of his witnesses, can prove his claim regarding B's promise by solemn hand-clasp, then B must fulfill his promise, since promises made by solemn handclasp must be fulfilled. But, if A has no witnesses, B is free from obligation and does not even have to take an oath.

<i>Q</i>. Several Jews lent twenty-one pounds to the dean (<i>Dechant</i>), the overlord of the Jews of the city, on condition that he repay them thirty pounds. The dean asked the Jewish community to go surety from him and pay his creditors the thirty pounds, when the next payment of the taxes would be due. The community leaders agreed and gave a writ of indebtedness, bearing their signatures, for thirty pounds to A and B. The dean was deposed before the next payment of the taxes became due and the community was faced with the loss of this money. The community, therefore, refuses to pay the nine pounds interest to the creditors, claiming that since the community became responsible for the original debt contracted by the dean, the payment of the nine pounds, in addition to the twenty-one pounds borrowed by the dean, would constitute usury.<br><i>A</i>. Since the creditors settled the interest on the dean as a loan, the dean became obligated to pay his creditors the full thirty pounds, which obligation was governed by the law of the country. The community leaders took over the dean's obligations in the presence of the three parties involved in the transaction, and became obligated to pay thirty pounds to the creditors. Moreover, the community is responsible for the full amount because its leaders went surety for the dean. The suretyship is binding in this case for two reasons: a) Although the suretyship was established after the debt was contracted (and should be invalid unless accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>) the creditors did not free the dean from his obligations until the community leaders went surety for him; b) suretyship established by community leaders is comparable to one made before a Jewish court and is binding even without a <i>kinyan</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 188; Pr. 38; Mord.

Then the bishop removed his miter and gave it to the Rabbi [cantor] and said: "I give you herewith the office of cantor." The cantor became very much incensed and said to the bishop: "Sir, our law does not permit me to receive the right to serve our Lord from your hands." The cantor resigned his post and I believe that he fined the Jew who was responsible for the bishop's act.

When Rabbi Zamlan was ill he sent for Rabbi Asher in order that the latter help him dispose of his property in a manner that would make it impossible for his wife, L, to appropriate his possessions in payment of her <i>ketubah</i> or for her sustenance. Rabbi Asher refused to come, but Rabbi Zamlan implored him and pleaded with him saying: "What can I do for my only son who, after my death, will have to go begging from door to door?" Rabbi Asher then agreed to act as a witness, and Rabbi Zamlan gave away to his son and to other persons, all of his property as an outright gift effective immediately. After his death, L's relatives summoned Rabbi Zamlan's son to the court of Rabbi Perez. The latter recorded the claims of the two parties and sent the claims to Rabbi Meir without giving the names of the litigants and without expressing any opinion on the subject. Rabbi Meir ruled that L was entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or to draw her sustenance, from the possessions of Rabbi Zamlan which he had given to his son; his reason being that even an outright gift to an heir is considered an inheritance and that the widow's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien upon it.<br>Rabbi Perez took issue with Rabbi Meir quoting Alfasi's decision that the ordinance of Usha — which ruled that a person who divided all of his property among his children may derive his sustenance as well as that of his wife's from such property — was not accepted.<br>Rabbi Meir reproved Rabbi Perez for resorting to Alfasi when the Talmud specifically decided that the ordinance of Usha was not accepted. R. Meir contended, however, that only that part of the ordinance was not accepted which gave the right to the donor, and to his wife while he was alive, to derive their sustenance from the property he had given away; while the rule that the widow may collect her sustenance or her <i>ketubah</i> from such property after the donor's death, was accepted before the ordinance of Usha was promulgated, and has remained in force independently of such ordinance.<br>Meanwhile L's relatives have written to Rabbi Meir asking for his decsion in this matter. R. Meir answered that he usually refrained from sending legal opinions to litigants, or to their relatives, and confined his responses to judges. But, when Rabbi Perez, in his second letter, gave the names of the litigants, R. Meir realized that the letters from L's relatives dealt with the same case. R. Meir recalled that among these letters was found a letter from Rabbi Asher which explained the circumstances of the gift mentioned above. Therefore, R. Meir added (in his second letter to Rabbi Perez) that since according to Rabbi Asher's letter, the donor mentioned the contingency of death when he summoned Rabbi Asher, he therefore made the gift to his son <i>causa mortis</i> (cf. B. B. 151a), and a widow is undoubtedly entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i> from <i>causa mortis</i> gifts.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 192; Am II, 46–7; cf. Hag.

<i>Q</i>. A sold his ground, which bordered on B's property, to C for a sum of money plus C's share in a piece of ground C held in partnership with D in another part of town. After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A's ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C's piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the "estate of Bar Marion" (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C's share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D's sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D's partner, and, having the right of preemption on D's share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B's right of preemption.<br><i>A</i>. Since C bought A's ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the "estate of Bar Marion", for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A's ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C's ground as having the value for him of the "estate of Bar Marion", for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C. Many persons have the erroneous notion that the preemptive right of an abutter is void whenever an exchange or real property is involved. Were this true, the parties to a sale of immovables would always add a small piece of ground to the purchasing price in order to place the transaction in the category of exchange of real property, thus turning into a hollow mockery the ordinance of the Rabbis who created the law of preemption for humane reasons. Therefore, whenever we suspect that the circumstances of a sale of real property were specially arranged in order to circumvent the law of preemption, we sustain the preemptive right of the abutter.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 193; Am II, 199, 200.

Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a "boundless" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

A's widow, Leah, and his children put forth their claims, through representatives, regarding real property left to A by his mother on condition that after A's death the property be transferred to A's children and not be used to pay Leah's <i>ketubah</i>. Leah claimed that the said property never belonged to A's mother since the latter received it in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, but failed to take the required oath before collecting such <i>ketubah</i>. Leah, therefore, demanded her <i>ketubah</i> from this property. A's sons, then, produced a document to the effect that A, foregoing the required oath, permitted his mother to take the property of his deceased father in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, and bestowed upon her as a gift whatever amount the property was worth in excess of her <i>ketubah</i>. Leah, however, claimed that as soon as her father-in-law died, his property, automatically falling to her husband, was subject to the lien of her <i>ketubah</i>, and that A, therefore, had no right to waive the oath his mother was required to take and to bestow gifts upon her without her (Leah's) permission.<br><i>A</i>. The property belongs to the grandchildren who were already born at the time the gift was made by A's mother, and Leah cannot collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. We have no proof that A's mother received more than the amount specified in the <i>ketubah</i>. A's document bestowing on his mother as a gift whatever she received over and above her <i>ketubah</i> does not prove that she actually received more than was due her. Leah's claim that A had no right to bestow gifts without her permission is valid only in regard to real property, but a husband may sell or give away personal property without his wife's permission. Therefore, A's mother had a right to give her property to A and to his children.

<i>Q</i>. Before her death, Leah, in the presence of witnesses, said: "All my possessions shall go to B and C except what I have already given to charity." After her death, B and C found some of her possessions in A's hands. They demanded these possessions from A who, in turn, claimed that Leah gave them to him as a gift <i>mortis causa</i> before she gave anything to B and C.<br><i>A</i>. If, while making the gift to A, Leah indicated that she was making such a gift in fear of approaching death, then her final words, giving everything to B and C, prevail, since she probably changed her mind regarding her gift to A. A, then, must return the property to B and C. But, if Leah made no mention of death when she gave some of her possessions to A, then such a gift is in the category of a "sick man's gift of part of his property" (Baba Batra 151b) which requires a <i>kinyan</i> (formal act of possession). Since in this case, there was a <i>kinyan</i> (the property was in A's possession at the time of the gift), the property belongs to A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 206; Pr. 34; L. 344; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. Upon dividing, among themselves, the land left by their father, A and B formally agreed (by means of a <i>Kinyan</i>) that the western part of that land shall belong to A and the eastern part to B. Upon B's portion was situated an unfinished stone structure. A demanded that it be torn down and the stones and gravel be divided between B and himself. B refused to tear the building down and wanted to pay A for his share of the value of the stones and the gravel. A, however, demanded that B also pay him half the amount it would cost to construct such a building.<br><i>A</i>. As soon as A agreed to take the western part of the estate he relinquished his right to the building in the eastern part, excepting the value of the stones and the gravel of such building.

If, when the community sold the honors to B, A was in a position to pay half a pound for them but failed to do so, he forfeited his rights to them when he consented to their being sold to B. Therefore, if witnesses testify that A had originally consented to such sale together with the rest of the community, A has no claim to these honors. Or, in the absence of such testimony, if witnesses testify to B's undisturbed possession — since B claims that A had consented to the sale — the honors belong to B. However, if, when the honors were sold to B, A could not afford to buy them, but now that he has the means he wants to recoup his rights and privileges, A is entitled to his rights of priority.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 209; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A and B appeared in court. A claimed that two years previously he had lent money belonging to orphans to B for investment purposes on condition that the orphans share equally in the profits as well as in the losses. He demanded that B return this money since B was not financially as well off as he had been two years previously and might lose the orphans' money. B, on the other hand, claimed that the money was given to him by the grandfather and mother of the orphans with the condition that he do not return it under any circumstances, not even to themselves, until the orphans grow up and get married; that he now intended to abide by this agreement even though the grandfather died meanwhile and his heirs have demanded the return of this money; and that he was richer at this time than two years previously, since at that time he owned no real estate while now he did, and also had property of his own.

<i>A</i>. If the grandfather and the mother of the orphans were not trustees — never having been duly appointed by the court, the father of the orphans, or the orphans themselves — they had no right to administer the latter's money. Therefore, the agreements they had entered into regarding this money, were void. If they were duly appointed as trustees for the orphans, they ought to be discharged for lending money belonging to orphans without adequate security, and without receiving notes of indebtedness, and on terms injurious to the orphans' interests; since according to the agreement the orphans were to share in the losses, as well as in the profits, resulting from B's transactions. Such money must be lent to a rich and trustworthy man, on adequate security, and on condition that the orphans share only in the profits but not in the losses. Any trustee not heeding this rule could be discharged without notice for damaging the orphans' interests, and the agreements he had entered into would become void at the time he was discharged. Since B admitted that the money lent to him belonged to orphans, and that it was lent to him on conditions injurious to the latter, the agreement he entered into with the trustees of said orphans, was void, and he had to return the money.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 211; L. 220; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. Before his death A, a trustee of the orphan B, appointed other trustees for B and gave them the money that had been deposited with him. The trustees are not certain whether A meant that the money be given to B's mother, or, merely, that she be manager of the estate during her lifetime.<br><i>A</i>. The trustees must carefully consider A's last words. If he told them to take good care of the money for B because it belonged to B, and that they do nothing therewith except with the consent of B's mother, he probably meant that they serve as trustees together with B's mother till B grow up, but he did not mean that the mother be a trustee indefinitely. Therefore, as soon as B grows up, the trustees and the mother will have to withdraw from the estate. Moreover, if B's mother displayed any intentions of retaining some of the money for herself, her trusteeship should be terminated immediately, for even a trustee appointed by the father of the orphans is to be dismissed as soon as it is discovered that he damages the interests of the orphans.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 212.

<i>Q</i>. A had Gentiles arrest his opponents. One of his opponents resisted arrest; he fled, but was pursued and killed by the Gentiles. A claims that he merely intended to coerce his opponents into answering his summons to court.<br><i>A</i>. A is fully responsible for the murder of his opponent, for when a Jew falls into the clutches of Gentiles, his life as well as his property is in jeopardy; he can expect from them neither pity, mercy, nor restraint. The Gentiles are happy to hold a Jew in their power; and, especially when commissioned by another Jew, their cruelty is boundless. They consider it entirely legitimate and even praiseworthy to rob, maim, and even murder a Jew. Therefore, a person who delivers a fellow Jew into the hands of Gentiles is directly responsible for all their cruelties. Thus A is to be considered as much a murderer as if he killed his opponent with his own hands. No punishment is too great for him, no penance too harsh, and no manner of self-torture too severe. Let him be flogged and publicly disgraced, let him wander as an exile in foreign lands, let his face become black through fasting and self-torture for a year or two, and seek atonement for his crime. I subscribe to any punishment you may impose upon him, no matter how severe; and I would agree to still sterner measures but not to milder ones.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 214; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 248, margin; Hayyim Or Zarua, <i>Responsa</i> 141; cf. ibid. 25; Mahril, <i>Responsa</i> 86; Weil, <i>Responsa</i> 28; ibid. 111, ibid. 147; Menahem of Merseburg, <i>Nimmukim</i> (61).

B denies that such condition was ever stipulated. Since A's daughter is in possession of the couple's property, may we rely on A's oath.<br><i>A</i>. A, as a relative, can take no oath in a litigation between his daughter and his son-in-law. Nevertheless, B may not force his wife to move to another country. For R.

Q. A owed money to several persons. When B demanded his money from A, the latter admitted the debt but claimed that since he did not possess enough money or valuables to cover all his obligations, he preferred to divide his possessions equitably among his creditors. Since A admits, in court, his debt to B, may the latter force A to repay that debt in full, before he divides his property?<br><i>A</i>. Since A owes money to several persons, and since he owes more than the total value of his possessions, each creditor is entitled to receive an equal share of such possessions irrespective of the amount due him. The debtor, however, may distribute his assets among his creditors in proportion to the amount due to each, before they come to court; such distribution would be irrevocable, and would even constitute a praiseworthy act. Since A is willing so to divide his possessions, no judge can force him to favor one creditor at the expense of the other creditors. However, before receiving his share of A's possessions, movables or immovables, each creditor will have to take a creditor's oath — the same oath that a creditor takes upon collecting his debt from encumbered property.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 219; Am II, 45; Tesh.

Although a creditor acquires a pledge deposited with him to the extent that his responsibility therefor is that of a paid bailee, the pledge itself does not belong to him.

<i>Q</i>. A is heavily encumbered by his overlord with taxes and forced loans. He originally came to settle in T because he had made a settlement with the overlord to pay a certain amount of taxes directly to the latter, and not in partnership with the rest of the community. The community, however, demands that A pay his share of the tax on the community.<br><i>A</i>. If A had originally separated himself from the community with the latter's full knowledge and consent, he need not cooperate with the community in the payment of its taxes; but, if he did not obtain the consent of the community, he had no right to make a separate agreement with the overlord since the custom of the community provides that all Jews be partners in the payment of the taxes. A community has a right to force a rebellious minority in its midst, to obey its customs. Furthermore, the overlord had no right to make a separate agreement with A in violation of the custom he himself had established among the Jews of his town. Such an act on the part of the overlord is not considered "law of the land", but rather constitutes downright robbery. Although according to the Talmud a king may change the customary taxation arrangements of his subjects (B. B. 143a), he is permitted to do so only when he is acting of his own accord, but not when he is urged to do so by some of his subjects. A's objection that it will be prohibitive for him to pay taxes both to the overlord and to the community, is not very serious, for he may explain to the overlord that separating oneself from the community in the payment of taxes is prohibited by our laws, that on this account one becomes involved in quarrels with the Jews of the kingdom, and that henceforth he will refuse to pay his taxes independently of the community. In such matters we are permitted to act with severity even when not directly empowered by the Talmud, as long as we conform to the spirit of the Talmud; for, were a Jew permitted to separate himself from his community, great calamities would often ensue.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 222; Am II, 122; Rashba I, 841; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A and B jointly loaned money to a third party. The latter's friends went surety to A for the loan, since A was the active partner. Subsequently, A was arrested by his overlord and was forced to relinquish the debt and to release the sureties. B summoned A to court demanding his share of the loan. A claimed that his arrest was due to the loan and that he cancelled it under duress. B claims that A was arrested for other reasons, and that the investment was lost through A's own fault.<br><i>A</i>. If A was arrested because of the aforesaid loan only and was forced simply to cancel the debt and release the sureties, he was free from obligation. Relinquishing another person's debts is a form of tort called <i>garmi</i> (damage done indirectly) for which the damager can not be held responsible if he acted under duress. This cancellation of the debt is similar to the burning of another person's notes of indebtedness, which latter act is considered <i>garmi</i>, for the debt itself is not cancelled by the burning of the notes of indebtedness; in our case similarly the obligations of the debtors and the sureties were not cancelled by A's act, even according to the law of the land, since A acted under duress. Were A able to summon the debtor and the sureties before a magistrate of another town, the latter would have held them responsible for the debt in spite of A's cancellation. Therefore, if A will take an oath to the effect that he was arrested solely for the purpose of being forced to cancel that debt, he will be free from obligation. R. Meir adds: You did not write A's answer to B's charge that when B tried to collect his share of the debt, A told the debtors they should not pay anything to B, since he, A, was the sole creditor and they owed nothing to B. The reason for this was that if B had been able to collect something on that debt, were it not for A's interference, A would be held responsible for B's loss, unless A was also forced thus to interfere.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 223; Am II, 157; Mord.

Now, A demands that B pay him back the ten <i>marks</i>, since his investments earned no profits. He further demands that B pay him for the pledges since they were lost through B's failure to return them (after having received his money), which failure constituted a wilful neglect on B's part. B, on the other hand, claims that: a) the money he lent to A belonged to orphans, b) the money was lent to A by a third party, c) he took the pledges because he was the trustee of the orphans, d) he is not responsible for the loss of the pledges since he did not hinder A from taking them away after the debt was paid.<br><i>A</i>. B is free from obligation, and is not required to take an oath to support his claims, for the following reasons: a) The money-lending transaction was legitimate even if it was carried out in accordance with A's version thereof; b) a creditor is not responsible for a loss of pledges through unavoidable accident, if he received such pledges at the time the loan was contracted; c) after A gave ten <i>marks</i> to B as B's share of the profits, A may no longer claim that he had made a mistake, and that ultimately his investments earned no profits.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 224; L. 326.

The Gentile released B and depended upon A for payment. A successfully avoids payment to the Gentile because of an old debt due him from the latter. Since, according to Jewish law, the transaction was not valid and A's indebtedness to B was not legally transferred to the Gentile, A must pay his debt to B. But why should B be permitted to rob the Gentile? Is not robbing a Gentile prohibited?

Since B claims that A and C had undertaken to abide by the decision of the community leaders, and that he merely obeyed such decision, he is free from obligation. Although these leaders were ignorant in the law, their decision was nevertheless binding since A and C had accepted them as judges. The leaders and worthies of a community, because they are generally accepted by the members of their community and are in the same category as the Syrian courts (Git. 23a), form an authoritative court. Should A deny B's claim (that he obeyed the order of the community leaders), B would be free from obligation since a witness supports his claim. Moreover, no oath is exacted from a trustee who claims to have carried out his commission. Even if the mistake of the court became known before B delivered the pledges to C, and B nevertheless obeyed the order of the court, he is free from obligation, for A and C originally agreed to abide by the decision of the community leaders; and the custom is widely accepted throughout our kingdom that whatever obligations a person assumes in the presence of the community leaders become binding and unretractable.

They can inherit no rights from B that he himself did not possess. The division of a house among partners should be executed by experts in one of two ways. a) Each partner should receive a part of the house proportional, in size, to his share while the difference between the value of such part and the money value of his share should be adjusted by the payment or receipt of money. b) Each partner should receive an appropriate part of the house inversely proportional, in size, to its intrinsic value, so that the estimated value of such part be exactly equal to the money value of his share.<br>This Responsum was addressed to Rabbi Hillel and Rabbi Menahem of Würzburg.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 234; Am II, 177; Mord.

According to the opinion of Rashi, the partners may compel A to take the west part of the room; R. Tam, however, thinks that they cannot do so. Since we cannot decide whose opinion should prevail, we must order A and the partners to cast lots; if the east part of the room falls to the partners, they shall gain title to it; but if the east part falls to A, he shall not gain title to it immediately, but whatever person or persons can by force succeed in taking possession of the east part that person or persons shall gain title to it.<br>This Responsum was addressed to R.

Meir answered: In order to obviate the necessity of leaving the matter to be settled by force, I searched for a more practical solution and found that Maimonides in his code ruled that upon the partitioning of a field held in partnership, a partner may insist on receiving his part of the field adjoining his own property, provided that both parts of the field are exactly equal [in fertility or arrangement of irrigation facilities]. Therefore, if B, C, and D, agree to equalize the two parts of the room by adding structures to the western side of the room similar to the ones in the eastern side, they will be entitled to receive as their share the eastern part of the room.

B can not claim undisturbed possession as evidence of title since, deriving his rights from Gentiles, he is in the same category as a Gentile and has no presumptive right of title. B's sons also lack such right, nor do we claim in their favor that perhaps their father bought from A the right to erect his buildings, since they are in the category of "sons of a robber." Since B's sons do not claim that B bought from A in their presence the right to erect his buildings, but merely state that the burghers claimed to have built the tower legally, B's sons must either remove their buildings from the ground in question or come to terms with A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 236; Am II, 180; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 314c; ibid. p. 366d.

B, however, refuses to remove his building, claiming that A's protests are of no avail since the building had been completed long before A protested.<br><i>A</i>. An abutter is not permitted to build a wall within four cubits of his neighbor's windows without the latter's permission. Therefore, B must remove the aforesaid building, for A protested as soon as he learned about its erection. Moreover, should B produce witnesses to the effect that A failed to protest immediately after he learned of the erection of B's building, it would avail B nothing as long as he does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, the right to erect the building. Undisturbed possession in itself is of no legal consequence, unless it be accompanied by a claim of having once legally acquired the disputed right.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 237; Am II, 181; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A well is situated on the boundary line between A's and B's properties, so that one half of the well is situated inside of A's property, and the other half inside of B's property. A erected a partition in the well (to separate the two parts) but placed the partition inside of B's property.<br><i>A</i>. As expressly stipulated in the deed, the partition must be moved to the middle of the well.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 238; Am II, 183.

Siman 239

<i>Q</i>. B's building was contiguous to A's property. The foundation of this building extended two hand-breadths beyond the wall itself. B wanted to build another wall in line with the edge of this foundation, the wall to extend two hand-breadths beyond the existing wall. A protested vigorously claiming that B's property ended at the edge of the wall of the building mentioned above, and that the foundation of such building extended two hand-breadths in his (A's) property.<br><i>A</i>. Since B was in undisturbed possession of the width of the foundation, he was thus in possession of the disputed two hand-breadths of ground along the whole length of the property, and upwards reaching into the sky. Therefore, if B will take an oath to the effect that he did not remove his neighbor's landmark [when the foundation was built], the disputed two hand-breadths of ground will belong to him. Although according to Biblical law no oath is administered in disputes involving real property, such an oath is required by Rabbinic enactment.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 239; Am II, 184; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. B claims that A stopped off a conduit that used to drain off the water from the roofs through A's own property. A denies that such a conduit ever existed, and points out that B himself built a ledge intercepting the alleged route of such conduit.<br><i>A</i>. Since B himself built a ledge blocking off the alleged conduit, he has no cause for action against A, and the latter need take no oath. A person who completely walls up his door leading into an alley and even removes the door posts may no longer reopen such entrance without the consent of the other dwellers in the alley.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 240; Am II, 185; Mord.

Siman 241


<i>Q</i>. B bought from a Gentile woman a house bordering on A's property. B agreed that the woman could remain in the house till the month of <i>Heshvan</i> (October). A and C claim that they were negotiating to buy the house before B appeared on the scene; that A has a partnership in the house since the beams of his house project into the wall of the Gentile's house; that the Gentile owed money to A; that B promised them not to buy the house; that the arbitrators reported to A and C, B's statement to the effect that A and C need not be concerned, and could rely on his word as a Jew that he would not buy the house; that the Gentile gave A and C the keys to her house, and that they opened it, measured the size and noted the arrangement of the rooms, the exits, and the entrances, and locked it, before B bought the house. They, therefore, demand that B transfer the house to them. B avers that he never promised A and C not to buy the house; and that he had negotiated to buy the house long before they did. The Gentile woman claims that A inserted his beams into her wall illegally.<br><i>A</i>. A and C cannot force B to transfer the house to them, for the following reasons: a) B denies having promised A and C not to buy the house; b) if B did make such a promise to A and C, and then broke it he might be called <i>Rasha</i> (wicked) or <i>Abaryana</i> (renegade), but we can not force him to transfer the house to A and C; therefore, no useful purpose will be served by imposing an oath on B regarding such promise; c) although locking a house is considered a valid act of possession, and one may gain title to the property of a Gentile by taking possession thereof (Bechorot 13a), this rule applies only when such an act is accompanied by proper intention by both parties. However, before the two parties agree on the terms of the sale no such intention is possible; therefore, A's locking of the Gentile's house was of no consequence; d) the fact that the Gentile owed money to A does not vest in him the priority rights of an abutter, for, only a creditor who has a mortgage on a house, lives therein, and has a lease thereon so that he cannot be made to move before the year is up has the right of an abutter. Moreover, since A's property borders on that of the Gentile, B may assert: "I have driven away a lion from your neighborhood", and such assertion annuls the priority rights A could have claimed as an abutter, as a creditor, or as a partner; e) B's statement to the arbitrators constituted neither an oath nor a vow, but a mere assurance. Even if we agree with A, who has construed that statement to mean an oath, B may not be forced to transfer his house to A merely because he disregarded his oath. Thus A is not entitled to indemnity. Indeed, B should be fined for his sinful act (breaking his oath), but we do not have the authority to impose penalties. However, you, my teacher, and your community, if you find that a disgraceful breach of conduct was committed, you may impose a proper fine upon B, the money to go to charity. Finally, half of B's wall, upon which the ends of A's beams are resting, belongs to A; for, the presence of such beams is ample proof that the wall was held in partnership by the two neighbors.

Siman 242

The question was again referred to Rabbi Meir who answered: Since the judges did not clearly understand my last statement, I shall explain. If A claims that half of the wall and half of the ground it rests on belongs to him, we uphold his claim since the fact that his beams rest on the wall corroborates his statement, and no witness or witnesses contradict him. A is not required to take an oath, not even a <i>gilgul shebuah</i> (oath of implication) in support of his claim. If A, however, admits that the Gentile woman had built the entire wall on her grounds, but that he subsequently persuaded her to permit his placing of his beams on her wall, no part of the wall belongs to him; for the Gentile merely permitted him to place his beams on her wall, but she gave him no part of the wall itself.
I have considered your inquiry regarding a proper punishment for B who, you claim, is a righteous, reputable and blameless person. He, indeed, must suffer severe punishment in order duly to atone for his sin; for when a person of his character commits a shameful act, he profanes the name of the Lord. However, if B is a scholar, he should not be put under the ban, but should be required to give a certain sum to the charity chest, or for the support of your students, the amount of the fine to be determined by the leaders (of the community).<br>These Responsa are addressed to "our teacher Rabbi Eliezer."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 241–2; Am II, 123; <i>Agudah</i> 21.

<i>Q</i>. The property A left when he died was sufficient to cover but part of his wife's <i>ketubah</i>. The widow claimed A's entire property in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, and refused to allow the use of any part of it to pay for A's burial expenses. Is the widow entitled to her claim?<br><i>A</i>. The widow is under no obligation to pay for her husband's burial. She is entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i> from all of A's property; and if nothing is left to pay for A's funeral expenses, such expenses must be covered by charity funds.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 243; Pr. 176, 964.

<i>Q</i>. A refuses to marry or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow claiming that, because a year has not yet passed since his brother's death, his deep sorrow prevents him from either marrying her or giving her <i>halitzah</i>.<br><i>A</i>. A's temporizing is baseless and useless. Our sages have decreed that three months, and not a year or two, after a person died leaving no children, his brother must either marry the widow or give her <i>halitzah</i>. Therefore, no temporizing is permitted. A should be coerced, either by persuasion or by flagellation, into giving <i>halitzah</i> to the woman immediately. Let Gentiles belabor him till he agrees to do what he is told to do. I should prefer, however, that A be misled or deceived by offers of money till he voluntarily gives her <i>halitzah</i>. Thus the widow may officially forego her claim to her husband's money that is in A's possession, and even bind herself thereto by a <i>kinyan</i>. After the ceremony the widow would still be entitled to collect this money from A, for the court that has a right to inflict corporal punishment on A, has a right to confiscate his property if it be required by considerations of public welfare. I should prefer to practice deception on A rather than inflict flagellation, since the latter might involve great hardship, have very serious consequences, and even cause A to abscond.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 244; Pr. 492; P. 10; Moses Minz, <i>Responsa</i> 10.

<i>Q</i>. A advanced many claims against B. Having no Jewish witnesses to testify on his behalf, he produced Gentiles as witnesses. B consented to admit in evidence the testimony of a certain Gentile; this consent was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. When, however, B felt that the Gentile was perverting the truth — probably having received a bribe — he protested the admission into evidence of the Gentile's testimony.<br><i>A</i>. Since B had accepted the Gentile as a trustworthy witness and had accompanied the acceptance by a <i>kinyan</i>, the testimony of the Gentile was equivalent to that of Jewish witnesses. Therefore B's protest was of no avail.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 245; P. 284; <i>Agudah</i> San. 15; cf. <i>Or Zarua</i> I, 752b.

a) <i>Q</i>. Is a person who reached his majority, permitted to appoint a legal representative to argue his case in court? The Palestinian Talmud (Sanh. 2, 1) definitely implies that a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative.<br><i>A</i>. The statement in the Palestinian Talmud does not necessarily imply that an ordinary person is permitted to appoint a legal representative. It is possible that only a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative, in order to save him the humiliation of appearing before a court having less authority than himself; but an ordinary person may not be permitted to make the appointment. In any case, all are agreed that a levir is not permitted to appoint a legal representative when his brother's widow demands that he fulfill the positive command (of God) to perform the ceremony of <i>halitzah</i> or to marry her. Moreover, a person commits a wrong when he consents to become a legal representative to a levir, thus helping to postpone the fulfillment of this positive command, and injuring the interests of the widow.
b) <i>Q</i>. Is a legal representative permitted to present before the court claims and arguments that will improve his client's case but which he knows to be false?<br><i>A</i>.

A contractor, a worker hired for the completion of a certain task and not hired by the day or week, is not permitted to resign before his task is completed. A scribe, however, is not permitted to resign even though he was hired for a specific period of time, and was thus not classified as a contractor; for the resignation of a scribe involves a definite loss of money to the person who hired him, as a book copied by two scribes is not uniform in appearance and, thus, commands a low price.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 247; L. 123; Mord.

L's husband avers that the garments were deposited with him as security against a debt.<br><i>A</i>. If the garments are not now in the husband's possession, or if they were identified in his possession as L's garments, he must return them to L, for a wife's garments are in the category of objects that are usually lent or rented out, regarding which one may not claim that he has bought them (Sheb. 46b). If no one, however, saw the garments in the husband's possession, we uphold his claim; since if he wanted to lie he could have denied having taken them.

<i>Q</i>. A and B planned to lend money to a Gentile in partnership at the rate of four <i>Heller</i> denarii per pound [per week]. However, A had more money to put in the partnership than B had. They agreed, therefore, that when in the future they would divide the profit, A should first take out of such profit four denarii [per week] per every pound he had invested more than B, and that the remainder should be equally divided between them. When they came to negotiate the loan with the Gentile, however, he asked them that in addition to lending him the money they undertake to feed his horses for a certain period of time. He offered to pay only three <i>Heller</i> denarii per pound [per week] interest, but the liberal compensation he offered for feeding his horses induced them to accept his terms. They agreed, therefore, that at the expiration of the designated period the Gentile pay A and B a certain sum of money, which sum represented payment of the principal and the interest, plus remuneration for feeding the horses. Now B claims that out of his share of the profit from feeding the horses he is paying A four denarii per every pound the latter had invested more than he himself had; and that such payment constituted usury.<br><i>A</i>. The above agreement between A and B is valid. No question of usury is involved. A Jew is permitted to pay interest to another Jew for a loan extended to a third party, as long as the first Jew is not responsible for the repayment of the principal.<br><i>Q</i>. A claims that he gave more feed to the horses than B gave.<br><i>A</i>. A should take an oath as to the amount and value of the feed he has given in excess of that of B, and be entitled to collect this difference. If A gave the extra feed at a time the price of feed was lower than it is at present, A must state under oath whether he had intended to lend feed or the price of feed to B, and be entitled to collect accordingly.<br><i>Q</i>. A claims that he bought four measures of feed from B and paid him for it; that when he came to take it, B told him that he had none and advised him to buy some from another person and charge it to him; and that consequently he bought two measures of feed from another person for thirteen schillings. He now demands two measures of feed plus thirteen schillings from B. B avers that since the original transaction was not binding, because mere payment of money does not legally conclude a sale of movables, he now refuses to enter into such a sale, and owes A only the money received from him.<br><i>A</i>. B must give thirteen schillings and two measures of feed to A, or he would incur severe punishment from Heaven. Although the mere payment of money does not conclude a sale, a person who retracts his word incurs severe punishment from Heaven.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 253–4–5; cf. Hag.

In return for both services A paid the young man's living expenses. Is the lending of the aforesaid money considered a legitimate transaction?<br><i>A</i>. If while the arrangement was made with the young man to rehearse the lessons with A's son in return for receiving his sustenance, the stipulation was made that the young man lend money to A, the transaction is considered usurious, even though A would have been content to pay the young man's living expenses in return for his tutoring alone. The fact that the money was not given as an actual loan, since A was not to be responsible for its loss through unavoidable accident, does not materially change the situation, since the Talmud considers the renting of money a usurious transaction (B. M. 69b). But, if it is true, what you write at the end of your letter, that the young man gave A his money as an outright gift so that he is at liberty, should he so desire, never to return the money to the young man, the transaction is a legitimate one.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 257; Am II, 151; Mord.

However, A cannot return the vessel in the same condition, since he had broken it.

Are we to give credence to L's assertion? Moreover, is a widow permitted to keep valuables she claims to have received from her husband as an outright gift?<br><i>A</i>. If the valuables were not seen in the woman's possession, we must give credence to her assertion, since she could have denied having taken them or could have claimed to have returned them (principle of <i>Miggo</i>). But, since in this case the fact of their being in L's possession is established, L must return the valuables unless she produces witnesses to substantiate her claim.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 268; Am II, 32; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 313d.

Siman 269

<i>Q</i>. What objects are considered "usually lent or rented out" (Sheb. 46b)?<br><i>A</i>. Regarding most books as objects "usually lent or rented out" a difference of opinion exists between Rashi and Rabbenu Tam. Other objects must be considered individually, each one on its own merits.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 269.

Siman 270

<i>Q</i>. A was ready to take an oath denying B's claim. When he noticed, however, that B was going to insert in the oath a denial of a former claim B had had against him, A decided to pay B's present claim in order to avoid taking such an oath. Will A, upon such payment, be free from the obligation of taking an oath, or must he pay both claims before being free from this obligation?<br><i>A</i>. Nowadays a person is required to take an oath whenever he denies any claims made against him, whether such denial is complete or partial, whether the claim involves immovables or movables. Therefore, the problem stated above does not exist nowadays. Let A pay B as much as he wants to pay. If B will put forth further claims against A, the latter must either pay such claims or take an oath. In former days, however, when certain claims if denied required no oath, the Rabbis differed in their opinions whether or not the defendant be required to take an oath regarding an earlier claim, in cases similar to the above.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 270; L. 238.

Siman 271

<i>Q</i>. L claims that her husband is impotent.<br><i>A</i>. The law considers such a claim by a wife to be valid, on the assumption that a woman would not dare present against her husband claims he knows to be false. Nowadays, however, there are many impudent and brazen women, and the above assumption is no longer true. Moreover, in this case there is reason to believe that L is lying since her husband has had children with a former wife. Even though he might have weakened since, we can put no trust in L's words. Therefore, we must not force the husband to grant L a divorce, but we ought to persuade him to do so.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 271; Pr. 947; Mord. Kid. 542; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 7; cf.

<i>Q</i>. Is a trustee of orphans, appointed to his trusteeship by their father, required to take an oath [to the effect that he did not retain anything belonging to the orphans and that he did not willfully damage their interests]?<br><i>A</i>. A trustee appointed by the father of the orphans is not required to take an oath. However, some authorities (<i>Ittur</i>) believe that when such a trustee has been removed by court, because of witnesses testifying to his mismanagement of the affairs of the orphans, he is required to take an oath.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 272; L. 239.

<i>Q</i>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B's property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against "a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?" How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?<br><i>A</i>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it.

Must a court decree be dated, since, otherwise, a creditor who obtains a later decree would be able to enforce his rights thereunder, prior to the creditor who received the former decree.<br><i>A</i>. It is advisable to include the date in a court decree, but not for the reason cited. A creditor, whose bond is dated before the bond of his fellow creditor, should receive a prior lien if execution is to be issued upon real property; but if execution is to be issued upon personal property, the creditor who seizes the property first has a prior lien without regard to the date of his bond. In any case, the date of the court decree is immaterial. Moreover, no undated document is invalid except a divorce.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 281; Pr. 525.

A listened to their arguments, returned to his home town, and sent his decision through a messenger who read it before the litigants. Is A's decision valid?<br><i>A.</i> If A's decision is a correct one, it is binding although A did not conform to the usual procedure of reading the decision personally, while seated, before the standing litigants. The procedure used in reading a court decision does not affect the legality of the decision.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned his father-in-law, B, to court and claimed: 1) that B's father-in-law, C, (A's grandfather), bequeathed twenty-five <i>marks</i> to B's two daughters with the provision that if one daughter died childless, the other should inherit her part, and if the second daughter likewise died childless, the twenty-five <i>marks</i> were to go to C's male heirs; 2) that the money was deposited with B; and 3) that after he, A, had been married to B's daughter for two years, the other daughter died while still a minor. A, therefore, demanded the twenty-five <i>marks</i> from B. B, on the other hand, claimed that he had given the twenty-five <i>marks</i> to A as dowry upon the latter's marriage to his daughter. A, however, claimed that upon receiving his dowry he was not told about the twenty-five <i>marks</i> and that B could not have given him that money since the younger daughter was still alive. To this claim B answered that he expected to give his own money to his younger daughter. He further claims that A's wife has no children yet and, therefore, he, B, cannot give anything to A since in case A's wife dies childless, C's heirs will keep him responsible for the money.<br><i>A</i>. B is under no obligation to A for the following reasons: 1) We believe B's claim that he included the money of his departed daughter in A's dowry, since B could have claimed that his younger daughter gave him her money, and this latter claim would have been irrefutable; 2) the father is the rightful heir of the departed daughter since C's provision for the disposition of his gift in case the daughter die childless is void.<br><i>Q</i>. A claims that he has witnesses who will testify that B took from his (A's) father thirty <i>marks</i>. B claims that he returned to A whatever he had taken from his father.<br><i>A</i>. If the witnesses will testify that B robbed A's father, A should take an oath that B did not as yet return the money to him, and be entitled to collect the thirty <i>marks</i> from B. If, however, B received the money from A's father in a legitimate way, B should take an oath that he had paid all the money he owed to his father, and be free from obligation.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 283–4; Pr. 1017; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 227a.

The punishment should also depend on the high qualifications of the man and the family insulted.

A brought two witnesses, one of whom testified that such was the understanding; the other witness was not sure whether the condition was made at the time of the agreement or subsequent thereto. C and the subscribing two witnesses denied A's allegation that such a condition was made at the time of the agreement. The Rabbis, therefore, decided that A must pay the five <i>marks</i> fine.

Such a transaction is called <i>asmakhta</i> and is not binding since it was not made before an authoritative court.

Should the discussion that follows reveal any just claims A may have against the community, I rely on you not to disclose them to A, lest the community accuse me of encouraging claimants and inciting them against the community thus damaging its interests. It seems, however, that if A could have obtained another position, had he not been engaged by the community of T, and now can no longer obtain that, or a similar, position, the community ought to pay A the wages of an "idle laborer" (i. e. the wages a cantor would be willing to accept for abstaining from practicing his profession for a given period). But, if A is able to obtain another position even now, he has no legal claim against the community, though he has cause for reproof. Should the latter position require more effort than the position with the community of T, if there be also an increase in remuneration commensurate with the increase in effort, the community of T would be free from obligation to A; otherwise, the community of T would have to compensate A for the increase in effort.

Since A did not repay the debt in B's presence, and since his creditor was a Gentile, who has held B directly responsible for such debt, and could still have collected it from B through the courts of the land, A was still under obligation to free B from his suretyship.

Moreover, B must leave this dispute also to C and D for arbitration. He can not press this charge separately without transgressing his oath. On the other hand, since people customarily and automatically reply "your father" whenever someone vilifies their father, B deserves greater punishment than A since he was the first to use vile language. In any event, both A and B should appear before a scholar seeking atonement for their sin of having vilified the dead.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 298.

Although A's vow was made in the form of <i>Asmakta</i>, it is binding since all promises to a holy cause, even when made in the form of <i>Asmakta</i>, are binding.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 299, 300; Pr. 493, 494; L. 211, 212; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i> p. 337b.

Siman 301

<i>Q</i>. A sent ten pounds to B to deliver to A's Gentile creditor. The Gentile refused to accept the money. Subsequently, robbers broke into B's home and took away this money. A claims that B did not hide the money properly and, therefore, was guilty of willful neglect. B avers that he kept the money in a good hiding place in his room, in the same place where he usually kept his own money, but that it was taken from him by force.<br><i>A</i>. If B will take an oath in support of his claim, he will be free from obligation, unless he admits having used the money. In the latter case he would be responsible for the loss of the money no matter under what circumstances it was lost. If B, however, did not use A's money for his own benefit, his manner of guarding it was sufficient. Although the only safe place in which to keep money is in the ground — money being unidentifiable, more thieves are after it, and they take greater chances in stealing it than any other valuables — B was not required to keep A's money in the ground, since it was not given to him for safekeeping, for he expected to hand it over to A any day upon demand.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 301.

Siman 302

<i>Q</i>. A claims that B misappropriated money from their partnership. B denies A's claim.<br><i>A</i>. If B will take the "partners' oath", he will be free from obligation. Although after a partnership is dissolved, an ex-partner is no longer required to take the "partners' oath", in this case, since B must take oaths in support of his other claims as against A, he must include an "entailed oath" regarding the above claim.<br><i>Q</i>. B's former partners claim that the Gentile who seized from B valuables that belonged to the partnership, has seized them, as the Gentile claimed, in payment of money B owed him. B denies having owed anything to the Gentile.<br><i>A</i>. Although Gentiles are robbers, and their excuses for seizing property from Jews are not to be taken seriously —ordinarily such a claim would not require an oath of denial on the part of B — in this case, however, B must take an "entailed oath". On the other hand, if B should admit that he owed money to the Gentile, he would have to pay this money to his former partners.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 302–3.

Siman 304

A claims that his father-in-law, B, alienated his wife's affections and also withheld his money. B claims: a) when he gave his daughter to A he stipulated the condition that A deposit sixty pounds with him; b) A agreed to this condition and gave the money to B and to his daughter stipulating that should A overindulge in food and drink or generally squander his money, he and his daughter would withhold the money until A bettered his habits; c) this agreement was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>; d) that A drew up a bond to that effect which bond is still in B's possession; e) A abstracted the sixty pounds from his wife, and therefore she refuses to live with him, or to give him money that was originally designated for buying her ornaments. A disclaims signing such bond, and denies having squandered any money or being guilty of any improper behavior. He denies having abstracted the money from B's daughter for the purpose of squandering it, but says that he had taken it only because he was afraid lest B rob him of his money and deprive him of his wife, as B had done with his other sons-in-law.<br>A further claims that B turned him over to a wicked Gentile who almost murdered him. A, therefore, demands that B be punished. B, on the other hand, gives a different account of the affair. He says that a Gentile, a violent man, placed a <i>mark</i> (8 ounces) of gold in pledge with him; and he, in turn, deposited it with A. When A wanted to leave town, B fearing lest the Gentile bring false accusations against him upon failing to produce the pledge, demanded that A return the gold <i>mark</i> to him. A invited B to go to the Gentile, and promised to free B from obligation to the Gentile. The Gentile, however, refused to listen to A and warned B that he (the Gentile) would collect double its value should his gold <i>mark</i> be lost. B, therefore, grabbed A by the clothes and said to the Gentile that his gold <i>mark</i> was in A's possession. The Gentile, then, angered by A's words made extreme threats against A. Nevertheless, A suffered no bodily injury nor any loss of money on account of this incident.<br><i>A</i>. If the agreement was made at the time of the betrothal, it is binding on A. At a betrothal, verbal agreements are binding, and whenever verbal promises are binding — as in charity-gifts, Temple-gifts, or vows — they are binding even when made in the form of conditional promises which are usually classified as <i>asmakhta</i>. If the money in question was part of the dowry given by B to his daughter, the agreement is certainly binding on A. Moreover, even if the agreement was entered into after the betrothal, it would also be binding if it was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before the notables of the community, who normally constitute an authoritative court.<br>Regarding A's complaint that B informed against him, A is not entitled to compensation since he suffered no damages. As to punishing B for complaining to a Gentile against A, I have no authority to impose fines. The community, however, has the right to impose fines, and also to punish a member for improper acts committed by him. Such fines are to be imposed in accordance with the status of the individuals involved.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 304; P. 219, 220; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 181a.

<i>Q</i>. A's brothers were young when their father died, and A managed his father's estate together with his own business. One day A was arrested for purposes of extortion by the prefect of Ulrich and the overlord of Erstein. In order to extricate himself and be released by them, A cancelled a debt of three hundred and fifty <i>marks</i> that was due to the estate from the duke of Brunswick, and freed the sureties of this debt. Thereupon A was released. A's brothers now demand that he should compensate them for the loss of their share of the duke's debt.<br><i>A</i>. A person is not permitted to buy his freedom with money belonging to others. The only exception to this rule is when a poor man hands over to robbers a valuable object deposited with him for safekeeping, in which case the poor man is free from obligation since we must assume that the robbers came expressly for the purpose of obtaining this valuable object (B.K. 117b). When the bailee himself is a wealthy man, however, we are not justified in making such an assumption. Since A is a wealthy man, he must pay to his brothers their share of the actual value of the duke's debt at the time it was cancelled. This law would apply even if it were known that the duke had plotted against A together with the overlords; the law, therefore, surely applies now when, according to the statement of the brothers, the duke was not associated with the overlords in their plot against A. A must also pay to his brothers their share of the interest that had accumulated on the debt before it was cancelled, even though the interest had not been made part of the principal by that time. A, however, must only pay their share of that interest which the duke would have definitely consented to add on to the principal; since the practice is for the debtor to promise a large rate of interest, but when the accumulated interest is to be added on to the principal, the debtor demands, and usually receives, a reduction of the amount of the accumulated interest. This reduction is an established custom and must be reckoned with.<br><i>Q</i>. A deceived the overlord and paid him one hundred <i>marks</i> less than what the overlord thought he received. A now claims that these one hundred <i>marks</i> belong exclusively to him, and that he gave this money to his brothers by mistake. The brothers, however, aver that A paid them their rightful share of the money.<br><i>A</i>. A may not claim that he paid the money to his brothers by mistake, especially so since according to talmudic law the brothers are fully entitled to their share of the money A saved by deception.<br>The case was then referred again to R. Meir thus: You, my illustrious teacher, have ruled that since A was a rich man he had to pay to his brothers their share of the actual value of the debt that had been due from the duke.<br>A, however, claims that with reference to the demands made on him by the overlords, he cannot be considered a rich man, for when he was arrested the lords demanded a ransom of thirty thousand<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">According to the question thirty thousand … was demanded from A, and according to the answer, one thousand <i>marks</i>.</i> (schillings?). His captors enumerated all his investments in great detail in order to prove that he was in a position to pay such ransom. The investments thus enumerated included those that belonged to the estate. A claims that he was arrested because his managing of the estate made him appear a rich man, and because the duke was anxious to cancel the above debt; therefore, he should not be held responsible for the cancellation of this debt. Moreover, the duke died in the meantime. Had A not cancelled the debt, it would have been absolutely worthless anyway, now that the debtor was dead.<br><i>A</i>. The fact that the overlords demanded one thousand <i>marks</i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">According to the question thirty thousand … was demanded from A, and according to the answer, one thousand <i>marks</i>.</i> from A does not prove that he was seeking the money of the estate, for when a person is thrown into prison for purposes of extortion, his rapacious captors first demand a huge sum as ransom, ten times his capital, without knowledge of the actual value of his assets. This is done in order to frighten him, force him to come to terms quickly, and pay a high ransom. Moreover, we must assume that A's captors would not commit such an outrage against the bishop and the burghers merely to cancel a debt of a faithless debtor who had already lost his credit. Your contention that A's captors were intent on cancelling the above debt in order that the overlord should not be called a defaulter, is indeed untenable. The duke did not mind becoming known as a thief, a robber, a highwayman, and an extortionist; why should he object to the appellation defaulter? It is incredible. Therefore, A must pay his brothers their share of the actual value of the above debt at the time it was cancelled.<br>Regarding the deception A practiced on the overlord by having paid him a lesser amount than what the overlord thought he had received, I have written that A must share the amount thus saved with his partners. This decision I based on the ruling (of the Tosephta, B.M. 8, 25): "If publicans relinquish the tax of one partner, the other partners share the benefits thereof." You disagreed with my decision, however, and attempted to draw a distinction between the case of the publicans, who knowingly bestowed a benefit on the partner, and our case where the overlord was unconscious of the fact that the partner was deriving a benefit from him. However, your reasoning serves only to strengthen my ruling instead of weakening it. If a direct gift by the publicans to one partner must be shared by the other partners, then money which was not a gift to A and was not meant as a benefit directly and exclusively for him, must surely be shared with his partners. Moreover, a silent partner is entitled to an equal share in the profits earned by the industry and cunning of the active partner. Although A alone took the risk and braved the danger of severe punishment, he must share the benefits with his partners.<br>These Responsa were addressed to Rabbi Samuel and Rabbi Shemariah.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Sinai VI (1943) 13 no. 417; Cr. 305–6.

<i>Q</i>. A was deputy in lending B's money to a Gentile upon interest. Thus A took the money from B and gave it to the Gentile in B's name; the Gentile's friends went surety to B. Subsequently, the Gentile, a violent man, concocted false charges against A and ordered him to repay both the principal and the interest to B out of his own pocket. The Gentile also told B that A would pay his debt for him. A, therefore, brought the principal and the interest to B. The latter, however, being a religious man, refused to accept the interest lest it be considered usury from Jew to Jew.

<i>Q</i>. A and his son-in-law B were partners in a house. A leased his half to B for an indefinite period till the latter's death, at a fixed annual rental. Subsequently, A wanted to sell his part, but B objected. The case was brought before R. Meir who sustained B's objection. Now B is seeking to sell his half and also his right to a fixed rental for the other half. A, however, objects to a sale by B of the right to a fixed rental claiming that he had originally leased his half to B for a low rental in order that B and his family live therein and enjoy it themselves, but not for the purpose of selling it to another. Is A's objection valid? Also, please note that A's daughter, B's wife, was dead, but the children she bore to A are living; does the fact that B's wife is dead prejudice B's rights? Moreover, B claims, and witnesses support his claim, that the agreement of lease was reached between A and B after a sharp quarrel which followed their buying of the property. Thus the lease was not a gift of love [in which case the purpose of the gift must be taken into consideration], but was rather the outcome of litigation and compromise and was, therefore, of the nature of a sale. B further states that should A's objection be sustained in court, he would sell his own half of the house and would dwell in the other half, or would rent out the latter half and would use the rent for his sustenance. Please further inform me, on the other side of this sheet, as to what was done in the case of the widow from Spiers and her two Levite levirs. Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel.<br><i>A</i>. We are not to take into consideration A's purpose in leasing his half of the house to B, for various reasons. a) When B sells his right to a fixed rental to a third party, he benefits from such sale as much as he would have benefited from living in the house himself. b) Since B has lived in the rented half of the house for a long time, the transaction of the lease is by now complete so that A's original purpose in leasing it is no longer of any consequence. c) A transaction of sale, lease, or even gift, is concluded by two parties, being the result of a meeting of both minds and, therefore, such transaction is not conditioned by the special purpose or intent of one party when such purpose or intent was not in the mind of the other party. Therefore, even if B had no surviving children from A's daughter, the validity of the lease would not have been affected. d) According to your letter, the lease was not motivated by feelings of kindliness, but was a purely business transaction. R. Meir adds: Regarding the widow mentioned above, I shall order that my Responsum pertaining thereto be copied for your benefit.<br>The answer bears the superscription: "To my teacher Rabbi Asher."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 315; Am II, 174.

In practice, we do not permit the baking of bread together with cheese or meat-pies; but if it had been done so, we do not prohibit the eating of such bread with meat or cheese. Onion baked in the same oven with forbidden meat, may not be eaten, since the odor of onion definitely has substance and absorbs from the forbidden meat. We, however, are permitted to eat (on Passover) unleavened bread that was baked in the same oven with leavened bread, since we find no mention (in the Talmud) of a problem regarding the odor of two types of bread.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am I, 68; Pr. 25, 26, 27; Hag.

<i>Q</i>. B bought property from a Gentile which bordered on A's property. Before paying for it, B, to acquire possession, did some digging in the Gentile's yard in the presence of witnesses. After B did so, but before he had paid the money to the Gentile, A constructed apertures for windows in his wall facing the property. Did A acquire rights to window lights?<br><i>A</i>. In city property digging is not considered a valid act of possession. Likewise A did not acquire any rights to window lights since a Gentile does not renounce his rights to his property before he receives the money, and the Gentile's property was, therefore, not (<i>res nullis</i>) ownerless. However, before paying money to the Gentile, let B perform a valid act of possession (such as locking a door, fixing or breaking part of the fence, etc.); otherwise A will acquire rights to window lights during the interval between the paying of the money and B's taking formal possession, since during such interval the Gentile's property will be <i>res nullis</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 63–64; Pr. 28–29; L. 338; Mord. ibid.

In France such bread is not eaten by Jews; even the sale of such bread to a Gentile is prohibited, lest the latter resell it to a Jew.

<i>Q</i>. Before her death, Leah, in the presence of witnesses, said: "All my possessions shall go to B and C except what I have already given to charity." After her death, B and C found some of her possessions in A's hands. They demanded these possessions from A who, in turn, claimed that Leah gave them to him as a gift <i>mortis causa</i> before she gave anything to B and C.<br><i>A</i>. If, while making the gift to A, Leah indicated that she was making such a gift in fear of approaching death, then her final words, giving everything to B and C, prevail, since she probably changed her mind regarding her gift to A. A, then, must return the property to B and C. But, if Leah made no mention of death when she gave some of her possessions to A, then such a gift is in the category of a "sick man's gift of part of his property" (Baba Batra 151b) which requires a <i>kinyan</i> (formal act of possession). Since in this case, there was a <i>kinyan</i> (the property was in A's possession at the time of the gift), the property belongs to A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 206; Pr. 34; L. 344; Tesh.

If A claims that his horse was not a stolen horse and that the Gentile took it away unjustly, or that he (A) had no knowledge that it was a stolen horse, he is not responsible (since we cannot rely on the Gentiles' word).

When C wanted to leave the city, A complained to the judge,<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Probably a Gentile judge.</i> who retained C's money until he would appear before the Jewish court and comply with its decision. B then interposed in C's behalf, became surety for him, took pledges from A (and, probably from C) and promised A by solemn hand-clasp that should C fail to appear in court and to comply with its decision, B would return the pledges to A. A believes he has witnesses to this effect, and demands the pledges from B. B, however, claims that he only guaranteed that C would return to the city before a certain date, that C did come to the city before that date, and that he (B) was thereby released from his obligation.<br><i>A</i>. If A, through the testimony of his witnesses, can prove his claim regarding B's promise by solemn hand-clasp, then B must fulfill his promise, since promises made by solemn handclasp must be fulfilled. But, if A has no witnesses, B is free from obligation and does not even have to take an oath.

<i>Q</i>. Several Jews lent twenty-one pounds to the dean (<i>Dechant</i>), the overlord of the Jews of the city, on condition that he repay them thirty pounds. The dean asked the Jewish community to go surety from him and pay his creditors the thirty pounds, when the next payment of the taxes would be due. The community leaders agreed and gave a writ of indebtedness, bearing their signatures, for thirty pounds to A and B. The dean was deposed before the next payment of the taxes became due and the community was faced with the loss of this money. The community, therefore, refuses to pay the nine pounds interest to the creditors, claiming that since the community became responsible for the original debt contracted by the dean, the payment of the nine pounds, in addition to the twenty-one pounds borrowed by the dean, would constitute usury.<br><i>A</i>. Since the creditors settled the interest on the dean as a loan, the dean became obligated to pay his creditors the full thirty pounds, which obligation was governed by the law of the country. The community leaders took over the dean's obligations in the presence of the three parties involved in the transaction, and became obligated to pay thirty pounds to the creditors. Moreover, the community is responsible for the full amount because its leaders went surety for the dean. The suretyship is binding in this case for two reasons: a) Although the suretyship was established after the debt was contracted (and should be invalid unless accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>) the creditors did not free the dean from his obligations until the community leaders went surety for him; b) suretyship established by community leaders is comparable to one made before a Jewish court and is binding even without a <i>kinyan</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 188; Pr. 38; Mord.

A Jew should be ransomed even against his express will, and be charged with the expenses incurred. A captive in the hands of Gentiles is exposed to ruthless treatment and incessant flogging, and his very life is in danger. Therefore, anyone who effects the ransom of a Jew is praiseworthy and is entitled to the expenses incurred. Moreover, Jews threatened by a common danger may force one another to contribute of their means to the measures that will free them of that danger.

The removal of the ban against settlement by waiver is accepted by the communities as legally binding, although, in talmudic law, rights in real property cannot be waived or relinquished unless the waiver be accompanied by a formal act of possession.

<i>Q</i>. A often strikes his wife. A's aunt, who lives at his home, is usually the cause of their arguments, and adds to the vexation and annoyance of his wife.<br><i>A</i>. A Jew must honor his wife more than he honors himself. If one strikes one's wife, one should be punished more severely than for striking another person. For one is enjoined to honor one's wife but is not enjoined to honor the other person. Therefore, A must force his aunt to leave his house, and must promise to treat his wife honorably. If he persists in striking her, he should be excommunicated, lashed, and suffer the severest punishments, even to the extent of amputating his arm. If his wife is willing to accept a divorce, he must divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 81; cf. Cr. 291.

<i>Q</i>. Leah, a married woman, borrowed money from her father to buy herself clothes. Leah's father demands the money from A, Leah's husband. The latter, however, refuses to pay his wife's debt.<br><i>A</i>. If Leah bought herself clothes in accordance with the rank of his, or her, family and borrowed the money from her father as a personal loan, A must pay that debt. But, if Leah's father gave her money and hoped that A would repay him, A is free from the obligation of repayment. Even in the former case, if A claims that his father-in-law owed him an equal sum of money, he (A) is under no obligation to pay, but must take an oath to support his claim.

<i>Q</i>. A became B's surety to a Gentile. One of the stipulations of the surety agreement was that if B would not pay his debt before a specified date, B would have to pay for A's meals until B paid his debt. [This was the custom of the land with reference to sureties]. B did not pay his debt on time. Meanwhile A ate extravagantly in C's house at B's expense.<br><i>A</i>. Jews who are sureties, are kind to their debtors and eat moderately at their expense. Moreover, A should have had pity on B who was just released from prison, and should not have dealt ruthlessly with him. Therefore, B must pay C the price of moderate meals, and the rest C is to collect from A.

A claims: a) that Leah lent him the money without any security; b) that he was supposed to lend it as he saw fit; c) that the clothes he deposited with Leah were deposited for safe-keeping only, because he was angry with his mother-in-law, and not as security for the loan; d) that he lent the money to others without security, and e) that his debtors failed to repay the loans.<br><i>A</i>. Leah shoud swear that she made a condition with A to lend the money only if adequately secured.

A made no payment on the date due after the extension; B, therefore, claims that the pledge became forfeited. A denies having said, "Take formal possession.……henceforth".<br><i>A</i>. Usually a statement, such as A is alleged to have made, is classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is not binding.

<i>Q</i>. B, C and D with the help of D's father, A, lent money to a Gentile on a pledge that was worth less than the amount of the loan. The Gentile, therefore, put up Gentile sureties for the entire loan. A, originally, agreed to negotiate with the Gentile on condition that he (A) be free from any responsibility should B, C and D sustain a loss through his intervention even though it be as a result of his wilful neglect. Subsequently, A wrote to B and C to return the pledge, and the latter did so. Meanwhile, one of the sureties showed A and D a letter signed by B and C instructing them to release the sureties. Thereupon, they released the sureties. B and C claim that the letter was forged and demand their money from D.<br><i>A</i>. D had no right to release the sureties until he was absolutely certain of B's and C's instructions. He was not to rely on a letter nor on any signature. Although the sureties were still legally responsible for the payment of the debt until released by B and C, D's release afforded the Gentiles an excuse to evade payment. Since A cannot be held responsible, D must make good B's and C's losses, the amount of which is to be evaluated by the court (not the face value of the loan since it was a bad debt and not worth its face value). If, however, B and C returned the pledge to the Gentile after the release of the sureties by D, though they had no knowledge of such release, the loss of the pledge is to be borne by them <i>pro rata</i>.

<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle "the law of the land prevails" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: "The law of the land prevails".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered "law of the land" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty.

<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A "in his work"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him "in his work."<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the "officers" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the "treasurers" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the "treasurers" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the "officers" directly because of the "lien of R. Nathan" (garnishment). But, if the "officers" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the "officers." k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him "in his work." Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of "the lien of R. Nathan." Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the "treasurers", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the "treasurers" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the "treasurers."<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

The Jews, B, C, D, and E, who were summoned to testify under oath as to A's identity, were threatened with confiscation of their property, if they refused to tell the truth. They, therefore, admitted that A was a convert, and avoided the taking of a false oath.

Now A demands that B, C, D, and E make good the loss that befell him owing to their testimony.<br><i>A</i>. B, C, D, and E must repay A for his losses sustained because of their testimony. Their testimony involved A's life, and their duty was to disregard the possible monetary loss to themselves and save A's life, even though it would involve the taking of an apparently false oath. Under duress one is permitted to swear to a statement which is apparently false and, then, modify that statement in one's thoughts so that it is no longer false; or one may completely nullify the false oath by a whispered statement. Many Jews resort to this practice whenever they are forced by their overlords to take an oath that they will not move out of the overlord's town.<br>R.

<i>Q</i>. At first all able-bodied men among the Jews, whether rich or poor, took their turn in guarding the gates and walls of the town in which they lived. A rich Jew would often be exempted from the duty by the town officials. Later, the Jewish community and the town officials agreed that the community pay a certain amount of money yearly to take the place of personal service. Must the rich and poor be taxed equally for this purpose?<br><i>A</i>. Although the payment of money takes the place of personal service, the burden of which was shared equally by the poor and the rich, the community should apportion the taxes (to pay for this service) among its members in proportion to their wealth. For the personal service was administered by Gentile town-officials whose acts did not conform to talmudic law, and who often released the rich altogether and put the burden on the poor. Now that the Jewish community has to pay in money for the guarding of the gates, the cost must be distributed justly, i. e. in accordance with talmudic law. Moreover, it became an accepted custom in all communities (tantamount to a law) that when the guarding of the gates is done by the Jews themselves, then every Jew must take his turn regardless of his financial standing. But when, occasionally, a community comes to an agreement with its city officials to pay a special tax in place of the personal service, this tax is apportioned among the members of the community in proportion to their wealth.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 104; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A and B, who lived in the territory of one lord, lent money on a partnership basis. Without the permission of his lord, A moved away into the territory of another lord. His former lord became angry and said to B: "I shall help you to collect your part of the loans, but not A's part." May B retain for himself the part of the loan which he will collect?<br>A. B has a right to dissolve the partnership without A's consent if the continuation of the partnership will cause him a loss of money. Therefore, if B, before he collected his part of the loans, expressly stated that he was going to collect only his share, then he may keep whatever he has collected. But, if he made no such statement, he must share the money he has collected with A.<br>This Responsum was addressed to R. Haim.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 105; Mord. B. K. 181; Hag.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that his assets, equal to forty <i>marks</i>, for which the community demands a tax, are not taxable.<br><i>A</i>. The decisions on questions of taxation are dependent more on custom than on talmudic law. The following rule is generally accepted by the communities: In any tax dispute between an individual and the community, the latter first collects the tax and then goes to court. Therefore, even before the tax is collected, the community is considered to be in possession of the tax-money, and the burden of proof falls upon the individual. This is not only an accepted custom, but also good talmudic law, and is operative even in a new community where there are no established customs. But if the community in question has a different custom, that custom prevails, though it be at variance with talmudic law.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

If there are no Israelites, women and children are called up in their place.

Since according to the law of the land a creditor may collect the entire debt from one surety, even where there are other sureties, and since in such a case the law of the land must prevail, the Gentile was entitled to collect his debt from B.

<i>Q</i>. In order to be entitled to her <i>ketubah</i>, a widow must take an oath that she did not steal, retain, or use any of her husband's property in any manner not specifically permitted by her husband. It is, however, only natural for a wife, during her marital status, to donate small sums of her husband's money (to relatives or to charity) without the husband's knowledge. Of such money, she usually keeps no account, and is not in a position to remember each donation. How, then, can a widow take this oath without violating her conscience?<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. The community wedding-hall borders on an alley into which the back doors of many houses open. The leaders of the community desire to open a door leading into the alley. They claim that part of the alley belongs to the community and that a door once led from the wedding-hall into the alley. The inhabitants of the alley, through their representative, deny that the community has any rights there, and introduce as evidence a bill of sale, countersigned by the leaders of the community, which reads: "A (a former resident there) sold to B his house and his part of the alley which borders on the community wedding-hall." Thus the leaders of the community admitted, by countersigning the bill of sale, that the alley belongs to the people who live in the houses around it, and that even though the wedding-hall borders on it, the community possesses no rights in the alley.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The wording of this Responsum is quite obscure and it is difficult to reconstruct the question. The interpretation given above seems to me to be near the truth; it is based on the readings of the old Prague edition.</i><br><i>A</i>. The leaders of the community may not open any doors in the wedding-hall leading into the alley, even though they certainly have rights there, since a door that had been completely closed may not be reopened; and no new door may be opened in an alley without the permission of the inhabitants there. On the other hand, the evidence produced by the inhabitants of the alley is worthless; for leaders of a community sign a bill of sale as judges and not as witnesses; and according to the Talmud (Ket. 109a), judges sign a document without reading it and, therefore, are not responsible for its contents.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 118.

<i>Q</i>. For many years the Jews of the entire kingdom paid their taxes to the king collectively.

But the communities of the rest of the kingdom still demand the regular taxes from the Jews of the territory presented to the king's son.<br><i>A</i>. The Jews of the entire kingdom became partners in the collective payment of their taxes for the reason that they were all the king's subjects and under obligation to pay their taxes to him. But, as soon as the Jews of the ceded territory ceased to be under the obligation of paying taxes to the king, the condition for the forming of the partnership no longer existed for them, and they could withdraw from the partnership (without the consent of the Jews of the rest of the kingdom). Therefore, if the king has given the entire income of the territory to his son, the Jews of that territory are under no obligation to their former associates. If, however, the king gave the territory itself to his son, but reserved the income to himself for a certain period of time, those Jews should continue to pay the taxes together with the Jews of the rest of the kingdom for that period of time.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

The betrothal of a woman in the presence of a single witness, is void. We do not require that she receive a divorce, for the mere sake of strictness, since such an act would bar her from marrying a person of priestly lineage. Nor are we apprehensive of a spreading report to the effect that the woman was betrothed, since such report would also include the information that the betrothal took place in the presence of a single witness, thus automatically nullifying the effect of the report. If it was originally reported, however, that a bona fide betrothal took place, and later it became known that the betrothal took place in the presence of a single witness, a divorce would be required, if we did not deliberately cancel false reports.

<i>Q</i>. A left two daughters, one of whom is married. May his widow collect money for her sustenance from the possessions of A's married daughter?<br><i>A</i>. A's married daughter must support his widow, or pay her the <i>ketubah</i> only from the valuables she inherited from A, but not from any gifts she received from him during his life, unless such gifts were made <i>causa mortis</i>.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

<i>Q</i>. A demands from B money (one <i>Mina</i>, Pr.) he owes him. B claims he paid the debt to A's wife. A says: "I gave you the money and I want you to pay it back to me".<br><i>A</i>. If a depositary hands over his deposit to another watchman whom the owner of the deposit usually trusts with his valuables, that depositary is free from obligation. Therefore, if A permits his wife to take part in the management of his business, B must take an oath that he gave the money to A's wife, and be free from obligation.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 225; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A and B extended a loan and received a pledge as security. The pledge remained in A's possession. A was arrested by his lord who seized his property, including the pledge. He finally agreed to pay his lord a certain sum, in consideration of which he was set free and the pledge was returned to him. He demands that B pay him part of the redemption price. B, however, says: "My lord exercises authority over your lord, and if you had waited a little, my lord would have compelled your lord to return the pledge."<br><i>A</i>. B must pay A as much as he (B) benefited by A's redeeming the pledge; i. e., as much as B would have paid to obtain the pledge immediately without necessitating the intervention of his lord.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

<i>Q</i>. A wife refused to have conjugal relations with her husband for a long time, with the result that she lost her <i>ketubah</i> according to Mishnaic law (M. Ket. 5, 7). She repented and wanted to resume marital relations with her husband, but the latter refused. Must he pay for her sustenance?<br><i>A</i>. When the woman lost her rights to the money she was entitled to under the <i>ketubah</i> she also lost her other rights enumerated therein, and her husband is under no obligation to support her any longer.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 228, 946; Rashba I, 861; Hag.

<i>Q</i>. A lent money to B receiving a pledge as security thereof. He stipulated at the time that he be not held responsible for the pledge in case of loss. Is A responsible if the pledge was lost through his wilful neglect?<br><i>A</i>. A is not responsible. Although a creditor is in the category of a paid watchman regarding the pledges he receives as security, he is not even in the category of an unpaid watchman, if he renounces his responsibility thereto; and he is not responsible even though the security be lost through his wilful neglect.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 229; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. Leah loathes her husband and demands a divorce. Her father who did not, as yet, give the dowry to her husband, handed the dowry over to Leah. Is the father's act justified?<br><i>A</i>. Leah's father was justified in his act for a number of reasons: a) A woman who loathes her husband and demands a divorce is entitled to collect from her husband everything that is left of her dowry. There is no doubt, therefore, that she may retain such dowry. b) R. Jacob Tam took into consideration the fact that a father promises a dowry to his daughter in the expectation that she will live with her husband. He, therefore, ruled that a husband whose wife died before he collected her dowry, can no longer collect it. The same principle applies to our case. c) If a man seizes the property of a debtor for the benefit of a single creditor while the debtor owes money to other creditors, such seizure is of no avail, and the other creditors may take away said property. But, if the man who seized the property hands it over to the creditor for whose benefit he seized it, the act is valid and the other creditors can do nothing about it. In our case, too, Leah already received the money from her father.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 230; Mord. Ket. 290; cf. Hag. Maim., <i>Ishut</i> 14, 20.

<i>Q</i>. R. Moses, the plaintiff, was not present when the defendants, the Jewish inhabitants of Quedlinburg, took an oath in order to nullify the testimony of R. Moses' single supporting witness; must they take the oath again in the presence of R. Moses?<br><i>A</i>. If the oath has been legally administered by a proper person (who is related neither to R.

<i>Q</i>. While A was absent in a foreign country, his wife borrowed money for her sustenance.

If A claims that the leaders of the community sold or gave to him the right to build the bath-house and if he has proof that they did not object to it for a while, after its construction and operation, he may continue to operate it, since the inconvenience is not so great, as it is being operated only once a week and the odor is mild.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 233.

Q. Some of the water from A's roofs used to drain into the Synagogue courtyard. Subsequently, A opened a spout, for the purpose of draining the water off his roof, which spout extended into the synagogue courtyard and thus all the water from A's roof was poured into the courtyard. The members of the community objected to this.<br><i>A</i>. A must remove his spout.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 236.

One-eighth of the property is large enough to form a "usable unit."<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Isaac b.

Therefore, regarding the greater value of some parts of said property because of positional advantages, the size of each part should be, upon partitioning, inversely proportional to its value, thus equalizing the value of each part. As regard the greater value of some parts because of artificial advantages, the heir receiving the more valuable part should pay the difference, in money, to the heir receiving the less valuable part, for with the money he receives the latter may so improve his part so as to have all the advantages the former has in his part.<br><i>A</i>.

But, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A's arguments, A would have had to swear and be able to recover, or swear and be free from obligation, and now the case is that the oath has either been transferred to B, or that now B may collect without taking an oath, the representative is free from obligation, since the damage to A's interests is not clear and remains problematical, as no one can be sure that A would have taken the required oath. However, if the case is such that had the representative pleaded A's arguments, A would be free from obligation and would not be required to take an oath, and now B collects from A without being required to take an oath, the representative is guilty of willful neglect.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 157; Pr. 242; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A drew up a legal document in which he used the following words: "Effective as of today, but to be executed after our (meaning himself and his wife, L) deaths, our daughter R shall inherit an equal share with her brothers, those already born and those that might be born, in whatever will remain of my estate." After A's death, his children and his widow, L, interpreted the document to mean that A had appointed L trustee over his estate. When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement.<br><i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B's part of her share) immediately, while B's two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L's death.<br>Although the brothers are entitled to manage R's share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L's death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <i>ketubah</i>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R's share. R may not claim that her father has made her an outright gift, free of any lien or obligation, since A did not intend to give R a greater share than that of his sons.

L's trustee claimed that L's property which she had given to her husband, had been given only to gratify him, but had not been intended as an outright gift. Therefore, this property had belonged to L; and she gave it to her mother by right.<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. We are sorry to trouble you about a case that has already been decided upon by the authoritative court of Rabbi Aaron. But the litigants are stubborn and troublesome, and we are forced to solicit your opinion. Two witnesses testify that, before his death, A's father instructed his wife to give thirty pounds to each one of his sons. She did not protest although he left her only a small piece of ground. A demands his thirty pounds. He also claims that, upon his marriage, his mother promised his wife, by solemn hand-clasp, to help him financially as long as she has a penny left, and that his mother took ten pounds from him. A's mother, on the other hand, denies that her husband told her to give money to her sons; she further denies having taken the ten pounds from A, or having promised anything to A's wife. Moreover, she claims to have spent more than thirty pounds on A, since she reared him, and since she educated him up to the age of thirty. She, therefore, demands her <i>ketubah</i> from the remainder of the money A's father left. Finally, the mother claims that she was sued by all the heirs in the court of R. Aaron, that the court decided in her favor, and that she still has the written decision.

Siman 246

<i>A</i>. No court is allowed to review the decisions of another court; therefore, the decision of R. Aaron must prevail. But, since A claims that at the time of the first trial the heirs had no reliable witnesses to support their claims, and that now he has found two reliable witnesses who support his claim, the testimony of these witnesses must be taken into consideration, and A's mother must take an oath that she spent at least thirty pounds on A's education and upbringing. The court cannot impose an oath on A's mother regarding the promise, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, that she is alleged to have made to A's wife, since the mother denies having made such a promise.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 245, 246, 247; cf. <i>Agudah</i> B.

<i>Q</i>. According to talmudic law, after the death of a person who had children by two wives, the sons of each wife first collect (from the father's estate) the <i>ketubah</i> of their mother; whatever is left of the estate is, then, divided among the heirs. Is this collection of a mother's <i>ketubah</i>, called <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i>, enforced nowadays?<br><i>A</i>. Many <i>Geonim</i> are of the opinion that the <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is not collectible nowadays. But R. Hai Gaon is of the opinion that it is collectible; and I am inclined to decide, in accordance with the opinion of R. Hai, that it is collectible even from movable property, unless a custom exists in a particular community that it is not collectible.<br>This decision is based on R. Meir's Responsum as recorded in Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to Nashim 26; and the opinion expressed in Mord. Ket. 162. But Cr. 116 records the following decision: Since a difference of opinion exists between the <i>Geonim</i>, the burden of proof [to prove according to which authority the law is to be decided] lies on the person who wants to collect money from the other person.<br>Tesh. Maim. <i>ibid</i>. continues: The <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is collectible nowadays from both real property and from personal property. As the ordinance of R. Tam, providing that a woman's dowry be returned to her heirs if the woman dies within the first year of marriage, is enforced; surely the ordinance of talmudic scholars, of a similar nature, should be enforced. According to the custom of the communities, the dowry is thus returned to the woman's heirs if she died within two years after her marriage. But R. Meir is of the opinion that the dowry should not be returned to her heirs, but to those who have given it originally. Similarly, R. Meir gave a dowry to his granddaughter Rachel. When she died in the second year of her marriage, R. Meir demanded that the dowry be returned to him although she had other heirs. In some communities only half of the dowry is returned when the woman dies in the second year of her marriage. The ordinance of the communities, which bears the signature of R. David of Merseburg, also has a similar provision.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 116; Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 26; Mord. Ket. 162. Cf. Asheri Ket. 4, 24.

Siman 250

We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: "All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 28; Hayyim Or Zarua, <i>Responsa</i> 147. Cf. <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> Ket. 12, 3; Asheri Ket. 13, 17; <i>Tur Eben Haezer</i> 75.<br>The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).

Siman 251

Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that "the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. "Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out" (Proverbs 17,14). Signed: Eliezer b. Ephraim. (Am. II, 81).

<i>Q</i>. A's window is narrow on the inside and wide on the outside. B, his neighbor, wants to build a wall alongside A's wall and extend it, as far as he is permitted, up to A's window.

Secondly, a person may increase his lights by beveling the outside border of his window as long as he does not touch the inside border of the window (or vice versa) without his neighbor being able to object to it. Surely one may make his wall very thin without his neighbor being able to object to it; the thinning of the wall has the same effect on the visibility of the window as the bevelling of the border of the window. If one is permissible, so is the other. The neighbor, then, cannot be restrained from placing his wall exactly in the same position he could have placed it before the person widened the outside of his window.

Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <i>Hallah</i> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them.

<i>Q</i>. A, B and C live in the same house. A Gentile came to the house and sold to A and B an article at a bargain price, on which they (A and B) made one <i>mark</i> profit. C claims that since part of the house belongs to him, and since he was present at the time the article was bought from the Gentile and he was one of the buyers, he is entitled to one-third of the profits. A and B deny C's claim that he was present at the time the article was bought; they admit that they once bought an article in partnership with C, but say that on that purchase they earned no profit.<br><i>A</i>. If A, B and C had made an agreement that they be partners in all good business transactions that come to the house, C is entitled to his share even though he was not present at the time the article was bought; for, although a person cannot sell to another anything that is not yet in existence, people may enter into a partnership to divide future gains (not yet in existence) as in such a partnership each partner merely becomes a hired worker to work for the benefit of the other partners. But if no such agreement exists, A and B must take an oath that C was not one of the buyers of the article, and that he was not present at the time the transaction took place and did not say: "I want to be a partner to this transaction." If, however, C was present at the time and expressed his desire to be a partner, he is entitled to his share of the profits; for, if one person tells another to lift up for him an article which has no owner, and this person picks it up, the former gains title to it; especially so if the second person is also to gain part ownership in the article, as in the present case.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 325.

<i>Q</i>. A received money from B for the purpose of buying for him garments from a Gentile. He paid the Gentile only part of the price of the garments. The Gentile forgot the balance due him, and did not ask for it for two years. A wants to retain the balance for himself.<br><i>A</i>. B gave money to A for the express purpose of paying the Gentile. As long as A does not pay the Gentile, the money belongs to B and A has no right to keep it. Moreover A has no right to give the money to the Gentile after the latter forgot about it; for, if A wants to sanctify the name of the Lord by paying the Gentile money the latter forgot about, let him (A) do so with his own money, as he cannot use another person's money for such a purpose.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 50; Pr. 326, 953; L. 335; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A owes money to B and B owes the same amount to a Gentile. B told A, in the presence of the Gentile, to pay his debt directly to the Gentile. The Gentile released B and depended upon A for payment. A successfully avoids payment to the Gentile because of an old debt due him from the latter. Since, according to Jewish law, the transaction was not valid and A's indebtedness to B was not legally transferred to the Gentile, A must pay his debt to B. But why should B be permitted to rob the Gentile? Is not robbing a Gentile prohibited? Moreover, the Gentile presses A for payment and eventually may force A to pay him his money; must A pay his debt to B?<br><i>A</i>. Robbing a Gentile is prohibited, but one is permitted to annul a Gentile's debt (if he can do so by using plausible excuses and without causing the name of the Lord to be profaned). But, if A will be forced to pay the debt to the Gentile, he will not have to pay anything to B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 227; Pr. 327; L. 385; Am II, 119.

<i>Q</i>. A, a wealthy person, pays his taxes directly to the lord and not together with the community. He lent money to his friends B and C, who invested it for profit. The volume of business in that locality with Jewish money, however, was not enlarged through B's and C's transactions with A's money, since A would have invested the money himself had he not lent it to B and C. The lord, therefore, will not make any greater demands for taxes because of C's and B's investments. Must B and C pay taxes to the community for the money they borrowed from A?<br><i>A</i>. The community can rightly claim that had A not lent the money to B and C he would not have invested that money but would have kept it in reserve. Therefore, the transactions by B and C with A's money do increase the volume of Jewish business and the overlord may demand more taxes because of this increase. Moreover, it is a custom in our kingdom that those who borrow money from wealthy individuals who pay their taxes independently of the community, must pay taxes to the community from the borrowed money.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 331.

<i>Q</i>. Several partners sue A for money. A demands that the partners choose a representative to present their arguments, for he may be at a disadvantage in having to answer the arguments of several people. May each partner claim that he wants to present his arguments personally for his own interests?<br><i>A</i>. Each partner has a right to present his claims personally. Furthermore, any testimony of one partner disadvantageous to the other partners is treated as the testimony of a single witness; and the testimony of two partners disadvantageous to the other partners is treated as the testimony of two witnesses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 332; Mord.

May the partners object on the grounds that they do not want A's friends to listen to their private affairs, and that A's friends may direct A's presentation of his arguments by sly hints and facial expressions?<br><i>A</i>. A cannot have his friends present at the trial, neither can the partners be present while one of them presents his claims, so that A may not be confronted with all the partners at the same time. Each partner shall present his claims separately and the verdict shall be passed on the accumulated evidence. If the court finds difficulty in remembering all the facts and claims, let the partners present their claims before two or three courts, or in two or three days to the same court, or let the court keep a written record of all claims.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 333; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A creditor demanded his money from a critically ill person. The latter admitted the indebtedness and ordered his heirs to repay the debt. Do you follow the decision of R. Tam that a widow has priority over a creditor in collecting (her <i>ketubah</i>) from movables, or the decision of Alfasi and the Geonim that the creditor has priority over the widow?<br><i>A</i>. No difference of opinion exists between R. Tam and the Geonim in regard to this law. Even the former admits that nowadays, when the ordinance of the Saburaim gives the creditor the right to collect his debt from movables even after the debtor's death, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from movables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 334; Am II, 68; Tesh.

Now that she refuses to live with him she loses the extra value placed on her dowry, the additional jointure promised her by the husband, as well as the 200 <i>zuzin</i> prescribed by the Talmud. Though in this country the same amount of dowry is written in the <i>ketubah</i> of a rich as in that of a poor bride, irrespective of the amount she actually brings in, in order not to shame the brides who bring in a small dowry, this rebellious wife is not entitled to collect the full amount of dowry written in her <i>ketubah</i>, since she never lived with her husband.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 442–443.

<i>Q</i>. A produced witnesses who testified to the effect that B had informed against A and had caused the latter to sustain a loss. A now demands that B's sons make good that loss.<br><i>A</i>. Damages caused by an informer fall under the heading of <i>Garmi</i> (damages caused indirectly) for which one is not directly responsible, but is liable to be fined. The amount an informer is required to pay [usually he has to make good the damage he caused], therefore, is a mere fine for his misdeeds and does not constitute the payment of a real obligation. Since heirs are not required to pay a father's fine, B's children are free from any obligation to A. Moreover, the court should claim for B's heirs that had B been summoned to court before his death, he would have claimed that he had already made good A's losses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 460.

A came to B's house and began to tutor B's son. Subsequently B discovered that A had never been examined by C. He, therefore, summoned A to court. A now declares himself ready to be examined, but B argues that A's present knowledge is no proof of his previous fitness for his position. Moreover, one witness testifies that at the time A undertook to teach B's son, he was not qualified to do so because of insufficient knowledge.<br><i>A</i>. If A has now sufficient knowledge to teach B's son, the burden of proof lies on B that A did not have such knowledge at the time he was engaged.

<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A "in his work"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him "in his work."<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the "officers" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the "treasurers" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the "treasurers" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the "officers" directly because of the "lien of R. Nathan" (garnishment). But, if the "officers" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the "officers." k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him "in his work." Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of "the lien of R. Nathan." Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the "treasurers", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the "treasurers" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the "treasurers."<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

A's temporizing is baseless and useless. Our sages have decreed that three months, and not a year or two, after a person died leaving no children, his brother must either marry the widow or give her <i>halitzah</i>. Therefore, no temporizing is permitted. A should be coerced, either by persuasion or by flagellation, into giving <i>halitzah</i> to the woman immediately. Let Gentiles belabor him till he agrees to do what he is told to do. I should prefer, however, that A be misled or deceived by offers of money till he voluntarily gives her <i>halitzah</i>. Thus the widow may officially forego her claim to her husband's money that is in A's possession, and even bind herself thereto by a <i>kinyan</i>. After the ceremony the widow would still be entitled to collect this money from A, for the court that has a right to inflict corporal punishment on A, has a right to confiscate his property if it be required by considerations of public welfare. I should prefer to practice deception on A rather than inflict flagellation, since the latter might involve great hardship, have very serious consequences, and even cause A to abscond.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 244; Pr. 492; P. 10; Moses Minz, <i>Responsa</i> 10.

<i>Q</i>. A mother demanded support from her three sons. One son has no money except his salary as teacher. The second son possesses fourteen <i>marks</i>.

Therefore, any son who would himself be thrown upon charity were he forced to support his mother, can not be forced to do so. But those sons who have means should support their mother in proportion to their wealth. These sons, however, cannot be forced to support their mother out of their own money, but can do so out of the money they are usually obliged to give to charity, although they would thus incur the curse of the Rabbis who say: "Cursed be he who feeds his father out of the poor man's tithe" Kid. 32a.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 198; Pr. 541; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. Before his death, A bequeathed sixty pounds <i>Heller</i> (denarii of Halle) to his brothers and sisters. His childless widow, however, retains all of A's property and refuses either to marry, or to take <i>halitzah</i> from her levir.<br>After protracted litigation, the widow (of Speyer) and her levirs finally came to court and chose their judges. These judges asked the opinion of R.

The leaders all agreed that after the rite of <i>halitzah</i> is performed, one half of the husband's estate belongs to the widow and one half to the levirs. R. Meir states that he knows no further details regarding these laws of the communities, and renders the following decision in accordance with talmudic law:<br><i>A</i>. If A's widow, three months after his death refuses to undergo the rite of <i>halitzah</i> or marry her levir, she is to be considered as a rebellious wife and all of A's property is to be taken away from her, except that which she has brought in as a dowry, upon her marriage to A. If, however, she consents to undergo the rite of <i>halitzah</i>, she receives half of A's property, as is the <i>Takkanah</i> of the communities.

<i>Q</i>. A has been dripping blood for the past four years. During that period he refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife on the ground that his doctors forbade him to have intercourse as it endangered his life. Is A to be considered a rebellious husband and hence should three denars per week be added to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> for the period of his abstention?<br><i>A</i>. Since A was forced by illness to refrain from intercourse with his wife, he is not to be considered a rebellious husband. A rebellious husband is one who refuses to live with his wife because he is angry with her or because he hates her. A person who is physically unable to live with his wife, however, is not considered a rebellious husband. A, however, must divorce his wife and must pay her the <i>ketubah</i>, since he is in the same category as a leper for whom coitus is harmful (Ket. 77b). Although A's sickness does not disable him permanently and is curable, we do not compel his wife to wait indefinitely in the hope that he might be cured. Thus Maimonides (M. T. Ishut 14, 7) rules that under such circumstances a woman must wait only six months. Although we have compared A to a leper for whom coitus is harmful, nevertheless we should not force A by flagellation to divorce his wife, but should only resort to persuasion. We should merely tell him the law requires him to divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>; should he refuse to do so, he would be called "transgressor". Whether A divorces her or not, however, we force him to pay his wife the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and her dowry, but we do not force him to pay her the additional jointure since some authorities hold the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure. Should A's wife aver that she does not believe that A's doctors told him to refrain from sexual intercourse, and insist that he is a rebellious husband, he would have to take an oath in support of his assertions. Should A refuse to take the oath, we would have to add to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> three Tyrian denars per week for the entire period of his abstention. I have sufficient proof to support my view that the three denars prescribed by the Mishnah (Ket. 5, 7) mean Tyrian denars. Should A admit that he had refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife because he was angry with her and that he had lied about both his sickness and the advice of his doctors, and should he declare that he now desires to resume marital relations with her, the aforementioned amount would be added to her <i>ketubah</i> and she would be required to resume her marital duties. Regardless of what happened in the past, A may now claim that he is well and that he is able to live normally with his wife, since the truth of his claim is bound eventually to be proven or disproven.<br>This Responsum is addressed to: "Rabbi Isaac, my relatives Rabbi Joel and Rabbi Ephraim".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Sinai V (1941) pp. 203–6; ibid. pp. 294–5; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 159c; Pr. 574.

Even if B had not, as yet, paid for the horse, the burden is upon him to prove that the horse was injured while in A's possession.

When the witnesses objected, A said that it was a slip of the tongue, that he did not intend to betroth Leah as his wife, especially since he was married already and that he would not violate the prohibition of polygamy by Rabbenu Gershom.

However, in order to be doubly certain, and for the sake of appearances, the captors should be asked to free the others from the <i>herem;</i> and knowing that the <i>herem</i> is not binding anyway, the captors should not hesitate to do so.

Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a "boundless" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

If the copulations during which blood was detected, occurred on specific dates, or at regular intervals, A must refrain from copulation on such dates. Moreover, if A is not anxious to remarry, and is willing to allow L to live away from him in another district and to deal with her through an intermediary or only in the presence of a third party, he does not have to divorce her.

B claims that A constructed apertures for window lights facing his (B's) yard after he (B) bought the yard from the Gentile.

B, however, claimed: that C rented the house from A on condition that he (C) lease it to whomever he wants; that he, B, was willing to partition off the part of the house he occupies from the rest of the house; and that he would guarantee to pay the widow for any damages she may sustain as a result of his remaining on the premises.

<i>Q</i>. A demanded from B sixty pennies he owed him. B admitted the indebtedness, but claimed that through A's wilful neglect, he, B, was not able to collect a debt of four pounds and sixty pennies. B, therefore, demanded that A pay him four pounds. The judges ordered A to swear that he did not willfully cause any damage to B, and ordered B to swear that A did willfully cause him a loss of at least sixty pennies. After the judges rendered this decision, B put forth his claim that, in partnership with A, he, B, loaned eight and one half pounds to Gentiles, and that, without his permission or consent, A relinquished that debt to the Gentiles. A, however, claimed that B gave him permission to do with B's share whatever he would do with his own. Moreover, A claims that B informed against him; a Jewish witness, the servants of the Bishop, and the burghers, support A's claim in this respect. The judges, however, demand that their former decision be carried out and that A and B present their new claims in another suit.
<i>A</i>. The decision of the judges that A must take an oath to the effect that he did not cause B to lose his investment by willful neglect, is correct. But if A released B's Gentile debtors (even though B gave A a blanket permission to do with his, B's, share whatever he, A, would do with his own), A must pay B as much as B's share was worth before A released the Gentiles.

The custom is well established throughout the kingdom that when an individual has a complaint against the community regarding the tax he was assessed with, he must first pay that tax and, then, may summon the community to court, for the community prefers to be in possession of such tax-money. As corroborative evidence of the legality of this procedure I cite the talmudic ruling that those who pay the capitation tax for others are justified in forcing the latter in their service (B. M. 73b), since "the law of the land prevails". Moreover, since the members of the community are partners in the payment of the taxes, no individual may willfully withdraw from the partnership. Since the majority (of the members of a community) may force the minority to abide by its rulings (B. B. 8b), it may certainly force an individual to pay his taxes. The burden of proof to the contrary rests upon the person who seeks to deviate from this rule.<br>Since the overlord customarily collects his taxes collectively from the entire community, the exact obligation of each member of the community regarding such tax becomes determined as if already collected (the very moment the overlord demands the collective tax); and if the overlord subsequently desires to free or relieve one member at the expense of the others, he has no right to do so. Such an act on his part is not considered "law of the land," but rather constitutes outright robbery, and is, therefore, not valid.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 49; Pr. 708, 915; L. 371; Am II, 130.

(1) <i>Q</i>. If A claims that the judges rendered an erroneous decision against him, can he summon the judges before a court?<br><i>A</i>. Yes, for we have heard of no ban or ordinance passed by the communities against the summoning of judges before a court. Moreover, it is a daily occurrence that litigants complain against their judges and summon them to court. Therefore, if the court of appeal shall decide that the judges erred, the latter will have to reverse their decision; should they refuse to reverse their decision, they will have to compensate A out of their own pockets.<br>R. M. adds: In our days, since the judges do not exercise the power of summons, but are compelled by a ban of the communities to sit in court and render judgment to those who appear before them voluntarily, the talmudic law — that the decision of the judges remains valid and the judges must compensate the injured party out of their own pockets — cannot be applied.<br>(2) <i>Q</i>. The judges allowed A a definite period of time within which to appeal his case before another court and A agreed to it. Now the specified term has expired; can A still appeal his case?<br><i>A</i>.

The latter refused to appear, claiming that according to the regulations of the community, anyone who is asked to pay a tax must do so, otherwise the community leaders have a right to pawn his property. They see no reason, therefore, why they should answer a summons to court.<br><i>A</i>. The scribes and tutors must first pay the levied tax; for the community is considered to be in possession of the tax money and the burden of proof lies on the individual.

A, needing money, asked B to take over the Gentile's loan and collect the interest. B paid A the amount due the latter from the Gentile and A said: "From now on it is yours." Subsequently, the Gentile failed to redeem the pledge. Is A permitted to recover the pledge and pay B the principal plus the interest accumulated during the time the pledge was in B's possession, or would such payment of interest constitute usury? Moreover, since a Jew does not gain title to a Gentile's pledge (Pesach. 31b), may B refuse to return the pledge to A on the ground that A sold his rights in that pledge to B?<br><i>A</i>. Since A did not gain title to the pledge, it is assumed that he surrendered all his rights to the pledge upon handing it to B. Therefore, B became the creditor of the gentile (and not A's creditor) and was entitled to the interest on his loan.

Since B still owes money to A, and since B could have denied owing anything to him, B is to be believed upon the taking of an oath that his transactions with A's money brought no profit.

A agreed and paid over the money to B in the presence of one witness. B died while on the trip, and the community appointed a trustee for his property. A demands his money from the trustee.<br><i>A</i>. On the order of the community, B's trustee should pay the six gulden to A. The latter is under no obligation to take an oath, in view of the fact that B died before the time for payment arrived.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 831.

<i>Q</i>. B hired A as tutor for his son for one year. A taught B's son together with other students. After four months of study, B took his son on a journey to a foreign country, for a period of two months. B's son returned to his studies at which he continued for three more months until the time of vintage, and then B took his son to the country and kept him there till the end of the year. A demands his wages for the whole year.<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. B discovered that A stole some silver from him. Accompanied by several men, B went to C's house and seized an article which A had entrusted to C for safekeeping. C, who owed money to B, refused to repay the debt unless B return to him A's article.<br><i>A</i>. B had a right to summon A to court, but he had no cause for action against C.

<i>Q</i>. Upon dividing, among themselves, the land left by their father, A and B formally agreed (by means of a <i>Kinyan</i>) that the western part of that land shall belong to A and the eastern part to B. Upon B's portion was situated an unfinished stone structure. A demanded that it be torn down and the stones and gravel be divided between B and himself. B refused to tear the building down and wanted to pay A for his share of the value of the stones and the gravel. A, however, demanded that B also pay him half the amount it would cost to construct such a building.<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. A and B bought merchandise in partnership and sold it in B's house. When they came to divide the profits, A demanded that B take the usual "partner's" oath, since the merchandise was sold in B's house. B claimed that A took part in the selling of the merchandise and should, therefore, also take a "partner's" oath. A, however, denied having taken any part in the transaction of the sale. Furthermore, A claimed that B owed him one Mina, which claim B denied. A demanded that B take an oath and be free from obligation, and B demanded that A take an oath and collect.<br><i>A</i>. Since B admits that he had taken part in selling the merchandise, and, therefore, must take a partner's oath, he is also charged with the oath on A's second claim.

<i>Q</i>. A Gentile wanted to buy a certain silver vessel from A. A, who had no such vessel to sell, wanted to take the Gentile to another Jewish dealer, but the Gentile commissioned A to buy the vessel for him. A went to B who was willing to sell a vessel weighing three pounds. A said to B: "The Gentile is my friend and I do not want to deceive him; if the vessel is truly made of silver, I shall buy it, otherwise, I shall not." B assured A that the vessel was made of silver, and added that since the silver was alloyed with a little copper, he was willing to accept forty-seven shillings for it. A took the vessel at night and sold it for fifty shillings to the Gentile who carried it away the same night. The Gentile, subsequently, complained that A deceived him, as the vessel was really made of copper. He, therefore, returned the vessel and forced A to refund him the money. A demanded that B take back the vessel, but B claimed that A saw what he was buying and accepted it for the stipulated price.<br><i>A</i>.

A suggested that he put it in his sheet, and B did so. Subsequently, the money was stolen from B. A, however, demanded his money and claimed that B was guilty of negligence since he slept in the market-place among thieves.<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. A thief came to A's house and sold him some gold. A, then, passed B's house and heard people say that the thief had money in his pocket. B said to his friends, that anyone who would rob the thief of his money would lose nothing since the latter was afraid of being caught. B further remarked that he would suggest to his Gentile customer, a chieftain, to rob the thief and then repay him (B) the three schillings the chieftain owed him. A warned B not to do so lest it become known that he, A, bought the stolen goods from the thief. A further warned B that he would hold him responsible for any loss he might suffer because of B's being involved in this matter. B, however, did not heed A's warning, saying that his Gentile customer, the chieftain, was his friend and that he would ask him not to demand from the thief any explanation after taking his money. After B's customer robbed the thief and released him, the latter was arrested by the authorities and was forced to confess to whom he sold the stolen gold, which caused A a heavy loss. A, therefore, demands that B make good that loss.<br><i>A</i>. B's act was only an indirect cause of A's loss; therefore, B owes nothing to A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 844.

<i>Q</i>. A lent money, on trust, to B who subsequently left for a distant country where he was robbed of all his possessions. Upon his return he settled with A for three halves (half-pounds, <i>marks</i>), and gave A a note of indebtedness in which no specific date of month or day, but the calendar year since the creation of the world appeared, and which contained a clause to the effect that A is to be believed without an oath should any litigation arise concerning this debt. After B's death his widow seized his property in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, which property barely covered ten percent of her claim, without taking the usual oath required of a widow upon the collection of her <i>ketubah</i>. Ten years after the death of B's widow, A presented his note for collection and demanded the full amount from B's sons. The latter claimed that their father left them nothing, that they inherited valuables from their mother only, and that B had paid A part of the debt contained in the note. A single witness testified, and A himself finally admitted, that B had repaid one-sixth of the debt.<br><i>A</i>. A controversy exists regarding the status of the property seized by a widow in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, if the widow died before taking the required oath. Some are of the opinion that the entire property reverts to the husband's estate; while others hold that the part of such property which is valued at no more than half of the amount of the widow's <i>ketubah</i> remains part of the widow's estate, while anything above that amount reverts to the husband's estate. The latter opinion is accepted. Therefore, if B's sons take an oath that they inherited nothing from their father, they are free from any obligation to A. If, however, they are willing to repay their father's debt, they may demand that A take an oath as to the amount actually due him, since he has been proven to be untrustworthy.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 859.

Many have disputed the efficacy of this procedure, and gave their opinions that A must divorce Leah.

D married C while she was still a minor, and entrusted his dowry, into the hands of his father-in-law, B, as a loan. After the first night, blood was found on the bridal sheet in spite of the fact that D did not yet cohabit with his wife, C. The fact was then discovered that C dripped with blood whenever she micturated or defecated. D, who kept away from his wife for a half year, was advised to cohabit with her on the ground that he thus might cure her. D did so and C's blood flowed profusely. D, therefore, sent C back to her father. D's mother claimed that C had this illness before she was betrothed to D; that long before C's marriage she once found C soaked in blood; that D's marriage to her was, therefore, contracted in error; and that C was therefore not entitled to her <i>ketubah</i>. B, however, claimed that it was D's misfortune that he could not cohabit with C, and, therefore, B demanded C's <i>ketubah</i>.<br><i>A</i>.

The custom is well established throughout the kingdom that when an individual has a complaint against the community regarding the tax he was assessed with, he must first pay that tax and, then, may summon the community to court, for the community prefers to be in possession of such tax-money. As corroborative evidence of the legality of this procedure I cite the talmudic ruling that those who pay the capitation tax for others are justified in forcing the latter in their service (B. M. 73b), since "the law of the land prevails". Moreover, since the members of the community are partners in the payment of the taxes, no individual may willfully withdraw from the partnership. Since the majority (of the members of a community) may force the minority to abide by its rulings (B. B. 8b), it may certainly force an individual to pay his taxes. The burden of proof to the contrary rests upon the person who seeks to deviate from this rule.<br>Since the overlord customarily collects his taxes collectively from the entire community, the exact obligation of each member of the community regarding such tax becomes determined as if already collected (the very moment the overlord demands the collective tax); and if the overlord subsequently desires to free or relieve one member at the expense of the others, he has no right to do so. Such an act on his part is not considered "law of the land," but rather constitutes outright robbery, and is, therefore, not valid.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 49; Pr. 708, 915; L. 371; Am II, 130.

A, therefore, demands that B return the Scroll to him. B, however, claims: (1) that he bought the Scroll for five pounds from the leaders of the community in the presence of the Rabbi; (2) that the beadle delivered possession of the Scroll to him; (3) that while buying the Scroll, he specified that he was donating it to his community and thus received it for half a pound less than the price asked for; and (4) that he had already donated it to his community and it was thus out of his hands.<br><i>A</i>. Since B bought the Scroll from reliable people, the sale is valid.

Thus a person may not give away all his possessions to his heirs in the expectation that his funeral expenses would be paid from public funds (Ket. 48a); the same principle should apply when one gives away all his possessions to his wife. The claims of a creditor, however, should have priority over the decedent's funeral expenses, since the appropriation of a creditor's own money to pay another person's funeral expenses would constitute downright thievery. On the other hand, just as an exemption of bedding, food for thirty days, and clothing to last twelve months, is allowed to a bankrupt debtor (B. M. 113b), so an exemption of the bare funeral expenses should be allowed in the case of a decedent's insolvent estate as against both the creditor and the widow.<br>This Responsum is addressed to Rabbi Israel, and the decision is in direct contradiction of that recorded in Cr. 184; ibid. 243; Pr. 176; ibid. 964; Mord.

No, the <i>herem</i> is not binding upon them since they accepted it under pressure, and since they probably thought that the threats of murder would not be carried out, that the overlord would probably not agree to murder, and that the captors themselves would be afraid to commit murder, a sin punishable by God and man. However, in order to be doubly certain, and for the sake of appearances, the captors should be asked to free the others from the <i>herem;</i> and knowing that the <i>herem</i> is not binding anyway, the captors should not hesitate to do so.

<i>Q</i>. The leaders of a community decided to introduce a new method of taxation whereby real property was to be taxed at the same rate as money. Prior thereto, real property was not so taxed. Are leaders of a community empowered to introduce such a change in the method of taxation?<br><i>A</i>. No; a change in an accepted custom, which will benefit some members of the community at the expense of others, can be introduced only by unanimous consent of the members.<br>R. Meir adds that throughout the kingdom, no taxes on real property are levied by the Jewish communities; that those whose wealth consisted mostly of money, attempted several times to introduce a change and tax real property; and that he, R.

<i>Q</i>. A gave a sum of money to a community to be used as an endowment fund for the maintenance of a Rabbi to be chosen by the community. After A's death, the people of the community chose their relative, B, as their Rabbi. A's daughter was married to a Rabbi who was the equal in scholarship to Rabbi B. Is the community obligated to accept as their Rabbi A's son-in-law in preference to Rabbi B? Moreover should some of A's children become poor, must the income from the endowment fund be used for their support rather than for the maintenance of the Rabbi, since it is to be assumed, in accordance with the principle of R. Simon b. Menassia (B.B. 132a) that A, while giving the money, intended that his own relatives be preferred to a stranger?<br><i>A</i>. After the money was given over to the community, neither A nor his family had greater rights to it than any other member of the community. The community, therefore, is not obligated to appoint A's son-in-law as their Rabbi. Moreover, it is to be presumed that A made a nobly charitable gift to the community without attaching any reservations or conditions. The law of R. Simon (B.B. 132a) deals with a charitable gift made under an erroneous assumption, while in our case no such condition existed.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 942; Mord. B. B. 486; <i>Agudah</i> B.

<i>Q</i>. The king held the Jews of the community responsible for A's failing to return to the city at an appointed time, and imposed a fine on them. The community, therefore, demanded that A reimburse them for the penalties they suffered on his account. A, however, claimed that the community did not guarantee his return at the specified date, and that the king used his failure to return as a mere pretext for extortion.<br><i>A</i>. Since A claims that the community did not guarantee his return, he can not be held responsible for the king's extortionate action. The king has no right to hold a community responsible for the whereabouts of an individual. Such action on the part of the king is not considered governmental law, but is to be put in the category of outright robbery.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 943.

<i>Q</i>. A, B, and C were the only Jewish residents of the town T. A was much richer than either B or C. Their overlord often made loans from A, which at times he repaid together with the interest, and on other occasions he withheld the interest. When the lord put a tax of two or three <i>marks</i> on the Jews, he sometimes exempted A from the payment of such tax. He once put a tax of two <i>marks</i> on A, B, and C. A week or two later he sent to A for a loan of two <i>marks</i>. When A complained that both paying taxes and making free loans were too burdensome for him, the overlord sent him to his treasurer with an order to the latter to refund A for his share of the tax, with wheat. Must A share the wheat with B and C?<br><i>A</i>. A, B, and C were partners in so far as paying the tax was concerned.

<i>Q</i>. What should be done to a man who revolted against his wife and gave away his money to others to avoid paying her the <i>ketubah</i>? Please explain in detail the laws concerning rebellious husbands and rebellious wives.<br><i>A</i>. If the husband refuses to support his wife he can be forced to support her. If he does support his wife, but refuses to cohabit with her, he should be told that according to the Rabbis he is required to divorce her or be called <i>abaryana</i> (renegade), but he cannot be forced to divorce her.

<i>Q</i>. Leah rebelled against her husband A, the son of Mendel Kern. When warned that she might lose her <i>ketubah</i> and the dowry (which she brought in upon her marriage) and that she might be forced to wait for many years for her divorce she threatened, among other things, to go and live among the Gentiles. Since the women of Regensburg were always arrogant in their relations to their husbands and now are even more supercilious than ever, Leah should be dealt with in a manner that would serve as a warning to her haughty sisters. A should be permitted to remarry immediately in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer b. Nathan, while Leah should be forced to wait for her divorce for many years. However, Leah should not be left entirely to the mercy of her husband who, after marrying another woman, might demand an exorbitant sum for Leah's divorce, or might refuse to divorce her altogether. We, therefore, leave it to you to decide upon a proper punishment for Leah.<br><i>A</i>. In order to curtail the possibility of Jewish women turning to mischief, and in order that people might not say: "This one is A's wife and this one his paramour", we should not permit the husband to remarry before he divorces his rebellious wife. Therefore, A should receive a limited amount of money and give Leah her divorce, or, he should give Leah a divorce on condition that the divorce become valid (from now and) twelve months, or two years, after date. After the delivery of such a conditional divorce, A may be permitted to remarry immediately. If, however, Leah had good reason to detest her husband, she should be dealt with more leniently. Therefore, you should use your judgment in determining the severity with which Leah is to be punished.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 946; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 161b.

Moreover, in this case there is reason to believe that L is lying since her husband has had children with a former wife. Even though he might have weakened since, we can put no trust in L's words.

<i>Q</i>. One part of a room is held in partnership by B, C, and D, and the other part belongs solely to A. B and C own estates which border on the east side of the room. When the partners are ready to partition the room with A, can they compel A to take the west part of the room so that B and C may have their own part, which they intend to continue to hold in partnership, contiguous to their estates?<br><i>A</i>. According to the opinion of Rashi, the partners may compel A to take the west part of the room; R. Tam, however, thinks that they cannot do so. Since we cannot decide whose opinion should prevail, we must order A and the partners to cast lots; if the east part of the room falls to the partners, they shall gain title to it; but if the east part falls to A, he shall not gain title to it immediately, but whatever person or persons can by force succeed in taking possession of the east part that person or persons shall gain title to it.<br>This Responsum was addressed to R. Meir's relative, Rabbi Joel.<br>The latter objected to R. Meir's ruling that the use of force be invoked in settling the above dispute, on the ground that this procedure would lead to serious quarrels.<br>R. Meir answered: In order to obviate the necessity of leaving the matter to be settled by force, I searched for a more practical solution and found that Maimonides in his code ruled that upon the partitioning of a field held in partnership, a partner may insist on receiving his part of the field adjoining his own property, provided that both parts of the field are exactly equal [in fertility or arrangement of irrigation facilities]. Therefore, if B, C, and D, agree to equalize the two parts of the room by adding structures to the western side of the room similar to the ones in the eastern side, they will be entitled to receive as their share the eastern part of the room. This ruling is in accordance with the views of both Rashi and Maimonides. In the present case we may disregard the view of R.

Subsequently A informed B that the date of circumcision would be postponed until such time as the child would be strong enough to undergo the operation. B left the city on community business and returned one day before the end of the month. Meanwhile, however, A had decided to circumcise his son immediately after he would be a month old, and, fearing that B might not return on time, he engaged an out-of-town <i>Mohel</i> promising him that the <i>Mitzvah</i> will be his even though B would return before the ceremony. B now demands that he be permitted to perform the rite. In general, may a father who has already appointed someone as a <i>Mohel</i> or <i>Baal Berith</i> (the one who holds the child during the rite), change his mind and give the honor to someone else? Please let us know the laws governing these situations since disputes often arise regarding them.<br><i>A</i>. If the child was not circumcised yet, B should perform the rite of circumcision since he was promised the <i>Mitzvah</i> originally.

Subsequently the Gentile met A's son, C, and complained to him about the ill treatment he received at the hands of his creditors. He also told the people in the street, that A, B, and Leah had already collected from him a thousand pounds in interest. To appease him, C agreed to take six wagons of wine for thirty-seven pounds. When A and Leah heard of it, they consented to take the wine, and ordered its delivery. Now, B refuses to accept his part of the wine claiming that he did not consent to the bargain, and that he would seek to collect cash from the Gentile.

At first A denied that he received B's book, but when confronted by a witness who supported B's claim, A retracted his denial, but alleged: 1) that B loaned him the book with the understanding that his (A's) children should be permitted to study therefrom; 2) that he loaned the book to his son-in-law; and 3) that the book was subsequently burned in the latter's house, and that hence the loss of the book was an unavoidable accident. B denied that he gave A permission to allow his sons to use the book.<br><i>A</i>. Since A and B lent books to each other, their responsibilities regarding these books were those of hired watchmen who are not responsible for unavoidable accidents. The question revolves, then, about A's lending the book to his son-in-law. Therefore, upon A's taking an oath that B gave him permission to allow his sons to use B's book, A will be free from any obligation to B. B, on the other hand, may retain A's book, upon taking an oath that he did not permit A to give his book to A's sons for study, and B is further entitled to collect from A's son-in-law (the difference between the value of the lost book and the one B retained) since the responsibility of the son-in-law regarding the book was that of a borrower who is responsible even for unavoidable accidents.

<i>Q</i>. A group of Jews of town T, without the knowledge or consent of the other Jewish inhabitants of T, formed a community organization and elected a single governing body with the power of apportioning taxes and managing all other communal and religious affairs. This organization assumed the authority to exercise these powers on all the inhabitants of T. Rabbi Meir Kohen, however, protested denying their authority, and refused to pay the taxes levied on him. He was willing to become a member of the community and share in the carrying of the community burden, provided he be permitted such rights in the election of leaders as were held by the other members of the community, or that the taxes be levied equitably, i.e., in exact proportion to a person's wealth. The elected leaders refused to accede to R. Meir's wishes and, with the help of Gentiles, forced their way into R. Meir's house and seized some of his valuables as pledges for the unpaid taxes. R. Meir retaliated by hiring other Gentiles who took back his valuables by force.<br><i>A</i>. The Jews of T who have banded together in electing leaders and giving them authority to manage all communal affairs, had no right to do so even though they represented a majority of the Jewish inhabitants of T, as long as a minority took no part in the reorganization, for no new custom or institution can be established in a community without the knowledge and consent of all its inhabitants. The talmudic statement: "The inhabitants of a city are permitted to enforce their rulings" (B.B. 8b), means: a) If the people of a city unanimously agree to enact a certain ruling, they are permitted to punish and fine anyone who subsequently disregards that ruling; or, b) the seven leaders of a community, originally elected with the knowledge and consent of all the members of the community to manage community affairs and to punish offenders, have the right to enforce their rulings and decrees. But, no majority of city dwellers can force a minority to be governed by a ruling to the original passing of which they have not consented, or to accept the authority of leaders whom they have not consented to elect.<br>Moreover, any ordinance passed by the inhabitants of a city without the knowledge or consent of a great man (a scholar) residing in their midst, is void and is not binding even upon those who passed the ordinance (B.B. 9a). There can be no doubt, therefore, that no community can pass an ordinance to be binding upon the scholar himself, unless he agrees to its enactment. Thus, an organization established against the express wishes of R. Meir Kohen, a person of high standing and scholarship, has no right to force its authority on all the inhabitants of T. Therefore, R. Meir had the right to resort to the help of Gentiles in order to recover his valuables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 968; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 299c; ibid. p. 363b.

<i>Q</i>. A trustee loaned money belonging to orphans to A on interest, at the rate of one quarter per <i>mark</i>. A refused to pay the interest. Moreover, A claimed to have repaid part of the loan, which claim the trustee denied. The inquiring judges decided that even money belonging to orphans can not be loaned to a Jew at a definite rate of interest.<br><i>A</i>. Your decision was correct and the trustee's stipulation of a definite interest was illegal and, therefore, void. However, under the circumstances, the loan is as if made by the Jewish court — the natural trustee and protector of all orphans — on the usual terms [made when orphans' money is loaned]: "to share in the profits but not in the losses." Therefore, if A earned profits with the money, he must pay to the trustee, the stipulated quarter per <i>mark</i>. If A admits that the money he borrowed belonged to the orphans, but claims to have repaid part of it, the trustee is believed as to the amount he received from A, (in repayment of the loan), and is not required to take an oath since the trustee is a disinterested third party. But if A states his belief that the trustee loaned him his own money, and not the orphans' money, the trustee must take an oath as to the amount he received from A in repayment of the loan, though he is not required to take an oath to the effect that the money he loaned belonged to the orphans.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 969; Mord.

Before concluding this transaction, A informed B of his intentions and of the Gentile's terms, and offered to borrow the amount from B on the same terms. B vigorously protested against A's mortgaging part of the house to a Gentile who might cause B trouble; but, at the same time, he refused to lend fifteen <i>marks</i> to A on the ground that it would be considered a taxable loan, and that the one <i>mark</i> per annum would be considered usury from a fellow Jew.<br><i>A</i>. If A sells his part of the house to B on condition that it be rented to A in perpetuity at one <i>mark</i> per annum, the sale will be legal and B will be permitted to collect the one <i>mark</i> per annum.

<i>Q</i>. Rachel's husband became an apostate. She gave him one-half <i>mark</i> as the price of his granting her a divorce. After the divorce was delivered, the witnesses to the instrument went to R's father, and with his permission tore up R's <i>ketubah</i>. A had in his possession a deposit belonging to R's husband. R demanded that A give her the deposit in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>. The apostate, on the other hand, threatened A with great injury unless he returned the deposit to him.<br><i>A</i>. Although the tearing of R's <i>ketubah</i> by her father does not cancel the apostate's obligation to R, A may not be forced to risk his life or property by handing over the deposit to R.

<i>Q</i>. A and B placed their dispute in the hands of two mediators subject to a final decision between the two, of C, the third mediator. They agreed before an authoritative court, that should one party refuse to abide by the decision of the mediators, that party was to pay five <i>marks</i> to the cemetery fund or to the synagogue. They deposited valuable pledges with C to enforce their agreement. The mediators reached a decision on the second day. A, however, refused to abide thereby claiming that, at the time of the making of the agreement, it was understood by both parties that the decision of the mediators was not to be postponed till the second day. A brought two witnesses, one of whom testified that such was the understanding; the other witness was not sure whether the condition was made at the time of the agreement or subsequent thereto. C and the subscribing two witnesses denied A's allegation that such a condition was made at the time of the agreement. The Rabbis, therefore, decided that A must pay the five <i>marks</i> fine. A, then, changed his mind and expressed his desire to be bound by the decision of the mediators. Must he still pay the fine?<br><i>A.</i> As soon as A refused to accept the decision of the mediators, he became obliged to pay five <i>marks</i> to the sacred cause.

<i>Q</i>. It is the custom of judges to consider as valid conditional transactions classified as <i>asmakhta</i>, and even to enforce the collection of the money-fines stipulated in such transactions, when they were accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court. How can the judges enforce the collection of such money when R. Hai Gaon and R. Hananel ruled that these transactions were invalid? Moreover, occasionally the conditional transaction is not concluded before an authoritative court, but the scribe inserts the phrases: "accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>, made before an authoritative court", as a mere formality. Why should the signature of two witnesses to such writ suffice? Why not require the signatures of three persons, those of the prominent men of the community?<br><i>A</i>. The ruling that a conditional transaction accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court is valid, is based on the weighty opinions of R. Zemah Gaon, Rashi, Rashbam, R. Tam, and Ri, while the opinion of R. Hai Gaon is untenable. As to your second objection, if the scribe was instructed by the contracting party (or parties) to draw up the contract, we assume that he was thus instructed to draw up a valid contract in accordance with accepted custom. Since it is customary to insert the phrase cited above in a conditional contract, the scribe was thus instructed to insert it in the contract, and we interpret such instruction as an admission by the defendant that the transaction had taken place before an authoritative court. Were two other witnesses to testify before us that the writ was drawn up by the undersigned witnesses who recorded an ordinary <i>kinyan</i> made in their presence, as a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court without their (the latter witnesses) having been instructed to draw up a valid contract, the contract would be void. Lacking such testimony we must rely on the signatures of the two witnesses as proof that the transaction was concluded before an authoritative court; the responsibility for any irregularity must rest upon such witnesses.<br>This responsum is addressed to "my teacher and relative Rabbi Asher".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 976; Am II, 107; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. When A was imprisoned the community delegated B to endeavor to release him. A claims that he sent books to B, which were valued at twelve <i>marks</i>, so that B, using the books as security, might procure a loan from the charity-chest at its regular rate of interest; and that he, thus, owes B nine pounds Nürnburg coins, which he is ready to repay. He demands that B permit him to redeem his books. B claims: a) that when A gave him the books, he, A, undertook to make good all damages incurred in securing the loan; b) that he, B, suffered damages because of his endeavors on A's behalf; c) that A sent word to R. Yedidyah and to B, to sell two books; d) that he, B, gave the two books to Rabbi Yedidyah who sold them, but who now refuses to give the money to B. A, however, claims that he only advised B to secure the aid of Rabbi Yedidyah in selling the books, since R. Yedidyah knew their value and how to sell them, but that he did not permit B to give the books to R. Yedidyah. Moreover, A claims that R. Yedidyah retains the money he received for the two books, for a debt B owes him. B denies that he owes money to R. Yedidyah.<br>A. If B admits that he received A's books, he is responsible for them. If, however, B claims that A gave him permission to give the books to R. Yedidyah, he must take an oath to that effect and then be free from obligation. Moreover, if A usually entrusted his valuables to R. Yedidyah, B is free from obligation without taking an oath. As to the damages B claims to have suffered on A's accounts because he went surety for A to Gentiles, if he has in his possession money belonging to A, he may take an oath as to the amount of damages he suffered, and be entitled to retain that sum. For if one Jew goes surety to a Gentile for another Jew, the latter must make good all damages suffered by the surety because of his suretyship, excepting damages caused by his wilful neglect. At first I was told that this law was an ordinance enacted by the communities, but now I realize that it is sound talmudic law (based on B. K. 114a: "thou hast placed a lion next to my field"). If, however, B has in his possession no money belonging to A, A may take an oath that he expressly undertook to be responsible only for the interest of a loan secured from the charity-chest, and be obligated to pay B only such interest.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 977.

<i>Q</i>. A claimed that he gave B a coat of mail and thigh plates as security for a loan. He repaid that loan, and therefore demands back his security. B answered that he received from A only a coat of mail which he was ready to return upon the latter's payment of money still due B. Upon hearing B's reply, A said to the judges that he knew that the law required them to charge B with an oath, but that B was not qualified to take an oath since he was a notorious thief and was suspected of swearing falsely. A made a public announcement that whoever knew anything that might disqualify B from taking an oath, should appear and testify before the court and the community leaders, in accordance with the Biblical injunction (Leviticus, 5, 1). Many witnesses appeared, but the testimony of only three persons was valid. One of these testified that B had stolen one pound from him; the second said that B had testified against him in a Gentile court and thus had caused him to suffer damages; and the third testified that B had bound himself by a <i>herem</i> to redeem his pledged horse, and had failed to do so. Since these misdemeanors had happened long ago and B might have repented since then, was the testimony of these witnesses sufficient to disqualify B from taking an oath?<br><i>A</i>. B should be disqualified from taking an oath because of the testimony of the first and third witnesses. The Talmud (B. K. 62a) came to no conclusion regarding the trustworthiness of an informer; therefore, the testimony of the second witness is of no consequence.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 978.

<i>Q</i>. When the bishop, an officer of the king, came to redeem the king's pledges from A, the latter demanded his interest at the rate of four pennies per week per pound. The bishop became very angry, uttered many profanities against the Jews, and even threatened to have them driven out of France (?). Subsequently, the bishop demanded that the officers of the community (<span>אמרכלים</span>) obtain the king's pledge for him. The community officers took the pledge from A and delivered it to the bishop, who, thus appeased, paid them the same amount he had originally offered A. A now demands that the community officers pay him the amount they promised him by a solemn handclasp at the time they took the king's pledge from him. The community officers, on the other hand, claim that they did not intend to pay him more than they were to receive from the bishop.

<i>Q</i>. R. Eliezer bound himself by a <i>herem</i> to give his daughter Gutlin, a minor, in marriage to Miriam's son, Isaac Levi, also a minor; and Miriam also obligated herself by a <i>herem</i>. Both parents put up a trust fund of three pounds for the couple, on condition that in case one of the parties dies before marriage the parents should divide between themselves the principal and the accrued interest. R. Eliezer died, and subsequently, but before her marriage, his daughter also died. A young son by a former marriage, who is also motherless, and a widow survived him. The trustee of the orphan, appointed by the community, and the widow, both made claims to one half of the trust-fund money. To whom should it be given?<br>It seems to me that the orphan is entitled to this money since it was not an actual asset at the time R. Eliezer died, and a widow collects her <i>ketubah</i> only from actual assets. The fact that the widow is in possession of the money, as the court gave it to her temporarily, does not make this asset any more actual as is evident from the case, quoted in the Talmud, of the woman with whom notes of indebtedness were deposited (Ket. 85a). Neither does the principle of <i>Miggo</i> apply to her since the money was given to her by the court and since the previous year she was obliged to make out a detailed statement of her assets, for the purpose of taxation and assessment for charity, in which statement the trust-money was listed. Signed: Moses Azriel.<br><i>A</i>. Since half of the fund which belonged to R. Eliezer was to be given to the couple on their wedding day and was to be returned to R. Eliezer in case of death, it did not leave R. Eliezer's possession, and was, therefore, at the time of his death, an actual asset of his estate from which his widow is entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>. The widow is further entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i> from the interest that accrued on the investment up to R.

<i>Case</i>. When A died he left to his widow, Leah, and to his young daughter, an estate of two pounds plus a few articles of clothing. Before Leah remarried, she entrusted the two pounds to her cousin, Rabbi Yedidyah, who was also A's brother, as a trust fund for her daughter. Her second marriage, to the son of R. Isaac of Coburg, was an unhappy one as she had to wander from town to town with her children on her shoulder to procure her daily sustenance, not receiving any support from her husband. She succeeded, however, in saving the sum of twenty-two schillings which she deposited with her mother in payment of a silken garment, valued at three pounds, which she bought for her daughter. When her husband learned about it, he went to Leah's mother and tricked her into giving him the garment. Leah then demanded her daughter's garment from her husband. The latter, however, claimed that, since whatever a wife possesses belongs to her husband, the silken garment belonged to him. He further demanded that Leah return to him all the garments and objects she had given to her daughter.<br>Rabbi Moses was the judge in the case and decided that Leah must take an oath that she did not give to her daughter directly or indirectly any money belonging to R. Isaac's son. Rabbi Yedidyah then wrote to R. Meir, and, enclosing a copy of R. Moses' decision, argued against it since he thought that R. Moses imposed an oath on Leah even though her husband was not positive she took his money and maintained only a possibility of it. R. Meir wrote his opinion that we can impose an oath on a wife only when the husband is positive that she misused his money, (which was in seeming contradiction to that of R. Moses). He sent this opinion to R. Yedidyah and adjured him to show it only to R. Moses who, R. Meir hoped, would retract his decision. R. Moses, however, felt humiliated, protested that Leah's husband was positive in his claim, and produced a statement from the local <i>Beth-din</i> which read: "Our teacher, Rabbi Meir: We let you know that the husband was positive in his claim and enumerated all the things he demanded of his wife. Since he was positive in his claim, and did not merely suggest a possibility of it, we have imposed an oath on the wife as advised by our teacher, Rabbi Moses." R. Moses further stated that R. Yedidyah made public R. Meir's letter and caused him great shame and humiliation. R. Meir, then, withdrew from the case, saying that he did not want to be a party to the personal quarrel between R. Yedidyah and R. Moses unless he could effect a reconciliation between the two.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 982; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 172d.

Our masters, the community of Nuremberg, take notice that my relative, R. Abraham, came to me as a representative of his community. The latter complains against members of your community who came to their town (the town of R. Abraham) and are doing business there. You have the power to stop this evil practice, but you do nothing about it. You know that such practice is prohibited by the Torah as evidenced by the talmudic decision (B. B. 21b) that an inhabitant of one city may restrain inhabitants of other cities from competing with him within his city limits, and other similar decisions (ibid. 22a, 21b). Furthermore, were we unable to prove that the Talmud forbids the practice mentioned above, we should have adduced such prohibition by simple logic, as we positively cannot imagine that it be permitted; for otherwise life would be unbearable. The rich would do business outside their own community, in all the settlements, and would thus increase the volume of business there without helping the Jews of those settlements to carry the burden of increased taxation directly resulting from such increase in business. You, the community of Nuremberg, must correct this injustice and must save the distressed from their oppressors. No one but you can comfort them, for no one else can mete out justice within your sphere of influence. Therefore, you should use all the power of coercion you command to prevent your members from going into other towns and competing with the Jewish inhabitants there; by so doing you would serve as a good example to other communities.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 983; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 306a.

<i>A</i>. An opinion is prevalent among the people that a <i>takkanah</i> of the communities frees one from any responsibility, if, after suffering bodily injury at the hand of his neighbor, and while still in the heat of anger, he retaliates with force, or even turns informer against him. If such <i>takkanah</i> exists, in order to punish severely the person who began the disturbance, or if B's claim is true that A released him from obligation in this matter, B owes nothing to A. But the <i>takkanah</i> of the communities probably frees the assaulted person, who retaliates in the heat of anger, from the special fines which communities usually impose upon offenders against public policy, but does not free him from responsibility for the injuries he inflicted upon the assailant. The judges, therefore, must evaluate the five compensations (prescribed to the injured person by the Talmud) for biting B's finger.

<i>Q</i>. Leah claims that she settled in the town T subsequent to the demand of a tax from the Jews by the burghers of the town, and after they had instructed the Jews to pay the tax to a Jew, A; that she was, therefore, not subject to this tax, even though A gave the community an extension of the time for payment; and that the community had no right to collect any money from her in payment therefor. The community claims that Leah sent her money to T for investment before the burghers demanded the tax; that her sister rented a house for her, which indicates that Leah had decided to reside in T before she actually came there; that it is a custom of the community to collect taxes from all those resident at the time of collection even though they were not residents at the time the tax was demanded; and that the tax was paid in order to save their lives, since the burghers threatened "to do what they did on the Rhine." Leah denied the claims that she sent her money to T, that it had been invested before her arrival and that her sister had rented a house for her. She stated that the Jews always paid a tax to the burghers whenever the latter demanded it; and that she did not intend to settle in T at all, but that being her sister's surety she had to follow her sister when the latter fled from her former settlement.<br><i>A</i>. Matters of taxation depend on local custom. It is needless to ask me the custom of our community, for you may have a different custom. Anyone who settles in a new place is bound by the custom prevailing there. But since the community has completely settled its obligations to the burghers, by consenting to pay the tax to A, before Leah settled in T, the representatives of the community must prove through witnesses who are not residents of T, that according to their custom Leah was obliged to pay the amount the community demanded, before they could deprive her of any of her property. If Leah, however, rented a house in T before the tax was levied, she is bound to pay her share of the tax, despite the fact that the community may not be able to prove any prevailing custom to that effect.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 995.

While pressed for money, A agreed to sell his house to C for one hundred twenty-five pounds, and promised him by solemn hand-clasp that if his neighbors (who owned the adjoining property) refused to buy the house for the stated sum, he would sell it only to C. Complying with C's demand A deposited a pledge of ten pounds with B to be delivered to C in case A did not keep his promise. A's neighbors agreed to buy the house for the price mentioned above. Meanwhile, A received money from a different source and after a conference with his relatives, he refused to sell the house altogether. A's neighbors summoned him to court claiming that he tricked them and that he used them as a means to free himself from his obligation to C. A, therefore, had to take an oath (in the form of a <i>herem</i>) that he had no intentions of trickery. Subsequently, with his pledge still in the hands of the trustee, B, A went to the Rabbis of a certain community and explained the situation to them. The Rabbis informed him that he did not lose his pledge since the consent of the neighbors to buy his house automatically voided his agreement with C. A, therefore, now demands his pledge from B. B, however, claims that A's agreement with C was that if A's neighbors did not buy his house by a certain date, A would sell it to C or forfeit the pledge. A single witness supports B's claim. B further claims that after the appointed time passed he delivered the pledge to C as instructed. Signed: Judah b. Rabbi Meshulam.<br><i>A</i>. A's agreement to give C ten pounds in case he, A, does not keep his promise, is considered an <i>Asmakta</i>; and since the agreement was not made in the presence of an authoritative court, and was not accompanied by a <i>Kinyan</i>, it is not binding. A promised C by solemn hand-clasp to sell him the house, but no such hand-clasp accompanied A's agreement to pay the fine of ten pounds; therefore, A is under no obligation to pay ten pounds to C. And, since according to A's report of his agreement with C such agreement was voided by the neighbor's consent to buy the house, A is under no obligation to C, and B must return to A his ten pounds. The testimony of the single witness — that A promised by solemn hand-clasp to sell his house to C if his neighbors would not buy it by a certain date — does not oblige A to take an oath denying the truth of such testimony. For a solemn hand-clasp is equivalent to an oath; thus, if the testimony of the witness is true, A is already under a solemn obligation to sell his house to C and an oath is unnecessary.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 996; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i> p. 265 b; ibid. 277d.

<i>Q</i>. A, B and Leah jointly lent money to one person. The debtor gave them the right to collect the annual produce of a certain village. A claims that B and Leah collected a certain amount of his share of the produce and gave it to farmers on condition that [at harvest time] they repay to B and Leah double the amount advanced. A, therefore, demands whatever B and Leah collected from these debtors. B, on the other hand, claims that he owes nothing to A, and that A collected part of his (B's) share of the produce. Leah claims that she is ready to return to A whatever he will state under oath she has taken from him. She further claims that she did not advance the produce for profit, but that she sold it when the prevailing market price was low.<br><i>A</i>.

<i>Q</i>. While critically ill, Mrs. Maimona said to the representative of the community that after her death the following matters should be attended to at her expense: 1) That the oil-lamp which burns during the services in the memory of her departed daughter, should be made to burn continuously day and night; 2) that every Friday evening a half-pound waxen candle should be lit in the synagogue in her memory; and 3) that half a <i>mark</i> should be expended on a <i>kiddush</i>-cup for the synagogue. When the representative asked her as to the source of the money for these expenditures, she answered pointing at an adjoining room: "You will find sufficient valuables and money in that room." The following day, a Friday, she called her brother Zemah and told him, in the presence of witnesses, to take for himself and for his sisters everything he finds in the room mentioned above. On the following Sunday, the representatives of the community came and asked her the whereabouts of the money she promised for the synagogue, but she refused to reveal anything. The representatives, therefore, broke into the room and took everything they found there. They also pronounced the <i>herem</i> against anyone who would not return to the community valuables or money belonging to Mrs. M. which might be in his possession. R. Isaac ha-Kohen admitted that Mrs. M. had deposited eight Cologne-<i>marks</i> with him and had told him that after her death he should do with the money "the proper thing."<br><i>A</i>. Mrs. M. probably withdrew her promise to donate something to the synagogue. A gift made <i>causa mortis</i> even to a holy cause can be rescinded. The money and valuables found in her room, therefore, belong half to R. Zemah and half to his sisters. R. Isaac must return the eight <i>marks</i> to Mrs. M's heirs, for the proper thing to do with money of a deceased person, is to return it to the heirs.<br>This Resp. is addressed to R.

<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle "the law of the land prevails" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: "The law of the land prevails".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered "law of the land" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

<i>Q</i>. A had two sons and one daughter. He gave his daughter in marriage to B and promised him by a written document that after his (A's) death, B would receive a share of A's estate equal to that of an heir. After A's wife died, A remarried and had two sons by his second wife. After her death, he gave presents to her young sons and expressly stated that these were to be in addition to their share in his estate after he should die. Subsequently, A lost his mind and three years later, he died. B demanded one-third of A's estate since at the time the promise of the gift was made to him, A had only two heirs. The grandfather of the younger orphans, acting as their representative, claimed that only one-sixth of the estate was due B, since two parts were to go to A's first-born son. Moreover, the representative demanded the <i>ketubah</i> of A's second wife, for her children, as <i>ketubat benin dikrin</i>. Subsequently, B admitted in the presence of many witnesses, that he knew the place where A hid his valuables. In order that he disclose the place of the hidden valuables, the representative of the orphans entered into an agreement with B, which agreement was strengthened by a <i>herem</i>, whereby B was to receive one-fifth of A's estate. Now B refuses to live up to the agreement and demands one-third of the estate.<br><i>A</i>. B is entitled to one-sixth of that property which he can prove A possessed at the time of making the promise of the gift to B. The agreement with B should, therefore, not bind the orphans since it was entered into to their disadvantage. Moreover, the sons are entitled to collect their mother's <i>ketubah</i> as <i>ketubat benin dikrin</i>, before the estate is divided among the heirs. Although many of the <i>Geonim</i> wrote that the <i>ketubat benin dikrin</i> is not collectible nowadays (the reason being that such an ordinance was originally instituted in order that fathers willingly give their daughters dowries equal to whatever they give to their sons, but nowadays fathers give more to their daughters than to their sons) R. Hai Gaon and the Tosaphists were of the opinion that it is collectible; and we follow the latter opinion. However, since the representative of the orphans entered into the agreement in order to recover A's hidden valuables, the agreement with B is valid. B will find it to his advantage to abide by the agreement and not break a <i>herem</i>, for he is really entitled to much less than what he is getting under the agreement. B, however, will have to state under oath the amount of A's valuables he has in his possession.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 1004: Mord. B. B. 599. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B. B. 181.

For a discussion of the identity of the <i>landgraf</i> and the amount of accrued interest, see Zimmels, <i>Beiträge zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland</i>, p. 113 foot note 389.</i> as security for a loan of one hundred and ten <i>marks</i>. One son, A, who owns a house but has no income, demands that the pledges be divided among the brothers since he and his family are starving for want of bread. The other brothers refuse to do so for the following reasons: 1) The pledges can not be divided among the brothers unless the girdle and the other objects be cut into pieces; 2) the debtor is powerful throughout the kingdom and if his pledges were damaged he would persecute the brothers and the entire community; 3) the pledges are worth less than the debt due. They, therefore, believe that it would pay to wait till peace is established in the country, at which time they might be able to induce the lord, through bribery, to pay his debt together with the accrued interest thereon. A, on the other hand, claims that in the last three years interest of more than four (hundred) <i>marks</i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i> reads: <span>הלנטנרווא</span> instead of the <span>הלנט נרינא</span> of Pr.

Under the circumstances, A cannot force his brothers to divide the pledges among themselves. If he is pressed for money, he may sell his interest in the pledges and the loan either to his brothers or to a stranger.

<i>Q</i>. R(achel), a widow, entered into the following agreement with B and his wife L(eah): 1) B and his wife undertook to provide food for R and her servant-girl until her death; 2) R, on the other hand, was to give to B and L her late husband's chain valued at fifteen <i>marks</i>; 3) B and his wife were to come to live in R's house (R owned a half interest in a house) and were to pay the interest to the mortgagee of R's house who was a Gentile; 4) in case B or his wife survived R the fifteen <i>marks</i> would be forfeited; and 5) in case both, B and his wife, died before R, she was to receive from their estate fifteen <i>marks</i> minus one-quarter <i>mark</i> for every year from the time of signing the contract. R delivered the chain to B and L. Subsequently B died and L moved to a place where there was no <i>minyan</i>. R demands from L her board and the interest due on the mortgaged house. L claims that she cannot afford to live in one place and provide food for R and her servant in another place. R refuses to leave her city, her daughter, her relatives, and the place where she can pray with a <i>minyan</i>. Can R compel L to provide food for her in R's city; and is not the contract void since in case L died before R and the latter reclaimed her money, the food L provided her with would constitute illegal interest?<br><i>A</i>. L cannot force R to come to live with her, and R can not force L to support her while L is away, for neither of them would have entered into the original agreement had they forseen such eventualities. Moreover, the contract is void since there is a possibility that the food R receives from L would constitute illegal interest on R's money. L, therefore, should deduct from the fifteen <i>marks</i>, the amount she expended on R's food, and return the rest to R.<br><i>Q</i>. R drew an instrument in which she stated that from then on and after her death, her (real) estate should belong to her brother, to certain people and to charity, on condition that she retain the right to sell any part of it if hard pressed for funds with which to feed and clothe herself. R, now, desires to sell part of her property claiming that she needs the money for her sustenance.

If it is known that R is not in dire need of money for her sustenance, she may not sell any part of her property. But if this is not a known fact, R may promise under oath that she will not sell any part of her property unless she will need the money for her sustenance.

Some of A's heirs admit having heard A say before his death that the book was deposited with B as a pledge. Is a <i>Humash</i> classified as an object which is usually borrowed or hired and regarding which a person is, therefore, not believed when he claims to have received it as a pledge?<br><i>A</i>. Throughout the kingdom, Rashi's view is accepted that a <i>Humash</i> is not an object that is usually borrowed or hired. B therefore may take an oath that the book was pledged with him for two <i>marks</i>. However, B should be careful in taking his oath; for, if A did not actually owe him two <i>marks</i>, but promised to give B two <i>marks</i> if the latter effect a reconciliation between A and his son, A became indebted to B only for the latter's wages for the time and effort expended, but not for full two <i>marks</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 1007.

Eliezer, since a loan to a Gentile cannot be sold to a third party?<br><i>A</i>. Since R. Eliezer did not guarantee the loan against default, the thirteen <i>marks</i> he received from A in payment therefor does not constitute a loan, and where there is no loan there can be no usury. Therefore, B is entitled to the <i>mark</i> profit.

<i>Q</i>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B's property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against "a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?" How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?<br><i>A</i>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it. The Torah was very careful, however, not to jeopardize the rights and opportunities of the sellers.<br>The author claims that the same question was sent to him from Neustadt.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 276–7; Pr. 1011; Berl. p. 284 no. 334; B. p. 292, no. 366.

Subsequently he resigned his post as <i>Gabbai</i> and demanded that the community order the new <i>Gabbai</i> to pay him the two <i>marks</i>. When the case appeared at court, A said to the community representatives: "I do not ask anything from you."

It is customary for charity officers to advance their own money when the charity chest is empty and to collect it afterwards. Such officers' claims that money is due them from the chest are believed.

When the case came to our court, we (the judges) decided that the agreement between A and B was an <i>asmakta</i>, and therefore, void. Moreover, even if B's promise to reconcile all those who might protest against the sale, were made before an authoritative court and strengthened by a <i>kinyan</i>, it would be void, since it is incumbent upon the buyer to do "what is just and good in the eyes of the Lord," (namely, to deliver the house to the owner of the adjoining premises), and the seller has nothing to do with it. Subsequently, the neighbor refused to buy B's house. Neither A nor anyone else was willing to pay for the house the amount A had originally offered. B, therefore, sued his neighbor for damages. We (the judges) decided that the neighbor is under no obligation to B since he did not cause B any damage directly.<br><i>A</i>. Your decisions are correct.

But, if there are eleven adult males in the community, no single member can be restrained from leaving; for he does not have to provide for the possibility of another member becoming sick or indisposed. However, if two out of the eleven want to leave, both have to share the expenses of hiring a person to complete the <i>minyan</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. When nine Jews have to hire a tenth in order to complete the <i>minyan</i> (quorum), or when they have to hire a cantor for the holidays, do the members share equally in expenses, or do they pay in proportion to their wealth?<br><i>A</i>. Since the members do not join a large community for the high-holyday prayers because they do not want to leave their homes, their possessions, and their investments, the forming of the local <i>minyan</i> is dependent upon monetary considerations, and the expenses thereof should be shared by the members in proportion to their wealth.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 1016; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned his father-in-law, B, to court and claimed: 1) that B's father-in-law, C, (A's grandfather), bequeathed twenty-five <i>marks</i> to B's two daughters with the provision that if one daughter died childless, the other should inherit her part, and if the second daughter likewise died childless, the twenty-five <i>marks</i> were to go to C's male heirs; 2) that the money was deposited with B; and 3) that after he, A, had been married to B's daughter for two years, the other daughter died while still a minor. A, therefore, demanded the twenty-five <i>marks</i> from B. B, on the other hand, claimed that he had given the twenty-five <i>marks</i> to A as dowry upon the latter's marriage to his daughter. A, however, claimed that upon receiving his dowry he was not told about the twenty-five <i>marks</i> and that B could not have given him that money since the younger daughter was still alive. To this claim B answered that he expected to give his own money to his younger daughter. He further claims that A's wife has no children yet and, therefore, he, B, cannot give anything to A since in case A's wife dies childless, C's heirs will keep him responsible for the money.<br><i>A</i>. B is under no obligation to A for the following reasons: 1) We believe B's claim that he included the money of his departed daughter in A's dowry, since B could have claimed that his younger daughter gave him her money, and this latter claim would have been irrefutable; 2) the father is the rightful heir of the departed daughter since C's provision for the disposition of his gift in case the daughter die childless is void.<br><i>Q</i>. A claims that he has witnesses who will testify that B took from his (A's) father thirty <i>marks</i>. B claims that he returned to A whatever he had taken from his father.<br><i>A</i>. If the witnesses will testify that B robbed A's father, A should take an oath that B did not as yet return the money to him, and be entitled to collect the thirty <i>marks</i> from B. If, however, B received the money from A's father in a legitimate way, B should take an oath that he had paid all the money he owed to his father, and be free from obligation.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 283–4; Pr. 1017; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 227a.

<i>Q</i>. a) A decided to remove from his province and from the jurisdiction of his overlord, and to settle in a town where B and his friends lived. Before taking up his residence under the new overlord he came to an agreement with him regarding the amount of taxes he was to pay, and further arranged to pay such taxes to him directly. A, therefore, refused to participate with the other members of the community whenever they jointly paid their taxes to the overlord. Hence they with B invoked against A the ban proclaimed by the communities against any one who refused to pay his taxes jointly with his community. Did A have the right to pay his taxes independently of the community?<br>b) For many years C resided in a locality where he paid his taxes jointly with D and the other Jews of the surrounding territory. He finally decided to sever his connections with them and made a separate agreement with the overlord to pay him a certain sum as a yearly tax. D and the other taxpayers strongly objected to this and therefore C came to an agreement with D and some of his friends. Others, however, still continued to raise objections to the course undertaken by C. Furthermore, whenever the ban (for nonpayment of taxes) was pronounced, it was couched in general terms which did not exclude C from it. Was C justified in his act?<br>c) Our overlord granted a release from taxation for the first year, to all Jews coming to settle in his territory. This release was granted against the wishes of the Jews already settled there. The new settlers paid no taxes during their first year of settlement in accordance with the above-mentioned release. But when payment of the taxes for the second year fell due, the old settlers, refusing to recognize the release granted by the overlord, forced the new settlers to pay taxes for both the current and the preceding years. Subsequently the overlord died and was succeeded by his son. The new and old settlers paid their taxes regularly without a complaint for many years. This year, however, quarrelsome persons came to settle here and they refused to pay their taxes for the first year because of the release granted by the father of the present overlord. Were they justified in their refusal?<br><i>A</i>. A person settling in a town has no right to isolate himself from the rest of the community and pay his taxes independently. All (Jewish) dwellers in a town are partners in the expenses of maintaining the townwall, the horse guard, the armory and the city gates (B. B. 8a), and must share in paying the town safety tax, in maintaining the free kitchen and the charity chest, and in contributing to similar town expenses, such as a tax to the overlord who is responsible for the safety of the town. Since every town dweller is a partner in these expenses, no partner is permitted (according to talmudic law) to withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners. Moreover, were paying of taxes independently of the community not forbidden by talmudic law, such practice would be proscribed by custom; for throughout the kingdom the custom of considering all taxpayers of a community as partners, and of not allowing anyone to pay his taxes independently, is well established. If not for this rule, equitable distribution of the burden of taxation would be impossible and endless quarrels would ensue, endangering the position of the Jew among his neighbors. Therefore, the community has a right to restrain A (and C) from paying taxes independently, even if only a single member of the community objects to such independent payment of taxes. The community has a right to use persuasion or force upon A and C, by flagellation, ban, or edict of excommunication. You have my full consent to resort to these coercive measures. The same rule applies to the quarrelsome new settlers (referred to in the third query). They must pay their full share of the taxes, even for the first year of their settlement.<br>These queries were sent to R. Meir by the Jews of Stendal. The following statements are appended.<br>I subscribe to the opinion of my teacher and relative, R. Meir, that they can not separate themselves from the community without its permission; for the goods of one town dweller may be mortgaged for the unpaid taxes of another town dweller (B. K. 113b). Moreover, even an idle man must help maintain the town's institutions (B. B. 55a)… signed: Menahem B. Natronai; Menahem b. David.<br>I agree to the above statements of my teachers… . signed: Ephraim b. Nathan; Isaac b. Judah.<br>I also agree with my teachers… . signed: Asher b. Yehiel haLevi.<br>We also agree with our great teachers to ban and anathematize all those who come to settle in a territory where Jews live unless they share the burden of taxes paid to the king and overlords. Signed: The community of Erfurt.<br>Whatever the new settler agreed to pay to the overlord and whatever the community agreed to pay, must be lumped together, and each member of the community must pay his share of this sum in proportion to his wealth and means.

R. Jacob, the cantor of Magdeburg, died and left a son, Hizkiyahu, who was worthy to succeed his father as cantor of Magdeburg, though inferior to him in some qualities. A majority of the membership of the Magdeburg community wanted the son to succeed his father, but a minority of possibly one or more strongly objected to the son. R. Moses b. Hisdai was asked for his opinion in the matter. He advised Hizkiyahu to try any measure in his power to ingratiate himself with the objectors. He asked the leaders of the community to direct their efforts toward effecting a reconciliation with the opposing faction, and expressed his opinion that a single person could not defy the will of the entire community. R. Isaac b. Moses (of Vienna) stated that according to Biblical Law a community could not hire a cantor to whom there was objection even by a single person. R. Meir stated his opinion that a cantor might officiate throughout the year even though not acceptable to a few congregants, but that he was not permitted to officiate on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i> or on fast days, if even a single congregant found him objectionable.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 109–11; <i>Or Zarua</i> I, 21a.

<i>Q</i>. A drop of milk fell upon the outside of a boiling pot of meat. The volume of the pot and its contents was more than sixty times that of the milk. Are the contents of the pot as well as the pot itself fit for use?<br><i>A</i>. In France I witnessed a great controversy over this matter. But, at the time, I failed to inquire into the reasons of both those who permitted and those who forbade the use of the pot and its contents. I also discovered that Ri forbade the use of the pot and its contents, probably for the reason that the drop of milk first rendered the pot unfit for use, and the pot, in turn, rendered its contents unfit for use.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 121.

Even if B had not, as yet, paid for the horse, the burden is upon him to prove that the horse was injured while in A's possession. If he cannot produce such proof, A is to swear that when he sold the horse to B he did not know that the horse was injured.

<i>Q</i>. A scribe was hired to copy a complete book. Is such a scribe permitted to resign before he has completed his task?<br><i>A</i>. A contractor, a worker hired for the completion of a certain task and not hired by the day or week, is not permitted to resign before his task is completed. A scribe, however, is not permitted to resign even though he was hired for a specific period of time, and was thus not classified as a contractor; for the resignation of a scribe involves a definite loss of money to the person who hired him, as a book copied by two scribes is not uniform in appearance and, thus, commands a low price.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 247; L. 123; Mord.

If the property was set aside by A to be used in payment of his wife's <i>ketubah</i> in case of divorce or his death, or, if it originally formed part of the wife's dowry, the sale is invalid.

<i>Q</i>. Many candles are usually lit in the synagogue on the morning of a holiday. Some persons want to forbid such a practice on the ground that the light of a candle is useless in the daytime, and one is not permitted on a holiday to light a candle the light of which serves no use.<br><i>A</i>. The light of many candles in the synagogue, whether in daytime or at night, enhances the spirit of festivity and rejoicing. Were it not for this reason, the practice of lighting many candles in the synagogue for Friday evening services, when a holiday falls on Friday, would be forbidden, since services are usually over before dark and the candles are not needed for their light; and the lighting of many candles on a holiday night would be forbidden, since a single candle dispels darkness. The practice referred to is, therefore, perfectly in order.<br>R. Meir added: Please forgive me for not having answered your questions. I was very busy and forgot to answer. I even lost your letter.

a) <i>Q</i>. Is a person who reached his majority, permitted to appoint a legal representative to argue his case in court? The Palestinian Talmud (Sanh. 2, 1) definitely implies that a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative.<br><i>A</i>. The statement in the Palestinian Talmud does not necessarily imply that an ordinary person is permitted to appoint a legal representative. It is possible that only a high priest is permitted to appoint such a representative, in order to save him the humiliation of appearing before a court having less authority than himself; but an ordinary person may not be permitted to make the appointment. In any case, all are agreed that a levir is not permitted to appoint a legal representative when his brother's widow demands that he fulfill the positive command (of God) to perform the ceremony of <i>halitzah</i> or to marry her. Moreover, a person commits a wrong when he consents to become a legal representative to a levir, thus helping to postpone the fulfillment of this positive command, and injuring the interests of the widow.<br>b) <i>Q</i>. Is a legal representative permitted to present before the court claims and arguments that will improve his client's case but which he knows to be false?<br><i>A</i>.

A person is not permitted to produce musical sounds on the Sabbath, and some authorities believe (Ulla, in Erub. 104 a) that one is not permitted to produce on the Sabbath any sound that will serve a specific purpose.

It is not necessary to write the Scroll of the Law in such a manner that each column begin with the letter <i>Vaw</i>.

The fly contaminated neither the soup, nor the bowl nor the plates. For the fly probably fell into the bowl when the soup was no longer boiling. Moreover, the law stating that a creature is never neutralized in a mixture, is applicable only to cases where the creature is not removed from the mixture.

A Jew is not permitted to offer a Gentile forbidden wine (<i>yayin nesek</i> — wine touched by a Gentile). I often wondered how this custom, to offer forbidden wine to Gentiles, became so widely accepted. If the perpetrators had been duly warned against this practice and did not heed the warning, they need no longer be disturbed; for it is better that they transgress innocently than rebelliously. Our own wine, of course, we are permitted to offer to a Gentile (although this wine becomes <i>yayin nesek</i> as soon as the Gentile touches it).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 145.

<i>Q</i>. When, on occasion, the stocks of wine in our locality are completely exhausted, are we justified in assuming that our beer is "the wine of the country" and thus may be used as wine for all religious purposes?<br><i>A</i>. The term "wine of the country" is applied to a drink when no real wine is available throughout an entire country. Thus no wine is available in Westphalia. But, there is an abundance of wine throughout your country. Moreover, even in your locality wine is available in large quantities most of the year. If toward the end of the year a shortage develops, you have no right to call your beer "the wine of the country". Knowing how superior wine is, and how much it is preferred to other drinks for <i>kiddush</i> and other religious uses, you should provide yourself with enough wine to last throughout the year.

Meir wrote to the Rabbis of Spiers not to ascribe legal absurdities to R. Nahman; for such interpretation of the words of R. Nahman was not only in opposition to an explicit statement of the <i>Mishna</i> (B. M. 9, 13) but was even against the very words of the Pentateuch (Deut. 24,10).

Solomon, of France: The tutor must be paid in full; for a tutor is in a similar position as the public workers of Mahoza who are reported to become weakened by lack of work (B. M. 77a). However, the following distinction should be made: If A's son was a sickly child, and A failed to warn the tutor about it, the tutor should get his full pay; but if the boy was usually healthy, the tutor should not be paid for the period of his pupil's illness.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 191; Pr. 137; L. 157; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A married off his sons and gave them marriage gifts. Subsequently A died.

<i>Q</i>. How much money is a woman entitled to collect as her <i>ketubah</i>, upon divorce or the death of her husband?<br><i>A</i>. The amount of money to which a woman is entitled as her <i>ketubah</i>, is dependent on local custom. In Würzburg and its vicinity, the dowry and the additional jointure are valued at one hundred pounds of two <i>marks</i> per pound; in the Rhine communities, it seems to me, they are valued at one hundred <i>marks</i>. These sums do not include the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> of two hundred <i>zuzim</i>, or five hundred pennyweights of silver, each <i>zuz</i> equalling two and one half pennyweights of silver. If no custom, as to the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, exists in your town, you should follow the custom of the town where the wedding took place. If no such custom exists there, you ought to follow the custom of the community nearest to you to which you usually look for guidance. But, if no such custom exists in the latter, the women of your locality are entitled to collect one hundred pounds of the coins current there, plus five hundred pennyweights of silver. Before a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> she must take an oath that she did not give away or waste (while her husband was alive or after his death) anything belonging to her husband, and that she did not retain anything for herself. Everything she takes from the husband's house, such as her bedding or her clothes even, is to be appraised and deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>. The orphans are to pay the balance due her either in real property or in moveable property, whichever they prefer.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 182; <i>Tashbetz</i>, 457.

<i>Q</i>. Does the law requiring a blank space the width of a column at the end of the Scroll of the Law, apply to the Scroll of Esther?<br><i>A</i>. The Scroll of Esther is called a book and, also, a letter. Therefore, all the laws governing the writing of books apply also to the Scroll of Esther. However, since it is also called a letter, only three (<i>Tashbetz</i>: ten) of its seams are required to be sewed with dried tendons, the others may be sewed with threads of flax.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 183; <i>Tashbetz</i> 180; cf.

In a new town it is forbidden to introduce the custom of giving presents to Gentile servants on <i>Purim</i>. R. Ephraim applied to this custom the verse: "and I multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal (Hos. 2, 10)."

<i>Q</i>. Are we permitted to eat butter bought from Gentiles?<br><i>A</i>. R. Tam, Ri, and some of the Geonim (in their Responsa), permit the use of such butter. However, R. Nathan of Africa writes in a Responsum, (found among my Geonic Responsa), that until now the use of such butter was permitted, but since the Gentiles began to mix forbidden fat with their butter, we anathematize all persons who eat it. Moreover, throughout Germany, excepting the towns bordering on France, the custom is well established not to eat such butter. But, since the former great authorities have permitted its use, we do not declare unfit the vessels wherein the butter of Gentiles was fried, even if it was so used by persons who usually do not eat it.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 193.

<i>Q</i>. The Mishna (Meg. 6b.) states: "The only difference between the first (month of) <i>Adar</i> and the second <i>Adar</i> consists in reading the scroll of Esther and giving presents to the poor." Does this statement mean that we ought to celebrate <i>Purim</i> on the fourteenth of the first <i>Adar</i> (in a leap-year) and fast on the thirteenth of this month?<br><i>A</i>. No, the above cited statement means that the reading of the scroll of Esther on the fourteenth of the first <i>Adar</i>, even though it was so read before the leap-year was decided on, does not free one from the obligation of reading the scroll on the second <i>Adar</i>. The statement does not mean that all other laws connected with <i>Purim</i> apply to the first <i>Adar</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 195; <i>Tashbetz</i> 178.

<i>Q</i>. A is the owner of a vineyard. Is he permitted to plant in it branches of a vine that has not yet borne fruit?<br><i>A</i>. Whether the branches are taken from a vine that has already borne fruit, or from one that has not yet borne fruit makes no difference. For the life of the new vine begins with the time the branch is planted in the ground. Even if the branch bore fruit before it was replanted, nevertheless, its fruit after replanting will be <i>Orlah</i> for three years. The fruit of the fourth year may be eaten after redeeming it for a penny, grinding the penny and throwing it into the river. However, the fruit from a branch of an old vine, planted in the ground without severing it from the old vine, may be eaten even during the first year.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 196; <i>Tashbetz</i> 365.

Siman 197

<i>Q</i>. A claims that B lent him money on a pledge, and that when he came to redeem the pledge B exacted interest from him. Since he had contracted the loan directly from B, the latter was not allowed to take any interest on this loan. A, therefore, demands that B pay him back the interest. B, on the other hand, claims that the loan was originally contracted through a Gentile intermediary and that he was entitled, therefore, to the interest.<br><i>A</i>. It is assumed that a person who might have gained an advantage by following a certain legal procedure, did not fail to follow such procedure. Since B could legally have been entitled to interest on his money had he granted the loan through a Gentile intermediary, we assume that he did grant the loan through such intermediary. Therefore, B is entitled to his interest and is not required to take an oath.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 197.

<i>Q</i>. A lent money to B on condition that they share equally in the profits. After a Sabbatical year passed, B refused to pay his debt to A, claiming that the Sabbatical year released him from the obligation. A is ignorant of the fact that were he to claim that he had a <i>prosbol</i>, which was lost, he could collect his debt in full. May the judge inform A of his rights?<br><i>A</i>. No, he may not. In talmudic times, people often wrote <i>prosbols</i>; therefore, a judge was allowed to inform a creditor of his right to claim that he had had a <i>prosbol</i> but lost it. Nowadays, however, people rarely write <i>prosbols</i> and a judge is not permitted to suggest to a creditor to put forth an unusual claim.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 972; L. 198; Rashba I, 1075; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A engaged a tutor for his son for one year. After the tutor had entered upon his duties, he was requested by A to leave. When the tutor had gone, A changed his mind and demanded that the tutor return to fulfill the terms of his agreement. The tutor, however, refuses to return, and claims that A released him from all obligations when he ordered him to leave.<br><i>A</i>. A verbal release is not binding when the obligation is personal [such as the obligation of a slave or a tutor]. Moreover, the tutor is under an obligation to A's son, and A had no right to release the tutor from such obligation. Therefore, the latter must resume his teaching of A's son.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 125; Pr. 77; L. 205; Rashba I, 873; Mord. B. M. 346; <i>Agudah</i> B. M. 118. Cf.

<i>Q</i>. A lent a silver key to B's wife. She says that she has lost the key. Has A any claim upon B, or his wife, for the value of the key?<br><i>A</i>. Most authorities agree that a person cannot collect from the husband the value of an object lent to, or deposited with, his wife, and lost by her, even in cases where she is a business woman conducting her husband's affairs with his full knowledge and consent. But a ban should be pronounced in the synagogue against those persons (including B's wife) who have the silver key in their possession and do not return it to A, and also against those persons who may receive such key in the future and will not return it to its owner. Moreover, A should receive a court decision entitling him to collect from B's wife, should she become widowed or divorced, an amount equal to the value of the key. A clause should be included in the decision providing that in case of a dispute between A and B's wife regarding the value of the key, it will be incumbent upon her to take an oath as to the value of the key.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 206.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that he deposited with B eleven and a quarter <i>marks</i>, and that B undertook to repay him that sum in Frankfort. B claims that A gave him the money on condition that he return it to A immediately after a meal they partook [and that meanwhile the money was stolen from him].<br><i>A</i>. The only proper method to safeguard money is to bury it in the ground (B.M. 42a). Keeping another person's money in the same place one keeps one's own, is not sufficient, for, a person may be careless with his own money, but he has no right to be careless with that of another. However, if B was expected to return the money immediately after the meal, then he was not supposed to bury it in the ground for the short time he was to keep it. Therefore, B must take an oath that he was to return the money after the meal, that he kept the money in the same place he kept his own, and that he was not unduly careless in handling it — and he would then be free from obligation.<br>The names of the litigants are given as R. Meir and R. Eliezer. Our author agrees with the opinion of those who sent the query to him.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 207.

Siman 208

<i>Q</i>. A claims that B owed him three and three-eighths <i>marks</i>, that B gave him valuables to pledge with the charity treasurers for a loan of the same amount (the money of which A was to take in payment of the above debt), that B asked him to pledge with the charity treasurers additional valuables of his own, which he (A) was to lend to B, should B's valuables prove insufficient security for the loan, and that B promised to redeem these valuables. A, therefore, demands that B redeem his pledges. B, while conceding the above, claims that originally A lent him only three <i>marks</i>; that the additional three-eighths of a <i>mark</i> A is demanding, constitutes the interest on this loan; and that such interest is unlawful usury from Jew to Jew since the loan was made by A directly to him [without a Gentile intermediary].<br><i>A</i>. B must take an oath that the three-eighths of a <i>mark</i> constitutes interest on a loan made directly to him, and thus be free from obligation for this sum. Although by taking this oath B will incriminate himself [since borrowing money on interest is also a sin] such oath will have full legal effect when applied against A. For the testimony of a witness that incriminates the witness himself, is nevertheless acceptable as valid testimony against, or in support of, the litigants (Sanh. 25 a).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 208.

<i>Q</i>. A lent money to B. Before repayment was due, the coins were discontinued and new coins were issued in their stead weighing more than the old coins. The increase in weight, however, was less than twenty-five percent (cf. B. K. 98a). How is B to repay his debt to A?<br><i>A</i>. If A specified at the time the loan was made that he was to be repaid a certain number of coins, B must repay him the same number of new coins, though he will thus repay more precious metal than what he borrowed, since an increase in the metal of less than twenty-five percent does not affect prices. But, if A did not specify the manner of repayment, he is to receive the same amount of precious metal as he lent to B, in new coins.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 209.

<i>Q</i>. A vowed to quit gambling and promised to give one <i>mark</i> for a holy cause should he break his vow. He subsequently gave money to a friend to gamble for him.

If the phrase "I will not gamble again" includes, in common parlance, gambling by proxy, he must pay the fine. If, however, the implications of the phrase in common speech can not be determined, we must follow Biblical use of terms. In Biblical law a person is responsible for the acts of his agent unless the agent himself commits a sin by carrying out his mission.

a) <i>Q</i>. M(eir) settled in the town T and lived there for many years buying houses and planting vineyards and groves. While he was alive certain persons contested his right to settle in T, but R. Judah ha-Kohen confirmed M's settling-rights. Now (after M's death) some inhabitants of T seek to oust M's son-in-law claiming that M possessed no settling rights in T.<br><i>A</i>. Since R. Judah, my teacher and relative, acting in his official capacity as judge, confirmed M's settling-rights, no one is permitted to contest these rights of M. For, R. Judah deserves complete reliance on, and respect for his decisions. Therefore, you ought to silence all contestants by decree.<br>b) You state in your letter that two years ago you inquired of me regarding R. Isaac son of Rehabiah whose settling right was contested by the leading inhabitants of the town and that at that time we (?) had confirmed R. Isaac's right on the following grounds: a) witnesses testified that his father dwelt in this town for a year or two without disturbance; b) after his father's death he dwelt here for three years without disturbance; and c) in such cases the court puts forth the claim (for the heir) that had the father been alive he would have claimed to have bought (or obtained) settling-rights from the other dwellers of the town (and would have needed no further evidence under the circumstances). I have heard my teacher R. Judah ha-Kohen decide cases of settling-rights-disputes on the grounds quoted above; but I do not believe that such decisions are correct. According to talmudic law, undisturbed possession is not a factor in disputes involving settling-rights. Persons dwelling on their property during its occupancy by another, do not have to protest such occupancy since they are always in possession of their property (B.B. 29b). Therefore, the failure of the inhabitants of the town to protest against R. Isaac's settling in their midst, is of no consequence, and the decision given above is, indeed, faulty. However, it is possible that my teacher (R. Judah) arrived at such decision by following not talmudic law but community practice. Many communities accept, as legal, methods of proving a person's settling-rights that have no basis in, and that are entirely unacceptable to, talmudic law. For, settling rights are governed by the customs and practices of each particular community. The customs of the various communities differ from one another and are not at all dependent on strict talmudic law. R. Judah, therefore, finding a parallel in talmudic law, wanted to institute the custom of accepting undisturbed possession as a method of proving a person's settling rights. This custom ought to be followed in the communities where R. Judah instituted it (in deference to this scholar), and is in itself worthy to be followed in other communities as well.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 213.

<i>Q</i>. What is the custom of your locality regarding the admission of the testimony of a single witness as evidence, or of a witness reporting what he had heard from an eye-witness, in disputes involving settling rights?<br><i>A</i>. We have no definite custom regarding these laws, for we never had a case of this nature. Were we confronted with such a problem, we would inquire of the communities as to the ruling accepted by them.<br>This Responsum was written by R. Meir in his youth, but in later life he decided that in disputes involving settling-rights, even the testimony of relatives or of witnesses reporting what they had heard from others, should be admitted in evidence; for, in such disputes, it is almost impossible to produce legitimate witnesses. The inhabitants of a town are the only ones who know whether or not a person possesses settling-rights, but such inhabitants are interested witnesses. Moreover, even they rarely remember what had happened years ago, and merely report vague memories, impressions, and hearsay. Therefore, when two groups of witnesses contradict each other, we admit the testimony of the group that has the most members. But usucapion is not a factor in proving settling-rights, since a person may have received permission to stay in town for a limited time only (Tesh. Maim.).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 214; Tesh.

The <i>pardekat</i> may claim that his opportunities of obtaining bargains or of finding, by chance, lost objects, have decreased since A came to settle in that town; that there has been a rise in house rents; and that he has suffered in many other ways from A's settling in this town.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned B to court contesting his settling-rights in T. The court upheld B's rights. The other inhabitants of T now want to summon B to court again, on the ground that they have additional claims and arguments that would bolster their case against B. It is my opinion that they have forfeited their right to a retrial since they were in T during the first trial and failed to present their claims and arguments at the time.<br><i>A</i>. Your opinion is correct. The inhabitants of T should have brought forth their claims and arguments at the original trial. For the same reason, a person summoned to court by a single inhabitant must not fail to answer the summons, on the ground that he wants to answer the claims of all the inhabitants at a single trial and does not wish to appear in court repeatedly with each individual inhabitant, since all claims against him should be brought forth during his trial when summoned by the single inhabitant or be permanently dismissed.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 216; B. p. 292, no. 367.

<i>Q</i>. A promised under oath to move out of T before the first of <i>Iyyar</i> or pay one <i>mark</i> to charity. The inhabitants of T claimed that A did not faithfully fulfill his promise, and they gave the following reasons: a) A did not move out of T since he had settled within the Sabbath limits (2000 cubits) of the town; b) he did not pay any taxes to the Cologne community, probably because he contended that he was still an inhabitant of T; c) he occasionally returned to T to collect his debts. Thus, A never intended to keep his promise; he was only trying to evade his oath; he, therefore, was obligated to pay one <i>mark</i> to charity. A, on the other hand, claimed that he had moved outside of the Sabbath limits of T into the jurisdiction of another overlord; that he had asked the tax collectors of Cologne to free him from the tax, because he had as yet not decided where to settle; that R. Jacob had told him that he, A, had fulfilled his promise properly; and that R. Jacob had, therefore, freed him from his obligation.<br>A. Even though A settled only within two thousand cubits of T, he had really moved out of T proper and had thus fulfilled his promise; for the outskirts of a town are not part of the town (as far as oaths or vows are concerned, cf. Ned. 56b). Moreover, it was just A's good fortune that he did not have to pay taxes to the Cologne community, because he was regarded as an inhabitant of T. We are in no position to determine whether or not A intended to keep his promise; and we have no right to fine A because of our suspicions or because we question his true intentions. However, in order to allay all suspicion, I advised A to make a statement, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, to the effect that he intended to fulfill his promise faithfully.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 217.

<i>Q</i>. A's widow and son, through their representative, summoned B, A's brother, before us. The representative claimed that A had given wine to B for the purpose of transporting it to Magdeburg and selling it there, and that B bartered this wine for a horse. He demanded, therefore, that B return the horse either to the widow, in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, or to the orphan who was the rightful heir. B claimed that he had become surety to a Gentile for a loan of five and one quarter <i>marks</i>, contracted by A, that A's wife had vowed to repay this debt and release him from his suretyship; that A had given him the wine for the purpose of selling it and buying his release with that money; that the horse was worth only three <i>marks</i>, and that the widow, therefore, still owed him two and one quarter <i>marks</i>. The representative, however, claimed that A had effected B's release from his suretyship. We decided, temporarily, that B should take an oath to the effect that he has as yet not been released from his suretyship and that he had received the wine for the purpose of buying such release; in which case he should be entitled to retain the horse. However, before B took the prescribed oath, he sold the horse for six pounds, which now had a value of four and one-quarter <i>marks</i>, and he made a settlement with the Gentile (A's creditor for the 5¼ <i>marks</i>) to pay him one <i>mark</i> per year for six years. B wanted to give the six pounds to his mother-in-law for investment purposes, she promising to pay the one <i>mark</i> per year for six years to the Gentile. The representative, however, claimed that B was in possession of an amount equal to the value of the horse only and that B must pay out of his own pocket the difference between this amount and the amount due the Gentile. He demanded that B return the six pounds to the widow and her son, who were willing to provide sureties to the Gentile guaranteeing the payment of one <i>mark</i> per year for six years. B, on the other hand, claimed that he was entitled to benefit from the advantageous settlement he negotiated with A's creditor; that being able to release himself completely from his suretyship by his shrewdness in the use of the four and one-quarter <i>marks</i>, he was entitled to do so; and that he was taking a risk since (the coins comprising) the six pounds were almost certain to be invalidated and be worth less than four and one quarter <i>marks</i>. Moreover, B claimed that A had promised to pay him for his efforts in selling the wine, and that he had guaranteed another debt of A which had not been paid. We shall follow your decision in this matter.

<i>Q</i>. A's widow and son, through their representative, summoned B, A's brother, before us. The representative claimed that A had given wine to B for the purpose of transporting it to Magdeburg and selling it there, and that B bartered this wine for a horse. He demanded, therefore, that B return the horse either to the widow, in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, or to the orphan who was the rightful heir. B claimed that he had become surety to a Gentile for a loan of five and one quarter <i>marks</i>, contracted by A, that A's wife had vowed to repay this debt and release him from his suretyship; that A had given him the wine for the purpose of selling it and buying his release with that money; that the horse was worth only three <i>marks</i>, and that the widow, therefore, still owed him two and one quarter <i>marks</i>. The representative, however, claimed that A had effected B's release from his suretyship. We decided, temporarily, that B should take an oath to the effect that he has as yet not been released from his suretyship and that he had received the wine for the purpose of buying such release; in which case he should be entitled to retain the horse. However, before B took the prescribed oath, he sold the horse for six pounds, which now had a value of four and one-quarter <i>marks</i>, and he made a settlement with the Gentile (A's creditor for the 5¼ <i>marks</i>) to pay him one <i>mark</i> per year for six years. B wanted to give the six pounds to his mother-in-law for investment purposes, she promising to pay the one <i>mark</i> per year for six years to the Gentile. The representative, however, claimed that B was in possession of an amount equal to the value of the horse only and that B must pay out of his own pocket the difference between this amount and the amount due the Gentile. He demanded that B return the six pounds to the widow and her son, who were willing to provide sureties to the Gentile guaranteeing the payment of one <i>mark</i> per year for six years. B, on the other hand, claimed that he was entitled to benefit from the advantageous settlement he negotiated with A's creditor; that being able to release himself completely from his suretyship by his shrewdness in the use of the four and one-quarter <i>marks</i>, he was entitled to do so; and that he was taking a risk since (the coins comprising) the six pounds were almost certain to be invalidated and be worth less than four and one quarter <i>marks</i>. Moreover, B claimed that A had promised to pay him for his efforts in selling the wine, and that he had guaranteed another debt of A which had not been paid. We shall follow your decision in this matter. Furthermore, please inform us whether or not B may exact an oath from the widow to the effect that she did not vow to release him from his suretyship.<br><i>A</i>. B has no claim on the money he received for the horse if his complete release from his suretyship is effected in other ways, especially since he had as yet not taken the required oath. Since the widow and her son are willing to guarantee such a release, B must return that money to them. However, if B take an oath to the effect that A owed him a certain amount of money, either for his effort in selling the wine or for becoming surety for another debt, he will be entitled to retain such an amount.

<i>Q</i>. A and B appeared in court. A claimed that two years previously he had lent money belonging to orphans to B for investment purposes on condition that the orphans share equally in the profits as well as in the losses. He demanded that B return this money since B was not financially as well off as he had been two years previously and might lose the orphans' money. B, on the other hand, claimed that the money was given to him by the grandfather and mother of the orphans with the condition that he do not return it under any circumstances, not even to themselves, until the orphans grow up and get married; that he now intended to abide by this agreement even though the grandfather died meanwhile and his heirs have demanded the return of this money; and that he was richer at this time than two years previously, since at that time he owned no real estate while now he did, and also had property of his own.<br><i>A</i>. If the grandfather and the mother of the orphans were not trustees — never having been duly appointed by the court, the father of the orphans, or the orphans themselves — they had no right to administer the latter's money. Therefore, the agreements they had entered into regarding this money, were void. If they were duly appointed as trustees for the orphans, they ought to be discharged for lending money belonging to orphans without adequate security, and without receiving notes of indebtedness, and on terms injurious to the orphans' interests; since according to the agreement the orphans were to share in the losses, as well as in the profits, resulting from B's transactions. Such money must be lent to a rich and trustworthy man, on adequate security, and on condition that the orphans share only in the profits but not in the losses. Any trustee not heeding this rule could be discharged without notice for damaging the orphans' interests, and the agreements he had entered into would become void at the time he was discharged. Since B admitted that the money lent to him belonged to orphans, and that it was lent to him on conditions injurious to the latter, the agreement he entered into with the trustees of said orphans, was void, and he had to return the money.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 211; L. 220; Tesh.

When his wife learned about it, she protested against the gifts to the sister and to charity. Does her protest invalidate these gifts?<br><i>A</i>. A woman's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien upon her husband's property. Since even the husband's consecration of his possessions is ineffective, as it does not remove the wife's lien upon them, his giving them away to charity is surely ineffective.

I lend out the charity funds in my possession for investment purposes only, to share equally in the profits and the losses; but I do not lend these funds on interest.<br>R. Meir adds: What you claim to have heard in my name that when a person gives a certain sum to charity he may consecrate it and be permitted to lend it on interest, then redeem it against a penny and throw the penny into the river, is untrue.

The Talmud provides that such money be invested with a rich and trustworthy person, one who obeys the laws of the Torah and is careful not to bring upon himself a ban of the Rabbis. It should be invested on condition that the orphans share in the profits but not in the losses (B. M. 70 a). To invest such money in mortgages on houses, fields, or vineyards, is preferable, since money may be lost but land lasts forever. The written contract attesting the transaction, should be deposited with a trustworthy person or with the trustee of the orphans. But, we are not permitted to lend such money on a definite rate of interest.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 235.

Subsequently A married and his second wife bore him a daughter. Before his death A sought witnesses to attest to his will that his daughter should inherit part of his estate, but he was overtaken by sudden death. Are we to assume that in the agreement referred to above A intended to give to a daughter the status of a son?<br><i>A</i>. The term "sons" when used in vows does not include daughters. Moreover, a person who has sons has no right to give his daughter the status of an heir.

Although nowadays, because of the ordinance of the Saburaim, a woman collects her <i>ketubah</i>, and all other obligations stipulated therein, from movables, the dowry of a daughter is not an obligation included in the <i>ketubah</i>, and, therefore, is not included in the abovementioned ordinance.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 237; cf.

<i>Q</i>. A was ready to take an oath denying B's claim. When he noticed, however, that B was going to insert in the oath a denial of a former claim B had had against him, A decided to pay B's present claim in order to avoid taking such an oath. Will A, upon such payment, be free from the obligation of taking an oath, or must he pay both claims before being free from this obligation?<br><i>A</i>. Nowadays a person is required to take an oath whenever he denies any claims made against him, whether such denial is complete or partial, whether the claim involves immovables or movables. Therefore, the problem stated above does not exist nowadays. Let A pay B as much as he wants to pay. If B will put forth further claims against A, the latter must either pay such claims or take an oath. In former days, however, when certain claims if denied required no oath, the Rabbis differed in their opinions whether or not the defendant be required to take an oath regarding an earlier claim, in cases similar to the above.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 270; L. 238.

A person who brings up an orphan in his house is in the same position as the orphan's father. Therefore, the phrase "our son" is quite appropriate. Moreover, the phrase in the document "to our mother so and so the daughter of so and so"… referring to A's mother-in-law, does not invalidate that part of the document as long as the name of the mother-in-law is given.

A mere claim to the effect that the articles had formed part of her <i>ketubah</i> would have been insufficient.

The ban of Rabbenu Gershon against divorcing one's wife without her consent, was not directed against those husbands who perform meritorious deeds by divorcing their wives. However, since A's wife claims that she was not forewarned of the consequences of her deed, and A can produce no witnesses to prove that she was so forewarned, she will be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i> after receiving her divorce.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 245; Hag.

<i>Q</i>. The burghers forced some Jews to take an oath on the Scroll of the Law that they would not clip the coins. While taking the oath the Jews made mental reservations, to their verbal statements, which they believed invalidated the oath. They proceeded, therefore, to clip the coins.<br><i>A</i>. Whether or not one has taken an oath not to clip coins, the doing so is a serious crime, the perpetrators of which deserve severe punishment. Clipping coins is tantamount to stealing and robbing, and robbing Gentiles is a crime. Furthermore, such an act creates a public nuisance as it may result in causing great injury to other Jews innocently passing on these coins. It may even cause widespread disaster, and has already led to a great deal of bloodshed. Thus, clipping coins brought about the destruction of our brethren in France and Britain. In addition to committing a basic crime, these Jews broke their solemn oath to the burghers. Mental reservations do not invalidate an oath occasioned by legal circumstances. The talmudic ruling (Ned. 28a) that a person may invalidate his oath to extortionists and murderers by mental reservations, does not apply in this case; for, while extortionists and murderers, by administering an oath, strive to bolster their criminal purposes, it is legal and proper for a king or civil authority to forbid the clipping of coins. Therefore, their oath to the burghers was valid despite their mental reservations. Moreover, when the Gentiles will learn that the Jews clipped coins despite their oath — and they are bound to discover it sooner or later — they will suspect the Jews of wilfully breaking their oath. Should the latter inform the Gentiles that they disregarded their oath because of mental reservations, the consequences might be still more serious; for Gentiles will never again believe a Jew under oath. Therefore, if your authority and my authority carry enough weight, these Jews should be properly flogged.<br>This Responsum is addressed to: "My teacher Rabbi Judah."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 246; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 337c.

But, if the articles can not be so identified, or, if no one saw them in R's possession, R must take an oath that she received them as an outright gift. We would have to accept such an oath because of the principle of <i>Miggo</i>, since, in the absence of witnesses, R could have denied the charge altogether. However, if witnesses testify, or R herself admits, that the gift was made to her <i>causa mortis</i> — R must return the valuables to A, since L's final statement before the witnesses voided all previous <i>causa mortis</i> gifts.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 180; L. 249; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. In the dispute between A and B the court found that B owed A money. A demanded either immediate payment, or that B put up a bond to insure such payment. B, however, asked for the usual thirty days' interval in which to carry out the decision of the court. Are A's demands justified?<br><i>A</i>. B is entitled to the thirty days' interval. The system of justice current in Israel is guaranty enough for A that after the thirty days will have passed the court will enforce its ruling. The reason for allowing a person only thirty days within which to comply with a court's decision, while, according to the Talmud, an <i>adrakta</i> is written after a ninety day interval, is this: An <i>adrakta</i> is written when the court finds no property from which to collect; but, if the property of the debtor is within reach, a judgment is enforced after the thirty days' interval has passed.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 267; P. 297.

<i>Q</i>. The oil-lamp of our synagogue emits a dense smoke which causes damage to the congregants and occasionally compels them to leave the synagogue altogether. Some persons have donated money for the purpose of buying oil for the synagogue.

The purpose for which the money was given may be changed by the members of the synagogue (though it can not be so changed by the donor) for the following reasons: a) Preparing an object for sacred use does not sanctify the object until it is actually used for such purpose; b) candles and oil used in a synagogue are not intrinsically sacred; nor are they even considered <i>tashmishe kedushah</i> (objects used for a sacred function) since they are not indispensable to the function of the synagogue.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 269; P. 299–300.<br><br>

<i>Q</i>. Is a matchmaker entitled to collect his full fee [even if it is out of all proportion to the time and effort spent in consummating the match]?<br><i>A</i>. A person who is not a professional matchmaker is entitled to compensation in accordance with the time and effort spent in concluding the match. But, a professional matchmaker is entitled to his full fee since he could have earned the same amount had he devoted his time and energy to another match. However, even the professional matchmaker is not entitled to his full fee unless it be almost certain that he could have earned the same amount from another match. Thus, the case came before me of a matchmaker whom a man promised a sum of money upon successfully concluding a match between himself and a certain woman. After the match was concluded and the man paid the promised sum to the matchmaker, the latter demanded a particular sum from the woman, claiming that she had also promised to pay him a fee. The woman denied his claim. I freed the woman from obligation for the following reason: Even if the woman promised a fee to the matchmaker he would not be entitled to collect it since he occupied himself with this match because of the money promised to him by her husband. The woman's promise of a fee to the matchmaker and the effort he spent as a consequence thereof, did not deprive him of any income, since his time had to be spent anyway on consummating this match.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 308.

A gave the valuables to C in order that he deliver them to B should a certain condition not be fulfilled. Such a transaction is called <i>asmakhta</i> and is not binding since it was not made before an authoritative court.

R. Isaac left his wife Sarah in the month of <i>Adar</i> of the year 5031 (1271), and travelled to a distant place in search of sustenance for his family. Next year he learned that his wife had played the harlot and had thus become pregnant. He returned home, and in the month of <i>Ab</i> of the year 5032 (1272) he appeared before us and asked us to investigate his wife's conduct during his absence, since she bore a child in the month of Adar of the same year (1272), twelve months after he had left her. Sarah asserted, however, that she was pregnant when her husband left her. Therefore we, the undersigned, wrote to R. Shealtiel and his two sons, who lived in the same village with Sarah, and they testified in writing that Sarah bore a child twelve months after R. Isaac left her. The signatures and seals of the deponents have been attested to by reliable witnesses. Then, a person appeared before us because of the ban (proclaimed against all those who knew anything relating to this case and did not appear as witnesses) and testified that on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i> of the previous year (1271) he went to Sarah's home in order to recite the <i>kiddush</i> in her presence, and found Gentiles, loafers, who caroused with her, caressed and embraced her. We concluded, therefore, that she must have become pregnant at that time. Other persons testified to have seen her on <i>Purim</i> of this year (1272) in the last stages of pregnancy. On previous occasions, however, in the month of <i>Elul</i>, she violently protested that she was not pregnant, and cursed and abused those who had said to her that she was pregnant. Moreover, before the evil report reached the town, Sarah's father appeared before us and asked us to allow him to put his daughter to death by drowning her. When asked for his reasons, he stated that a daughter of his (meaning Sarah) was an incorrigible harlot, who bore a bastard daughter by a Gentile and then killed her child. When asked whether he tried other means of controlling her, he answered that whenever he reproved her she threatened to apostatize altogether and pleaded that she was not the first woman who ever sinned. She had left the house on a number of occasions but was persuaded to return by the entreaties of her mother. The father feared lest she turn to evil and, therefore, asked for permission to kill her. However, we did not permit him to carry out his design. We sent the testimony to Rothenburg to the great luminary, Rabbi Meir. Since the Rabbis of Erfurt who are near us, and those of Würzburg, who are far from us, as well as Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, all agree to allow R. Isaac to divorce Sarah even against her will, the divorce has been given in our presence. Signed: Moses Azriel b. Eleazar hadarshan, Eleazar b. Yehiel, Ephraim b. Joel.<br>R. Meir's opinion was as follows:<br>The testimony of R. Shealtiel and his sons is of no consequence for two reasons. a) They are related to each other; their testimony is that of a single witness, and, therefore, insufficient. b) The foetus could have lingered in the mother's womb for twelve months (cf. Yeb. 80b). Sarah's giving birth to a child twelve months after her husband left her, is, therefore, no proof of her depravity. The testimony of the other witness regarding Sarah's indecent behavior on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, being the testimony of a single witness, does not deprive Sarah of her right to her <i>ketubah</i>. If R. Isaac believes the aforementioned witness or if he takes the word of his wife's own father, he must divorce Sarah even against her will. If she renders it impossible for him to divorce her, he may marry another woman without divorcing Sarah as a warning to all indecent and depraved women. But he must pay Sarah her <i>ketubah</i>. However, if Sarah admits her guilt, or acknowledges the truth of the testimony regarding her indecent conduct on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, or if she cannot satisfactorily explain why she denied her being pregnant in the month of <i>Elul</i> of the previous year, or answer all other questions regarding her conduct, she loses her right to her <i>ketubah</i> and is entitled only to whatever is left of the valuables she had brought with her upon her marriage.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 310; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A duke's servants who occasionally engaged in plundering the countryside, sold a pregnant heifer to A. At the time the sale took place, the vendors told A to allow the original owner of the heifer, a Gentile woman, to redeem it, when she was ready. Subsequently the woman appeared and offered to redeem the heifer. A agreed to the transaction, but, before the woman had the opportunity of producing the money, the heifer gave birth to a firstling. Is the calf a consecrated firstling (which can not be sold to a Gentile)?<br><i>A</i>. When the robbers took the cow away from its owner, he abandoned all hope of recovery. Therefore, when A bought it he acquired clear title thereto because of this abandonment of hope and of the change of domain. The subsequent consent by A to allow the original owner to redeem the cow, did not transfer the title to the owner. Thus the firstling was born to a cow belonging to a Jew and was, therefore, consecrated.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 312.

<i>Q</i>. Complying with A's request, the ruler of town T gave A the authority to admit as settlers only those persons of whom A would approve. A claims that B asked him for permission to remain in T for one year telling him that he had settling rights in another place, thus admitting that he possessed no settling-rights in T. B claims that he does possess such rights in T, that his father lived there before him, and denies having asked B for permission to stay there. Should both, B and A, be permitted to stay in T, it might lead to grave consequences, even to the spilling of blood, since B's conduct is known to be corrupt. Rabbi Moses asked what course he should take with respect to their claims.<br><i>A</i>. If A produces witnesses to the effect that B asked permission to remain in T for a year, B will have to leave the town, since by his asking for permission he admitted that he either possessed no settling rights there, or had foregone any rights he might have had. If A can produce no such witnesses, B has a right to dwell in T. However, because of B's wicked conduct, you, Rabbi Moses, should deprive B of his settling rights in T and require A to pay adequate compensation to B. I have often seen communities deprive one of their members of his settling-rights because of misconduct; your court that has the right to confiscate a person's money, surely has the right to deprive one of his settling-rights. You should force, therefore, A and B to leave the case completely in your hands to be decided either by arbitration or according to strictly legal requirements, and then you will be able to decide as you see fit.<br>R. Meir adds:<br>Your opinion that B lost his settling-rights because of the legal principle "the law of the land prevails" is untenable. The ruler of T gave A the authority to pass on new settlers, but he gave A no authority to dislodge old residents. Had the ruler of T granted A the authority even to dislodge old residents, the validity of such a grant would depend on the reasons that prompted the ruler to grant such authority. If A asked the ruler for such authority, then A has no right to exercise his authority since by his request he directly injured B's interests. But, if the ruler of T, on his own accord, said that he does not want any Jew to live in T unless he receive A's permission, then A may dislodge B because of the legal principle: "The law of the land prevails".<br>The decision of R. Isaac (b. Samuel, the Tosafist) in the case of the Jews who fled from their town and whose real estate the ruler of the town confiscated and, then, sold to other Jews, has nothing to do with our decision. In this latter case, R. Isaac rightly decided that the purchasers must return the property to the original owners (as compensation, the purchasers were entitled to the amount the original owners would have spent to regain their property) for the ruler had no right to confiscate real property that belonged to the Jews for generations. Such an act on the part of the ruler is not considered "law of the land" but is rather outright robbery, and, therefore, illegal. In our case, however, the ruler of T is the owner of T and has a right to admit anyone into his town, and to keep out of it anybody he wants to keep out. We cannot claim for B's benefit that his father bought permanent settling rights from the ruler of T and stipulated that he or his descendants could never be dislodged from T, for such transactions were very rare, even though such a stipulation if made would be binding and would render the act of the ruler dislodging B an illegal act.<br>The decision arrived at in the Talmud (B.B. 54b) accepting as binding the Persian law that if the owner of a field defaults in the taxes for that field, anyone who pays the taxes becomes owner of the field, also, has nothing to do with our case; for taxes on real property accumulate even when the owners are away, while Jews are not required to pay taxes to their overlord, unless they actually live in the domain of these overlords. For Jews are not subjugated to their overlords as the Gentiles are, in the sense that they have to pay taxes to a particular overlord even when they do not live in his domain. The status of the Jew, in this land, is that of a free land owner who lost his land but did not lose his personal liberty. This definition of the status of the Jews is followed by the government in its customary relations with the Jews.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 6; Pr. 101, 1001; L. 313; Mord. B.

<i>Q</i>. B, C and D with the help of D's father, A, lent money to a Gentile on a pledge that was worth less than the amount of the loan. The Gentile, therefore, put up Gentile sureties for the entire loan. A, originally, agreed to negotiate with the Gentile on condition that he (A) be free from any responsibility should B, C and D sustain a loss through his intervention even though it be as a result of his wilful neglect. Subsequently, A wrote to B and C to return the pledge, and the latter did so. Meanwhile, one of the sureties showed A and D a letter signed by B and C instructing them to release the sureties. Thereupon, they released the sureties. B and C claim that the letter was forged and demand their money from D.<br><i>A</i>. D had no right to release the sureties until he was absolutely certain of B's and C's instructions. He was not to rely on a letter nor on any signature. Although the sureties were still legally responsible for the payment of the debt until released by B and C, D's release afforded the Gentiles an excuse to evade payment. Since A cannot be held responsible, D must make good B's and C's losses, the amount of which is to be evaluated by the court (not the face value of the loan since it was a bad debt and not worth its face value). If, however, B and C returned the pledge to the Gentile after the release of the sureties by D, though they had no knowledge of such release, the loss of the pledge is to be borne by them <i>pro rata</i>. Any additional loss, over and above the pledge, is to be borne by D alone.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 7; Pr. 93; L. 314; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nezikin</i>, 12.

Now, A demands that B pay him back the ten <i>marks</i>, since his investments earned no profits. He further demands that B pay him for the pledges since they were lost through B's failure to return them (after having received his money), which failure constituted a wilful neglect on B's part. B, on the other hand, claims that: a) the money he lent to A belonged to orphans, b) the money was lent to A by a third party, c) he took the pledges because he was the trustee of the orphans, d) he is not responsible for the loss of the pledges since he did not hinder A from taking them away after the debt was paid.<br><i>A</i>.

Having no money to pay for it, he gave B a quantity of gold on condition that should he fail to pay B within three days, B would have the right to raise money against such gold by using it as security on an interest-bearing loan, or by having the money-changers exchange it for money, or by resorting to any other possible manner of raising money. B, however, pledged the gold with C on condition that it become forfeited after two weeks shall have elapsed, should A fail to redeem it within that time. A did not redeem his gold within the stipulated time. Now A demands that B return his gold since he never intended to allow B to pledge his gold on such unusual, and extremely unfavorable, conditions. By the phrase "any other possible manner" he meant to permit the employment of customary methods of raising money against security, and no more. Moreover, B did not necessarily have to raise a loan. He could have taken off a piece of the gold commensurate in value with the money due him, and returned the remainder to A; since gold bullion lends itself to such treatment without the necessity of appraisal [by a court]. B, on the other hand, claims that knowing what a dilatory debtor A was, he refused to do business with him until A gave him the gold and specified that it could be used to raise money "in any possible manner", the last phrase to be taken literally. He further claims that he could not raise the money in any other way than on the terms made with C, and that he informed A about this transaction with C, and that A agreed to it. A, however, denies B's assertions and claims that he was informed of the transaction with C after he had mounted his horse and had been ready to ride on his way, and that he did not realize at the time the meaning of B's words.<br><i>A</i>. Even assuming the truth of B's version of his agreement with A, such agreement is considered an <i>asmakhta</i> and is not valid unless accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court. Therefore, B must pay to A the difference between the value of A's gold and the amount due B. Moreover, B's agreement with C regarding the forfeiture of the pledge is also considered an <i>askmakhta</i> and is invalid.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 170; L. 331.

<i>Q</i>. A claims he deposited a pledge with B to secure a loan, and now wishes to redeem it. B claims that the pledge had to be redeemed before a certain date or become forfeited. When the time of payment arrived, A asked for an extension of time and said: "Take formal possession so that the pledge henceforth be yours if I do not repay you before that date". A made no payment on the date due after the extension; B, therefore, claims that the pledge became forfeited. A denies having said, "Take formal possession.……henceforth".<br><i>A</i>. Usually a statement, such as A is alleged to have made, is classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is not binding. But since B is in possession of the pledged articles, and since B has done a favor to A in lending him money, this satement is no longer classified as <i>Asmakhta</i> and is binding. Therefore, if B takes an oath that A made the statement: "Take formal possession..…henceforth", the pledge belongs to B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 1; Pr. 91; L. 333; Rashba I, 1103; <i>Tashbetz</i>, 490; cf.

<i>Q</i>. A was ready to obey the decision of a Jewish court regarding his dispute with B; nevertheless, B informed against him before the overlord and, consequently, A was forced to pay one pound to the [Gentile] judge. B admitted having informed against A and having asked (the overlord) to retain A's valuables till A answer his summons to [a Jewish] court and abide by its decision.<br><i>A</i>. B had no right to force A to abide by the decision of a Jewish court through the intervention of a Gentile, unless the community or the court instructed him to do so. No person is permitted to take the law into his own hands except when he seeks to retrieve his own particular article. Therefore, it witnesses testify to the amount A lost through B's unlawful act, B must make good such loss. But if no such witnesses exist, and B claims not to know of any loss sustained by A, he may take an oath in support of his claim and thus be free from obligation.<br>(R. Meir alludes in an obscure manner to various claims and counterclaims of the two parties, the exact meaning of which is hard to determine. I. A.)<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 185 b; L. 334. Cf.

The Gentile forgot the balance due him, and did not ask for it for two years. A wants to retain the balance for himself.<br><i>A</i>. B gave money to A for the express purpose of paying the Gentile. As long as A does not pay the Gentile, the money belongs to B and A has no right to keep it. Moreover A has no right to give the money to the Gentile after the latter forgot about it; for, if A wants to sanctify the name of the Lord by paying the Gentile money the latter forgot about, let him (A) do so with his own money, as he cannot use another person's money for such a purpose.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 50; Pr. 326, 953; L. 335; Mord.

You have rendered unfit for eating purposes meat that was not rinsed before it was salted and cooked. Your decision in this case, however, is not correct since the talmudic law requiring that meat be rinsed before salting is a requirement previous to the act (<span>לכתחלה</span>) which law does not render unfit for eating purposes meat that was already salted without a previous rinsing (<span>בדיעבד</span>).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 55; Pr. 992; L. 337; Rashba I, 870.

<i>Q</i>. B bought property from a Gentile which bordered on A's property. Before paying for it, B, to acquire possession, did some digging in the Gentile's yard in the presence of witnesses. After B did so, but before he had paid the money to the Gentile, A constructed apertures for windows in his wall facing the property. Did A acquire rights to window lights?<br><i>A</i>. In city property digging is not considered a valid act of possession. Likewise A did not acquire any rights to window lights since a Gentile does not renounce his rights to his property before he receives the money, and the Gentile's property was, therefore, not (<i>res nullis</i>) ownerless. However, before paying money to the Gentile, let B perform a valid act of possession (such as locking a door, fixing or breaking part of the fence, etc.); otherwise A will acquire rights to window lights during the interval between the paying of the money and B's taking formal possession, since during such interval the Gentile's property will be <i>res nullis</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 63–64; Pr. 28–29; L. 338; Mord. ibid.

<i>Q</i>. R. Tam is of the opinion that a person whose claim is supported by the testimony of a single witness is entitled to collect his claim without being required to take an oath. However, the Talmud, B. M. 28a, states: Where two persons lay claim to an object found by a third, each of the two giving the proper identifying marks and one of them supporting his claim by the testimony of a single witness, the testimony of that witness is of no avail. Does not this talmudic law contradict the statement of R. Tam?<br><i>A</i>. There is no contradiction. R. Tam means to say that whenever a person would be entitled to collect his claim were he to take an oath to support it, such an oath would not be required if he obtain the testimony of a single witness supporting the claim. Thus, the testimony of a single witness directed against a litigant has the effect of requiring an oath (denying the truth of such testimony) when otherwise no oath would have been required; and such testimony in favor of a litigant has the effect of rendering unnecessary an oath that otherwise would have been required. However, when two persons lay claim to an object found by a third and both give the proper identifying marks, no oath is accepted from either of the claimants and the object is not delivered to either of them. Therefore, the additional testimony of a single witness does not change the situation.<br>This Responsum is addressed to: "My teacher, and relative, Rabbi Menahem", of Würzburg.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 343; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. Before her death, Leah, in the presence of witnesses, said: "All my possessions shall go to B and C except what I have already given to charity." After her death, B and C found some of her possessions in A's hands. They demanded these possessions from A who, in turn, claimed that Leah gave them to him as a gift <i>mortis causa</i> before she gave anything to B and C.<br><i>A</i>. If, while making the gift to A, Leah indicated that she was making such a gift in fear of approaching death, then her final words, giving everything to B and C, prevail, since she probably changed her mind regarding her gift to A. A, then, must return the property to B and C. But, if Leah made no mention of death when she gave some of her possessions to A, then such a gift is in the category of a "sick man's gift of part of his property" (Baba Batra 151b) which requires a <i>kinyan</i> (formal act of possession).

<i>Q</i>. A and B were captured and held for ransom. The former was rich and the latter, poor. A spent money with the help of his mother and effected the release of both A and B. A claims that B asked to be ransomed, and therefore demands that B pay his share of the expenses. B denies having asked to be ransomed.<br><i>A</i>. A Jew should be ransomed even against his express will, and be charged with the expenses incurred. A captive in the hands of Gentiles is exposed to ruthless treatment and incessant flogging, and his very life is in danger. Therefore, anyone who effects the ransom of a Jew is praiseworthy and is entitled to the expenses incurred. Moreover, Jews threatened by a common danger may force one another to contribute of their means to the measures that will free them of that danger. A and B have to share the expenses in proportion to their wealth, since they were captured for the purpose of extorting money from them.<br>R.

The removal of the ban against settlement by waiver is accepted by the communities as legally binding, although, in talmudic law, rights in real property cannot be waived or relinquished unless the waiver be accompanied by a formal act of possession. But since the community denies A's claim, A must produce proof that the ban against settlement had been waived in his favor.

Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <i>Hallah</i> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <i>Hallah</i> from them. But R. Eliezer never meant his law to be a palliative measure. I, therefore, take a small piece from each quantity of dough that is separately mixed, and then join the small pieces into one piece as <i>Hallah</i>.<br>Signed: R. Isaac b. Simeon.<br><i>A</i>.

The custom is well established throughout the kingdom that when an individual has a complaint against the community regarding the tax he was assessed with, he must first pay that tax and, then, may summon the community to court, for the community prefers to be in possession of such tax-money. As corroborative evidence of the legality of this procedure I cite the talmudic ruling that those who pay the capitation tax for others are justified in forcing the latter in their service (B. M. 73b), since "the law of the land prevails". Moreover, since the members of the community are partners in the payment of the taxes, no individual may willfully withdraw from the partnership. Since the majority (of the members of a community) may force the minority to abide by its rulings (B. B. 8b), it may certainly force an individual to pay his taxes. The burden of proof to the contrary rests upon the person who seeks to deviate from this rule.<br>Since the overlord customarily collects his taxes collectively from the entire community, the exact obligation of each member of the community regarding such tax becomes determined as if already collected (the very moment the overlord demands the collective tax); and if the overlord subsequently desires to free or relieve one member at the expense of the others, he has no right to do so. Such an act on his part is not considered "law of the land," but rather constitutes outright robbery, and is, therefore, not valid.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 49; Pr. 708, 915; L. 371; Am II, 130.

<i>Q</i>. A demanded from B sixty pennies he owed him. B admitted the indebtedness, but claimed that through A's wilful neglect, he, B, was not able to collect a debt of four pounds and sixty pennies. B, therefore, demanded that A pay him four pounds. The judges ordered A to swear that he did not willfully cause any damage to B, and ordered B to swear that A did willfully cause him a loss of at least sixty pennies. After the judges rendered this decision, B put forth his claim that, in partnership with A, he, B, loaned eight and one half pounds to Gentiles, and that, without his permission or consent, A relinquished that debt to the Gentiles. A, however, claimed that B gave him permission to do with B's share whatever he would do with his own. Moreover, A claims that B informed against him; a Jewish witness, the servants of the Bishop, and the burghers, support A's claim in this respect.

<i>Q</i>. A, his four daughters, and his wife, were killed when the house they occupied collapsed. A's heirs claim that perhaps the wife died first and that therefore they now were the only heirs to A's estate. The wife's brothers, on the other hand, claim that perhaps the wife died last and that therefore they were entitled to her <i>ketubah</i>. Some Rabbis are of the opinion that the wife's heirs were entitled to one-twelfth of the estate; while other Rabbis, computing probabilities, believe that they were entitled to one thirty-second of the estate.<br><i>A</i>. It is my humble opinion that the wife's heirs are entitled to one-half of the estate, because of the talmudic principle <i>Kol Kavua kemahaze al mahaze domi</i>, meaning: whenever an event is about to befall (or has befallen) one of a number of fixed persons or objects, each person or object has a fifty-fifty chance that the incident will befall (or has befallen) him or it. Therefore, legally, there is a fifty-fifty chance for each one of the six persons involved that he or she died last. Had the daughters been married and had their husbands appeared to demand their share, the estate would have had to be divided into six parts. But, since only two persons demand their share, the estate should be divided between the two. Although a woman has to take an oath before she is entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, no such oath is required in this case since A died suddenly and we have no reason to suspect that before his death he had deposited with her valuables to be used in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 172; L. 378; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. R(achel) lent L(eah) twenty <i>marks</i>, secured by pledges, for the purpose of investment and was to share equally in the profits. Part of the money, according to R, belonged to orphans and the other part was deposited with her for the purpose of educating the orphans and contributing to other religious causes with the profit derived therefrom. Subsequently, L paid back to R sixteen <i>marks</i>, gave her a pledge worth ten <i>solidi</i> which a Gentile had deposited with L as security for a loan of one <i>mark</i>, told R that the investments had brought in a profit of fourteen <i>marks</i>, and said that she took for herself seven <i>marks</i> which constituted her part of the profits. Two days later, however, L claimed she had searched her assets and investments carefully and could find no trace of the seven <i>marks</i> profit coming to R, and that she did not know what had become of that money. She demanded that R return her pledges in exchange for the three <i>marks</i> she still owed R on the principal. R said that when L paid her the sixteen <i>marks</i>, the pledges were left in her (R's) possession as security for the four <i>marks</i> of the principal and the seven <i>marks</i> of profit coming to her; that she would not return the pledges until the eleven <i>marks</i> were paid to her; that L had probably spent the seven <i>marks</i> on her sustenance, since she had no money and no source of income; and that she (R) ought not to suffer any loss on the one <i>mark</i> loan made to the Gentile against a pledge worth ten <i>solidi</i>, since she had expressly instructed L to lend the money against adequate security only. L rejoined that R had given her no such instructions; that she knew the Gentile very well, had always trusted him and at one time had lent him ten pounds without security which he had repaid in full; and that when she extended the loan to the Gentile she acted in good faith and was, therefore, not responsible for the loss resulting therefrom. L denied having spent the seven <i>marks</i> on her sustenance, and further denied that her pledges were left in R's possession as security for the seven <i>marks</i> profit, claiming that these pledges were deposited as security for the principal only. The court set up to register the claims [for the purpose of sending it to an authoritative court for decision] thoroughly questioned L regarding the disappearance of half of the fourteen <i>marks</i> she had originally admitted she had earned, but could receive no clear explanation from her. She claimed that whenever she earned a profit of ten or twenty <i>solidi</i> she spent half of it for her daily needs and added the other half to the principal, since such was her understanding with R; that she had thus spent seven <i>marks</i> out of the profit, and that when she finally counted up her assets she could find no trace of the seven <i>marks</i> profit coming to R. She believes that the money was either lost or stolen, or disappeared in some other manner unknown to her.<br><i>A</i>. A person with whom money is deposited for investment purposes and who is to share equally in the profits, assumes the responsibility of a debtor for one half of the money [the profit of which half belongs to him], and the responsibility of a bailee for the other half [the profit of which belongs to the depositor]. If, in addition to the money, the depositor pays a small token fee to the bailee as compensation for his trouble in managing the investments, the latter has the responsibility of a paid bailee for the second half of the deposit; but when no such fee is paid, the responsibility of the bailee thereto is that of a gratuitous bailee. Since L claims to have added the seven <i>marks</i> profit to the principal, her responsibility to this profit became the same as to the principal. Therefore, if R paid L a token fee for her trouble in managing the investments, L was responsible for the loss or theft of the seven <i>marks</i>. Although some authorities would disagree with this decision, we follow the authorities favoring R's interests, since she is in possession of the pledges. But, if R paid L no such fee, the latter will be responsible for only half that amount, upon the taking of an oath to the effect that the seven <i>marks</i> were lost through no negligence on her part, and that she did not misappropriate them. However, should R claim that according to her agreement with L the profit was not to be joined to the principal and that it was to be given to her immediately, or that it was left with L as a loan and not for reinvestment, R will be entitled to collect the entire seven <i>marks</i> upon the taking of an oath to the truth of such claim. We must be satisfied with such oath, since she is in possession of the pledges. Regarding the loan to the Gentile against inadequate security, R may take an oath to the effect that she had specifically instructed L not to lend the money unless adequately secured, and be entitled to collect the one <i>mark</i>; or she may demand that L take an oath as to the truth of her (L's) claim.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that when the overlord seized his valuables he also seized L(eah)'s valuables which were in the same room; and that when he finally settled with the overlord to pay him a fixed sum of money, and the latter returned all of the valuables to him, he pledged them with the persons who went surety for him to the overlord. L demands her valuables, and A demands that L pay part of the tax he promised to pay to the overlord.<br><i>A</i>. If A's claim regarding the seizure of L's valuables is true, it is presumed that L abandoned all hope of recovering them. Although in the case of an ordinary robber no such presumption exists (B. K. 114a), at present every overlord is king in his domain; no one exercises any restraint upon him, and we presume that owners of movables seized by an overlord have abandoned all hope of recovery. Therefore, L's seized valuables belong to A since he acquired them through abandonment (<i>yeush</i>) and change of possession (<i>shinui reshut</i>), although the principle "the law of the land prevails" does not apply in this case of robbery and extortion. However, A is not entitled to collect any additional tax-money from L, since she was not personally included by the overlord in his extortionist act on A. Although all persons earning money in a town or locality must share the burden of taxation of such a town or locality, this ruling applies only to regular taxes of a fixed amount annually collected by the king (or overlord) from the entire community in one lump sum. The robbery and extortion of an overlord, however, on pretext or false accusation, is to be borne only by the person unfortunately caught in his toils, but not by those who, probably by the grace of God, have escaped them.<br>R.

<i>Q</i>. A, a levir, married the widow of his brother B and had children with her. B had died while his father was still alive, but subsequently the father also died. Before his death, however, the latter divided his property equally among his sons. While A was away his remaining three brothers divided the father's landed property into four equal parts, one for each brother. When A returned he did not object to the division; and after his death, when the brothers sold their parts, his widow and orphans did not protest against the sale for over three years. Now, however, the latter claim that the division was unjust and the sale, therefore, invalid since A was entitled to a double portion of the estate, his own and that of his brother B.<br><i>A</i>. Both, the division of the property by the brothers, and its subsequent sale, would be void, according to Rashi, since A was entitled to a double portion out of his father's estate. The fact that both transactions were not protested for over three years, is of no consequence since the brothers, or their successors, do not claim that A officially forewent or sold his rights. Moreover, A died before the three years of undisturbed possession were over, and one cannot claim undisturbed possession as evidence of title to property belonging to young orphans even after they grow up. However, since A's father divided his property among his sons, A is not entitled to any more than what his father gave him; for he received his portion as a gift and not as an inheritance.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

The Gentile released B and depended upon A for payment. A successfully avoids payment to the Gentile because of an old debt due him from the latter. Since, according to Jewish law, the transaction was not valid and A's indebtedness to B was not legally transferred to the Gentile, A must pay his debt to B.

We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: "All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh.

Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).<br>Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that "the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. "Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out" (Proverbs 17,14). Signed: Eliezer b. Ephraim. (Am. II, 81).

<i>Q</i>. A drained the water in his yard by means of a ditch which was adjacent to B's stone wall. B claimed that when the ditch was full, the water had flooded his house. He, therefore, demanded that A fill up his ditch. A claimed that the ditch had been in his yard for a period of twenty-four years and that B had never protested before. B, however, contended that the ditch had not previously caused him any damage. A's father bought the property with the ditch from a Jew who, in turn, had bought it from a Gentile.<br><i>A</i>. If A removes his ditch one <i>tefah</i> from B's wall, he is free from further obligation. But even if A does not do so, he is free from any obligation since he inherited the ditch from his father, who, if alive, could claim that he bought the right to maintain the ditch from B. Moreover, A is not required to take an oath to the effect that he never heard his father say that he did not buy from B (or B's father) the right to maintain the ditch for the following reasons: <i>a</i>) Orphans are not required to take an oath in order to free themselves from a money obligation; b) the oath of orphans is a rabbinical decree and the Rabbis did not decree anything disadvantageous to the interests of the orphans.<br>The fact that A's yard originally belonged to a Gentile, has nothing to do with the case since B does not claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally. If B does put forth the claim that the Gentile dug the ditch illegally, it will avail him nothing, since, again, the court will have to put forth the claim, for A's benefit, that A's father bought the right to maintain the ditch from B or B's predecessors.<br>This Responsum was sent to R.

<i>Q</i>. A's wife bound herself by a ban in the presence of the people of the town, not to do a certain thing. The terms of the ban were written down, and all the townfolk signed the document. Subsequently she transgressed the ban several times, as attested to by witnesses. A transgressing woman, if properly forwarned, loses the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. We are doubtful, however, whether A's wife had to be properly forewarned before losing her right to the <i>ketubah</i>. We are inclined to believe that no such forewarning was necessary since she was warned at the time the ban was pronounced that she would lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i> should she transgress the ban, and she agreed thereto without inserting any qualifying conditions. Does A's wife lose the right to her <i>ketubah?</i> Furthermore, is A permitted to divorce her against her will?<br><i>A</i>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <i>ketubah</i>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <i>Sotah</i> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <i>ketubah;</i> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately.<br>The question was again sent to R. Meir: A's wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage).<br><i>A</i>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife's sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor's children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A's wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 185; L. 393; Tesh.

Abraham believes that the talmudic ruling, "a widow who seized (her husband's) valuables for her sustenance may retain such valuables (Ket. 96a)," applies to cases where it is known that the widow seized less than the value of her <i>ketubah;</i> his brother, R. Samson b. Abraham, and Maimonides, believe that the ruling applies to any amount seized by the widow, for the amount a widow may need for her sustenance is indeterminate. Therefore, the widow may retain the money she has seized for her sustenance. She need take no oath as to the amount seized, since such oath would serve no purpose. However, should she subsequently demand additional funds for her sustenance, she would have to take an oath as to the amount she seized and to the manner she used it. She may restrain the orphans from selling immovables they inherited from her late husband since her sustenance is a lien upon such property, but she can not invalidate a sale already concluded.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 394; Am II, 3; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. I heard that you permit the lending of charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits, but not in the losses, resulting from its investment by the borrower. Such a transaction is forbidden by Rabbinical decree; why, then, should it be permitted in connection with charity-funds? Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. Lending charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, is forbidden. The Rabbis who said (B. M. 70a) that a person lending money on such a condition is called "wicked" made no distinction between rich and poor. Since a poor person is not permitted to lend his money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, we are not permitted to do so for him.
Note: The following introduction precedes the answer: Please excuse me for the brief response. For the last two weeks I have been confined to bed and have lost the taste for food. I wrote to you a lengthy response regarding the lending of charity-funds, and sent it to you through a messenger named Marvel. I forgot the lengthy argument and discussion. I remember, however, to have agreed with your reasons and arguments, and to have added the following ….<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 425; P. 476. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B.M. 73.

<i>Q</i>. A borrowed ten pounds of charity-money on the following conditions: a) that he pay three pounds per year out of his profits; b) that should his profit be less than three pounds, he would have to pay only half of that profit; and c) in case there be a loss, A would suffer the entire loss himself. For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <i>abak ribbit</i> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <i>abak ribbit</i> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal.<br>R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir's decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision.<br>R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to "ask the Oracle" (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 426; P. 477.

a) <i>Q</i>. A married L in Mayence, or in another locality, where the <i>ketubah</i> is valued at two hundred <i>marks</i>. They then removed to a different locality where the <i>ketubah</i> is valued at much less. They lived in the latter place until A's death. How much money is L entitled to as her <i>ketubah</i>?<br><i>A</i>. The opinion of R. Simon b. Gamaliel (Ket. 110b) is accepted that a woman is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> current in the locality where her marriage took place.<br>b) <i>Q</i>. After A died L took over, and managed, his estate. Why, then, did you write that the estate was considered, nevertheless, to be in the possession of the orphans?<br><i>A</i>. R. Hananel decided that the estate managed by the widow is considered to be in the possession of the orphans. The widow is merely a managing trustee. Therefore, all the profit accruing because of her management, belongs to the orphans and she can not collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. When the widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> she loses her right to receive her sustenance from the estate. She must, then, take an oath while holding the Scroll of the Law; and whatever she thus states under oath to have given away, or to have retained for herself, to have given to her daughter, or to have given to charity, is deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>c) <i>Q</i>. L lent some of the money to lords and "men of violence", and it is doubtful whether the latter will pay their debts.<br><i>A</i>. L is responsible for these bad investments. Ordinarily when heirs pay the <i>ketubah</i> to a widow, they may give her in payment any kind of property, or any object even bran; but they cannot pay her by transferring to her money due them from others, since the collection of debts often involves litigations to which a woman is not accustomed. However, in our case, the orphans may transfer to L the money she has invested with the lords and the "men of violence", in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, since she had no right to make such unsafe investments.<br>d) <i>Q</i>. While L managed the estate she gave presents to certain persons thinking she had the right to do so. Are the orphans entitled to take back the presents?<br><i>A</i>. The recipients are entitled to retain these presents since they may claim that L gave them out of her own property, and since it appears that the market ordinance (<i>takkanat hashuk</i>) was to apply to property given away as presents.<br>e) <i>Q</i>. Do we put forth the claim for the benefit of the orphans that L may have been a widow when she married A, or that A may have paid her one <i>Mina</i>.?<br><i>A</i>. We surely put forth the above claims for the benefit of the orphans. However, if a report circulates that L was a virgin when she married A, she is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin, since the majority of women are married while virgins. [The principle of "a majority of cases" presumes that what is true in most instances, is also true in our case.] Although in litigation over money matters the principle of "a majority of cases" is not a factor, it is so when the claimant is in actual possession of the litigated money. In our case, L is in actual possession of the money; therefore, the combination of a "majority" and a "report" in her favor, is conclusive.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 127–8–9–30–31; L. 480–1–2–3.

<i>Q</i>. Does a minor complete the quorum necessary for the purpose of mentioning the name of God in the invocation to grace after the meal?<br><i>A</i>. There are many conflicting opinions on this subject. R. Tam held that such a minor could complete the necessary quorum, but he himself did not permit such a practice. I have seen many great authorities doing so. But when I was in Provence I said grace several times at the table of my great teacher in the presence of nine men and one minor in his thirteenth year, and he did not allow me to mention the name of God in the invocation. Subsequently I inquired of my teacher R. Judah whether my great teacher was correct in forbidding me to mention God's name; and he replied that he was, thus confirming his opinion.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 488.

<i>Q</i>. We are in doubt concerning the implications of the following ruling of the scholars of Nehardea: When one person gives goods to another in order that the latter trade therewith and the former share in the profits, half of the value of such goods is considered a loan (at the risk of the active partner) and the other half, a trust (at the risk of the investor). Does this statement imply that the part which is considered a loan is subject to all the laws governing loans, even to the extent of being cancelled by a Sabbatical year? Would it not work to the disadvantage of the investor?<br><i>A</i>. That part which is considered a loan is subject to all the laws governing loans and is subject to cancellation by a Sabbatical year. However, the investor can safeguard his interests by writing a <i>Prosbol</i>.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R. Shemariah.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 490; Mord. B. M. 390.

<i>Q</i>. We have heard that you refrain from eating meat after cheese for the same interval as cheese after meat, and that you do eat poultry-meat after cheese. Is this report true?<br><i>A</i>. Yes, one may conduct oneself more strictly than required by the Law in order to make sure that one be not exposed to sin, without being guilty of the sin of adding anything to the Law.<br>R. Meir adds that in his youth he used to scoff at those persons who were so meticulous. He even considered their practice heretical, until he once found small particles of cheese between his teeth hours after he ate it. He, therefore, decided to be more careful.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 615; L. 500; Mord., <i>Hulin</i>, 68; cf. <i>Tashbetz</i>, 355.

<i>Q</i>. A's father, before his death, deposited his books with B (a trustee) as security for a dowry of twenty-four <i>marks</i>, which he promised his son C. He subsequently paid B eighteen <i>marks</i>, leaving a balance of six <i>marks</i>. C's brother, A, representing his mother, Bruna, now demands that B permit him to redeem his father's books for six <i>marks</i>. B, however, claims that when C demanded the six <i>marks</i> from his mother, she, in payment of that amount, assigned to C a debt of twenty-three pounds D owed her, and pledged the books for that amount. B, therefore, demands twenty-three pounds to be paid to C before he returns the books. A, however, claims that anything paid to C above six <i>marks</i> will constitute usury.<br><i>A</i>. B's testimony is accepted without reservation since B is a trustee. According to that testimony, the payment of twenty-three pounds to C would constitute usury. B must, therefore, return the books to A and his mother upon the receipt of six <i>marks</i>. Moreover, the loan of the value of twenty-three pounds never really belonged to C, since a loan can not be legally assigned to a third party.<br>R. Meir sent substantially the same answer to Rabbi Yedidyah which answer begins as follows: "According to the (record of) claims sent to me by the judges, the widow, Bruna, did not admit that the loan originally belonged to them (to B and C). She claims only to have given them the loan in exchange for the pledges …."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 985–6; L. 503.

<i>Q</i>. A refuses to marry or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow claiming that, because a year has not yet passed since his brother's death, his deep sorrow prevents him from either marrying her or giving her <i>halitzah</i>.<br><i>A</i>. A's temporizing is baseless and useless. Our sages have decreed that three months, and not a year or two, after a person died leaving no children, his brother must either marry the widow or give her <i>halitzah</i>. Therefore, no temporizing is permitted. A should be coerced, either by persuasion or by flagellation, into giving <i>halitzah</i> to the woman immediately. Let Gentiles belabor him till he agrees to do what he is told to do. I should prefer, however, that A be misled or deceived by offers of money till he voluntarily gives her <i>halitzah</i>. Thus the widow may officially forego her claim to her husband's money that is in A's possession, and even bind herself thereto by a <i>kinyan</i>. After the ceremony the widow would still be entitled to collect this money from A, for the court that has a right to inflict corporal punishment on A, has a right to confiscate his property if it be required by considerations of public welfare. I should prefer to practice deception on A rather than inflict flagellation, since the latter might involve great hardship, have very serious consequences, and even cause A to abscond.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 244; Pr. 492; P. 10; Moses Minz, <i>Responsa</i> 10.

<i>Q</i>. What constitutes the merit of emigrating to the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>. My knowledge on this subject does not go beyond the talmudic statement (Ket. 111a) that a person who emigrates to the Holy Land is absolved from sin. This applies to a person who commits no sins in the Holy Land proper, and who fulfils all the commandments appertaining to the Holy Land. However, the punishment for a sin committed there is more severe than that for a sin committed elsewhere; for the Lord watches over the Holy Land more diligently, and the land itself can bear no sinners. For this reason the Holy Land is now desolate and contains no walled cities. Therefore, it is to those who go to the Holy Land and intend to be reckless in their behavior and particularly to quarrel there that the verse applies: "But when ye entered ye defiled My land (Jer. 2, 7)." When, however, a person emigrates to the Holy Land with sincere intentions and conducts himself there in piety and saintliness, his reward is unlimited; provided, of course, that he possess sufficient means of support there.<br><i>Q</i>. Does a person buried in Palestine escape the <i>hibbut hakkever</i> (agonies of the grave)?<br><i>A</i>. I do not know.<br><i>Q</i>. Why did the Amoraim fail to move to the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>. Such an act would have seriously interferred with their studies, since in the Holy Land they would have to spend much time in finding means of support. A person is permitted even to leave the Holy Land in order to study with his teacher (Erub. 47a); therefore, one is surely not enjoined to break off his uninterrupted studies in the Diaspora and emigrate to the Holy Land where he would find his means of support with great difficulty.<br><i>Q</i>. What is the meaning of the talmudic statement (Ket. 110b): A person who dwells in the Diaspora is as one who has no God?<br><i>A</i>. God's presence is primarily concentrated in the Holy Land.

<i>Q</i>. A, B, C, and D, were partners in a loan made by them. In repayment they received a quantity of silver which they divided among themselves by lot. Subsequently, A bought B's silver and sold it to merchants [probably Gentile merchants]. The latter broke up the silver and found it mixed with base metal. A averted a calamity by pacifying the merchants with gifts of money, thus preventing their bringing false accusations against him. A demands that B reimburse him with the price of the silver, and also compensate him for the money he had spent in pacifying the merchants.<br><i>A</i>. The sale of the silver to A is void, since it was made in error. Similarly, the division of the silver among the partners is void, even though made by lot, since that too was made in error. However, B is not required to compensate A for the money he spent in pacifying the merchants, since B did not know, at the time of the sale, that his silver contained base metal.

<i>Q</i>. Many candles are usually lit in the synagogue on the morning of a holiday.

The light of many candles in the synagogue, whether in daytime or at night, enhances the spirit of festivity and rejoicing. Were it not for this reason, the practice of lighting many candles in the synagogue for Friday evening services, when a holiday falls on Friday, would be forbidden, since services are usually over before dark and the candles are not needed for their light; and the lighting of many candles on a holiday night would be forbidden, since a single candle dispels darkness. The practice referred to is, therefore, perfectly in order.<br>R. Meir added: Please forgive me for not having answered your questions. I was very busy and forgot to answer. I even lost your letter.

<i>Q</i>. Does the custom of the Galileans prevail, which provides that the widow is entitled to receive her sustenance out of her husband's estate all the days of her widowhood until she demand her <i>ketubah</i>; or is the custom of the Judeans to be followed, which provides that the heirs may discontinue providing her sustenance as soon as they are ready to pay her the <i>ketubah</i> (Ket. 52b, 54a)?<br><i>A</i>. Opinions differ on this subject and I should not dare to decide between the authorities. However, we always follow the decisions of Alfasi whenever they are not contradicted by the Tosaphists. In this case the Tosaphists specifically agree with Alfasi that the custom of the Galileans was to be followed. The fact that two or three members of your community found it necessary to insert, in the <i>ketubot</i> they gave to their wives, the clause: "after my death, should you desire to remain a widow the rest of your life you may take possession of all my property" does not prove that your community has adopted the Judean custom. These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow's position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands' estates by being paid their <i>ketubah</i>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom. Mere ignorance of their rights may have been the only reason these widows did not protest against such an ouster.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 281; Am. II, 4; Mord. Ket. 170. Cf. Moses Minz, <i>Responsa</i> 5; ibid. 17; <i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 335, Isserlein, <i>Pesakim</i> 223.

Siman 282

<i>Q</i>. A widow seized notes of indebtedness and bonds of Gentiles, that were made out both in her name and in the name of her husband. Does this act constitute seizure of the debts?<br><i>A</i>. The widow has to produce evidence to the effect that the money represented by the notes and the bonds was actually her money. Furthermore, possession of notes and bonds, does not imply the right to the money and property described therein. Thus seizure of the notes and the bonds does not constitute seizure of the debts.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 282; Mord. B.B. 562; <i>Agudah</i> B.B. 123. Cf. Maharil, <i>Responsa</i> 75.

Siman 283

<i>Q</i>. A widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> and a creditor demands his money from an estate. Who has priority in collecting from the estate?<br><i>A</i>. The creditor has priority over the widow. Moreover, even when the estate consists of assets only to satisfy one of the claimants, the creditor is paid in preference to the widow. In our times, since the creditor as well as the widow collects from unencumbered movables, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from such movables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 140; P. 283. Cf. Asher, <i>Responsa</i> 79, 1; Weil, <i>Responsa</i> 30.

Siman 284

<i>Q</i>. A advanced many claims against B. Having no Jewish witnesses to testify on his behalf, he produced Gentiles as witnesses. B consented to admit in evidence the testimony of a certain Gentile; this consent was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. When, however, B felt that the Gentile was perverting the truth — probably having received a bribe — he protested the admission into evidence of the Gentile's testimony.<br><i>A</i>. Since B had accepted the Gentile as a trustworthy witness and had accompanied the acceptance by a <i>kinyan</i>, the testimony of the Gentile was equivalent to that of Jewish witnesses. Therefore B's protest was of no avail.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 245; P. 284; <i>Agudah</i> San. 15; cf. <i>Or Zarua</i> I, 752b.

Siman 285

<i>Q</i>. A house belonged to three or four partners, one of whom was Leah. An abutting house was sold to Rachel. Leah wanted to buy the latter house and asserted her priority rights as an abutter. Indeed the Talmud rules (B.M. 108b) that an abutter may not assert priority rights, if the buyer is a woman. This law may not apply, however, when the abutter is also a woman.<br><i>A</i>. The talmudic law cited above applies even when the abutter is a woman.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 285; Mord. B. M. 394. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B. M. 170.

Siman 286

<i>Q</i>. Ten Jews individually loaned various sums of money to a feudal lord, each one receiving pledges as security, independently of the others. One day, the feudal lord called them together and told them that he preferred to deal with them collectively instead of individually. He also wanted an extension of the loans. Furthermore, he stipulated that whenever he would pay them a sum of money as interest they should divide it among themselves in proportion to their oans, and whatever he would repay on the principal should also be so divided. The creditors agreed to this arrangement. Subsequently, however, one creditor succeeded in collecting his debt independently of the others. Must he share with the others the amount he has collected?<br><i>A</i>. Since the creditors did not actually pool their money, their efforts, or their pledges, and did not form a partnership by any binding act, no partnership existed. Each creditor had a right to act in pursuance of his own interests. However, if the loan of the creditor who collected his debt independently was well secured by pledges or sureties, or if the security was sufficient to warrant a new loan by him, he may be called "wicked" for having damaged the interests of the other creditors. This is in accordance with the talmudic law (Kidd. 59a): If a poor man "turneth a cake" and another takes it away from him, the latter is called "wicked".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 286.

Siman 287

<i>Q</i>. Leah, A's widow who was now the wife of C, had taken the proper oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i> before a court, whereupon the court had transferred to her A's house in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>. This house had been originally given to A by his father, B, who had distributed the rest of his property among his (B's) sons-in-law as gifts <i>causa mortis</i>. B's sons-in-law now claim to possess a deed to the effect that B gave the house to A with the stipulation that, in case A died childless, the house should belong to B's daughters. [Since A died childless] B's sons-in-law demand the house.<br><i>A</i>. Since A was the legal heir to the house, B had no power to terminate A's normal right of conveying his inheritance to his heirs (cf. B. B. 133a). Therefore, B's stipulation limiting A's normal right of inheritance was void; the house unreservedly belonged to A, and Leah, his widow, had the right to collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 260; P. 287; Mord. B.B. 595; Hag. Maim., <i>Zekiah</i> 12, 3; Asher <i>Responsa</i> 84, 2; <i>Tur Hoshen Mishpat</i> 248; <i>Agudah</i> B.B. 180.

Siman 288

A woman is permitted to cohabit with her husband immediately after her immersion in the ritual bath, even if such immersion took place in the daytime [of the eighth day]. However, R. Tam holds that a woman is not permitted to immerse herself in a ritual bath during the daylight time of Sabbath even if it be her eighth day.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 507; P. 288.

Siman 289

<i>Q</i>. I have heard that you permit a woman to attend the bath-house for further lavation, after her required immersion in a ritual bath.<br><i>A</i>. I can find no reason for prohibiting such practice. For the original prohibition against washing in ordinary water after immersion in a ritual bath, was directed only against persons preparing themselves for sacred duties; while a woman prepares herself for a secular purpose. My teacher R. Isaak of Vienna, was wont to prohibit such practice; nevertheless, when I once presented my point of view discussing the matter at length in his presence, he did not contradict me. I also heard from young men from Mantua, that when he (?) inquired about the matter from Rabbi Isaiah of Burgundy [of Trani], the latter also permitted the practice.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 289; Am. II, 55; cf. Mord. Sheb. 750.

<i>Q</i>. One of two opposing litigants wants his case to be tried by the local court of Rothenburg, while the other litigant insists on bringing it before the <i>Beth Havaad</i> (superior court) at Marienburg.<br><i>A</i>. The Talmud differentiates between litigants, giving a creditor the right to choose the court for the trial of his case (Sanh. 31b). At present, however, an ordinance of the communities prevails to the effect that, in a place where an authoritative court exists, no litigant may insist on taking his case before the <i>Beth Havaad</i>. Therefore, the litigants (of Rothenburg) must choose a court that will hear their claims; and the court, in turn, will refer their claims to a superior court of its own choosing.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 290.

The talmudic statement, that a man may direct his young daughter (a minor) to accept <i>kiddushin</i> (Kid. 19a), implies that having once directed her to receive <i>kiddushin</i>, he may no longer withhold his consent from her doing so. Although the Talmud prohibits the betrothal of a minor (Kid. 41a), this prohibition only means that a father should not himself take the betrothal-money of his young daughter (a minor), but he may permit her to accept the money herself. Thus have I acted in the case of my own young daughter; I told her to receive her <i>kiddushin</i>, if she wanted to do so.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 293; cf.

A ritual examiner (of slaughtered cows) who passed as <i>kosher</i> (ritually fit for eating) two or three cows that were ritually unfit, must be removed from his post until he completely repents of his act.

You have written correctly: R. Alexandri may not compel the witnesses to reveal their testimony, until they appear in court to have it recorded by order of the judges. Furthermore, he may not cause the ban to be pronounced against the witnesses, if they are willing to testify without recourse to the ban. However, if R. Alexandri fears that other witnesses may withhold their testimony, he may, by the authority of the judges, compel you (the community?) to pronounce the ban against any and all witnesses who refuse to testify.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 296.

<i>Q</i>. In the dispute between A and B the court found that B owed A money. A demanded either immediate payment, or that B put up a bond to insure such payment. B, however, asked for the usual thirty days' interval in which to carry out the decision of the court. Are A's demands justified?<br><i>A</i>. B is entitled to the thirty days' interval. The system of justice current in Israel is guaranty enough for A that after the thirty days will have passed the court will enforce its ruling. The reason for allowing a person only thirty days within which to comply with a court's decision, while, according to the Talmud, an <i>adrakta</i> is written after a ninety day interval, is this: An <i>adrakta</i> is written when the court finds no property from which to collect; but, if the property of the debtor is within reach, a judgment is enforced after the thirty days' interval has passed.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 267; P. 297.

R. Tam decided that a minor may not be counted among the ten men required to make up a <i>minyan</i>, and we can not go against his decision. Therefore, when you find yourself in a position where the other congregants are about to count a minor among the required ten, the best thing for you to do is to leave the synagogue, and thus avoid being the cause of a transgression.<br>This Responsum bears the superscription: "to my teacher, R.

The purpose for which the money was given may be changed by the members of the synagogue (though it can not be so changed by the donor) for the following reasons: a) Preparing an object for sacred use does not sanctify the object until it is actually used for such purpose; b) candles and oil used in a synagogue are not intrinsically sacred; nor are they even considered <i>tashmishe kedushah</i> (objects used for a sacred function) since they are not indispensable to the function of the synagogue.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 269; P. 299–300.

<i>Q</i>. A demanded of B the silver girdle and golden stomacher he had deposited with him. B averred that A's wife, before her marriage to A, had deposited these jewels with him in order to withhold them from A and keep them for the children by her former marriage. Now that she had died, B wished to do her bidding and deliver the jewels to her children. We, therefore, decided that B take an oath as to the truth of his statement and deliver the jewels to the heirs of A's wife. Next day, however, when B was to take the oath, he declared that he had been reminded, by his wife, of the truth of A's claim, and that he was ready to take an oath to the effect that A deposited the jewels with him. The heirs of A's wife, however, who were present at the trial on the previous day, claimed that B had, then, admitted having in his possession jewels that belonged to them. They, therefore, demanded these jewels.<br><i>A</i>. If B takes an oath to the effect that A deposited the jewels with him, and returns them to A, he will be free from obligation to the woman's heirs. We must be satisfied with such an oath since B had recourse to a <i>Miggo</i> (an alternative claim) that would only have imposed a different oath on him; for B could have claimed that he had returned the jewels to the heirs, or that the jewels had been stolen or lost, after the court had reached the above decision. Such claims by B would only have obligated him to take an oath. Although we usually do not accept a defendant's claim to have been mistaken in his original admission, even when such defendant had recourse to a <i>Miggo</i>, this case is different, since B is not a litigant and is to gain nothing from either alternative.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 301; Mord.

Subsequently A learned that she had sold the coat to him (to A) at a profit of more than one pound. B denied that his wife had ever made such promise to A.<br><i>A</i>. B's wife is free from obligation and is not required to take an oath to support her husband's claim. A solemn promise is equivalent to an oath, and we do not impose an oath, in order to establish the existence of another oath.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 302.

Rabbi Dan's report in my name is correct, that when one person gives goods to another in order that the latter trade therewith and the former share in the profits, half of the value of such goods is considered a loan (the other half is considered a deposit), even to the extent that a Sabbatical year effects its cancellation. I always consider it a loan in every respect. The law that such half be considered a loan is stated in the Talmud without qualification (B. M. 104b). The stipulations of Raba are specific; they do not go beyond those mentioned by Raba.<br>R. Meir adds: Your requests, Rabbi Samuel and Rabbi Dan, that I forgive Rabbi Hananiah for his insults to me are granted. I fully absolve him of guilt.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 304; Pr. 973; Tesh.

A claimed that B, in having declared himself ready to help a Gentile, his antagonist, had caused him a loss of sixteen pounds; for A, fearing B, had to settle with the Gentile, thus sustaining the loss.<br>R. Meir absolved B from any obligation to A. Since B had not actually taken an oath on the Gentile's behalf, he was only a passive cause of A's loss, which is a lesser degree of responsibility even than that of an indirect cause.<br>R. Meir further decided that when a Gentile chooses two Jewish witnesses in his litigation with a Jew, and the latter agrees to admit in evidence the testimony of these two (in the court of the land), they may testify on the Gentile's behalf, even though the (other) Jews protest against such action. Once having been accepted by the two parties to the litigation, their oath would not add anything.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 311.

<i>Q</i>. I heard that you permit the lending of charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits, but not in the losses, resulting from its investment by the borrower. Such a transaction is forbidden by Rabbinical decree; why, then, should it be permitted in connection with charity-funds? Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. Lending charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, is forbidden. The Rabbis who said (B. M. 70a) that a person lending money on such a condition is called "wicked" made no distinction between rich and poor. Since a poor person is not permitted to lend his money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, we are not permitted to do so for him.<br>Note: The following introduction precedes the answer: Please excuse me for the brief response. For the last two weeks I have been confined to bed and have lost the taste for food. I wrote to you a lengthy response regarding the lending of charity-funds, and sent it to you through a messenger named Marvel. I forgot the lengthy argument and discussion. I remember, however, to have agreed with your reasons and arguments, and to have added the following ….<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 425; P. 476. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B.M. 73.

Siman 477

<i>Q</i>. A borrowed ten pounds of charity-money on the following conditions: a) that he pay three pounds per year out of his profits; b) that should his profit be less than three pounds, he would have to pay only half of that profit; and c) in case there be a loss, A would suffer the entire loss himself. For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <i>abak ribbit</i> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <i>abak ribbit</i> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.<br><i>A</i>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal.<br>R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir's decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision.<br>R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to "ask the Oracle" (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 426; P. 477.

Nowadays the talmudic law regarding a rebellious wife no longer applies. The ordinance of the Saboraim prevails instead, that when a woman refuses to live with her husband, he is immediately to be coerced into granting her a divorce. This ordinance was instituted in order that Jewish women should not turn to mischief. The woman is to receive whatever she has brought in as her dowry (<i>Nikse Zon Barzel</i>), and whatever is left of her own property to which her husband had the right of usufruct (<i>Nikse Melug</i>). The Geonim ruled that she was also entitled to the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>. The husband is to be coerced, by threat of excommunication, into granting the divorce, for who will dare contradict the decisions of the great luminary Rabbenu Gershom, the Geonim, Alfasi, Maimonides, and R. Isaac di Trani? One may not object that such favorable treatment would encourage many women to rebel against their husbands; Heaven forfend, Jewish daughters are not suspected of such malefaction. They prefer to stay married even in adverse circumstances, and would not seek a divorce unless actually driven thereto.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 285, nos. 337–9; P. 494. Cf.

<i>Q</i>. R. Moses maintained that he had settling-rights in the town of Quedlinburg. This claim was supported by the testimony of a single, qualified, witness, who subsequently died. R. Moses, therefore, demanded his rights. The members of the Q. community, however, disclaimed any knowledge of the existence of such settling-rights. Rabbi Isaac, of blessed memory, had instituted the custom of Q. of accepting the testimony of a single witness as evidence, in matters appertaining to settling-rights, and of disregarding testimony of disqualified witnesses.<br><i>A</i>. Although the members of the Q. community are disqualified as witnesses in this case, they may take an oath (as litigants) to rebut the testimony of the single witness. Therefore, if the community will pronounce the ban (against anyone who will make false statements) and the inhabitants of Q. will declare in accordance with this ban that they had never heard that R. Moses had obtained settling-rights in Q., R. Moses will then have no right to settle there. If some of the inhabitants testify that they had heard, or had been told by their parents definitely, that R. Moses had no settling-rights in Q. — even if the rest of the inhabitants are silent on the matter — R. Moses will not be permitted to settle in Q. because it would constitute an infringement of the rights of these few. Statements of some of the inhabitants in R. Moses' favor, would, then, not affect the situation, since they are disqualified as witnesses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 514; Pr. 231.

<i>Q</i>. A drop of milk fell on the outside of a (meat) pot covering the greater part of it. Are the pot and its contents fit for use?<br><i>A</i>. Rabbenu Samson permits its use while Ri forbids it. Ri bases his opinion on the fact that a drop of milk does not spread over the whole pot, and since the part of the pot affected is not sixty times the volume of the milk, the milk is not neutralized. Therefore, even according to Ri if one could gage the volume of the milk and find a ratio of one to sixty to the volume of the part of the pot affected, the milk would be neutralized. In any event, if the loss be an appreciable one, or the enjoyment of the Sabbath or a holiday be involved, one may be lenient, in view of R.

<i>Q</i>. Many candles are usually lit in the synagogue on the morning of a holiday. Some persons want to forbid such a practice on the ground that the light of a candle is useless in the daytime, and one is not permitted on a holiday to light a candle the light of which serves no use.<br><i>A</i>. The light of many candles in the synagogue, whether in daytime or at night, enhances the spirit of festivity and rejoicing. Were it not for this reason, the practice of lighting many candles in the synagogue for Friday evening services, when a holiday falls on Friday, would be forbidden, since services are usually over before dark and the candles are not needed for their light; and the lighting of many candles on a holiday night would be forbidden, since a single candle dispels darkness. The practice referred to is, therefore, perfectly in order.<br>R. Meir added: Please forgive me for not having answered your questions. I was very busy and forgot to answer. I even lost your letter.

Rabbi Samuel of Eisenach, a relative of R. Meir, permitted the eating of ritually slaughtered chickens with which a <i>trefah</i> chicken was mixed up. He based his decision on an opinion he said he had received from R. Jacob, that the law stated in Mishna Ab. Z. 5, 9, and interpreted in the Talmud Ab. Z. 74a, is the accepted law governing mixtures. This talmudic interpretation implies, that only objects possessing both characteristics: a) items usually sold by the piece, and b) forbidden objects, the profitable use of which is prohibited (<i>issurei hanaah</i>), are never neutralized in a mixture. However, objects lacking one of these characteristics do become neutralized in the proper mixture.<br>R. Meir took issue with R. Samuel, pointing out, that the accepted authorities never mention the foregoing view as the final law. On the contrary, these authorities decide that items usually sold by the piece, even though they be not forbidden objects the profitable use of which is prohibited, are never neutralized. Moreover, R. Samuel contradicted himself and ruled that a "piece fit to be offered a guest", even though it be not <i>issurei hanaah</i>, is not neutralized; but a whole chicken is also considered "a piece fit to be offered a guest". R. Meir, therefore, pleads with R. Samuel to acknowledge his mistake, and change his decision, lest it become a misleading precedent which may be followed by future generations.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 14; Am I, 75.

<i>Q</i>. Water was drawn with a leaking vessel from a ritual bath until less than forty <i>seah</i> remained in it. The vessel had a hole, the size of a finger, in its side, immediately adjacent to the bottom. There is no doubt, therefore, that at least three <i>lugin</i> of water leaked back from the vessel into the bath, thus rendering the bath unfit for ritual purposes. Therefore, no inflow of fresh water could ever purify it for ritual purposes. The obvious solution would be completely to drain the bath until less than three <i>lugin</i> of water remain therein. But the natural inflow of fresh water is so intense that the bath can not be so drained.<br><i>A</i>. I should prefer to have the bath completely drained and thus be spared the trouble of discovering legal grounds to declare the bath fit for ritual purposes. Since, however, that is impossible, I declare that the bath is ritually pure for two reasons: a) since the hole in the vessel is immediately adjacent to the bottom so that the vessel can not retain any water, it is legally not considered a vessel. Therefore, the water dripping therefrom is not considered <i>maim sheubim</i> (drawn water) and does not render the bath unfit for ritual purposes. b) This ritual bath, being a natural spring, does not become unfit by the admixture of <i>maim sheubim</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. Does water scooped up in a winnowing shovel, (that has a rim on three sides but is open on the fourth side) and poured back into the ritual bath render the bath unfit for ritual purposes?<br><i>A</i>.

Even though the forming of three dimensional figures is forbidden, a Jew is permitted to paint figures, since paintings have no thickness. Moreover, the Talmud (Ab. Z. 43 a-b) seems to imply that a Jew is permitted even to make three dimensional figures of animals and birds, since only the fashioning of figures of the human body or the quadruple figure of man, lion, ox and eagle is forbidden.<br>This Responsum is addressed to R.

<i>Q</i>. A widow seized for her sustenance all the money left by her late husband. The orphans claim that she thus seized more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. May she be compelled to return the money?<br><i>A</i>. Although R. Isaac b. Abraham believes that the talmudic ruling, "a widow who seized (her husband's) valuables for her sustenance may retain such valuables (Ket. 96a)," applies to cases where it is known that the widow seized less than the value of her <i>ketubah;</i> his brother, R. Samson b. Abraham, and Maimonides, believe that the ruling applies to any amount seized by the widow, for the amount a widow may need for her sustenance is indeterminate. Therefore, the widow may retain the money she has seized for her sustenance. She need take no oath as to the amount seized, since such oath would serve no purpose. However, should she subsequently demand additional funds for her sustenance, she would have to take an oath as to the amount she seized and to the manner she used it. She may restrain the orphans from selling immovables they inherited from her late husband since her sustenance is a lien upon such property, but she can not invalidate a sale already concluded.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 394; Am II, 3; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. Does the custom of the Galileans prevail, which provides that the widow is entitled to receive her sustenance out of her husband's estate all the days of her widowhood until she demand her <i>ketubah</i>; or is the custom of the Judeans to be followed, which provides that the heirs may discontinue providing her sustenance as soon as they are ready to pay her the <i>ketubah</i> (Ket. 52b, 54a)?<br><i>A</i>. Opinions differ on this subject and I should not dare to decide between the authorities. However, we always follow the decisions of Alfasi whenever they are not contradicted by the Tosaphists. In this case the Tosaphists specifically agree with Alfasi that the custom of the Galileans was to be followed. The fact that two or three members of your community found it necessary to insert, in the <i>ketubot</i> they gave to their wives, the clause: "after my death, should you desire to remain a widow the rest of your life you may take possession of all my property" does not prove that your community has adopted the Judean custom. These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow's position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands' estates by being paid their <i>ketubah</i>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom. Mere ignorance of their rights may have been the only reason these widows did not protest against such an ouster.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: P. 281; Am. II, 4; Mord. Ket. 170. Cf.

Is the trustee justified in his demand?<br><i>A</i>. Since the property was mortgaged to A's widow, she is now considered to be in possession of her <i>ketubah</i>. And as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, she is not required to take an oath (Ket. 87b) unless the orphans claim positive knowledge of her having appropriated anything that belonged to their father.

<i>Q</i>. A widow seized the property of her late husband. She kept it for years; some of it she squandered, and some of it she gave away as presents. Now the orphans demand that she take an oath regarding her management of the aforesaid property.<br><i>A</i>. The orphans are justified in their demand that the widow take an oath regarding the property she has squandered or given away. Although the Yerushalmi rules that a widow who seized the property of her late husband is not required to render an accounting, Ritzba (R. Isaak b.

Since the widow derived her sustenance from the property of the orphans<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the widow did not take the required oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i>, the estate belonged to the orphans.</i>, the fruit of her labor belonged to them.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 15.

<i>Q</i>. A married a widow, B, and lived with her for eight years till her death. B had not taken the customary widow's oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i> due her from her former husband. When she married A she was not considered very rich and no one suspected that she owned more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. But, after her death, when A declared, under oath, to the community (leaders, probably for purposes of taxation) the value of his assets, it was discovered that he had inherited from B more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> from her former husband. The heirs of the latter, therefore, demand that A return the excess to them.<br><i>A</i>. If the valuables B brought to A were undistinguishable and no one recognized them as having belonged to B's former husband, A is free from obligation for five reasons. a) Even if the valuables B brought to A were worth more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>, such valuables may not all necessarily have come from the estate of her former husband, for she might have received some gifts or found a treasure. b) Were B still alive she would have been obliged to take an oath [to the effect that she did not take from her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>], but now that she is dead, A is free from the obligation of taking an oath, since he is not supposed to know his wife's affairs. c) A is not even required to take the oath of an heir — that B never told him, and that he did not know that she had received from the estate of her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> — since the heirs of B's former husband are not positive in their claim. The heirs, however, may pronounce the ban (<i>herem</i>) in the synagogue against anyone who does possess such knowledge and does not reveal it. Such ban would include A. d) Whatever a person would have retained, had he taken an oath, his heirs may retain without the necessity of taking an oath. e) Some authorities require A to take the oath of an heir; but since many great authorities absolve him from such oath, and since A is in possession of the aforesaid valuables, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. For similar reasons A would be free from the obligation of taking an oath, even if some of the valuables brought to him by B were distinguishable and were recognized as having belonged to B's former husband, if the valuables thus recognized were in themselves not worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>. But, if the distinguishable valuables are in themselves worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>, A must return the difference to the heirs of B's first husband.<br><i>Q</i>. Witnesses have testified to the effect that B and her former husband, C, had made a binding agreement that in the event of the death of one party, the surviving party would share the property with the heirs. After C's death, B settled with all of C's heirs, except the youngest, D, who was born after the drawing up of the agreement. D, therefore, is now pressing his claim.<br><i>A</i>. D was entitled to his share even though he was born after the agreement was made, for in it B did not bestow benefits on anybody; she merely relinquished her rights to C's property up to a certain extent, and D later became heir to the relinquished property. However, A may claim that B brought him nothing from C's estate, or he may contend that B had already settled with D, and be free from obligation for the reasons enumerated above.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 17; cf.

<i>Q</i>. A drew up a legal document in which he used the following words: "Effective as of today, but to be executed after our (meaning himself and his wife, L) deaths, our daughter R shall inherit an equal share with her brothers, those already born and those that might be born, in whatever will remain of my estate." After A's death, his children and his widow, L, interpreted the document to mean that A had appointed L trustee over his estate. When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement.<br><i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B's part of her share) immediately, while B's two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L's death.<br>Although the brothers are entitled to manage R's share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L's death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <i>ketubah</i>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R's share. R may not claim that her father has made her an outright gift, free of any lien or obligation, since A did not intend to give R a greater share than that of his sons. After L's death, R may exact an oath from her brothers to the effect that they did not retain for themselves anything belonging to her.<br><i>Q</i>. L's trustee claimed that L's property which she had given to her husband, had been given only to gratify him, but had not been intended as an outright gift. Therefore, this property had belonged to L; and she gave it to her mother by right.<br><i>A</i>. This property was not listed in L's <i>ketubah</i>, and was thus considered <i>niksei melug</i> regarding which a woman may not claim that her gift thereof to her husband was not actually meant to be binding but was given in order to gratify him (B. B. 50a). Therefore, the gift was binding, and she no longer had any claim to said property. She had no right to give it to her mother.<br>This Resp. is addressed to: "My teacher Rabbi Eliezer b. Ephraim."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 30; Pr. 243–4; Am II, 18.

<i>Q</i>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A's son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A's children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A's children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A's impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L's children and one of A's children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A's other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.<br><i>A</i>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A's valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A's children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L's refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R. Mushlin, A's brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A's children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: "Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house." L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife's reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin's assertions were true, A's gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <i>causa mortis</i>, since it was to be given to them after A's death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <i>causa mortis</i> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A's estate. L's daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A's heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A's estate. L's son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.<br><i>Q</i>. L, at the time of her arrest, hired an agent to manage A's estate, to collect debts and sell valuables, in order to raise money for the ransom. She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A's children.<br><i>A</i>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin's claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A's estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L's <i>ketubah</i>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.<br><i>Q</i>. Upon her marriage, A's daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).<br><i>A</i>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <i>ketubah</i> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A's daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <i>ketubah</i>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L's interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.<br><i>Q</i>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <i>ketubah</i> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?<br><i>A</i>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.<br><i>Q</i>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <i>marks</i> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: "I shall never demand this money from you". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: "You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!" R. Meir further adds: "At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose."<br>These Responsa are addressed to "My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

<i>Q</i>. A paid his taxes directly to the overlord of his town, independently of the rest of the community. The overlord, suspecting that A possessed much greater wealth than he usually professed to have, and being driven by a greed for money, arrested him without cause and later arrested his wife L. Before her arrest, however, and before the reason for these arrests became manifest, L helped Gershom, A's son by a previous marriage, to flee the domain of the overlord and thus escape from his clutches. Meanwhile, A was put to death in prison. The overlord posted guards in the town to make sure that A's children did not escape, and demanded a large sum of money from L. He further proposed that L merge her taxes with those of the community and that the latter jointly with L negotiate the new tax. When the community representatives asked as to the identity of the persons who would be expected to pay this tax, the overlord answered that everybody would pay it, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The community representatives, then, strongly objected to the merger with L; whereupon the overlord agreed to negotiate with them separately. He levied a very heavy tax on the community, but this tax did not exceed the estimated value of the wealth of the community members. L was warned that should she prove to be stubborn and unyielding, she and A's children would be made to suffer the same fate as A. Finally the overlord came to terms with L and agreed to release her, and to return to her A's impounded valuables, for a ransom of six hundred and twenty pounds. To insure the payment of this ransom the overlord demanded as hostages one of L's children and one of A's children by his former marriage. Now Gershom, and A's other children by his former marriage, refuse to pay their part of the ransom money, and instead, wish to pay their part of the assessment on the community.<br><i>A</i>. Gershom is not obliged to pay any part of the ransom money since he escaped before the overlord asked for such money. Although L engineered his escape, he is under no monetary obligation to her, since she merely did him a favor. However, if Gershom is to claim, as his share of the inheritance, part of A's valuables that have remained in town within the grasp of the overlord, he must pay a proportionate part of the ransom for such valuables. A's children by his former marriage must pay their part of the ransom money in proportion to their wealth. Even though they were not imprisoned, there is sufficient indication that the overlord intended to include them in the extortion. Thus, guards had been posted in town to watch them, and their lives had been explicitly threatened upon L's refusal to come to terms with the overlord. Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R. Mushlin, A's brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A's children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: "Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house." L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife's reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin's assertions were true, A's gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <i>causa mortis</i>, since it was to be given to them after A's death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <i>causa mortis</i> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A's estate. L's daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A's heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A's estate. L's son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.<br><i>Q</i>. L, at the time of her arrest, hired an agent to manage A's estate, to collect debts and sell valuables, in order to raise money for the ransom. She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A's children.<br><i>A</i>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin's claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A's estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L's <i>ketubah</i>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.<br><i>Q</i>. Upon her marriage, A's daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).<br><i>A</i>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <i>ketubah</i> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A's daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <i>ketubah</i>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L's interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.<br><i>Q</i>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <i>ketubah</i> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?<br><i>A</i>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.<br><i>Q</i>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <i>marks</i> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: "I shall never demand this money from you". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: "You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!" R. Meir further adds: "At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose."<br>These Responsa are addressed to "My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

Moreover, had the overlord negotiated with L regarding only her personal possessions, he would not have demanded 620 pounds from her, knowing full well that she was entitled to receive from A's estate only her <i>ketubah</i>, and that such a sum was well beyond her means. The overlord did not demand from the community a sum greater than the value of all their wealth; therefore, it stands to reason that he was not entirely unreasonable in his demands upon L. We may assume with certainty that had L refused to pay the ransom, A's children would have been seized, and would have been killed or forcibly baptized. Had A's children protested against being ransomed, we would have paid no attention to them and would have effected their release even against their will, and then, we would have collected the ransom money from them; for we are obliged to ransom a Jew even against his will. Now, that A's children have not protested against the ransom, they must certainly contribute thereto in proportion to their wealth. Although their lives were threatened, and the talmudic law (B.B. 116b) would thus require that the amount of the ransom money should be calculated, one half equally for each person, and the other half in proportion to the individual's wealth, this law does not apply to our case. We know that the overlord was interested only in their money, not in taking their lives, as the whole trouble started because the overlord thought A to be very wealthy.<br><i>Q</i>. L seized some of A's movables claiming that she seized them for the purpose of paying for her sustenance. Some of these movables were originally impounded by the overlord and were later returned to L. May A's heirs force L to render under oath an account of such valuables?<br><i>A</i>. Movables impounded by an overlord are considered abandoned property (<i>hefker</i>), title thereto, passing to the first person who seizes them, since the original owner must have given up hope of retrieving them. Although owners do not usually abandon movables taken away by Gentile robbers (B.K. 114a), they do abandon these when impounded by the overlord of the town, since he is the undisputed master of the town and no one can restrain him. This was especially true in our case, since his claim was bolstered by false accusations. Therefore, L is under no obligation to give an account of the movables returned to her by the overlord. However, those movables which the overlord had returned to her, and which she gave to the overlord in partial payment of the ransom, should be credited <i>pro rata</i> to all those who are obliged to pay the ransom, since the valuables had been given to her in order to decrease the ransom for all parties involved. Furthermore, L is under no obligation to give an accounting of the other movables she seized (the movables that were not impounded by the overlord) as long as it is known that the value of such movables does not exceed the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. For whenever L demands her <i>ketubah</i>, she will have to take an oath regarding these movables; as long as she does not demand her <i>ketubah</i>, no oath can be imposed on her.<br><i>Q</i>. Rabbi Kuzlan, a relative of R. Meir, declared that A had deposited money with him and had told him to give the money, after A's death, to R. Mushlin, A's brother, who had received instructions regarding its disposal. Rabbi Kuzlan, therefore, gave the money to R. Mushlin. The latter claims that he was instructed by A to give all the money to A's children by his former marriage. R. Liber Shamash, another relative of R. Meir, testified that A made the following declaration in his presence: "Half of all the ready cash I have here, and in the house of Rabbi Kuzlan, and in the settlement, was given to Gershom my son, and the other half to his two older sisters, and I have empowered my brother Mushlin thus to dispose of the deposit that is in the house." L, on the other hand, produced a document wherein it was written that A had obligated himself not to alienate any of his property and thus put it beyond his wife's reach. L, therefore, demands that R. Mushlin take an oath to support his assertions.<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of R. Liber Shamash is of no consequence since a verbal admission of having given valuables to a certain person, is no proof that title to such valuables was actually transferred to that person. Therefore, R. Mushlin has no witness to support his assertions. Although heirs may not exact an oath from a trustee appointed by their father (Gitt. 52a), this rule applies only to the heirs, who are to inherit the property managed by the trustee; but, the heirs who, according to the assertions of the trustee, are not to receive any part of such property, may exact an oath from the trustee even though they are not positive in their claim that the trustee had wronged them. Therefore, L and her children may exact the oath from R. Mushlin. Moreover, even if R. Mushlin's assertions were true, A's gift to his children by his former marriage would be considered a gift <i>causa mortis</i>, since it was to be given to them after A's death. Since a widow and orphaned daughters are entitled to draw their sustenance from all <i>causa mortis</i> gifts, L and her daughters would be entitled to draw their sustenance, and L would be entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, from the money in the hands of R. Mushlin, if no unencumbered assets remain of A's estate. L's daughters are entitled to receive their sustenance till their marriage, the expense to be born proportionately by A's heirs (out of their inheritance). At the time of their marriage they will be entitled to a dowry of one tenth the immovables of A's estate. L's son, however, must derive his sustenance from his own portion of the inheritance, and when it will all be consumed he will have to resort to charity.<br><i>Q</i>. L, at the time of her arrest, hired an agent to manage A's estate, to collect debts and sell valuables, in order to raise money for the ransom. She agreed to pay the agent a large sum of money for his efforts. Furthermore, R. Mushlin claims to have incurred expenses in his efforts to save L and A's children.<br><i>A</i>. Since L had a right to hire an agent (Gitt. 52a) and since she was in urgent need of help, the agent is entitled to receive adequate compensation for his efforts; the court is to determine what constitutes adequate compensation. The agent, however, is not entitled to receive anything above such amount, even though L had promised him much more, for wages and hire are subject to reassessment. If R. Mushlin's claim is disputed, he must take an oath to support it. L had no right to sell any part of A's estate unless such sale was made in the presence of a lay court. Therefore, the articles sold must be reevaluated by such a court. If the articles had been sold below such evaluation, the difference should be deducted from L's <i>ketubah</i>; but if the articles were sold above the estimated value, the difference should revert to the heirs.<br><i>Q</i>. Upon her marriage, A's daughter by a former marriage was given by R. Mushlin, as part of her dowry, her share (one quarter) of the money originally deposited with Rabbi Kuzlan (see part 3).<br><i>A</i>. L was entitled to collect a proportionate part of her <i>ketubah</i> exclusively from this money; now that this money had been given to the husband of A's daughter, L may no longer collect that part of her <i>ketubah</i>. Therefore, R. Mushlin has directly damaged L's interests and must make good, out of his own pocket, the loss thus sustained by L.<br><i>Q</i>. Are the heirs permitted to pay L her <i>ketubah</i> by transferring to her debts due from Gentiles, if she objects to such manner of payment?<br><i>A</i>. Debts due from Gentiles can not be directly assigned to a third person. Even though there is an indirect method of assigning such debts, a woman may refuse such manner of payment since even a creditor or one who has suffered damage may refuse to receive payment in such manner. Moreover, a woman is not expected to suffer the hardships and indignities entailed in collecting debts from Gentiles. Therefore, L may insist on being paid only in nonencumbered valuables.<br><i>Q</i>. During the perilous period of the persecution by the overlord, a Gentile who owed ten <i>marks</i> to A came to L and asked her to release him from this debt. L, fearing lest refusal would aggravate the situation, said to the Gentile: "I shall never demand this money from you". A's heirs claim that this release caused them an unnecessary loss of ten <i>marks</i>.<br><i>A</i>. Neither according to Jewish law nor according to the law of the land does L's statement release the debtor from his obligation to A's heirs. But, if according to the law of your particular town this debt is considered cancelled, L is to be held responsible for the amount the debt was worth at the time of the release. Surely the debt was not worth very much at a time when the creditor was in mortal danger! However, if L released the aforementioned debtor, as a safety measure, and as a contributing factor to gain relief, the loss must be born by L, and the heirs that were in town at the time, <i>pro rata</i>.<br><i>Q</i>. A had deposited one pound with a burgher. After L came to terms with the overlord, the burgher returned the pound. L and the heirs who were in town during the period of danger, claim that it would have been impossible to collect the pound from the burgher if the settlement had not been effected with the overlord, while the other heirs claim that the burgher would have returned the money in any event.<br><i>A</i>. If L is not able to take an oath to the effect, that (she is certain that) the deposit would in all probability have been lost if not for the settlement with the overlord, no ransom money can be collected from this deposit.<br><i>Q</i>. The youngest heir received for his share debts due to the estate. The market value of these debts was much less than their face value. Since every heir must contribute to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i> in proportion to the amount of money, he or she, inherited from A's estate, what amount is the youngest heir to contribute?<br><i>A</i>. He must contribute in proportion to the market value of the debts.<br><i>Q</i>. Two notes of indebtedness were held in A's room which had been sealed up by the overlord (at the time of the extortion). Are the investments attested to by these notes, subject to the payment of the ransom money?<br><i>A</i>. These investments are in the same category as the money and the valuables that were held in the room; for had no agreement been reached with the overlord, he would have taken away the notes of indebtedness, and the investments would have been lost. Even when the notes are presented to (Gentile) debtors, they are often unwilling to repay their debts; when such notes are lost, one can not expect repayment. Moreover, the overlord would have collected these debts for himself.<br><i>Q</i>. L took from Gershom's share debts to the value of one hundred and seventy pounds. Now that Gershom is not required to pay any ransom money, how can he collect his money?<br><i>A</i>. Gershom may charge this amount to his sisters' shares of the ransom money and collect it from them, or he may charge it to the payment of L's <i>ketubah</i>. L does not have to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or the ransom money, directly from the orphan girls; she may collect it from their money in the hands of R. Mushlin. The latter has no right to give the money he holds, to anyone until L receives all that is due her from the heirs, both male and female, each one according to his share.<br>If R. Mushlin has already given this money to the heirs, or should he in the future give it to them in order to put obstacles in L's way, and thus make it difficult for her to collect her money, then R. Mushlin is to be held responsible for such payments, and is to pay L out of his own pocket.<br>R. Meir adds: "You have protracted your case and have burdened me beyond endurance. I cannot bear your sending me any further inquiries regarding this case. It is obvious that the trustees are only interested in causing annoyance, vexation and protraction. From now on judge any case that may come before you, yourselves!" R. Meir further adds: "At last it has become apparent, it is sad to reflect, that all these cunning machinations are employed only to harass the widow, to procrastinate, and to deprive her of her <i>ketubah</i>; but you are merely succeeding in troubling and harassing me to no purpose."<br>These Responsa are addressed to "My relatives Rabbi Elijah and Rabbi David".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

<i>Q</i>. L, who managed her husband's business, deposited money with B and C. Her husband, A, demands this money from B and C claiming that the money was his.<br><i>A</i>. If the money is in the hands of the depositaries, they must return it to A, since the latter entrusted his business to his wife. If, however, the money was returned to L and she claims that the money belongs to her, since it had been originally given to her on condition that her husband have no rights thereto; or that the money belongs to a person, D, who lent it to her, she may take an oath to support her claim and retain the money. Although a husband may not exact an oath from his wife regarding her management of his business (Ket. 88a), this rule applies only to the case where the husband is not positive in his claim.<br><i>Q</i>. A left his wife L; and while he was away, L borrowed money for the sustenance of herself and of her infant daughter. A now refuses to pay the debts she thus incurred.<br><i>A</i>. If L will take an oath to the effect that these loans were made to her with the expectation that she would personally repay them and that now she is unable to do so, A will be obliged to pay these debts. For a husband must provide for the sustenance of his wife, and of his children until they reach the age of six.<br><i>Q</i>. L contends that A beat her.

And since L has no money and will have no money till she be widowed or divorced, there is no sense in exacting an oath from her.

<i>Q</i>. Does a father have the authority to restrain his son from emigrating to the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>.

Will a person whose wife refuses to accompany him on his emigration to the Holy Land, be liable to punishment for divorcing her?<br><i>A</i>.

Have you heard what were the reasons that prompted the prominent men to order their sons to return from the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>. It seems to me that the following were the reasons: a) No mercy was shown there; b) they were constantly troubled by the necessity of earning their bread, so that they could not devote their time to study; c) consequently they were lacking in knowledge of the <i>Torah</i>, and they were uncertain regarding the details of ritual law.

<i>Q</i>. We, the undersigned, were chosen as examiners and recorders of the claims of A and the widow L. Consequently, witnesses have testified before us: a) that when A was ill he asked his wife, R, to agree to an arrangement that would bring solace to their souls; b) that A and R, therefore, made a legally binding arrangement in their presence, to the effect that if A died first R would give three <i>marks</i> and A's clothes to a charity stipulated by him; and if R died first A would give six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes to a charity stipulated by her; and c) that subsequently A recovered from his illness, but R became critically ill and died of her illness. R's mother, L, came before us and claimed that, before her death, R appointed her (L) trustee of the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes, and that she asked her to distribute the same to any charity she saw fit. L, therefore, demanded the six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes from A. A on the other hand, claimed that he asked his wife before her death why she had not stipulated the recipients of this charity, and in reply she authorized him to spend two <i>marks</i> on the cemetery, either for the purpose of constructing a wall or for obtaining sand; to give half a <i>mark</i> for the sick, and to give the rest to R's needy relatives. Neither L nor A have any witnesses to support their assertions. Regarding the garments demanded by L, A claimed that L had already taken away all of R's clothes with the exception of one cloak. A demanded that L return to him his wife's seven gold rings, the two pieces of silver jewelry, the two Cologne gulden, and the money that was in R's pocket, which L had taken. L averred that she had returned to A everything that belonged to him. L further demanded that A pay her the expenses she incurred in transporting her daughter's body to another place for burial. A averred that he had paid for the casket and the shrouds; that L had transported R's body without his knowledge and consent; that he had intended to bury her in our town since there was a cemetery in our town; and that L had incurred unnecessary expenses in having R's relatives accompany the body to the place of burial. L, on the other hand, claimed that A had known of her intentions to transport her daughter to another town for burial, that A had consented to it, and that she could prove the truth of these contentions through the testimony of A's tutor, should the latter be forced to testify by a <i>herem</i>. A's tutor was summoned before us and testified to the following facts: A told him that he, A, would have accompanied his wife's body to the place of burial were he able to leave the house; he asked the tutor whether he was willing to take his place; the tutor agreed and accompanied the hearse as instructed. Three days after the claims in question were placed before us, L further claimed that A had been at odds with her daughter and, therefore, the latter did not entrust to him the charity money, and preferred that L distribute it. A denied this claim asserting that there was never any enmity between him and his wife, and that, on the contrary, she became very affectionate toward him during her illness and tried to show this affection in many ways. L also claimed that she had already distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions; while A claimed to have warned L not to give anything away without his consent. A discovered some of the garments distributed by L in the hands of the recipients. Please explain in detail who is to be entrusted with the distribution of the charity money, and please write your answer on the reverse side of this parchment. Signed: Samuel b. Eliezer haKohen; Kalonymus b. Asher; Nahman b. Nathan.<br><i>A</i>. If L claims that A was present when her daughter appointed her the distributor of the money and the clothes, A must take cognizance of her claims and must take an oath denying such claims. After taking such an oath, A will have to give to charity in the presence of witnesses the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes still in his possession. But, if L admits that A was not present at the time she was thus appointed distributor of the money and the clothes, A is under no obligation to L and must proceed to give them to charity in the presence of witnesses. L., on the other hand, must take an oath to the effect that she did not take anything belonging to A, that she has distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions, and be free from obligation. As to the expenses of R's funeral, if some of R's relatives, or some of A's relatives, had been transported and buried in the cemetery to which R's body was transported, A was under obligation to bury R in that cemetery, since a husband is obliged to bury his wife with all the honor and dignity customary in her family, or in his family, whichever be the greater. Therefore, A must pay L the expenses she incurred in the burial of her daughter, and must also repay all loans extended to L for that purpose. Moreover, even if no relatives of A or R were ever buried in this cemetery, since A sent his tutor to participate in the funeral, he thus gave his consent to the proceedings and must pay the expenses thereof. The amount of such expenses are to be attested to by L under oath. However, A is responsible only for the expenses strictly necessary for the funeral, but not for any unnecessary extravagances.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 33.

Your statement is correct. The act of a married woman who disposed of her clothes on her death-bed, is invalid. The clothes must be returned to the husband. For a husband buys raiment for his wife only for the purpose of her wearing them, not for the purpose of her giving them away. Although the husband was present at the time the gifts were made, and did not protest, his silence did not indicate consent.

<i>Q</i>. A, a nephew of Rabbi Kohen Zedek, asked the latter for advice regarding the planned betrothal of his daughter. A informed him that in his (A's) locality there were no qualified witnesses (unrelated to the bride) but that he intended to invite two strangers from another locality to act as witnesses to the betrothal. These two strangers, however, were brothers-in-law and one was the nephew of the other. Rabbi Kohen Zedek, then, told A that since these two were related to each other they were disqualified witnesses and consequently the betrothal would be void. A, however, answered that no great harm would be done even if the betrothal were void since the bridegroom would ultimately betroth the bride again, at the time of the marriage. A repeated this answer to the widowed sister of Rabbi Kohen Zedek who later witnessed the betrothal and protested that the witnesses were disqualified. Must A's daughter receive a divorce in order to free herself from the bridegroom?<br><i>A</i>. Since the two witnesses were related to each other, they were disqualified and the betrothal was not binding. Therefore, A's daughter needs no divorce. As to the spreading rumor that a betrothal took place, the opinion of Rav is accepted that when the court discovers that a certain rumor [of betrothal] had no foundation in fact, the court silences such rumor. Moreover, a rumor is of no consequence unless the probability of its truthful origin has been upheld in court (cf. Git. 89a f.), while in our case the rumor is known to be baseless.<br>Rabbi Kohen Zedek wrote again to Rabbi Meir raising doubt as to the correctness of R. Meir's decision, and informing him that his (R. Meir's) teacher from Spiers at first agreed with this decision but later disagreed with it; and that meanwhile A's daughter became betrothed to another man.<br>Rabbi Meir answered that the first decision of his teacher was correct; that in the case of a woman who was betrothed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was later discovered to be related to the bridegroom, Rabbi Joel haLevi decided in a Responsum that the woman did not need a divorce, and permitted her to remarry; and that he enclosed a copy of Rabbi Joel's Responsum in order to prove that his own decision was based on a solid foundation. He added: A rumor is of no consequence unless it be current in the town where the alleged betrothal took place. In this case, however, A and his sons were the only Jewish residents of the settlement, and they were told beforehand that such a betrothal would be void. Moreover, even the authorities who hold that we cannot dispel a rumor, agree that when a rumor is self-contradictory, or the statements made therein are not untrue but harmless, such rumor is of no consequence. We are not at liberty to be overstringent in such cases and demand that a divorce be delivered in order to dispel any shadow of doubt as to the girl's freedom to remarry, since such a step would make her ineligible to marry a man of priestly lineage.<br>The leaders of the communities [Spiers, Worms, and Mayence] upon learning that R. Meir permitted A's daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <i>Sefer Hamikzoot</i>, the author of <i>Sekel Tob</i>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A's daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom.<br>R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <i>Ittur</i> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <i>Sekel Tob</i>.<br>R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A's daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A's daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce.

<i>Q</i>. A, a nephew of Rabbi Kohen Zedek, asked the latter for advice regarding the planned betrothal of his daughter. A informed him that in his (A's) locality there were no qualified witnesses (unrelated to the bride) but that he intended to invite two strangers from another locality to act as witnesses to the betrothal. These two strangers, however, were brothers-in-law and one was the nephew of the other. Rabbi Kohen Zedek, then, told A that since these two were related to each other they were disqualified witnesses and consequently the betrothal would be void. A, however, answered that no great harm would be done even if the betrothal were void since the bridegroom would ultimately betroth the bride again, at the time of the marriage. A repeated this answer to the widowed sister of Rabbi Kohen Zedek who later witnessed the betrothal and protested that the witnesses were disqualified. Must A's daughter receive a divorce in order to free herself from the bridegroom?<br><i>A</i>. Since the two witnesses were related to each other, they were disqualified and the betrothal was not binding. Therefore, A's daughter needs no divorce. As to the spreading rumor that a betrothal took place, the opinion of Rav is accepted that when the court discovers that a certain rumor [of betrothal] had no foundation in fact, the court silences such rumor. Moreover, a rumor is of no consequence unless the probability of its truthful origin has been upheld in court (cf. Git. 89a f.), while in our case the rumor is known to be baseless.<br>Rabbi Kohen Zedek wrote again to Rabbi Meir raising doubt as to the correctness of R. Meir's decision, and informing him that his (R. Meir's) teacher from Spiers at first agreed with this decision but later disagreed with it; and that meanwhile A's daughter became betrothed to another man.<br>Rabbi Meir answered that the first decision of his teacher was correct; that in the case of a woman who was betrothed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was later discovered to be related to the bridegroom, Rabbi Joel haLevi decided in a Responsum that the woman did not need a divorce, and permitted her to remarry; and that he enclosed a copy of Rabbi Joel's Responsum in order to prove that his own decision was based on a solid foundation. He added: A rumor is of no consequence unless it be current in the town where the alleged betrothal took place. In this case, however, A and his sons were the only Jewish residents of the settlement, and they were told beforehand that such a betrothal would be void. Moreover, even the authorities who hold that we cannot dispel a rumor, agree that when a rumor is self-contradictory, or the statements made therein are not untrue but harmless, such rumor is of no consequence. We are not at liberty to be overstringent in such cases and demand that a divorce be delivered in order to dispel any shadow of doubt as to the girl's freedom to remarry, since such a step would make her ineligible to marry a man of priestly lineage.<br>The leaders of the communities [Spiers, Worms, and Mayence] upon learning that R. Meir permitted A's daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <i>Sefer Hamikzoot</i>, the author of <i>Sekel Tob</i>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A's daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom.<br>R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <i>Ittur</i> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <i>Sekel Tob</i>.<br>R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A's daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A's daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce. Although such a divorce is unnecessary, and hence should not be granted, as it would bar the woman from ever marrying a man of priestly lineage, I should overlook this point in honor of the Rabbis of the communities. Accordingly A's daughter will wait for a divorce till the feast of <i>Purim</i>. If the communities will be unable to effect the divorce within that time, because of the stubbornness of the bridegroom and his refusal to comply with their request, we shall go against the wishes of the community leaders and allow A's daughter to marry her second bridegroom; as we shall not permit that she be put in a position where she can never remarry.<br>We have never seen revered teachers of old act in the manner of the above-mentioned community leaders.

Q. A owed money to several persons. When B demanded his money from A, the latter admitted the debt but claimed that since he did not possess enough money or valuables to cover all his obligations, he preferred to divide his possessions equitably among his creditors. Since A admits, in court, his debt to B, may the latter force A to repay that debt in full, before he divides his property?<br><i>A</i>. Since A owes money to several persons, and since he owes more than the total value of his possessions, each creditor is entitled to receive an equal share of such possessions irrespective of the amount due him. The debtor, however, may distribute his assets among his creditors in proportion to the amount due to each, before they come to court; such distribution would be irrevocable, and would even constitute a praiseworthy act. Since A is willing so to divide his possessions, no judge can force him to favor one creditor at the expense of the other creditors. However, before receiving his share of A's possessions, movables or immovables, each creditor will have to take a creditor's oath — the same oath that a creditor takes upon collecting his debt from encumbered property.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 219; Am II, 45; Tesh.

When Rabbi Zamlan was ill he sent for Rabbi Asher in order that the latter help him dispose of his property in a manner that would make it impossible for his wife, L, to appropriate his possessions in payment of her <i>ketubah</i> or for her sustenance. Rabbi Asher refused to come, but Rabbi Zamlan implored him and pleaded with him saying: "What can I do for my only son who, after my death, will have to go begging from door to door?" Rabbi Asher then agreed to act as a witness, and Rabbi Zamlan gave away to his son and to other persons, all of his property as an outright gift effective immediately. After his death, L's relatives summoned Rabbi Zamlan's son to the court of Rabbi Perez. The latter recorded the claims of the two parties and sent the claims to Rabbi Meir without giving the names of the litigants and without expressing any opinion on the subject. Rabbi Meir ruled that L was entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or to draw her sustenance, from the possessions of Rabbi Zamlan which he had given to his son; his reason being that even an outright gift to an heir is considered an inheritance and that the widow's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien upon it.<br>Rabbi Perez took issue with Rabbi Meir quoting Alfasi's decision that the ordinance of Usha — which ruled that a person who divided all of his property among his children may derive his sustenance as well as that of his wife's from such property — was not accepted.<br>Rabbi Meir reproved Rabbi Perez for resorting to Alfasi when the Talmud specifically decided that the ordinance of Usha was not accepted. R. Meir contended, however, that only that part of the ordinance was not accepted which gave the right to the donor, and to his wife while he was alive, to derive their sustenance from the property he had given away; while the rule that the widow may collect her sustenance or her <i>ketubah</i> from such property after the donor's death, was accepted before the ordinance of Usha was promulgated, and has remained in force independently of such ordinance.<br>Meanwhile L's relatives have written to Rabbi Meir asking for his decsion in this matter. R. Meir answered that he usually refrained from sending legal opinions to litigants, or to their relatives, and confined his responses to judges. But, when Rabbi Perez, in his second letter, gave the names of the litigants, R. Meir realized that the letters from L's relatives dealt with the same case. R. Meir recalled that among these letters was found a letter from Rabbi Asher which explained the circumstances of the gift mentioned above. Therefore, R. Meir added (in his second letter to Rabbi Perez) that since according to Rabbi Asher's letter, the donor mentioned the contingency of death when he summoned Rabbi Asher, he therefore made the gift to his son <i>causa mortis</i> (cf.

<i>Q</i>. Within the first year of her marriage to A, L claimed that she detested him and could not live with him. Before their marriage, money had been given to L by her father, as a present, on condition that A never have a right to it. L, therefore, demanded this money and the accrued income thereof. On the other hand, L's father had promised a dowry to A but had postponed the date of delivery of such dowry, having expressed the fear that L might rebel against her husband within the first year of her marriage. A, therefore, demands the dowry from L's father.<br><i>A</i>. Although no present can be given to a married woman on condition that her husband have no right thereto, such a present may be given to her during the period of betrothal and thereupon the husband will have no right to such present or the income thereof. Therefore, the present and the accrued income must be returned to L. This decision is effective only if L's dislike of A is deep and genuine and is not induced by anyone. The community must pronounce the ban (<i>herem</i>) against anyone holding information relative to this matter; and if it be discovered that someone has induced L to rebel against A, then the money may be withheld from her as a punishment until she repents. The court always has a right to punish one even unduly, if such punishment will help to check lawlessness and indecency. In this case the punishment of L will serve as a warning to other women. Moreover, should A desire to marry another woman, I believe that he should be permitted to throw a bill of divorcement to L even against her will, since she is the rebellious party. A, however, is not entitled to the dowry promised to him by L's father, since the latter had expressed his intention of giving such dowry only in the event that L and A lived happily together.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 48.

<i>Q</i>. A lived normally with his wife L for some time. Later, however, L detected discharges of blood during copulation on three occasions. Should L "examine herself" (Niddah 66a, with a lead tube, in order to discover whether the blood flows from the interior of the womb or from the walls of the vagina) or must A divorce her immediately? In case of divorce, is L entitled to her <i>ketubah?</i><br><i>A</i>. Rashi and Ri hold opposite views on this subject. We are not at liberty to disregard Rashi's view and, therefore, can not permit A to live with L even if an "examination" will produce favorable results. However, we must make the following distinction: If the three acts of copulation during which blood<br>was detected were consecutive, A must divorce L forthwith; but, if they were not consecutive and between each act there were other acts during which no trace of blood was detected, A is permitted to live with L. If the copulations during which blood was detected, occurred on specific dates, or at regular intervals, A must refrain from copulation on such dates. Moreover, if A is not anxious to remarry, and is willing to allow L to live away from him in another district and to deal with her through an intermediary or only in the presence of a third party, he does not have to divorce her. In case of divorce, however, L is entitled to the <i>Ikkar-ketubah</i> and to her dowry, but she cannot collect the additional jointure, since some authorities are of the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure.<br>This Resp. is addressed to "my relative Rabbi Baruch ha-Kohen."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 49; Rashba I, 839, 40; Pr. 625; Mord. <i>Niddah</i>, 735; Hag.

<i>Q</i>. After urinating Leah usually finds blood on her "examining rag" (<i>ed</i>); the Rabbis of Cologne are of the opinion that she is permitted to cohabit with her husband, since the ruling of R.

Jose would admit that upon finding blood on her "examining rag", after urination, the woman would be ritually unclean. (For R. Jose's opinion is based on the belief that blood found in urine does not come from the interior of the womb, but from a wound or sore; cf. Pr. 630; Mord. <i>Niddah</i> 735. That blood on the "examining rag" after urination however usually comes from the interior of the womb, is universally accepted.)

We have carefully investigated and found that this woman has a wound in her womb; for every time she urinates she suffers severe pain. Occasionally, but not always, she finds blood in her urine; but no blood is found immediately after urination, neither upon wiping herself nor on the "examining rag". I, therefore, agree with you that this woman is permitted to cohabit with her husband, for, when a woman says she has a wound in her womb from which the blood exudes, she is to be believed.<br>This responsum is addressed to Rabbi Yekutiel; the <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, however, ascribes the question to Rabbi Asher.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 52; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 339a.

L has a wart in her vagina which bleeds during copulation and even when touched by the "examining rag". I am inclined to believe that L is ritually clean since we assume that her blood comes from the wart and not from the interior of the womb. During her regular period (of menstruation), if she definitely feels that the blood comes from the wart, she is ritually clean; otherwise she is unclean. At other times she is ritually clean even when she does not definitely feel that the blood comes from the wart. She can recognize the menses by a greater flow of blood than that which usually comes from the wart. At her menstruation period she must count the same number of days as hitherto. Moreover, knowing exactly where the wart is situated, she should be able to manipulate the "examining rag" in such a way as to discover whether there be present any menstrual blood.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 53; cf.

<i>Q</i>. Are the "days of purity" [the days between the seventh and the fortieth day after the birth of a son, and between the fourteenth and the eightieth day after the birth of a daughter during which a flow of blood does not render the woman unfit to cohabit with her husband] still in effect? Alfasi rules that the "days of purity" are not in effect at present.<br><i>A</i>. I have not at hand Alfasi on the laws of <i>Niddah</i>, but I once examined carefully the statement of Alfasi, referred to, and found that he did not mean to convey your meaning at all; for there is no doubt that the "days of purity" are still in effect.<br>R. Meir adds: When I studied under my teachers in France, my father asked my teacher whether the "days of purity" were still in effect. My teacher was surprised that this should be doubted at all, since no opinion to the contrary is quoted in the Talmud. He asked me so to inform my father. But, when I subsequently returned to this kingdom I was told that Alfasi had decided that the days of purity were no longer in effect. A closer examination of the text of Alfasi, however, did not bear this out.

<i>Q</i>. A, of priestly lineage, saw his wife L go to a secluded place with a certain young man. They stayed there only for a short time, for L's mother walked toward them with a lighted candle. On another occasion, while lying in bed late at night, A heard, on the other side of the wall, the heavy breathing of his wife and the young man as they were arduously embracing each other, which to him was clearly indicative of consummated sexual intercourse. The same incident was repeated on another night. On these occasions L was late coming to bed. Next morning, however, when A rebuked L for her lewd conduct, she protested vigorously. Nevertheless A was convinced that his wife commited adultery and was, therefore, forbidden to him. A had always loved and catered to L, but she had never returned that love, and had never submitted to him willingly.<br>Rabbi Hezekiah b.

<i>Q</i>. According to talmudic law, after the death of a person who had children by two wives, the sons of each wife first collect (from the father's estate) the <i>ketubah</i> of their mother; whatever is left of the estate is, then, divided among the heirs. Is this collection of a mother's <i>ketubah</i>, called <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i>, enforced nowadays?<br><i>A</i>. Many <i>Geonim</i> are of the opinion that the <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is not collectible nowadays. But R. Hai Gaon is of the opinion that it is collectible; and I am inclined to decide, in accordance with the opinion of R. Hai, that it is collectible even from movable property, unless a custom exists in a particular community that it is not collectible.<br>This decision is based on R. Meir's Responsum as recorded in Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to Nashim 26; and the opinion expressed in Mord. Ket. 162. But Cr. 116 records the following decision: Since a difference of opinion exists between the <i>Geonim</i>, the burden of proof [to prove according to which authority the law is to be decided] lies on the person who wants to collect money from the other person.<br>Tesh. Maim. <i>ibid</i>. continues: The <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i> is collectible nowadays from both real property and from personal property. As the ordinance of R. Tam, providing that a woman's dowry be returned to her heirs if the woman dies within the first year of marriage, is enforced; surely the ordinance of talmudic scholars, of a similar nature, should be enforced. According to the custom of the communities, the dowry is thus returned to the woman's heirs if she died within two years after her marriage. But R. Meir is of the opinion that the dowry should not be returned to her heirs, but to those who have given it originally. Similarly, R. Meir gave a dowry to his granddaughter Rachel. When she died in the second year of her marriage, R. Meir demanded that the dowry be returned to him although she had other heirs. In some communities only half of the dowry is returned when the woman dies in the second year of her marriage. The ordinance of the communities, which bears the signature of R. David of Merseburg, also has a similar provision.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 116; Pr. 248; Am. II, 64, 65; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 26; Mord. Ket. 162. Cf. Asheri Ket. 4, 24.

<i>Q</i>. May the sons of A's second wife plead that A's first wife, at A's request, has waived her children's right to her <i>ketubah</i>? Thus, while a person may not claim to have repaid a debt before it fell due because the presumption is that people generally do not repay a debt before it falls due, no such presumption exists in regard to waiving a right or an obligation.<br><i>A</i>. The claim that an olbigation has been waived in one's favor is weak and is valid only when the legal presumption of <i>Miggo</i> exists; as in the case where the person could have successfully denied the very existence of the obligation, or could have claimed to have already discharged such obligation. Therefore, the claim in our case is invalid. Moreover, had A's first wife actually waived such obligation in the presence of witnesses, her act would have been invalid since she had no right directly to waive the monetary rights of her children, while retaining her own rights.<br><i>Q</i>. Since the court does not attend to claims against young orphans except when interest is accumulating on their obligations, or when the widow's <i>ketubah</i> is demanded, in which latter case the court attends only because of <i>hinnah</i> (in order to enhance happy marriages); and since in our case (where A's sons by his first wife demand the <i>ketubat benin dichrin</i>) the element of <i>hinnah</i> is absent, must these sons wait (with the collection of their mother's <i>ketubah</i>) until A's youngest sons grow up?<br><i>A</i>. A's sons by his first wife do not have to collect the <i>ketubah</i> of their mother; for it fell to them as an inheritance and is theirs already. All of A's sons are partners in the estate, which must be divided among them to give each of them his due share. Therefore, if A left money, the sons of his first wife may take their share of the money without the supervision of a court since the dividing of money between heirs needs no such supervision. But, if A's estate consists of real property, the sons of his first wife will have to wait until A's youngest sons grow up, as R. Tam is of the opinion that a court should not attend to the division of such an estate unless the young orphans agree to the division.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 65.

<i>Q</i>. Does a woman collect her <i>ketubah</i> from a loan that has been secured by a pledge at the time the loan was contracted? Does a first-born son receive a double share from such a loan?<br><i>A</i>. A woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from all loans, even from loans that are not secured by pledges. Nowadays especially, since a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from movables — and even after the loan is repaid to the orphans she may demand the money thus repaid in payment of her <i>ketubah</i> — she is entitled to collect directly from the debtor. Moreover, the custom of collecting the <i>ketubah</i> from movables and from loans, is well established in our time. Such a custom may be justified by the fact that the major part of our business consists of loans and investments. Similarly a first-born is entitled to a double share from a loan that had been secured by a pledge, since such a loan is not considered <i>raui</i> (a potential asset) but constitutes a real asset of the estate.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 66.

Siman 67

<i>Q</i>. A rented a house to B for five years and received the rent for the entire period in advance. He promised to repay B the expenses for any structures he might erect in the house, and gave him a written guaranty to this effect. B spent six pounds on such structures. Subsequently, A died and his widow, L, took over the house in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.<br><i>A</i>. B must vacate the house; for L's <i>ketubah</i> was a lien upon it, before it was rented to B. L may remove anyone from the house, whether buyer, renter, or creditor; provided, of course, that her marriage to A took place, and A was owner of the house, before he sold it, rented it, or borrowed money. Therefore, if A left no movables and his estate does not exceed L's <i>ketubah</i>, B can not reclaim his money. If, however, A left movables with a third person, these movables ought to be turned over to B in payment of the obligation due him, and any excess should go to L. Whenever a creditor and a widow press their claims to an estate consisting of movables — unless the movables had previously been set aside by the husband for the payment of his wife's <i>ketubah</i> — the creditor has priority over the widow. The creditor's priority, however, as against the widow extends only to the payment of the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and that part of the dowry which the husband wrote in the <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually gave him as dowry — thus in our <i>ketubah</i> we uniformly write that the wife brought in a dowry worth fifty pounds, regardless of the actual value of her dowry, and in our country a woman collects one hundred <i>marks</i> as her dowry, since we interpret the term "pound" to be a pound of weight, consisting of two <i>marks</i>. In regard to whatever the widow actually brought in as dowry she is considered a creditor sharing equally with other creditors in collecting from movables. Although a woman is entitled to collect the entire amount her husband wrote in the dowry clause of her <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually brought in, she does not have equal right with a creditor in collecting that excess. Therefore, since in collecting her actual dowry from movables, L is on an equal footing with B, the movables mentioned above must be equally divided between L and B (and not in proportion to the respective obligations). When an estate consists of movables and immovables, and the latter do not suffice to cover the <i>ketubah</i>, the widow collects the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and the excess dowry, from the immovables, while she takes her part of the movables in payment of her actual dowry. The creditor may not claim that the immovables taken by the widow are in payment of her actual dowry, while she may not collect the rest of the <i>ketubah</i> from the movables until he, the creditor, collects his full debt therefrom, for the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and the additional jointure are liens upon the immovables, while in regard to the actual dowry she is considered a creditor entitled to share with the other creditors in collecting from movables (cf. Ket. 86a).<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 67.

<i>Q</i>. A creditor demanded his money from a critically ill person. The latter admitted the indebtedness and ordered his heirs to repay the debt. Do you follow the decision of R.

No difference of opinion exists between R. Tam and the Geonim in regard to this law. Even the former admits that nowadays, when the ordinance of the Saburaim gives the creditor the right to collect his debt from movables even after the debtor's death, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from movables.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 334; Am II, 68; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A owed one <i>minah</i> to B. He promised that he would repay the money on a specified date, or that his sureties, C and D, would either repay it themselves or would eat two meals a day to be charged to A. A made a binding promise to C and D, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, to compensate them for any losses they might suffer on account of their suretyship; and he gave them a written document to that effect. Before the debt fell due, however, A died leaving orphans and a widow, but not enough property to cover the latter's <i>ketubah</i>. B demands that the sureties either eat at the expense of A's estate, or pay him one <i>minah</i>. Who has priority in collecting from the estate, the creditor or the widow? Is this case similar to the case when interest is accumulating on the obligations of young orphans [in which case the court must attend immediately to the affairs of the estate in order to save the money of the orphans], or is it not similar to this case for the reason that in our case the orphans can receive no part of the estate in any event?<br><i>A</i>. Nowadays that a creditor may collect his debt from the movables of an estate, he has priority over the widow in collecting from movables. The orphans are not considered at all in this case, since they can receive no part of the estate in any event.<br><i>Q</i>. When A married L she had small children. She said to A that she would give him a dowry of thirty <i>marks</i>, and would keep her remaining twenty <i>marks</i> for her children. The twenty <i>marks</i>, however, were not kept separately and they (A and L) did business with the entire sum. Subsequently A died, and L claimed that the greater part of the money he left belonged to her young children. Do we assume that since A did business with the money it belonged to him?<br><i>A</i>. If the money is in L's possession and we have no evidence (but her admission) that she possesses it, L must take an oath in support of her claim. We must be satisfied with this oath since she could have successfully denied possessing the money. But, if the money is not in her possession, or we have evidence that she possesses it, she must produce witnesses in support of her claim.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 69–70.

<i>Q</i>. A wants to emigrate to Palestine, but his wife, L, refuses to accompany him. Is he permitted to divorce her?<br><i>A</i>. The Talmud (Ket. 110b) rules that under the circumstances, the husband is permitted to divorce his wife and is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Although some scholars believe that this talmudic ruling applied only during the period of the Temple, while Israel dwelt on his land, and that it does not apply at present, we must make no such distinction, for the contradiction between the statement of the Babylonian Talmud (ibid.) and that of the Palestinian Talmud (Ket. end), may be reconciled if we assume that the latter refers to the present. Regarding the payment of the <i>ketubah</i>, however, A is not required to pay L the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and the additional jointure, but he is required to pay her whatever she has brought in as her dowry (<i>niksei tson barzel</i>) and whatever is left of her <i>niksei melug</i> (private property of the wife).

<i>Q</i>. Does a father have the authority to restrain his son from emigrating to the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>. Since it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to settle in the Holy Land, a father has no authority to restrain his son from fulfilling this <i>mitzvah;</i> for one must honor the Almighty above one's father.<br><i>Q</i>. Will a person whose wife refuses to accompany him on his emigration to the Holy Land, be liable to punishment for divorcing her?<br><i>A</i>.

Have you heard what were the reasons that prompted the prominent men to order their sons to return from the Holy Land?<br><i>A</i>. It seems to me that the following were the reasons: a) No mercy was shown there; b) they were constantly troubled by the necessity of earning their bread, so that they could not devote their time to study; c) consequently they were lacking in knowledge of the <i>Torah</i>, and they were uncertain regarding the details of ritual law.

<i>Q</i>. Are the women among the group of forced converts from Rockenhausen who escaped from their captors, permitted to resume their marital relations with their husbands?<br><i>A</i>. Nowadays that the Gentiles are all powerful, a Jewish woman who was held captive by them, even though only for the purpose of extortion, is not permitted to live with her husband (Ket. 27b). But, since in this case many Jews were held captive together, they are now able to testify which women were not violated by their captors; such women who can furnish this testimony, even by a single witness and even by a woman witness, are permitted to resume their marital relations with their husbands. The fact that the captives did not give their lives for their religion does not disqualify them as witnesses. Although a Jew is enjoined to choose death rather than be forced to worship idols, should he violate this law he would not become disqualified as a witness though he would be guilty of having committed a sin. Moreover, according to the account given by the captives, they never actually embraced Christianity, but merely listened without comment to the priest's recitation of his senseless ritual in the presence of the Gentiles. Thus, the captives never committed a sin; for a Jew is not enjoined to choose death rather than allow the Christians to deceive themselves into believing that they have converted him.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 80; cf.

Siman 81

We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.<br>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.<br>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: "All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 386; Tesh. Maim. to <i>Nashim</i>, 28; Hayyim Or Zarua, <i>Responsa</i> 147. Cf. <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> Ket. 12, 3; Asheri Ket. 13, 17; <i>Tur Eben Haezer</i> 75.<br>The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:<br>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).<br>Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).<br>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).<br>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that "the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.<br>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. "Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out" (Proverbs 17,14). Signed: Eliezer b. Ephraim. (Am. II, 81).

Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a "boundless" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 194; Am II, 97; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A promised to give two <i>marks</i> for a holy cause should he cohabit with his wife, within the year. He did cohabit with her within that time. If such promise of a gift were made by an individual, even had such money been actually delivered to the donee, it would be considered an <i>asmakhta</i> and would be void. Therefore, this conditional promise for a holy cause should also be void, for, although a mere verbal promise for a holy cause is as valid as an actual delivery (of money and valuables) to a private person, it has no greater validity than such delivery; and any transaction classified as an <i>asmakhta</i> is invalid even if the money and valuables are actually delivered. Although a conditional promise classified as <i>asmakhta</i>, if accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court, is valid, its validity stems from the powers of confiscation inherent in the authoritative court, but not from an act of the promisor.<br><i>A</i>. A must pay two <i>marks</i> to the holy cause. A mere verbal promise to a holy cause is as binding as a similar promise to an individual accompanied by any manner of conveyance that serves to validate such promise. Since a conditional promise classified as <i>asmakhta</i> is valid if accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court, a mere promise of this kind made to charity or to a holy cause is binding, even though the promise was not made before an authoritative court. The validity of a conditional promise made before an authoritative court does not stem from the court's power of confiscation, otherwise no <i>kinyan</i> would have been required. Moreover, the power of confiscation by a Jewish court is invoked only for the furtherance of proper conduct in accordance with Jewish principles (<span>לפגדר מלתא</span>) but not for the sake of validating private transactions.<br>This responsum was addressed to Rabbi Solomon "a prominent scholar from France".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 99; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. It is the custom of judges to consider as valid conditional transactions classified as <i>asmakhta</i>, and even to enforce the collection of the money-fines stipulated in such transactions, when they were accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court. How can the judges enforce the collection of such money when R. Hai Gaon and R. Hananel ruled that these transactions were invalid? Moreover, occasionally the conditional transaction is not concluded before an authoritative court, but the scribe inserts the phrases: "accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>, made before an authoritative court", as a mere formality. Why should the signature of two witnesses to such writ suffice? Why not require the signatures of three persons, those of the prominent men of the community?<br><i>A</i>. The ruling that a conditional transaction accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court is valid, is based on the weighty opinions of R. Zemah Gaon, Rashi, Rashbam, R. Tam, and Ri, while the opinion of R. Hai Gaon is untenable. As to your second objection, if the scribe was instructed by the contracting party (or parties) to draw up the contract, we assume that he was thus instructed to draw up a valid contract in accordance with accepted custom. Since it is customary to insert the phrase cited above in a conditional contract, the scribe was thus instructed to insert it in the contract, and we interpret such instruction as an admission by the defendant that the transaction had taken place before an authoritative court. Were two other witnesses to testify before us that the writ was drawn up by the undersigned witnesses who recorded an ordinary <i>kinyan</i> made in their presence, as a <i>kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court without their (the latter witnesses) having been instructed to draw up a valid contract, the contract would be void. Lacking such testimony we must rely on the signatures of the two witnesses as proof that the transaction was concluded before an authoritative court; the responsibility for any irregularity must rest upon such witnesses.<br>This responsum is addressed to "my teacher and relative Rabbi Asher".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 976; Am II, 107; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. While critically ill, A gave a bill of divorcement to his wife on condition that should he die from this illness, she should be divorced therewith from the day she receives the divorce. After the bill of divorcement was thus delivered to A's wife, it was torn up. Subsequently A's condition improved; he got up from bed, walked to the synagogue and to the market place without a cane, and even arranged his mother's funeral out of town. Twenty-eight days thereafter, however, he fell ill again and died. During these twenty-eight days he was at times lying in bed, and at other times he was upon his feet. Was the bill of divorcement effective?<br><i>A</i>. The bill of divorcement was ineffective. First, according to R. Tam and Ri the stipulated condition mentioned above, is to be interpreted to mean that A intended the divorce to become effective an hour before his death. Since on the day of A's death the bill of divorcement was already torn up, no divorce took place. A similar query was sent to me from Acco (Aachen?) and I ruled that no divorce took place. I always advise women who receive such conditional divorces to guard their bills of divorcement carefully till their husbands die. Secondly, even according to Rashi, who believes that the divorce becomes effective immediately upon the delivery of the bill of divorcement, if the husband subsequently dies from his illness, the fact that A was walking thereafter without the support of a cane nullified the bill of divorcement. In any event the advice of a medical authority would be required in order to decide whether or not A died from his first illness; and nowadays we have no medical authorities on whose expert opinion we can definitely rely in such a vital matter.<br>R. Meir adds: I do not possess the <i>Tosaphot</i> to tractate <i>Gittin</i>, nor the code books from the south (Alfasi and Maimonides).

<i>Q</i>. A owes money to B and B owes the same amount to a Gentile. B told A, in the presence of the Gentile, to pay his debt directly to the Gentile. The Gentile released B and depended upon A for payment. A successfully avoids payment to the Gentile because of an old debt due him from the latter. Since, according to Jewish law, the transaction was not valid and A's indebtedness to B was not legally transferred to the Gentile, A must pay his debt to B. But why should B be permitted to rob the Gentile? Is not robbing a Gentile prohibited? Moreover, the Gentile presses A for payment and eventually may force A to pay him his money; must A pay his debt to B?<br><i>A</i>. Robbing a Gentile is prohibited, but one is permitted to annul a Gentile's debt (if he can do so by using plausible excuses and without causing the name of the Lord to be profaned). But, if A will be forced to pay the debt to the Gentile, he will not have to pay anything to B.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 227; Pr. 327; L. 385; Am II, 119.

<i>Q</i>. A is heavily encumbered by his overlord with taxes and forced loans. He originally came to settle in T because he had made a settlement with the overlord to pay a certain amount of taxes directly to the latter, and not in partnership with the rest of the community. The community, however, demands that A pay his share of the tax on the community.<br><i>A</i>. If A had originally separated himself from the community with the latter's full knowledge and consent, he need not cooperate with the community in the payment of its taxes; but, if he did not obtain the consent of the community, he had no right to make a separate agreement with the overlord since the custom of the community provides that all Jews be partners in the payment of the taxes. A community has a right to force a rebellious minority in its midst, to obey its customs. Furthermore, the overlord had no right to make a separate agreement with A in violation of the custom he himself had established among the Jews of his town. Such an act on the part of the overlord is not considered "law of the land", but rather constitutes downright robbery. Although according to the Talmud a king may change the customary taxation arrangements of his subjects (B. B. 143a), he is permitted to do so only when he is acting of his own accord, but not when he is urged to do so by some of his subjects. A's objection that it will be prohibitive for him to pay taxes both to the overlord and to the community, is not very serious, for he may explain to the overlord that separating oneself from the community in the payment of taxes is prohibited by our laws, that on this account one becomes involved in quarrels with the Jews of the kingdom, and that henceforth he will refuse to pay his taxes independently of the community. In such matters we are permitted to act with severity even when not directly empowered by the Talmud, as long as we conform to the spirit of the Talmud; for, were a Jew permitted to separate himself from his community, great calamities would often ensue.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 222; Am II, 122; Rashba I, 841; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned the Community of Friedberg to court and put forth his claims as follows: Long<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase <span>השבעות לפני התפיסה</span> might mean: <span>ה׳ שבועות לפני התפיסה</span> five weeks before the general arrest</i> before the arrest (of the Jews of Friedberg) the members of the community were called upon to pay the (yearly) tax, and each one declared, under sanction of excommunication, the value of his assets. A told the registrars of the declarations that he possessed seventy <i>marks</i>, thirty-seven of his own, and thirty-three that he owed to Gentiles and that were to be repaid immediately; that all his neighbors knew of his obligation immediately to repay that debt; and that he refused to pay taxes for these thirty-three <i>marks</i>. The registrars told A that it was not worth his while to argue about the matter since the tax was so small, only three pennies per <i>mark</i>. A answered that he feared lest the tax-rate later would be increased; but the registrars assured him of their positive conviction that, with God's help, no increase of the tax-rate would be necessary. A, therefore, agreed to pay the tax on the whole amount. Subsequently the community, including A's wife, was arrested. A, however, was in Frankfort at the time, and he escaped to a place called Hunburg. As soon as he arrived there he was seized by the knights, his creditors, for the purpose of collecting the money due them from him before he became penniless. In order to pay off his creditors, A had to call in his investments immediately and thus had to settle with his debtors for much less than what they owed him. A sent his nephew to the fortress, where the Jews of Friedberg were held in custody, to inform them that he was forced to repay his debts and consequently would be able to contribute toward the ransom of the community only from the money he still had left. The community leaders, however, paid no attention to him, taxed him an amount double the value of his present assets, and delivered his wife into the hands of the king's servants with instructions to detain her and punish her till she pay this amount. A was willing to pay the same tax-rate on the money he now possessed, as the other members of the community had paid, but the amount he had been assessed was well beyond his means. He contended that he should not be expected to pay tax on the money he had owed to others, since he had repaid that money before the amount of the ransom (for the community) was agreed upon. Moreover, Rabbi Meborak, the trustee of the community, admitted to A that the custom of the Friedberg community always was for the members to declare their assets yearly under sanction of excommunication and to pay on the feast of <i>Hanukkah</i>, on the basis of such declaration, only the taxes already demanded by that date; while any unforeseen expenses or taxes demanded during the remainder of the year were paid with money borrowed on account of the next year's taxes.<br>The trustee averred: It is a custom long established in Friedberg, a community where great scholars and <i>parnasim</i> (community leaders) have dwelt, that a person pay taxes on the capital he does business with even though a great part of that capital is not his own. A himself has complied with this custom for many years. Now that we have been arrested, wise and discerning men have advised us to use the declarations made before the arrest as a basis for the apportioning of the ransom demanded from us; for, were we to rely on new declarations, since the tax is so excessively high, a few of our members might (by making false declarations) cunningly evade paying their due share.<br>A rejoined: The custom of paying taxes on capital invested with one by other people, applied only as far as ordinary taxes were concerned. But in the case of ruinous robbery such as the present one, when a person is expected to give away everything he has, how can one give that which is not his! Moreover, your decision, to use the former declaration as a basis for levying this tax, was reached without my consent and in spite of my protests. For the purpose of this tax you have evaluated your immovables and your books at half its actual value; an object evaluated at two <i>marks</i> was later sold for four <i>marks</i>. Who gave you the right to make such evaluation?<br>The trustee averred: Immovables and books are customarily exempt from taxation. But. for the advantage of the community, the wealthy among us have consented to pay taxes on immovables and books. They have decided, with the knowledge and consent of the whole community, to assess books at their actual cost, i.e. the cost of the parchment plus the scribe's wages. If this arrangement is displeasing to A, they are willing to revert to the generally accepted custom of paying no taxes on such valuables.<br>A replied: No custom can apply to the present case of ruinous robbery. Moreover, the rich have brought this calamity upon us by their high houses; why, then, should these houses be exempt? A further claimed that when one member of the community was discovered to have transgressed the ban and to have possessed more capital than what he had originally declared, the community confiscated that excess and distributed it proportionately among the tax-payers; and that one rich tax-payer promised to give his part of that excess to A in order to help him ransom his wife. That part amounted to sixteen <i>marks</i>, and A demanded that sum. The trustee answered that he did not consult the tax-payer referred to, but that he was sure that the latter would either deny having made such a promise, or would say that he had changed his mind.<br>Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel; Yehiel b. Isaak; Joseph b. Nathan.<br>A further claims that the community leaders have foregone part of the tax of some members, which in some cases amounted to as much as one hundred <i>marks</i> and in others to sixty <i>marks</i>, in order that these members might agree to the manner of apportioning the tax, while from A they demand that which he does not possess.

Siman 128

Also, please instruct us regarding the laws governing the taxation of immovables and books; for I remember what you told us regarding the Mishna, Peah, 8, 9, and the <i>Yerushalmi</i> thereto, that you derived from these sources the rule that immovables be assessed at one quarter their value. Books, I believe, should not be taxed at all; if those who study the books are exempt from taxation, the books themselves ought to be similarly exempt. The Torah is termed "freedom" and ought to be free from the yoke of government. Moreover, house utensils are not taxed. Sometimes a person has many sets of such utensils, which are used only on rare occasions, yet he pays no taxes thereon. How much more reason to exempt books that are used daily by a person or by his sons and sons-in-law, or are lent to others for the purpose of study.
<i>A</i>. Why did you inquire of me concerning matters of taxation which are rooted in local custom, each community being governed by its own customs? The Talmud states that a person may withdraw from a partnership without the consent of the other partners when each person is attacked by a band of robbers and thus may suffer a loss of money (B. K. 116b). Therefore, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners in payment of normal taxes only, A had a right to withdraw from the partnership with reference to the exorbitant tax which constituted outright robbery. The rule, "the law of the land prevails", does not apply to extraordinary taxation, the latter being considered outright robbery. Therefore, since A warned the community to include him in their settlement with the authorities only if he was to bear the burden of the ensuing tax in proportion to the money he had left after paying his debts, the leaders of the community had no right to include him in their settlement unless they agreed to his terms. They should have excluded A's wife from their settlement with the authorities. However if such exclusion of A's wife might have led to her being abused and defiled by the uncircumcised — for a report reached us of the Jews of Friedberg having been threatened that unless they speedily come to terms with their captors their wives would be outraged and defiled — the leaders of the community were justified in including her in the general settlement in spite of A's protests. A Jew should be ransomed and delivered out of the hands of Gentiles even against his express will, and should be charged with the expenses incurred. Moreover, if the Jews of Friedberg were accustomed to be partners even in the payment of exorbitant taxes — for the custom in these kingdoms has been for a long time that there were no normal taxes, and every overlord levied taxes to his heart's content — the mere fact that the tax was more exorbitant than the others did not give A the right to withdraw from the partnership. Every tax levied by the overlord must be borne proportionately by all the Jews of the community. Even though A warned the leaders not to include him in the general agreement, except on his terms, his warning was of no avail as long as the leaders did what they thought the right thing. Since in the opinion of the latter it was better to come to terms with the government instead of passively revolting against it, A was bound by the act of these leaders and must contribute his share in proportion to the capital he possessed at the time of the arrest. The fact that he was later forced to repay his debts did not diminish his obligation; for this obligation was not created at the time the agreement was reached with the authorities, but it was created at the time of the arrest, and at that time he still possessed seventy <i>marks</i>. A's complaint that some of the members of the community evaluated their immovables and books at less than their actual value, is irrelevant, for the community members have done him a favor by paying a tax on such valuables. Had they refused to pay such tax, no court would have compelled them to pay it. Already in former generations, many persons had complained bitterly before the courts and had demanded that immovables and books be taxed, especially when exorbitant taxes were demanded by the authorities — taxes that took away nine tenths of one's capital — but the owners of immovables and books were always acquitted in accordance with a long established custom instituted by the "ancients" [early settlers of Germany and France]. Since many good reasons, as well as the interests of public welfare, support the decision that immovables are not taxable, no court can override the decision of the other courts in this matter, unless the people of your community originally unanimously adopted a different ruling, for a community may change an established custom by a unanimous vote only. Regarding the alleged promise of the rich tax-payer to A, I have little to say as long as the promisor keeps silent. In any case, since the promise was not made formally, the promisor has a right to change his mind at any time. However, A's complaint that the community leaders have foregone certain obligations of some members, is a serious complaint since the leaders have no right to forego A's part of such tax obligations without his consent. But if these leaders were originally unanimously elected freely to manage the affairs of the community, and were thus vested with the power to forego obligations to the community whenever they would see fit to do so, they have acted well within their rights.<br>R. Meir adds: It is true that I was inclined to derive from the aforementioned talmudic sources the rule that immovables be assessed at one quarter their value, but the long established custom of not taxing such property prevails even in the face of talmudic law. Your arguments for not taxing books are conclusive.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 127–8. Cf. Mord. B. B. 480; <i>Agudah</i> B.

<i>Q</i>. At the time the tax was collected B did not pay any tax on an apparently bad debt. Shortly thereafter, A helped B to settle with the debtor for part payment of this debt. A, then, said to B that he would not be expected to pay taxes on the original value of the debt. Subsequently some members of the community summoned B to court regarding the tax on the debt, and the court reached a certain decision. A, however, was not satisfied and, as a member of the community, summoned B to court again. The latter claims that A's statement mentioned above proves that A had no case against him. A, on the other hand, contends that B swore to pay a tax on the value of the debt at the time the tax was collected. B denies this claim, while A has no disinterested witnesses to support his contention.<br><i>A</i>. If A was in town when B was first summoned to court, he should have appeared in court at that time to press his claims. Even if A was out of town at the time, if B has complied with the court's decision in the matter, he is under no obligation to A. B is not required to take an oath denying A's claim, since no oath is imposed for the purpose of forcing compliance with an alleged former oath. On the other hand, A's statement to B did not, in itself, absolve B from obligation to A, since a person, sometimes, does not reveal his real arguments and claims to his opponent until they both appear at court.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 167; Am II, 136.

<i>Q</i>. A's house was robbed and he reported this in town. Subsequently, he recognized one of his books in B's possession B had bought the book from C who had bought it from a Gentile. Moreover, A does not usually sell his books. B, therefore, stated under oath the price he paid for the book; but A constantly deferred payment of that amount.<br><i>A</i>. A owes that amount to B. Since the court has a right to distrain a debtor's article for the benefit of the creditor, the court may surely confirm B in the possession of the book after the latter pays to A the difference between its actual value and the price he had originally paid. If B paid C for the book more than the latter paid to the Gentile, C must return the difference to A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II. 138.

<i>Q</i>. C gave a pledge to the community treasurers, the collectors of the tax, as security for his share of that tax. The treasurers, however, later lost that pledge (apparently through no fault of theirs). Must C pay his share of the tax?<br><i>A</i>. Since the overlord keeps the community responsible for the deficiency caused by the loss of C's pledge, the community is collectively held responsible for the entire tax (each individual, therefore, is responsible to the community and not to the overlord). Since C gave the pledge to the representative of the community, and it was lost while in the latter's possession, C is free from obligation. Therefore, the whole community must make up the deficiency. We can not compare this case to that of the man who betrothed a woman with a pledge (Kidd. 8b), and conclude that since the pledge was given as security only and did not constitute actual payment, that C did not as yet discharge his obligation; for the community is not obliged to pay the overlord actual cash, but may pay its tax in valuables as well as in cash. Thus the custom is that when a person gives a pledge to the community treasurer (and then fails to redeem it) the pledge is not sold but is handed over intact to the overlord's messenger, when the latter comes to demand the tax-money, in payment of that person's share of the tax, whether the pledge be worth much more than, or exactly as much as, that share of the tax. Therefore, whether a person pays cash or gives a pledge, makes no difference to the community. The second case you ask about, is exactly similar to the first. As soon as a person hands over his payment to the treasurer of the community, he is free from obligation. However, such payment must actually be made to the treasurer; mere setting aside of valuables as payment for taxes, is not sufficient.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 139.

<i>Q</i>. The community of T, with the consent of (R. Meir's relative) Kohen Zedek, decreed: a) that anyone who moves out of T may not return to it in order to lend additional funds to his debtors, for the purpose of fortifying his investments with them, without the knowledge and consent of the community, the latter having to determine whether or not such debts can be collected without lending additional funds to the debtors; b) that if the debts can be so collected, the non-resident creditor be not permitted to lend additional funds to the his debtors; c) that in case a member of the community will be willing to take over the investments of such creditor, the latter be forced to transfer such investments to the former; and d) that if anyone is found transgressing this decree and lending additional funds to his debtors without the knowledge and consent of the community, he should pay on all of his money that can be found a tax of six Cologne pennies per <i>mark</i>. A was discovered to have transgressed this decree.<br><i>A</i>. If A was a resident of T when the aforesaid ordinance was passed, whether he supported the measure, accepted it tacitly, or openly protested against it, he is bound by it even though he subsequently moved out of T. For a person's protests against an ordinance designed for the public benefit and passed by a majority vote of the worthy members of the community are of no avail. Thus the ordinance of Rabbenu Gershom reads as follows: "If the residents of a city have established an ordinance for the benefit of the community, for the benefit of the poor, or for any other useful purpose, and most of the worthy ones have agreed to it, the others may not void such ordinance and may not demand to take the matter to court, for no court may sit in such a case, because everything depends on the opinion of the prominent men of the city, in accordance with the custom of the ancients, or as an emergency measure."<br>If A, however, moved out of T before the ordinance was passed, he is to be governed only by talmudic law and by customs generally accepted by the communities, while any restrictive measure adopted by the community of T after A moved out is not binding on him. A community may force a dissenting minority and all those who subsequently come to settle in the town, to accept its decrees and ordinances. But a community possesses no authority over a person who moved out of town before the decrees and ordinances were passed, and who does not live there any longer. Therefore, if A had had ample opportunity, since he left T, to force his debtors to replay their debts to him, and failed to do so, he must pay the community taxes on such debts. But if he was unable to collect these debts, the custom is well established in all communities not to tax such debts. Any local ordinance in opposition to such custom is not binding on a non-resident who was a non-resident at the time the ordinance was passed. But, if the community representatives claim that A has had ample opportunity to force collection of his debts, and A denies such claim, the latter must take an oath to bolster his denial.<br>This responsum is addressed to "my relative Kohen Zedek."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 140; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 300a.

You ask too much of me in requesting me to arbitrate in this matter. Heaven be my witness that I would not have taken this case even for a large sum of money. But, since you have adjured me, and have informed me that unless I intervene a serious quarrel would break out, I shall go against my inclination to comply with your wish. Briefly, therefore, if you have been accustomed to be partners in the payment of all kinds of taxes to the overlord, viz: normal taxes, exorbitant taxes, poll taxes, tallages, penalties, and whatever other levies came to his mind, you must assess each member, for the present extortion, in the same manner and according to the same procedure as heretofore. If you have been accustomed either to tax real property, or not to tax it, you must not deviate from whatever was the custom except by unanimous consent. But if up to the present you never paid any but normal taxes, if heretofore your overlord never demanded any extraordinary taxes, but was satisfied with collecting the regular, yearly tax, you must search out and follow the custom of German communities. If the custom throughout Germany, when a community is arrested for the purpose of extortion, is to exempt real property from taxation, you must not tax such property; and if the custom is to assess such property at one half, one third, or one quarter, its actual value, you must follow this custom. This is required by strict law; but, I would prefer that you voluntarily adjust your differences and reach some compromise, if possible. You need not further inquire of me regarding this case, for my answer will invariably be the same: either you reach a compromise, follow your local custom, or, in case no local custom exists, follow the custom of your country.<br>This responsum is addressed to: "My teacher Rabbi Eliakum Kohen Zedek, and R.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that L(eah) delivered him into the hands of Gentiles and caused him a loss of one hundred and five pounds. L denies A's charge. A further claims that he lent L twelve pounds for investment purposes to share equally in the profits. L avers that A lent her ten pounds upon interest [the interest was to be two pounds], that she has repaid five pounds and still owes him five pounds of old coins.<br><i>A</i>. Regarding the first charge, if L will take an oath in support of her claim, she will be free from obligation. Regarding the latter claim, although I have heard in the name of R. Tam that the principle "a person will not let stand what is permitted and eat what is forbidden", as applied to the case where the creditor claims to have lost his <i>prosbol</i> (Git. 37b), is also applicable to a case such as the one mentioned above, some great scholars draw a clear distinction between the case of <i>prosbol</i>, where the debtor does not know whether or not the creditor has had a <i>prosbol</i>, and a claim such as the one mentioned above where the debtor knows the terms of the agreement, and his denial, therefore, of the creditor's claim, ought to carry weight. Moreover, R. Tam's decision probably applies only when the creditor had received a pledge and, thus, was in possession of his money. But, in our case, A seeks to collect. Therefore, L may take an oath to the effect that she owes A only five pounds of old coins, and, after repaying that sum, be free from further obligation.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 167; Am II, 143.

<i>Q</i>. A young man lent money to A stipulating that the latter be responsible for the loss of it through theft, but not through unavoidable accident. The former also tutored A's son. In return for both services A paid the young man's living expenses. Is the lending of the aforesaid money considered a legitimate transaction?<br><i>A</i>. If while the arrangement was made with the young man to rehearse the lessons with A's son in return for receiving his sustenance, the stipulation was made that the young man lend money to A, the transaction is considered usurious, even though A would have been content to pay the young man's living expenses in return for his tutoring alone. The fact that the money was not given as an actual loan, since A was not to be responsible for its loss through unavoidable accident, does not materially change the situation, since the Talmud considers the renting of money a usurious transaction (B. M. 69b). But, if it is true, what you write at the end of your letter, that the young man gave A his money as an outright gift so that he is at liberty, should he so desire, never to return the money to the young man, the transaction is a legitimate one.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 257; Am II, 151; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. A and B jointly loaned money to a third party. The latter's friends went surety to A for the loan, since A was the active partner. Subsequently, A was arrested by his overlord and was forced to relinquish the debt and to release the sureties. B summoned A to court demanding his share of the loan. A claimed that his arrest was due to the loan and that he cancelled it under duress. B claims that A was arrested for other reasons, and that the investment was lost through A's own fault.<br><i>A</i>. If A was arrested because of the aforesaid loan only and was forced simply to cancel the debt and release the sureties, he was free from obligation. Relinquishing another person's debts is a form of tort called <i>garmi</i> (damage done indirectly) for which the damager can not be held responsible if he acted under duress. This cancellation of the debt is similar to the burning of another person's notes of indebtedness, which latter act is considered <i>garmi</i>, for the debt itself is not cancelled by the burning of the notes of indebtedness; in our case similarly the obligations of the debtors and the sureties were not cancelled by A's act, even according to the law of the land, since A acted under duress. Were A able to summon the debtor and the sureties before a magistrate of another town, the latter would have held them responsible for the debt in spite of A's cancellation. Therefore, if A will take an oath to the effect that he was arrested solely for the purpose of being forced to cancel that debt, he will be free from obligation. R. Meir adds: You did not write A's answer to B's charge that when B tried to collect his share of the debt, A told the debtors they should not pay anything to B, since he, A, was the sole creditor and they owed nothing to B. The reason for this was that if B had been able to collect something on that debt, were it not for A's interference, A would be held responsible for B's loss, unless A was also forced thus to interfere.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 223; Am II, 157; Mord.

Since Ri ruled that the opinion of Rabba prevails, that the responsibility of a keeper of a lost object is that of a gratuitous bailee (B.

<i>Q</i>. A and B formed a partnership for the purpose of buying (and selling) silver, and minting coins. Subsequently A admitted C into the partnership. The affairs of the partners became highly complicated giving rise to litigation, each partner pressing various claims and counterclaims against the other. a) B who lent some of the partnership money on interest, and refused to share the profit on this investment with A, claimed that when he formed the partnership he agreed to share the profit arising out of his buying silver and minting coins, but not out of his money-lending transactions, b) A claimed that he had lent forty pounds to B out of the partnership money, and that B did not repay that debt; B averred that he did repay the forty pounds. c) A claimed that B owed fifteen <i>marks</i> to the partnership, and that the profits that flowed in from Enns, from Neustadt, and from the minters, were included in the fifteen <i>marks</i>. B denied this claim of A. d) A had sent a messenger to Enns to collect ten pounds. The messenger had collected the money but subsequently had lost it. B claimed that A was responsible for this loss since he had appointed the messenger without consulting him. A averred that he had consulted B about it. e) Sixty-one <i>marks</i> were found to be missing from the partnership money. B claimed that the money had been lost while in A's possession, and that the latter was responsible for the loss since he had put the partnership money in the custody of his children who were minors.<br><i>A</i>. a) Since B lent money belonging to the partnership on interest, he must share the profit from these investments with the other partners, even though the partnership was originally formed for other purposes than lending money on interest, unless B had expressly stipulated the condition, at the time the partnership was formed, that he would retain all profits he might earn from money lending; for an agent who employs his principal's money in his own business transactions must share his profits with the principal even though he is fully held responsible for all losses. b) and c) Regarding the other claims and counterclaims of the partners, each partner must take an oath to support his claims and be free from obligation to the partnership. d) A is not responsible for the loss caused by his messenger, since he gave nothing to the messenger, but merely spoke to him. But, if A did give money to the messenger, he must take an oath to support his claim (that he consulted B about appointing the messenger) or to the effect that his partners allowed him a free hand in the management of their affairs, and be free from obligation; otherwise he is to be held responsible for appointing an unreliable messenger. e) If B is positive in his claim that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> were lost while the partnership money was in A's possession, A will have to take an oath denying that the money was lost at that time, or be held responsible for that loss; for putting money in the custody of young children is considered wilful neglect; and a partner, being in the category of a gratuitous bailee, is responsible for wilful neglect. A is to be held responsible for the loss of the ten pounds through his messenger and the loss of the sixty-one <i>marks</i>, only if such losses had occurred before B joined A "in his work"; otherwise A can not be held responsible even for wilful neglect, since a bailee is not responsible for losses caused by wilful neglect, if such losses occurred while the owner was with him "in his work."<br>The matter was again sent to R. Meir for his opinion on other problems that arose. f) Regarding the forty pounds lent to B and demanded by A, which B claimed to have repaid, you wrote that both, A and B, were required to take an oath to support their claims. Will A, upon taking such oath, be entitled to collect the forty pounds from B? g) B claimed that A had admitted C into the partnership without his permission. If not for this act of A, he, B, would have earned thirty pounds. A denied B's claim. h) B claimed that towards the end [of their business venture] they had been offered six pounds for the coin [probably the coin-matrix], but that A did not permit him to sell it for that price, while refusing to buy it himself, and thus they lost the six pounds. i) B claimed that C and the "officers" [probably the officers of the mint] owed money to the partnership, but that A refused to collect this money. j) A claimed that the sixty-one <i>marks</i> allegedly missing from the partnership money, really represented the payment he had made to the "treasurers" in order to free his partners from their obligations to them. He demanded, therefore, that B pay his share of this payment. B stating that the "treasurers" depended on him for the repayment of his obligation, denied A's claim and said that A did not go surety for him and was, therefore, not required to pay B's obligation. B further claimed that the above-mentioned money was actually lost because A put it in the custody of his young children. A's youngest child, however, is fifteen years of age.<br><i>A</i>. f) If B takes an oath to the effect that he repaid the forty pounds to A, the partners may hold A responsible for these forty pounds. But if A subsequently takes an oath to the effect that B did not repay the forty pounds, A will be free from obligation to his partners regarding that sum. g) A must take an oath to support his claim. However, if at any time B had shown satisfaction with C's being admitted to the partnership, A's oath is unnecessary. h) Since A did not allow B to sell the coin [matrix] for six pounds hoping to sell it later for more, he can not be held responsible merely because his expectations were not realized. j) Since the money belongs to the partnership, B can sue C and the "officers" directly because of the "lien of R. Nathan" (garnishment). But, if the "officers" are Gentiles and the law of the land does not recognize the validity of the law of garnishment, A must institute proceedings against the "officers." k) I have already written to you that A is not to be held responsible even for losses occasioned by wilful neglect since B was with him "in his work." Moreover, since A's youngest child is fifteen years of age, the putting of money in the custody of his wife and children cannot be considered wilful neglect, since a bailee is expected to deliver his bailment into the hands of his wife and grown up children (B.M. 36a). If the partners, however, have not as yet divided the partnership money among themselves, B may exact an oath from A's children (but not from his wife until she be widowed or divorced) to the effect that they have not misappropriated any of the partnership money. He may exact this oath because of "the lien of R. Nathan." Regarding A's claim to have paid B's obligations to the "treasurers", B is free from obligation for that sum; for a person who repays the debt of another has no claim on the latter. However, if A claims that he went surety to the "treasurers" for B, the latter must take an oath denying this claim of A, or asserting that he owed nothing to the "treasurers."<br>These Responsa were sent to Vienna, the residence of Rabbi Abigdor haKohen.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 12, 15, 16; Pr. 102; ibid. 490; Am II, 162; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. When A demanded of B the return of the money he had given him, B repaid part of it and provided A with a surety for the rest. The fact that B provided A with a surety is attested to by witnesses. Now, however, B claims that this money was originally given to him by A not as a loan but as an outright gift, that consequently he owes nothing to A, and that when he provided A with a surety he acted "inside the line of justice."<br><i>A</i>. The testimony of the witnesses to the effect that B provided A with a surety, is convincing proof that A had given the money to B as a loan. Although a person will sometimes buy what by law belongs to him in order to avoid litigation, this principle applies only when the rightful owner is not in possession of the disputed property, while in our case B was in possession of the money. Moreover, even if there were no such witnesses, we would have put no credence in B's assertion that he provided A with a surety only because he acted "inside the line of justice." For the principle of <i>Miggo</i> — that we ought to believe B's present statement since, were he inclined to lie, he could have denied altogether having provided A with a surety — does not apply to this case, since we are thoroughly convinced that had B not owed the money to A, he would not have repaid part of it.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 166; Am II, 164.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned B, the brother of his wife L, to court. A claimed that his wife, L, who took part in managing his business, had transferred to her brother, B, a debt of four pounds of coins due her from C; that in B's presence L told C to pay his debt to B, and that the latter would be under obligation to repay to her that money as well as half of the profit he (B) would earn therewith; that L released C from obligation to her because B had undertaken to be responsible for the money; that C promised by solemn hand-clasp to repay his debt to B, and that the latter consequently promised L by solemn hand-clasp to repay her the money and half of his profit therefrom; and that L permitted B to retain for himself the chickens he might receive from his Gentile debtors as presents.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Cf. Hagahot Maimuniot</i>, Constantinople edition, to <i>Hilkot Malveh</i>, chap. 9: <span>אם המקבל לוקח עצמו הדורונות שמביאין הנוים כשבאים לפדות את משכנותיהן בהא נראה דסגי בשכר עמלו</span>. Thus Gentile debtors used to bring presents to their creditors, when they came to redeem their pledges.</i><br>B averred that L had stealthily taken the four pounds from A and had lent them to C; that she acted stealthily because she was afraid of her husband; that subsequently she encountered difficulty in collecting the money from C who had no money with which to repay her; that consequently she asked B to collect the money for her; that he, B, obligated himself to pay L the principal plus half the profit he might earn therewith, should he succeed in collecting the money from C; that his obligation to L was not to begin till C repaid his debt; and that C never paid him the money. B further claimed that he had not in C's presence provided L with sureties for the debt nor came to an agreement with her regarding the conditions of the transaction; but that L merely told C to repay his debt to B, without any further qualification; that when he subsequently came to demand the money from C, the latter asked him for an extension of the loan for four weeks; that L advised him to grant C that extension; that in all his dealings with C he consulted L and followed her instructions; that he reminded L repeatedly that his obligation toward her would not begin till C repay his debt, and that she invariably agreed with him.<br>The trustee appointed by L confirmed (in her name) A's claims and denied those of B. The trustee further claimed that L had stipulated in her agreement with B that he invest her money only against pledges, and that B violated this agreement by granting C an extension. Does the granting of permission to the active partner to receive gifts from the prospective Gentile debtors legitimize the aforesaid seemingly usurious transaction (for the plaintiff thinks that such stipulation does legitimatize the transaction) according to which B was to be responsible for the entire principal and was also expected to share the profits with L?<br><i>A</i>. If L released C because B took over C's obligation and told L to release C, B's responsibility was that of a surety who guaranteed a loan at the time it was consumated, and was, therefore, responsible even if his act was not accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. But, if L merely told C to pay his debt to B, the latter is not responsible for the debt, even if he did not expressly stipulate the condition that his responsibility begin only after C had repaid his debt. Although L claims that B promised by solemn hand-clasp to go surety for C, since B denies this claim he is free from obligation and is not required to take an oath. Had B made such promise by solemn hand-clasp, we would compel him to carry out his promise. However, we impose no oath on a person who denies having promised by solemn hand-clasp, when such a person would be under no obligation to the alleged promisee if he truly made no promise by solemn hand-clasp. Therefore, if B take an oath to the effect that L did not release C because of B's promise, or that he, B, had expressly stipulated the condition that he was not to become obligated till C has repaid his debt, he would be free from obligation. B's alleged solemn hand-clasp, however, does not take the place of such oath. Since aside from that hand-clasp, B would have been under obligation to L if her other claims were true, such a hand-clasp does not take the place of a judicial oath administered while holding the Scroll of the Law.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 165; Sinai VII (1943), 5–6, 53; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 361a.

<i>Q</i>. A and his son-in-law B were partners in a house. A leased his half to B for an indefinite period till the latter's death, at a fixed annual rental. Subsequently, A wanted to sell his part, but B objected. The case was brought before R. Meir who sustained B's objection. Now B is seeking to sell his half and also his right to a fixed rental for the other half. A, however, objects to a sale by B of the right to a fixed rental claiming that he had originally leased his half to B for a low rental in order that B and his family live therein and enjoy it themselves, but not for the purpose of selling it to another. Is A's objection valid? Also, please note that A's daughter, B's wife, was dead, but the children she bore to A are living; does the fact that B's wife is dead prejudice B's rights? Moreover, B claims, and witnesses support his claim, that the agreement of lease was reached between A and B after a sharp quarrel which followed their buying of the property. Thus the lease was not a gift of love [in which case the purpose of the gift must be taken into consideration], but was rather the outcome of litigation and compromise and was, therefore, of the nature of a sale. B further states that should A's objection be sustained in court, he would sell his own half of the house and would dwell in the other half, or would rent out the latter half and would use the rent for his sustenance. Please further inform me, on the other side of this sheet, as to what was done in the case of the widow from Spiers and her two Levite levirs. Signed: Asher b. Rabbi Yehiel.<br><i>A</i>. We are not to take into consideration A's purpose in leasing his half of the house to B, for various reasons. a) When B sells his right to a fixed rental to a third party, he benefits from such sale as much as he would have benefited from living in the house himself. b) Since B has lived in the rented half of the house for a long time, the transaction of the lease is by now complete so that A's original purpose in leasing it is no longer of any consequence. c) A transaction of sale, lease, or even gift, is concluded by two parties, being the result of a meeting of both minds and, therefore, such transaction is not conditioned by the special purpose or intent of one party when such purpose or intent was not in the mind of the other party. Therefore, even if B had no surviving children from A's daughter, the validity of the lease would not have been affected. d) According to your letter, the lease was not motivated by feelings of kindliness, but was a purely business transaction.

<i>Q</i>. A, B and C jointly owned a house, A owning a half interest therein and B and C, one quarter each. B died leaving his share to four sons. Now A wants to divide the house among the partners. B's heirs, however, object to such division since each of them would be left with a part too small for use as living quarters. A, however, avers that he wants to take half of the house for his exclusive use, and that if B's sons refuse to subdivide their father's share, they may hold that share jointly.<br><i>A</i>. Since, while B was alive, the house was large enough to be divided among the three partners, and if A had then demanded a division, B's objection thereto would have been of no avail, B's sons may not now restrain A from effecting such a division. They can inherit no rights from B that he himself did not possess. The division of a house among partners should be executed by experts in one of two ways. a) Each partner should receive a part of the house proportional, in size, to his share while the difference between the value of such part and the money value of his share should be adjusted by the payment or receipt of money. b) Each partner should receive an appropriate part of the house inversely proportional, in size, to its intrinsic value, so that the estimated value of such part be exactly equal to the money value of his share.<br>This Responsum was addressed to Rabbi Hillel and Rabbi Menahem of Würzburg.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 234; Am II, 177; Mord.

<i>Q</i>. Jacob bought half an interest in a room from Noah. Subsequently Noah sold his remaining share to A and B; and later Jacob sold his half to C, D, and E. A now seeks to divide this room among the partners.<br><i>A</i>. If the size of the room is ten cubits by ten cubits, A may force the other partners to agree to a partition since he, A, owning one quarter of the room, would receive a "usable unit" upon a partition even according to Ri who sets the minimum for such "usable unit" at six cubits by four cubits. For these measurements, the talmudic cubit of twenty-four thumb-breadths should be used. Even though such partition might leave C, D and E with parts smaller than this minimum, A would still be entitled to effect a partition of the property since before Jacob sold his share to C, D, and E each partner (A, B and Jacob) would have been entitled to a "usable unit." Moreover, A could have forced Jacob to agree to a partition even if he, A, would not have received a "usable unit." The restriction upon partners not to partition a house unless each partner receives a "usable unit", was decreed by the Rabbis for the benefit of those partners who were to receive the smaller parts. Therefore, A would have been entitled to waive this rabbinic decree that had been designed for his personal benefit.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 234: Am II, 178; Mord. B. B. 569; cf. Mord. B.

<i>Q</i>. The burghers built the city tower on the foundation of A's wall. Subsequently the burghers gave B certain rights in that tower, and he erected buildings therein. A, however, claimed that the burghers had wronged him, had misappropriated some of his ground, and that B's buildings were partly standing on his (A's) ground.<br><i>A</i>. As I have already explained in my other letter, the fact that the tower is built on A's foundations shows that the ground also belongs to A. B can not claim undisturbed possession as evidence of title since, deriving his rights from Gentiles, he is in the same category as a Gentile and has no presumptive right of title. B's sons also lack such right, nor do we claim in their favor that perhaps their father bought from A the right to erect his buildings, since they are in the category of "sons of a robber." Since B's sons do not claim that B bought from A in their presence the right to erect his buildings, but merely state that the burghers claimed to have built the tower legally, B's sons must either remove their buildings from the ground in question or come to terms with A.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 236; Am II, 180; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 314c; ibid. p. 366d.

<i>Q</i>. B erected a building alongside of A's windows, thus shutting out the light from his windows. As soon as A learned about it, he protested vigorously. B, however, refuses to remove his building, claiming that A's protests are of no avail since the building had been completed long before A protested.<br><i>A</i>. An abutter is not permitted to build a wall within four cubits of his neighbor's windows without the latter's permission. Therefore, B must remove the aforesaid building, for A protested as soon as he learned about its erection. Moreover, should B produce witnesses to the effect that A failed to protest immediately after he learned of the erection of B's building, it would avail B nothing as long as he does not claim to have bought, or to have received as a gift, the right to erect the building. Undisturbed possession in itself is of no legal consequence, unless it be accompanied by a claim of having once legally acquired the disputed right.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 237; Am II, 181; Tesh.

<i>Q</i>. B's building was contiguous to A's property. The foundation of this building extended two hand-breadths beyond the wall itself. B wanted to build another wall in line with the edge of this foundation, the wall to extend two hand-breadths beyond the existing wall. A protested vigorously claiming that B's property ended at the edge of the wall of the building mentioned above, and that the foundation of such building extended two hand-breadths in his (A's) property.<br><i>A</i>. Since B was in undisturbed possession of the width of the foundation, he was thus in possession of the disputed two hand-breadths of ground along the whole length of the property, and upwards reaching into the sky. Therefore, if B will take an oath to the effect that he did not remove his neighbor's landmark [when the foundation was built], the disputed two hand-breadths of ground will belong to him.

Since B himself built a ledge blocking off the alleged conduit, he has no cause for action against A, and the latter need take no oath.

a) <i>Q</i>. Seven partners jointly own a house and a courtyard. Three eighths thereof belongs to A, one-sixth to B, one-eighth to C, five forty-eighths to D, five forty-eighths to E, one-sixteenth to F, and one-sixteenth to G. A and B demand that the property be divided among the partners. Should the property be so divided, some of the partners would receive parts that are not "usable" [i.e., an area smaller than six cubits by four cubits].<br><i>A</i>. Those partners who are to receive a "usable" part may divide the house and courtyard in such a way that each of them receives his individual part, while the other partners hold the remaining parts jointly. Thus if F and G, are each to receive a part that is not "usable", they may be forced to hold jointly one eighth of the house and courtyard. F may not demand that he be given his part separately, even though such part be not "usable." Such a demand, if heeded, would leave G with a part that is not "usable" thus making the entire division impossible; we may use force in the case of a vicious (lit. Sodom-like) act of this kind.<br>b) <i>Q</i>. Who has charge over the division, the partners or the court?<br><i>A</i>. The evaluation of the various parts is to be made by the court.<br>c) <i>Q</i>.

<i>Q</i>. A sold his ground, which bordered on B's property, to C for a sum of money plus C's share in a piece of ground C held in partnership with D in another part of town. After the sale was completed and the title conveyed, B pressed his rights as an abutter. Since Maimonides rules that the law of preemption does not apply to the case where a person exchanges his immovables for the immovables of another, C was advised to persuade A to refuse to accept from B, in payment of A's ground, anything but the particular piece of ground A was to receive from C. Accordingly A claimed that C's piece of ground was very precious to him and that he valued it like the "estate of Bar Marion" (B.B. 12b). B, therefore, bought from D his share of the particular ground he held in partnership with C, and offered it to A in lieu of C's share of the same ground. C, however, objected to D's sale claiming that upon the voiding of his transaction with A he would return to his former status as D's partner, and, having the right of preemption on D's share, he would buy such share leaving nothing to A. A and C employed many other tricks and artifices in order to void B's right of preemption.<br><i>A</i>. Since C bought A's ground and gave away his own ground in partial payment thereof, he no longer owns the latter ground. Since a person who buys real property desired by an abutter, merely acts as the agent of such abutter (B.B. 108a), C must deliver to B the ground he bought from A, receiving in exchange the ground B bought from D plus a refund of his money. Were B unable to acquire such ground from D, he would have repaid C with money for the ground C gave to A; the value of such ground would have been determined by experts and not by C. C would not have been able to claim that his ground was very precious to him having for him the value of the "estate of Bar Marion", for such claim is valid only when a person is seeking to take away the property of another (in exchange of his own) against the will of the latter who may plead that his property is very precious to him. But in our case C has sold his property to A, and is only entitled to its market price. Moreover, even if the aforementioned sale were not concluded as yet, and an understanding merely existed between A and C that C convey his ground to A on condition that the conveyance of A's ground be without any interference on the part of the abutters, A could not have insisted on exchanging his ground for ground exactly similar to that of C. A could not have attached special importance to C's ground as having the value for him of the "estate of Bar Marion", for the reason already stated. Therefore, B would have been able to pay A with other ground, located in the same town, of equal value as that of C. Many persons have the erroneous notion that the preemptive right of an abutter is void whenever an exchange or real property is involved. Were this true, the parties to a sale of immovables would always add a small piece of ground to the purchasing price in order to place the transaction in the category of exchange of real property, thus turning into a hollow mockery the ordinance of the Rabbis who created the law of preemption for humane reasons. Therefore, whenever we suspect that the circumstances of a sale of real property were specially arranged in order to circumvent the law of preemption, we sustain the preemptive right of the abutter.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 193; Am II, 199, 200.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that certain commentaries to the tractate <i>Yebamot</i> were once lent to B's father, to A's brother, and to himself; that when these commetaries were lost (or stolen) the three borrowers were required to compensate the lender to the extent of one pound; that his brother and he, A, paid two thirds of this compensation; that after B's father died, B found (or recovered) the commentaries; and that in A's presence, B evaluated them at one pound upon delivering them to his creditor. A, therefore, demands from B two thirds of a pound, for his brother and himself. B avers that he has no knowledge of A's having paid anything for the commentaries; that he received them as part of his father's estate; that he was answerable for only half of their value since he shared the estate with his brother; that he kept them for a period of three years without any protest on A's part; and that even if he were forced by the court to pay A for his alleged share in the commentaries, he would pay such share of their present, depreciated, value only. A rejoins that he holds B responsible for the entire sum, since he found the commentaries in B's possession; and that he learned only recently that they were in B's possession. B further claims that in order to retrieve the commentaries he paid (the thief) more than their actual value; and that he gave them to his creditor in A's presence without any protest on A's part. A avers that he has no knowledge of B's having paid anything for the commentaries; that B should not have paid anything for them, since they would have been returned at no cost, and that the reason for his failing to protest against B's delivering them to his creditor, was that he sought to discover at what price B would evaluate them. Signed: Nethanel b. Nahman, Ephraim b. Ephraim.<br><i>A</i>. If A claims that B knows that A and his brother paid two thirds of a pound when the commentaries were lost, B must take an oath denying such knowledge and be free from obligation. But, if A is not positive in his claim, B is not required to take an oath. A general ban should be pronounced against anyone (including B) who knows anything about this matter and does not report it to the court. If, however, B admits A's claim, but claims to have spent money in retrieving the commentaries, he is entitled to a refund of his expenses. If, however, he paid such money to the thief himself, he is entitled to no refund. Thus, one who buys a stolen object from a person known to be a thief is not entitled to a refund of expenses; he who buys an object from a thief knowing definitely it to be a stolen object, is surely not entitled to a refund. A did not lose his rights by failing to protest against B's delivering the commentaries to his creditor; and he is entitled to receive his share of the amount they were evaluated at, when so delivered.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 209.

<i>Q</i>. Rashi, in his interpretation of the talmudic statement of Menahot 6b (s. v. <span>וכי תימא</span>), implies that after Aaron was appointed to the priesthood non-priests were excluded from serving even at high-places. How, then, did Manoah and Samuel personally offer up sacrifices on high-places? Moreover, [Midrash] Shoher Tob states that Samuel was guilty of three transgressions in making his burnt offering: a) he had no right to act as priest, b) he made the offering at the wrong time, and c) he made the offering on a high-place. The last statement thus supports Rashi's opinion.<br><i>A</i>. The aforesaid opinion of Rashi was refuted by the Tosaphot (Manahot 6b, s. v. <span>וכי תימא</span>) who cited as proof the priestly activities of Samuel and Saul, and the explicit talmudic statement in Zebahim 118a. However, although non-priests were permitted to act as priests in offering up sacrifices on high-places, Levites were never permitted to do the work of priests (Erekin, 11b).

The distribution of charity and fine-money is governed either by custom or by agreement on the part of the community (members). However, if no custom exists in your town and the community can come to no agreement, the money should be distributed in proportion to the number of charity recipients belonging to each synagogue; for A and B were ordered by the community to pay to charity, and all the poor of the town have an equal claim to the charity of that town. A distinction is drawn in Jewish law between the poor related to the donor and the poor of the town, between the poor of the donor's town and those of another town.

<i>Q</i>. The community of T engaged A as cantor for a three years' period, but soon retracted, discharging A and hiring B in his place. Now A institutes suit against B.<br><i>Q</i>.

Should the discussion that follows reveal any just claims A may have against the community, I rely on you not to disclose them to A, lest the community accuse me of encouraging claimants and inciting them against the community thus damaging its interests. It seems, however, that if A could have obtained another position, had he not been engaged by the community of T, and now can no longer obtain that, or a similar, position, the community ought to pay A the wages of an "idle laborer" (i. e. the wages a cantor would be willing to accept for abstaining from practicing his profession for a given period). But, if A is able to obtain another position even now, he has no legal claim against the community, though he has cause for reproof. Should the latter position require more effort than the position with the community of T, if there be also an increase in remuneration commensurate with the increase in effort, the community of T would be free from obligation to A; otherwise, the community of T would have to compensate A for the increase in effort.

I have heard that whenever a plaintiff, before formally relinquishing his claims against the defendant, registers his protest before witnesses and declares that the forthcoming relinquishing of his claims will be a mere pretense, the courts throughout these communities consider such relinquishing of claims null and void. They base such a decision on the talmudic statement that a protest registered against a forthcoming divorce or gift is "a mere clarification of the situation" (B. B. 40b), which they interpret to mean that a protest is valid in these two instances even though the person was not coerced into granting the divorce or the gift. This decision, however, is wrong and wicked, and is the greatest outrage practiced since the days of the Judges. Were this principle accepted in our law, life would be unbearable. A husband would grant a divorce to his wife in consideration of a substantial sum of money, and after pocketing the money would disclose that a protest preceded the granting of the divorce. Persons would do favors to others in consideration of gifts received from them and would later discover that protests preceded the deeds of gift. Why did Rabban Gamaliel the Elder (Git. 32a) decree that a divorce be not nullified unless the messenger or wife be notified of its nullification before the bill of divorcement reached the wife … .?<br>The concluding part of this Responsum is missing.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 239.

<i>Q</i>. A donated a plot of ground to the community for the purpose of erecting a synagogue thereon. However, when the members of the community made ready to build the synagogue they were restrained by the "students of Jesus" (probably theological students). The community, therefore, decided to build a Talmudical school instead; whereupon A objected that he did not donate the ground for such purpose.<br><i>A</i>. Since A did not originally stipulate the condition that in case a synagogue is not built on said ground, it shall revert to him, he may no longer withdraw his gift, and the ground belongs to the community who can use it for any purpose it sees fit. The mere designation of an object for a sacred purpose does not sanctify the object, and it may still be used for a secular purpose. Therefore, were A not a resident of that town, the community would be free to use said ground for building the school. But if A is a resident of that town, since a community can not use for one purpose, community property originally designated for another purpose, unless such change be unanimously approved by the members of the community, or approved by a resident, outstanding scholar of the caliber of R. Ashi, the community can not build a school on the ground, since the protest of A does not permit a unanimous approval of the plan. Therefore, the community can do nothing with the ground till either the Christian priests permit them to build a synagogue, or A withdraws his objection.<br>This Responsum is addressed to "My teacher Rabbi Asher."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 240; Mord.

Your reasoning and the fine distinctions you draw are correct, but they apply only to a case where the person who is seeking to sell the house that he has rented to another, is not forced to sell the house by dire necessity. When a person is thus forced to sell his house, we assume that originally when he rented the house to his tenant he did not intend to let it remain rented while he was dying from hunger. Therefore, if the landlord take an oath to the effect that he is forced by dire necessity to sell his house, his tenant will have to vacate the house. If the tenant has paid his rent in advance for a certain period, however, he may not be forced to vacate before the expiration of that term, since renting is a form of buying limited to the period for which the rent is paid. In our case, the tenant may not claim that his landlord is not in desperate need of money since he owns real estate on which his wife's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien, and he could sell to another the right to take title to such real estate in case his wife die before him, for we assume that at the time the landlord rented his house to the tenant he did not intend that the renting should cause him to jeopardize his property in such a manner.<br>This Responsum is addressed "to my teacher Rabbi Asher."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 241; cf.

<i>Q</i>. A has two sons and several daughters, some under six years of age, and some older. These children possess property of their own which they received as gifts. Must A nevertheless provide them with food and sustenance? Your pupil is inclined to think that A is under no obligation to do so, since feeding one's children is considered by the Talmud to be a charitable act (Ket. 50a), and A's children need no charity.<br><i>A</i>. Your reasoning is correct as far as the older children are concerned, but does not apply to those under six years of age, for as the Rabbis decreed that a husband must provide his wife with food and sustenance even if she has property of her own, they also decreed that a father feed his children until they reach the age of six, even though they have property of their own.<br>The query was sent by Rabbi Asher.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 242, 244; cf.

<i>Q</i>. A had no settling-rights in T, but lived there for a number of years by permission successively granted to him by the community for definite periods of time. Now, however, a small number of the members of the community refuse to grant him permission for a further stay in T. Your pupil is inclined to think that A is entitled to stay in T long enough to collect his debts. Thus the Talmud rules that bakers and dyers are entitled to three years' notice because they usually grant extensive credit, a person who lends money to Gentiles on trust surely requires a great deal of time to collect such debts. Meanwhile, A should be permitted to engage in lending money on a limited scale, just enough to provide for his sustenance.<br><i>A</i>. The talmudic law you quote (B.M. 101b) refers only to a landlord who leased his premises to a baker, or a dyer, for an indefinite period. One who leases his premises for a definite period, however, need give no notice, and the tenant must vacate at the expiration of such period. The specification of a definite period, in itself, constitutes sufficient notice. Since A received permission to stay in T for a definite period of time, he must remove from T as soon as such period expires.<br>The query was sent by Rabbi Asher.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 244; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 300c.

<i>Q</i>. A sent his messenger to take wine from his Gentile debtor in payment of his debt. The messenger carried out his order and pulled the wagon of wine for the purpose of taking possession thereof by this act. However when the Gentile brought the wine to town he gave it to his other creditor, B. Now A sues B for that wine.<br><i>A</i>. The law of agency does not apply to a Gentile, nor can he confer a benefit, for the law of conferring a benefit is deduced from the law of agency. Therefore when the Gentile gave the wine to the messenger for A's benefit, his act was not valid. Furthermore, since the messenger strove to take possession of the goods of a debtor for the benefit of one creditor though the debtor owed money to other creditors, his act was invalid (Ket. 84b). Moreover, perhaps Rashi's opinion is accepted that one cannot acquire ownership of a Gentile's property by a <i>kinyan</i> of pulling. Finally, B may not be called "wicked", for interfering with another man's business, since the Gentile owed him money.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 245.

The judges of Worms also inquired of me regarding this matter. Those who have preceded us debated this problem at length.

Makkot ch. 1, hal. 7.<br>This Responsum is addressed to "my teacher Rabbi Asher".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Am II, 246. Cf. Asher, <i>Responsa</i> 3, 13.

<i>Q</i>. A prominent burgher, a violent man, told A and B that he would take over the obligation of a debtor of theirs, since he himself owed money to this debtor. He invited them to his house in order to give them pledges as security for such debt. When they came to his house he placed pieces of cloth before them. A picked out one piece of cloth, twelve cubits in length, and said that he would like to have it for a Sabbath outfit. The Gentile sold it to him for two <i>marks</i> and deducted that sum from the debt. B then told A that he thus owed him one <i>mark</i>; but A objected to this claim saying that he took the cloth only because he wanted to withdraw his money from the Gentile, that he intended to keep the two <i>marks</i> for himself, and to even the score, he advised B also to buy a similar garment from the Gentile. B refused to buy it. The Gentile, then, gave them the rest of the cloth as security and they departed. Subsequently they returned the cloth in exchange for other pledges; they also held the Gentile's pledges for other debts contracted at various times. All in all, however, the pledges were worth much less than the debts and were never redeemed. Four years later the Gentile died and the pledges lapsed. Now, B demands that he be permitted to take two <i>marks</i> out of the pledges, and the remainder be equally divided between the partners; while A demands that the two partners bear the loss in proportion to the money that was due each.<br><i>A</i>. Since the burgher was a violent man, A had a right to collect part of his debt independently of B. A had bought the garment for himself, had taken legal possession thereof from the Gentile, therefore, it belonged exclusively to him. Thus his share in the partnership was diminished by two <i>marks</i>, and he must now bear a smaller share of the loss; for the loss must be borne by each partner in proportion to his investment.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 277, no. 60.

<i>Q</i>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B's property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against "a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?" How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?<br><i>A</i>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it. The Torah was very careful, however, not to jeopardize the rights and opportunities of the sellers.<br>The author claims that the same question was sent to him from Neustadt.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 276–7; Pr. 1011; Berl. p. 284 no. 334; B. p. 292, no. 366.

Q. When B went out of town, the officer of the town stationed guards at his house in order to make sure that neither his wife, his children, nor his valuables would be removed from town. Three days later B's wife came to A and implored him to go surety for her to the officer, and to guaranty that neither she, her children, nor their valuables would be removed from town, until her husband returned and personally gave security to the officer that he would not move out of the overlord's territory. When subsequently B returned to town, A told him of his suretyship. B thanked A and commended him for having kept the guards out of his house. Then the overlord of the town, the king's highest officer, came and heaped accusations on B for having gone to dwell in another town — though this town was also a royal town and, therefore, under his jurisdiction — saying: "I know that you intend to flee from my territory". B, realizing that the officer had falsely accused him before the overlord, asked the dignitaries of two towns to induce the overlord to permit him to move into another town under his jurisdiction. When permission was granted, A's relative informed him that B was planning to move out of the overlord's territory. A protested to B's wife that he would be held responsible by the officer for such a move on B's part. B's wife reminded him that the overlord released B's sureties from obligation, but A pointed out that he had gone surety to the officer, and that the latter did not release him. B's wife, therefore, vowed and obligated herself by solemn hand clasp that in case the officer should inculpate A, and in case B should not compensate him for all ensuing losses, she would herself compensate him, up to twenty pounds, out of her clothes and jewels, without a court action. Subsequently B moved out of town, A was inculpated and incarcerated, and was forced to pay thirty pounds for his release. A, therefore, demands the thirty pounds from B.<br><i>A</i>. A husband must redeem his wife even when the ransom asked is larger than her value (as a slave), and must pay his wife's debts which she contracted, for the purpose of buying her release. A person who goes surety for another must be compensated for all ensuing losses. Consequently, B must compensate A for his losses.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. P. 286, no. 348. Cf. <i>Agudah</i> B.

<i>Q</i>. A butcher removed the lungs from several ritually slaughtered sheep. Later, adhesions were found on one of the lungs. Are we to suspect that the ritual examiner had been at fault and had overlooked these adhesions, or are we to presume that a Gentile had mixed a lung from a <i>trefah</i> sheep with the other lungs?<br><i>A</i>. Whenever a presumption is possible we resort to it, since a ritually slaughtered animal is considered <i>kosher</i> until it is proven to be <i>trefah</i>.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 291, no. 363.

<i>Q</i>. What laws govern those transactions which fall in the category of <i>asmakta</i>?<br><i>A</i>. Such transactions are valid if accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and concluded before an authoritative court. However, some <i>asmakta</i> transactions are valid even when not accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and not concluded before an authoritative court. Thus the Talmud rules that if a person lends money to another against a field, and the debtor says that in case he does not repay the debt within three years title to the field shall have vested in the creditor from now on, the transaction is valid (B.M. 65b, 66b). An earnest deposited in connection with a marriage engagement becomes forfeited upon the breaking of the engagement, even though the original transaction was not made before an authoritative court and was not accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. A mere promise to pay a fine to charity, as when a person promises to give a certain amount to charity in case he plays cards, is also binding. Regarding this law I wrote at length in a Responsum, which you will find in the possession of our friend R. Isaac of Straubing, and is too long to be repeated here. A decision by a court of arbitration is not binding unless the acceptance of the judges by the litigants was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i>. Search further in the sources and you will learn the details of these laws.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 291, no. 364.

<i>Q</i>. A negotiated to buy from a Gentile a house which bordered on B's property. After A agreed with the Gentile on the terms of the sale, he withdrew his offer so that the Gentile should lower his price. He warned B not to negotiate with the Gentile since he, A, was still negotiating with him. B, however, disregarded A's warning and bought the house from the Gentile. In defense B claims that he had sought to purchase the house from the Gentile before A began his negotiations. Should B be punished for his act as violating the talmudic injunction against "a poor man turning a cake, and another coming and taking it (Kidd. 59a)?" How long should one refrain from offering to purchase an article which another Jew is seeking to buy?<br><i>A</i>. R. Jacob Tam applies the aforesaid talmudic injunction only to mercantile pursuits but not to cases where a person is about to pick up a lost or ownerless object and another snatches it away. For finding a lost object is a rare opportunity and the second person is just as much entitled to the ownerless object as the first person. Buying abutting property from a Gentile is also a rare opportunity and is in the same category as picking up lost objects. Therefore, B is free from any obligation to A. A Jew should not approach a seller where another Jew had already agreed with the seller for the sale of the article, and where the writing of the contract and the scrutiny and transfer of the deed in the Gentile courts are the only things lacking in order to complete the sale. But, the mere offer of a Jew to buy something without the seller's acceptance of the offer, does not restrain another Jew from buying it. If such were the case, it would be very unfair to the seller who would be forced to sell his possessions to the very first bidder, no matter how low the offer, since no other purchasers would dare to buy it. The Torah was very careful, however, not to jeopardize the rights and opportunities of the sellers.<br>The author claims that the same question was sent to him from Neustadt.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 276–7; Pr. 1011; Berl. p. 284 no. 334; B. p. 292, no. 366.

<i>Q</i>. A summoned B to court contesting his settling-rights in T. The court upheld B's rights. The other inhabitants of T now want to summon B to court again, on the ground that they have additional claims and arguments that would bolster their case against B. It is my opinion that they have forfeited their right to a retrial since they were in T during the first trial and failed to present their claims and arguments at the time.<br><i>A</i>. Your opinion is correct. The inhabitants of T should have brought forth their claims and arguments at the original trial. For the same reason, a person summoned to court by a single inhabitant must not fail to answer the summons, on the ground that he wants to answer the claims of all the inhabitants at a single trial and does not wish to appear in court repeatedly with each individual inhabitant, since all claims against him should be brought forth during his trial when summoned by the single inhabitant or be permanently dismissed.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 216; B. p. 292, no. 367.

<i>Q</i>. A claims to have pawned with B, for thirty schillings, objects worth ten pounds. He is now willing to repay the thirty schillings and demands that B return the pawned objects. B, on the other hand, claims to have followed A's instructions and to have pawned the objects with the <i>Cahorsin</i>. To A's charge that the objects are still in B's possession, B retorts that he subsequently bought them from the <i>Cahorsin</i>. A also claims that B gave false testimony against him and caused him a loss of eleven pounds. B denies this charge. A further claims that he has provided B's Pentateuch with punctuation marks, that he was not paid for his labor, and that he can prove through witnesses that B owes him three pounds. B, however, claims to have already paid his obligations to A.<br><i>A</i>. Regarding B's claim that he had paid his obligations to A, if he will take an oath to this effect, he will be free from obligation to A. Regarding A's first claim, however, the following distinction must be made: If B admits that A had originally pawned the objects with him for thirty schillings, even though subsequently thereto A told him to pawn them with the Gentile, he must return the objects to A upon the receipt of thirty schillings; but, if both A and B admit that originally A merely sent B to pawn the objects with the Gentile, B must state under oath the amount he paid to the Gentile for the return of the objects, and must return them to A upon the receipt of such amount.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 292, no. 370.

<i>Q</i>. After A's death, his widow and her mother revealed that A had left a Scroll of the Law and his large, good prayer-book to charity. They suggested that the community should choose one of them on the following terms: if they choose the Scroll they must undertake to memorialize A's soul together with the souls of the other departed; but if they choose the prayer-book they must undertake to use it constantly for ten years [that the <i>Hazzan</i> use it in conducting the prayers of the congregation]. The community chose the prayer-book. But, the widow and her mother, then, asserted that they had agreed to deliver the prayer-book on condition that it be used for ten years to the exclusion of all other prayer-books. At court the representative of the community stated that the community would be ready to accept the prayer-book on the original terms, while the widow's representative denied ever having offered the prayer-book to the community. The community representative retorted that such offer was made in the presence of many witnesses. Accordingly a solemn ban was pronounced against anyone who had heard the widow make the offer and would not appear at court to offer testimony. Some members of the community, then, testified that the widow offered the prayer-book to the community on condition that it be used for ten years. Others testified that they heard the widow's mother make such offer but did not hear it from the widow herself. Some testified that they heard the widow's mother stipulate the term "exclusively", while others heard no exclusive stipulation.<br><i>A</i>. Since the prayer-book has allegedly been offered to the community, the members of the community, as interested parties, are considered disqualified witnesses. Therefore, in the absence of qualified witnesses, if the widow will take an oath to the effect that she had never offered the prayer-book, to the community, she will be free from obligation.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 293 no. 371.

<i>Q</i>. A claims that B had promised to pay him half a <i>mark</i> for accompanying him on his ride to a certain place. He rode with B to that place, and now demands his pay. B avers that the offer had been made in jest.<br><i>A</i>. Since A acted upon B's offer, the latter cannot, now, dismiss such offer as a mere jest. However, A is not entitled to receive the full amount offered, if such amount exceeds the actual value of his services by more than one-sixth. If such is the case, A is entitled to the actual value of his services only.<br>This Responsum is addressed to "my relative R. Kalonymus."<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 294 no. 372.

"They that swear by the sin of Samaria" and mainly rely on Christian oaths in the conduct of their business are guilty of a misconduct. I have often protested most vigorously against it, but they would not heed me. I have often repeated that on account of such practices family fortunes have been ruined and investments lost, but I have been unable to abate these practices; for those who indulge in them state that they rely on great authority, on R. Tam, who permitted such practices on the ground that the Gentiles of today were not idolators. Nowadays the Gentiles swear by their sacred objects but do not consider the objects themselves to be deities. Though they appeal to Heaven and mean Jesus, they do not expressly mention his name. [Regarding the prohibition involved, see Sanh. 43b]. Moreover, since these Jews do not heed outright prohibitions, how can one expect them to abstain from practices that some authorities permit? However, the person who reported to you that I sanction such practices, did not speak the truth; for whenever a difference of opinion exists between our great authorities I follow the strict opinion, except when the lenient ruling has been widely accepted as an ancient custom.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 294 no. 386; <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i> p. 113a.

<i>Q</i>. Many candles are usually lit in the synagogue on the morning of a holiday. Some persons want to forbid such a practice on the ground that the light of a candle is useless in the daytime, and one is not permitted on a holiday to light a candle the light of which serves no use.<br><i>A</i>. The light of many candles in the synagogue, whether in daytime or at night, enhances the spirit of festivity and rejoicing. Were it not for this reason, the practice of lighting many candles in the synagogue for Friday evening services, when a holiday falls on Friday, would be forbidden, since services are usually over before dark and the candles are not needed for their light; and the lighting of many candles on a holiday night would be forbidden, since a single candle dispels darkness. The practice referred to is, therefore, perfectly in order.<br>R. Meir added: Please forgive me for not having answered your questions. I was very busy and forgot to answer. I even lost your letter. I could find no one who travelled regularly to your parts, and I did not often inquire from travelers about persons who might travel to your locality.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 125; P. 125; Am.

<i>Q</i>. Thieves broke into A's cellar and inserted a tap into a cask of wine. Subsequently it was discovered that a great deal of wine was missing from the cask. Rabbi Jedidyah, however, permitted the use of the wine that was left in the cask.<br><i>A</i>. Though the majority of thieves are Gentiles, and the talmudic dictum regarding Pumbeditha (A.Z. 70a) does not apply to other places, the use of this wine is permitted nevertheless, for there is no evidence that thieves broke into the cellar. Thus the cellar was found locked, while thieves do not trouble themselves to lock a door after their work is done. Therefore we assume that a member of the household inserted the tap, a common enough occurrence. Each member of the household, though he knows that he himself did not tamper with the cask, is nevertheless permitted to drink the wine, for he may assume that one of the other members of the household inserted the tap.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: B. p. 295, no. 389. Cf. Asher, <i>Responsa</i> 19, 1.
<i>Q</i>. Thieves entered a place where many casks of wine were stored. Some of the casks were provided with faucets, while others were entirely sealed. The thieves inserted a faucet in one of the sealed casks and drew part of its wine. I believe that the wine in the casks which have faucets should be considered "forbidden wine" since we suspect that the thieves drew wine from these casks also.<br><i>A</i>. We must not be too strict in our ruling when it is uncertain whether wine has been dedicated to an idol. Since there is no indication that the casks which had faucets were tampered with by the thieves, we do not assume that the thieves drew wine from them. Faucets are usually inserted in casks which contain ordinary wine, while sealed casks are used for wine of superior quality. The thieves preferred to insert a faucet in a sealed cask probably in order to draw the superior wine rather than obtain inferior wine from the open casks. Moreover, they did not draw out all the wine even from the sealed cask. There is no reason to suspect, therefore, that they also drew wine from the open casks.<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: <i>Mordecai Hagadol</i>, p. 119b; cf. B. p. 295, no. 389.

<i>Q</i>. A Gentile woman poured wine without touching it into a bottle or glass, thinking it was whiskey.<br><i>A</i>. Since she did not touch the wine and did not know that it was wine, we assume that she did not discover its true nature by its odor.

<i>Q</i>. The community of T engaged A as cantor for a three years' period, but soon retracted, discharging A and hiring B in his place. Now A institutes suit against B.<br><i>Q</i>. A has no legal claim against B though he does have a claim against the community. Not having been asked regarding A's case against the community, I shall refrain from passing judgment thereon. Should the discussion that follows reveal any just claims A may have against the community, I rely on you not to disclose them to A, lest the community accuse me of encouraging claimants and inciting them against the community thus damaging its interests. It seems, however, that if A could have obtained another position, had he not been engaged by the community of T, and now can no longer obtain that, or a similar, position, the community ought to pay A the wages of an "idle laborer" (i. e. the wages a cantor would be willing to accept for abstaining from practicing his profession for a given period). But, if A is able to obtain another position even now, he has no legal claim against the community, though he has cause for reproof. Should the latter position require more effort than the position with the community of T, if there be also an increase in remuneration commensurate with the increase in effort, the community of T would be free from obligation to A; otherwise, the community of T would have to compensate A for the increase in effort. In any event, A has no legal claim against B, though he has cause for reproof, and the latter may perhaps be called "wicked".<br>S<small>OURCES</small>: Cr. 292; Am II, 234; B. p. 298 no. 392.
