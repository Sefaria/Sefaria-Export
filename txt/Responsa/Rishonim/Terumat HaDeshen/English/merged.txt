Siman 1

Question: In most communities it is practiced in the long days of summer to read the evening Shema, and to pray the evening prayer, 3 or 4 hours before the stars come out. Is there a way to reconcile this practice, or a reason for this practice, since many scholars practice this along with the masses?
Answer: It is not in our hands to settle this problem, or to find a reason for this tradition to say Maariv so much earlier, 3 or 4 hours. For Rabbenu Tam wrote that from Plag HaMincha and onwards is considered night, according to R' Yehuda, and from that point onward the obligation of Shema and Maariv can be fulfilled. And it is written by the Mordechai, and in the Hagahot Maimuniyot, and the Ravyah wrote that the words of Rabbenu Tam are primary [i.e. the law follows him in this case], and he who is stringent and takes it upon himself to wait until the stars come out as is said by the other great ones, it is seen is arrogance and he is called a mere layman if he is isn't consistently more stringent upon himself. Anyhow, this time [Plag HaMincha] is merely an hour and a quarter before the stars come out; but what is the source to pray Maariv so much earlier? And when I was young I saw in Tosafot on the first chapter of Berachot that there are those who wish to say that in the days of summer, when the days are long, we calculate the hours of the night as small hours, and the hours of the day as long hours, so that there will always be twelve hours of night and twelve hours of day. This was also written to me in a responsum from a great sage, who also responded that daylight should always be split into twelve, even in the long summer days, in order to calculate Plag Hamincha.  And in the Tosafot in chapter Keitzad Meabrin, they go into detail on the calculation of hours for the purpose of calculating the equinoxes and solstices, whether on long or short days.And according to this calculation, it would have been possible to resolve the issue of bringing forward the prayers more than one-and-a-quarter hours, according to the length of the day. For instance, in the middle of the summer when in some countries the day lasts eighteen hours, from dawn until nightfall, each ‘hour’ is extended by a third. If so, an hour and a quarter in the first system becomes a one and seven-eighths of an hour. However, we haven’t even managed to legitimise two hours, let alone three or four! Therefore, it seems that there is no way to resolve this according to the rules and the logic of the Talmud. Rather, it is possible to say that the custom became widespread through the loss of strength which descended to the world. And a lot of people desire to eat while the day is still long. And if they ate before the Mincha they would linger at their food and drink and they would not come at all to the synagogue. And for this reason a few sages forbade even a small meal shortly before the big Mincha (12:30). If so, it was not permitted at all to eat always before the Mincha, and therefore the Sages didn’t have strength to stop the majority of the people from praying the evening prayer and saying the Shema while the day was still light. And in this manner we found even in the first generations in the days of Rav Hai Gaon, as it is written in Ashiri, at the beginning of tractate Berakhot,  and in the days of Riv’a, as it is written in the Commentaries of Rambam on the laws of prayer that there was a community that prayed and recited the evening Shema at the time where it appeared to the Geonim that it was not the correct time for prayer and the Shema recitation. Even they did not stop the people from praying early! I’ve also heard in the yeshivah from the mouth of one of the big sages, that he heard and had a tradition, that in earlier times, in the city of Krems (Austria), they would pray Arvit and read the Shma on Erev Shabbat when the day was still so big (very early) that the Rabbi of the city, who was one of the Sages of the past, together with all the important people of that community would go for a walk on the Danube river after eating the Shabbat meal, and afterwards they would return to their houses before nightfall. It is also found according to one great scholar, who taught to pray Arvit and read the Shema during the long day (in daylight) for the need of a marriage banquet. From all these examples learn that the in the old days it was easy to be lenient in this matter,  especially since: 1) When the Tosafot at the beginning of Berachot wrote that we do 2 leniencies that contradict each other concerning the Amidah. This is not the case anywhere else. 2) Concerning the reading of the Shema also according to Rashi, we are fulfilling the obligation of the Shema on our bed. And it seems that if a talmid chacham found him/herself in a public that would pray early and read shma earlier during summer, if s/he is not able to separate them s/he doesn’t need to separate themself from them. Rather s/he prays with them and reads with them and fulfill their obligation. But if he used to separate himself, he should pray at the time the Sages decreed according to all opinions. This is what it seems in my humble opinion. 

Siman 2

Question: If at the same time one is reading the Shema the Shaliach Tzibbur begins Modim, whether he(the one saying shema) is in the middle of a section(of the three paragraphs of Shema) or in the middle of a blessing(that comes before or after the Shema), can he answer Modim(derabanan) with the congregation, or should he bow down without answering and not interupt the Shema and its blessings? 
Answer: It seems that there is proof that one can interrupt(the Shema) and answer Modim(with the congregation. It says in Perek Mi Shemeto(Berachot 21b)- Rav Huna says one who enters a synagogue and finds the congragation praying(the Shemoneh Esrei), if he is able to finish his tefillah(of shemoneh esrei) before the Shaliach Tzibbur reaches Modim, he should pray his tefillah, but if not he should not pray. From here we see that the Talmud insists very much that one should delay his tefillah in order to answer Modim and doesn't say that he should pray and bow without answering in the middle of the blessing(of his own shemoneh esrei), in line with what Tosafot and the Rosh(Berachot 3:18) say, that Rabbenu Tam would regularly do this when the Shaliach Tzibbur reached Modim. Tosafot and the Rosh conclude that one shouldn't begin to pray and rely on bowing without answering, as is clear from the gemara mentioned above. From this we see that answering Modim is like a דבר שבקדושה and is like answering Amen to the berachot of האל הקדוש and שומע תפילה, who the Semak(Siman 104) says we answer to in any place of the Shema and its blessings.

Siman 5

Question: Townspeople or officers summoned him, or he went to them on his own, due to a debt he owes non-Jews. They discussed matters of dispute and compromise at length, and he could not excuse himself from them without losing the debt. He had to drink with them, until the time for praying Minha elapsed. In such a case, may he pray Ma’ariv twice or not?
Answer: It seems to me that he may indeed pray Ma’ariv twice, even though the great ones have written: “If one purposefully did not pray one of the prayers in its proper time, there is no make-up prayer (tashlumin), for something that is crooked cannot be fixed.”  It seems to me that the present case would not be considered purposeful (mezid), and is similar to one who is compelled. This is inferred from the beginning of the chapter “Elu Megalhin” (Mo’ed Katan 14a): “What is the law if he lost something? Do we say that since he must seek it out, he is considered compelled (oneis)?” We see from here that whenever one neglects a mitzva to prevent loss of money is considered compelled. It further states in the first chapter of Berakhot: “Beware of a Torah scholar who forgot his learning because he was compelled.” Rashi explains: “He was ill or preoccupied with working because foot is scarce.” Mordechai, in the first chapter of Shabbat, in the name of Rabbeinu Tam regarding the passage that forbids setting sail [before Shabbat], distinguishes someone who is traveling for the sake of a mitzva from one who is traveling a voluntary matter (devar reshut). A voluntary matter refers to one who is traveling for pleasure; if one is traveling for commerce, to earn a living, it is considered traveling for a mitzva. All of this implies that, in the present case, he is not considered to be acting purposefully, even though we can make a distinction: with regard to prayer, which is worship of the Creator, he should not be worried about the loss of his money. It is even said about Torah scholars that they keep the times of study and the times of prayer separate, and it is stated in Avot (2:1): “Calculate the reward of a mitzva against its costs.” So granted, he did not act appropriately; nevertheless, this is not called “purposeful.” It is akin to one who erred or was unwitting about his prayer, who indeed may make it up. It is further stated in the chapter “Tefilat Ha-shahar”: “Shmuel’s father and Levi were walking on the road. They arose early and prayed.” Rashi explains: “They prayed before dawn.” At first glance, it is implied that they were traveling voluntarily, for their own needs, yet they would pray, even ab initio, outside the prescribed time. Even according to Tosafot ad loc., which explains that they prayed after dawn but before sunrise, the primary time for prayers is only after sunrise, and nevertheless they forsook the primary time for prayer for the sake of their business dealings, even ab initio. Thus, we may say that ex post facto one is not called a sinner and purposeful if he misses the entire interval to avoid losing money. Rosh wrote ad loc.: “Rabbeinu Hananel ruled in accordance with Shmuel’s father and Levi.” Even though Halakhot Gedolot ruled against this, that may have been for a different reason, namely, that [the blessing of] redemption should immediately precede prayer (mismakh ge’ula le-tefila). Moreover, Rosh wrote that R. Hananel’s position stands to reason.

Question #61: Regarding what many people are used to doing, even the most stringent of them, when they meet on Shabbat after leaving shul and tell each other rumors regarding the kings and the princes and the extent of the wars etc., etc. - Is there a reason for concern regarding a prohibition or not? 
Answer: It seems to be the case that we have to be precise in this matter. The Tosafot and also the Ashiri wrote in their commentaries on chapter “these links'' (Shabbat 113b) that it is forbidden to multiply vain conversations on Shabbat, as it is proven by the story of Rashbi’s mother, as it appears in Vayikra Rabba, in which it says that Rashbi had an old mother, who was very talkative. He said to her “Mom, it is Shabbat now!” She therefore became silent. This teaches us that you should not engage so much in talking on Shabbat as on Hol. And in the Talmud Yerushalmi, we say: “they hardly allowed people to greet others on Shabbat”. With this, it is clearly forbidden to engage in too much talking on Shabbat as if it was Hol, even more so (it is forbidden on Shabbat) to speak more than on weekdays. However, if these same people enjoy themselves through talking and telling stories from the kings and princes and their wars and so on, like the way a lot of people like to do, it seems it is certainly allowed. So is it written in the Sefer Mitzvot Katan, that young people who enjoy running and jumping, they are permitted to do so, as well as anything they might enjoy watching. And we have seen that even though the sages interpreted the verse (Isaiah 58:13): וְכִבַּדְתּוֹ מֵעֲשֹׂת דְּרָכֶיךָ - honor it and not go your ways  - do not walk the same way on Shabbat as you do during weekdays (meaning: not run and not jump). Even still, one may enjoy and satisfy one's spirit. The same law applies regarding superfluous speech. This too was derived from the same verse "nor look at your affairs nor speak words", as the Tosafot and the Ashiri explained above.  However,  I have seen many times that some of those people that meet to talk about these rumours do not enjoy themselves so much from these rumours, and they do this for the sake of their friends gathered with them (peer pressure) , in this case it seems it would be forbidden for those who do not enjoy it.

<b>Question 92</b> He who has a very narrow Sukkah to sleep in, such that he cannot sleep with his body and legs outstretched, is he considered <i>mitzta'er</i> (=suffering) in such circumstances or not?
<b>Answer:</b> It would seem, that he is not exempt from sleeping in the Sukkah through this [case which might be] <i>mitzta'er</i>. And it seems to me, to bring a proof, from that rule that the size of a Sukkah is at least 7 handbreadths, and the size of the body of a regular person is 3 cubits, which are 18 handbreadths, as is found in the Chapter [of Eruvin] 'Mi Shehotzi'uhu'. And in the Chapter 'HaMatznia' (Tosafot on Shabbat 92a.44.1) about he who carries a load above 10 [handbreadths] Tosafot proved that the body of a man without his head is 18 handbreadths, and such also seems apparent there from Rashi's commentary. And if so, even when you look at the diagonal of 7 by 7 [handbreadths, the minimum size of a Sukkah], that is 9.8 handbreadths, and we require, whether for eating or sleeping, that the head of a person and most of his body be in the Sukkah, and his head and most of his body is more than 10 handbreadths, according to the calculation above. And how could the Sages give a minimum size for a Sukkah which someone cannot sleep in with his head and most of his body within the Sukkah? And even though it may be fit to eat in, Rabbi Eliezer of Metz wrote, brought in the Mordekhai (Sukkah 740), that a Sukkah which is not fit to sleep in, even if it is fit to eat and drink in, one does not fulfill his obligation with it at all, rather it must be that it is normal once in a while to sleep curled up, and it is not considered <i>mitzta'er</i>.

Question: In many places, individuals and even Torah scholars conduct the bulk of their Purim meal ‎at night, going to shul and davening minchah but not maariv, then returning home and beginning ‎their meal by day and continuing into the night, such that most of the meal is at night. Is there logic ‎behind this custom, or not?‎
Answer: It appears to me that one should find some reason and support for this custom. I have ‎found a responsum which says, "I have heard from R' Toviah in the name of Riva that when youths ‎take food from each other, even without permission, for the joy of Purim, from the time the ‎megilah is read until the night of the Purim feast - two nights and one day - there is no issue of ‎surreptitious or overt theft. They should not be summoned to court and there is no concern, so ‎long as they do not overstep the practices established by the town councillors." It is clear that the ‎second night is legitimately part of the Purim feast. The question remains for Riva himself, fort he ‎second night is the 15th of Adar, and how could one fulfill the meal of the 14th on the 15th?... ‎Apparently, the reason is that the reading of the megilah on the morning of the 14th takes time, ‎and then one is busy sending portions and giving gifts to the indigent, and there is no time to eat a ‎meal with joy and pleasure. Therefore, our predecessors established part of the meal in the ‎evening, starting it during the day before maariv so as to fulfill the mitzvah of the feast during the ‎day, which is the essential time. One then continues during the time he has available, enjoying the ‎meal until night and at night, and the whole is one meal. We have found a similar practice of ‎nullifying a mitzvah meal for the sake of other mitzvot in Tosafot Chullin 83a, which asks why the ‎mishnah there did not include a meal for the first day of Succot among the four occasions when ‎people regularly eat large meals. He explained that it is because people are busy with the mitzvot ‎of Succah and Lulav on the day before Yom Tov, and so they did not prepare big meals for the first ‎day of Succot.Although I have justified this custom, still, my mentors customarily eat the essential ‎meal in the morning, as do I, and it appears that this is the practice in the Rhineland.‎

Siman 111

<b>Question 111:</b> Do people who send robes, sheets, and the like to their friends on Purim fulfill the commandment of sending portions (<i>mishloach manot</i>) or not?
<b>Answer:</b> It appears that we do not fulfill [the commandment] with them. For it appears that the reason for sending portions is so that each one will have enough and what is sufficient to have the meal as required, as is understood from the Gemara in the first chapter (Megillah 7b:6). As Abbaye bar Avin and Rabbi Chanina bar Avin would exchange their meals with each other, and fulfill sending portions with this. Hence the reason is on account of the meal. Moreover it appears that we do not find anywhere that anything besides food items or drinks are called portions. And the Rambam (Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 2:15) was accordingly precise with his language. As he wrote, "One is obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of cooked food or two [other] types of food; and it appears that drinking is included in eating." But with gifts to the poor (<i>matanot le'evionim</i>), he wrote (2:16), "money or types of food." Hence concerning the sending of portions, he reasoned that it is only edible items.

Question: Leah and Rachel are fighting over women’s seats in the synagogue, and Leah brings two women [to demonstrate] that the seats are hers, and Rachel brings one man to testify that the seats are hers, which testimony is better, two women or one man?
Answer: It seems that the law of presumption of possession of seats relies on something I will proceed to explain, which is if Leah has a presumption of possession to these seats, and Rachel seeks to remove it from [Leah’s] possession, Leah doesn’t even need to swear to refute Rachel’s witness. And even though most geonim decided that we make one swear an oath on a d’rabbanan level even regarding land, here [is different], since Leah has two women who can testify according to her, she is exempt [from such an oath]. And even though normally a woman’s testimony has no substance [in court], in this such case they are normally more discriminating than men, so we can believe them more. And similarly I found a passage from halachic decisions of a certain great rabbi that the reliability of women to testify regarding a widow, that these are the clothes she wore during the life of the husband, because men don’t normally look at women’s clothing, and he brought a proof from the Talmudic statement that three are believed regarding a first-born, [and one of them is] a midwife. What emerges is that regarding matters that men would not normally know, we believe women, even to extract money [from someone], as the case there regarding the widow’s clothing [which is extracted from the inheritor’s estate]. And it seems that women’s seats in the synagogue are not something that men would normally know, as to which seat is for this woman and which for this one. And it seems that we can bring a proof about it that we would believe women in such cases,  from that which we said in the first chapter of Bava Kama (15a), “The last clause is necessary to teach us freemen, to exclude slaves. It states ‘people of the covenant’ - to exclude gentiles, who are invalid for testimony regarding damages.” And it also states there “And it is necessary, for if we taught slaves, because they have no mercy, and if we taught gentiles, because they are not relevant to mitzvot. And the Rambam in his Sefer Nezikin, (Nizkei Mamon 8:13), states: “Damages should not be collected... without clear testimony. One does not say that since we are not with shepherds, servants, and the like are found in the stables of horses, the stalls of cattle and the corrals of sheep, their testimony should be accepted if they testify that one animal damaged another. Similarly, if minors or women testify that one person injured another or caused another type of damage, [one might think] that we rely on them. [But this is not so.]” And it seems from the words of the Rambam that he wishes to provide a reason why regarding damages that slaves and gentiles are excluded from the category of testimony more than the rest of the entire Torah laws, for it is obvious that they should be invalid for testimony, and for this reason he gave the reason that one might think they should be believed since they were the only ones there. And still there is the mistaken thought that it is specifically these [are invalid], because they don’t have mercy, or because they are not commanded in the mitzvot, but women and minors have both of these, and thus should be kosher [for testimony], for there are many instances when invalid witnesses are found when it comes to damages, and the Rambam comes to teach that we need clear testimony. That is how to explain the opinion of the Rambam. And even though that Ashiri explains there two other reasons, why was it necessary for the Tanna to explain specifically for damages that slaves and gentiles are invalid for testimony. Nevertheless, one could say that he is not disagreeing with the reasoning of the Rambam, that each master gives a reason, as is written in Bava Kama 46b these explanations that the geonim employed, on that which we say of the need to sue first. And now, since we learn from the Tanna the rationale that in cases where the invalid [witnesses] are more common that the kosher ones, one could validate the invalid [witnesses], even though the Tanna concludes that they should not be validated, one could say that that is distinct for damages, since if we believe them, life couldn’t continue for anyone, for anyone who is suspected of being a thief could pay slaves or gentiles or induce women or slaves to testify on his behalf that his fellow, or his fellow’s animal, damaged him 100 dollar’s worth every day. But we could say that things that occur occasionally, such as widow’s clothing or women’s seats in the synagogue, we can employ the rationale of the Tanna that one could validate the invalid [witnesses], and therefore Leah does not need to take an oath at all against the [one] witness, for she had witnesses on her side. And even if Rachel had the presumption of possession of the seats, and she had no support at all to support her [and though possession is usually paramount], Leah can take them from her through the testimony of the two women, as was explained. However, if Rachel had the presumption of possession, and one [male] witnesss supporting her, the seats would remain in her possession. And even if Leah had two women [witnesses], nevertheless it is of equal power [since this is possession plus one male witness versus two women witnesses]. And the proof for this is from Yevamot 117b, that concludes like the ultimate version of Rabbi Nechemiah regarding a woman’s testimony that her husband died, that two women against one man, is of equal power. Even though that there the women were also trusted to testify, nevertheless, we do not follow after most opinions, since one kosher witness was testifying against them, and they concluded there according to the ultimate version. And so it is proven from the Yerushalmi, as is there, and it appears [to me] to be the same thing in our case. And it is incorrect to distinguish, [saying] that that case is different, for by the law the women are not kosher, but rather they were lenient regarding women’s testimony, as is explained there, but regarding our case, where it is proper to believe women, we can say we are following after majority of opinions, even opposite one kosher witness, for there two women are extracting something from the presumed possessor, where there is no testimony against them, which is not true when there is one [kosher] witness. Nevertheless, one may answer that since one kosher witness testifies that he knows with certainty that these seats are Rachel’s, we are not vetting women as kosher in our case, but rather that because it sort of cannot be done with one [kosher] witness, therefore we are lenient regarding this, and not because they have more power. If so, it is comparable to a woman’s testimony, and therefore it is of equal power, like there [in that case], that there as well one woman could not come and say [the husband] died, and one kosher witness come and says he did not die, her words are not voided against the one [kosher] witness, while her words would be voided against two [other] women. So we see that even though they are better, they are still of equal power [to one man in other cases].

May peace inundate you forever, holy community of Regensburg, may God protect it, and my disciples, the holy society. We return for your benefit (?),  for it has been several days since my relative by marriage, the strong hammer R. Yisrael of Bruna (=Brno, Czech Republic) wrote to me, and we have accepted this, how R. Anshel, may the Rock protect him, resolved to disrespect him, saying that he (R. Anshel) alone will rule and serve in all rabbinic capacities: divorces, levirate divorce, issuing rulings, and the like. His spirit moved him to push away R. Yisrael of Bruna, may the Rock protect him, and treat him as one of the students, completely removing his prestige. Whenever R. Yisrael of Bruna wrote to me, my answer to him was always that he should remain silent and be one of those who accepts insult, for I hoped that men of truth who pursue justice would find a solution. My hopes have been disappointed, for nothing has changed for the better, only for the worse. Since we have seen that this is the case, we cannot countenance the shaming and degradation of the rabbi of Bruna, as I would fear punishment, as we see in the chapter “Ha-sokher et Ha-po’alim” (Bava Metzi’a 83b) in the case of Rabbi Eliezer. For the sake of truth, justice, and peace, so that dispute does not proliferate, I will write my opinion. Since the community chose neither R. Anshel nor R. Yisrael, and both must pay dues like all the laymen, neither of them has a stronger hold (hazaka) than the other. Although R. Anshel was in Regensburg before R. Yisrael’s arrival, this does not give him a better hold, since the community did not accept him upon themselves as a leader or an officer. He is like one of the laymen who lives in the city; if another layman comes to live nearby in the same city, the first layman cannot say that he already possessed it, since nowadays the Settlement Ban (“Herem Ha-yishuv”) is not practiced. This accords with the statement on the chapter “Lo Yahpor” (Bava Batra 21b): “If he is levied taxes in this place, [another] cannot prevent him [from setting up a competing business],” meaning, if he wants to pay local taxes, as stated in Mordechai. Furthermore, Or Zaru’a states: “If he is a Torah scholar, and people require his Torah, then even if he came from a different kingdom, which does not pay tribute to the ruler of this city, he cannot be prevented. Certainly, in such a case, R. (Shimon b.) Gamliel  would not agree to forbid settlement of any sort on a Torah scholar. Even if there is another Torah scholar in the city, for ‘the jealousy of scribes increases wisdom.’ If he does not know how to profit, but always studies, then the townspeople are commanded to work on his behalf. If he is wealthy, the Torah exempts him from paying tax.” Thus, he wrote plainly “even if there is another Torah scholar in town,” and he did not differentiate between where the townspeople accepted the first Torah scholar as a leader and officer and where they did not. In all cases, we cannot prevent [a second scholar from moving in], and if he is wealthy, the Torah exempts him. We thus see that the second Torah scholar has a hold just like the first one. We have also seen, in our own generation, several places where there are two rabbis, and we have not heard that one would have more of a hold than the other. In Vienna were R. Meir Halevi and R. Aavraham Klausner, of blessed memory. In Krems were R. Yehoshua of Eger and R. Nahlifa, of blessed memory. In Nuremberg were R. Yisrael and R. Koppelman, of blessed memory. In Mainz was R. Zalman Runkel and R. Todros, of blessed memory. I studied in the yeshiva of R. Zalman Runkel. R. Yaakov Moelin (Maharil), of blessed memory, permitted me to set up a yeshiva on my own in Nuremberg, even though R. Zalman Katz had been there several years before I arrived, but I did not want to accept this upon myself. For the reasons I have written, I believe that R. Bruna has as much of a hold as R. Anshel on all matters, and R. Yisrael may preside over those of high standing,  whether to establish his own yeshiva, to grant writs of divorce, perform levirate divorce, issue rulings, and recite the benedictions at weddings, and none may protest against him. One who turns his heart from heeding me, whether in private or in public, I will seek retribution from him and extract the matter from his ear. You, my disciples, be careful not to transgress my word, and also be careful about my honor. Consider the ways of the world; for my part, I do not permit. Whatever a disciple must do and accept from his master—do it. I am astonished that you see this and are silent. You should have made efforts to bring peace between them, so that it does not, God forbid, cause destruction. There are already several communities that have been destroyed due to dispute. Seek justice. Seek peace. The words of the insignificant Yaakov Weil.

R. Eliezer b. Shalom and R. Gershom b. Shalom came before me in a case. R. Eliezer screamed at R. Gershom that he stabbed him and shoved him on the holiday of Sukkot, during the hoshanot circuits, with intent to harm him, as he hated him for a long time. [R. Eliezer] was shoved so much that the bones of his shoulder broke, and he required a doctor to heal him. R. Gershom retorted that he made the circuits like everyone else, and it is normal to push and shove at that time. If he shoved him, it happened without intent to harm him. They continued to fight before me. I also saw all of the testimonies, and after scrutinizing them I found no clear testimony that R. Eliezer was pushed by R. Gershom. I saw only deductions and implications within the testimonies. However, one witness testified that R. Gershom said to him the night before the shoving incident that he had in mind to shove R. Eliezer the next day. He also said to him as they left the synagogue, “Why did you not come to the aid of your landlord when he was shoved?” This testimony was clearer than all the other testimonies. Nevertheless, if we were to exhaust the full depth of Torah law, this testimony would not be sufficient. R. Gershom’s statement to the witness on the previous night, we can say, was because people are prone to boasting without acting, as we see in the chapter “Hezkat Ha-batim” (Bava Batra 33b), in the case of one who went and chopped down another’s date palm.  Even what he said after leaving the synagogue, as above, was an admission outside of the rabbinical court, was autonomously volunteered, and was not in the presence of his accuser, so it is entirely ineffective, as explained by Or Zaru’a [in comments on] the beginning of Bava Metzi’a. R. Gershom cannot be punished or convicted on the basis of deductions and implications, for we accept the ruling of the anonymous first Tanna who disagrees with R. Aha in the chapter “Ha-mokher Peirot” (Bava Batra 93a) in the of an ox that was grazing by the river and a dead ox was found by its side. Even though one was gored and the other was wont to gore, we do not say, “This one gored that one.” This is the ruling of Rif in the chapter “Ha-para” (chapter 5 of Bava Kamma). Certainly in the present case we need stronger indications that there was intention to cause harm, for if he did not intend to cause harm, even if [the victim] was certainly harmed by him, [the perpetrator] is completely exempt from culpability, since the harm came at a time of joy over a mitzva, as Or Zaru’a and Rosh state ad loc., and as Tosafot state at the end of Sukkah. Yet I see, and my heart tells me, that a matter like this needs a major safeguard and protective fence, for if one man can ambush another at such a place, the mitzva of the circuits will be annulled due to each man’s fear of being harmed by someone who hates him. If one bodily injures his fellow at that time, his sin is greater than if he would do so at a different time and place, firstly because he degrades the sanctity of the synagogue, and secondly because he does God’s commandment by means of a transgression. Worse, during this time, on the podium is the Torah scroll, in which it states “do not add” [blows to the prescribed number of lashes], which the Sages interpreted to mean that even if a Jew is wicked, one who strikes him once he has accepted his punishment commits a transgression. One must not conquer the queen while the king is in the house. Since it is apparent and evident that R. Gershom intended to strike and hurt R. Eliezer bodily, and in all such cases, a rabbinical court may punish even in a manner that is not prescribed by law, I hereby impose that R. Gershom express regret and ask forgiveness. He shall do the following: On a day when the Torah is read, while the Torah scroll is on the podium, he should walk from his space to R. Eliezer’s space, passing in front of the ark. The community notables should go with him. He shall say to R. Eliezer: “Eliezer, I have sinned to the God of Israel and then to you, for I have degraded the sanctity of the synagogue and the commandments of the Almighty, and I have violated the Torah’s admonition against striking and hurting another bodily. I therefore ask for pardon and atonement from the God of Israel, and then forgiveness from you, for I regret what I have done. I have estimated the doctor’s fees on average. R. Gershom shall give R. Eliezer two gold coins, and R. Eliezer shall give away those two gold coins, with the knowledge of two trusted men, in honor of the synagogue in Graetz (=Slovenj-Gradec, Slovenia), for a mitzva of his choosing, since they are being given to him as a penalty and to reinforce safeguards, as I explained above. Therefore, I did not impose any charges due to time lost from work, since it is not as clear as the doctor’s fees, for which it is known that R. Eliezer will have to spend money. So says the youngest and most insignificant in all of Israel.
