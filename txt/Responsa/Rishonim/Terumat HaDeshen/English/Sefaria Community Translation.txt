Question: In most communities it is practiced in the long days of summer to read the evening Shema, and to pray the evening prayer, 3 or 4 hours before the stars come out. Is there a way to reconcile this practice, or a reason for this practice, since many scholars practice this along with the masses?
Answer: It is not in our hands to settle this problem, or to find a reason for this tradition to say Maariv so much earlier, 3 or 4 hours. For Rabbenu Tam wrote that from Plag HaMincha and onwards is considered night, according to R' Yehuda, and from that point onward the obligation of Shema and Maariv can be fulfilled. And it is written by the Mordechai, and in the Hagahot Maimuniyot, and the Ravyah wrote that the words of Rabbenu Tam are primary [i.e. the law follows him in this case], and he who is stringent and takes it upon himself to wait until the stars come out as is said by the other great ones, it is seen is arrogance and he is called a mere layman if he is isn't consistently more stringent upon himself. Anyhow, this time [Plag HaMincha] is merely an hour and a quarter before the stars come out; but what is the source to pray Maariv so much earlier? And when I was young I saw in Tosafot on the first chapter of Berachot that there are those who wish to say that in the days of summer, when the days are long, we calculate the hours of the night as small hours, and the hours of the day as long hours, so that there will always be twelve hours of night and twelve hours of day. This was also written to me in a responsum from a great sage, who also responded that daylight should always be split into twelve, even in the long summer days, in order to calculate Plag Hamincha.  And in the Tosafot in chapter Keitzad Meabrin, they go into detail on the calculation of hours for the purpose of calculating the equinoxes and solstices, whether on long or short days.And according to this calculation, it would have been possible to resolve the issue of bringing forward the prayers more than one-and-a-quarter hours, according to the length of the day. For instance, in the middle of the summer when in some countries the day lasts eighteen hours, from dawn until nightfall, each ‘hour’ is extended by a third. If so, an hour and a quarter in the first system becomes a one and seven-eighths of an hour. However, we haven’t even managed to legitimise two hours, let alone three or four! Therefore, it seems that there is no way to resolve this according to the rules and the logic of the Talmud. Rather, it is possible to say that the custom became widespread through the loss of strength which descended to the world. And a lot of people desire to eat while the day is still long. And if they ate before the Mincha they would linger at their food and drink and they would not come at all to the synagogue. And for this reason a few sages forbade even a small meal shortly before the big Mincha (12:30). If so, it was not permitted at all to eat always before the Mincha, and therefore the Sages didn’t have strength to stop the majority of the people from praying the evening prayer and saying the Shema while the day was still light. And in this manner we found even in the first generations in the days of Rav Hai Gaon, as it is written in Ashiri, at the beginning of tractate Berakhot,  and in the days of Riv’a, as it is written in the Commentaries of Rambam on the laws of prayer that there was a community that prayed and recited the evening Shema at the time where it appeared to the Geonim that it was not the correct time for prayer and the Shema recitation. Even they did not stop the people from praying early! I’ve also heard in the yeshivah from the mouth of one of the big sages, that he heard and had a tradition, that in earlier times, in the city of Krems (Austria), they would pray Arvit and read the Shma on Erev Shabbat when the day was still so big (very early) that the Rabbi of the city, who was one of the Sages of the past, together with all the important people of that community would go for a walk on the Danube river after eating the Shabbat meal, and afterwards they would return to their houses before nightfall. It is also found according to one great scholar, who taught to pray Arvit and read the Shema during the long day (in daylight) for the need of a marriage banquet. From all these examples learn that the in the old days it was easy to be lenient in this matter,  especially since: 1) When the Tosafot at the beginning of Berachot wrote that we do 2 leniencies that contradict each other concerning the Amidah. This is not the case anywhere else. 2) Concerning the reading of the Shema also according to Rashi, we are fulfilling the obligation of the Shema on our bed. And it seems that if a talmid chacham found him/herself in a public that would pray early and read shma earlier during summer, if s/he is not able to separate them s/he doesn’t need to separate themself from them. Rather s/he prays with them and reads with them and fulfill their obligation. But if he used to separate himself, he should pray at the time the Sages decreed according to all opinions. This is what it seems in my humble opinion. 

Siman 2

Question: If at the same time one is reading the Shema the Shaliach Tzibbur begins Modim, whether he(the one saying shema) is in the middle of a section(of the three paragraphs of Shema) or in the middle of a blessing(that comes before or after the Shema), can he answer Modim(derabanan) with the congregation, or should he bow down without answering and not interupt the Shema and its blessings? 
Answer: It seems that there is proof that one can interrupt(the Shema) and answer Modim(with the congregation. It says in Perek Mi Shemeto(Berachot 21b)- Rav Huna says one who enters a synagogue and finds the congragation praying(the Shemoneh Esrei), if he is able to finish his tefillah(of shemoneh esrei) before the Shaliach Tzibbur reaches Modim, he should pray his tefillah, but if not he should not pray. From here we see that the Talmud insists very much that one should delay his tefillah in order to answer Modim and doesn't say that he should pray and bow without answering in the middle of the blessing(of his own shemoneh esrei), in line with what Tosafot and the Rosh(Berachot 3:18) say, that Rabbenu Tam would regularly do this when the Shaliach Tzibbur reached Modim. Tosafot and the Rosh conclude that one shouldn't begin to pray and rely on bowing without answering, as is clear from the gemara mentioned above. From this we see that answering Modim is like a דבר שבקדושה and is like answering Amen to the berachot of האל הקדוש and שומע תפילה, who the Semak(Siman 104) says we answer to in any place of the Shema and its blessings.

Question #61: Regarding what many people are used to doing, even the most stringent of them, when they meet on Shabbat after leaving shul and tell each other rumors regarding the kings and the princes and the extent of the wars etc., etc. - Is there a reason for concern regarding a prohibition or not? 
Answer: It seems to be the case that we have to be precise in this matter. The Tosafot and also the Ashiri wrote in their commentaries on chapter “these links'' (Shabbat 113b) that it is forbidden to multiply vain conversations on Shabbat, as it is proven by the story of Rashbi’s mother, as it appears in Vayikra Rabba, in which it says that Rashbi had an old mother, who was very talkative. He said to her “Mom, it is Shabbat now!” She therefore became silent. This teaches us that you should not engage so much in talking on Shabbat as on Hol. And in the Talmud Yerushalmi, we say: “they hardly allowed people to greet others on Shabbat”. With this, it is clearly forbidden to engage in too much talking on Shabbat as if it was Hol, even more so (it is forbidden on Shabbat) to speak more than on weekdays. However, if these same people enjoy themselves through talking and telling stories from the kings and princes and their wars and so on, like the way a lot of people like to do, it seems it is certainly allowed. So is it written in the Sefer Mitzvot Katan, that young people who enjoy running and jumping, they are permitted to do so, as well as anything they might enjoy watching. And we have seen that even though the sages interpreted the verse (Isaiah 58:13): וְכִבַּדְתּוֹ מֵעֲשֹׂת דְּרָכֶיךָ - honor it and not go your ways  - do not walk the same way on Shabbat as you do during weekdays (meaning: not run and not jump). Even still, one may enjoy and satisfy one's spirit. The same law applies regarding superfluous speech. This too was derived from the same verse "nor look at your affairs nor speak words", as the Tosafot and the Ashiri explained above.  However,  I have seen many times that some of those people that meet to talk about these rumours do not enjoy themselves so much from these rumours, and they do this for the sake of their friends gathered with them (peer pressure) , in this case it seems it would be forbidden for those who do not enjoy it.

<b>Question 92</b> He who has a very narrow Sukkah to sleep in, such that he cannot sleep with his body and legs outstretched, is he considered <i>mitzta'er</i> (=suffering) in such circumstances or not?
<b>Answer:</b> It would seem, that he is not exempt from sleeping in the Sukkah through this [case which might be] <i>mitzta'er</i>. And it seems to me, to bring a proof, from that rule that the size of a Sukkah is at least 7 handbreadths, and the size of the body of a regular person is 3 cubits, which are 18 handbreadths, as is found in the Chapter [of Eruvin] 'Mi Shehotzi'uhu'. And in the Chapter 'HaMatznia' (Tosafot on Shabbat 92a.44.1) about he who carries a load above 10 [handbreadths] Tosafot proved that the body of a man without his head is 18 handbreadths, and such also seems apparent there from Rashi's commentary. And if so, even when you look at the diagonal of 7 by 7 [handbreadths, the minimum size of a Sukkah], that is 9.8 handbreadths, and we require, whether for eating or sleeping, that the head of a person and most of his body be in the Sukkah, and his head and most of his body is more than 10 handbreadths, according to the calculation above. And how could the Sages give a minimum size for a Sukkah which someone cannot sleep in with his head and most of his body within the Sukkah? And even though it may be fit to eat in, Rabbi Eliezer of Metz wrote, brought in the Mordekhai (Sukkah 740), that a Sukkah which is not fit to sleep in, even if it is fit to eat and drink in, one does not fulfill his obligation with it at all, rather it must be that it is normal once in a while to sleep curled up, and it is not considered <i>mitzta'er</i>.

<b>Question 111:</b> Do people who send robes, sheets, and the like to their friends on Purim fulfill the commandment of sending portions (<i>mishloach manot</i>) or not?
<b>Answer:</b> It appears that we do not fulfill [the commandment] with them. For it appears that the reason for sending portions is so that each one will have enough and what is sufficient to have the meal as required, as is understood from the Gemara in the first chapter (Megillah 7b:6). As Abbaye bar Avin and Rabbi Chanina bar Avin would exchange their meals with each other, and fulfill sending portions with this. Hence the reason is on account of the meal. Moreover it appears that we do not find anywhere that anything besides food items or drinks are called portions. And the Rambam (Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 2:15) was accordingly precise with his language. As he wrote, "One is obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of cooked food or two [other] types of food; and it appears that drinking is included in eating." But with gifts to the poor (<i>matanot le'evionim</i>), he wrote (2:16), "money or types of food." Hence concerning the sending of portions, he reasoned that it is only edible items.

Question: Leah and Rachel are fighting over women’s seats in the synagogue, and Leah brings two women [to demonstrate] that the seats are hers, and Rachel brings one man to testify that the seats are hers, which testimony is better, two women or one man?
Answer: It seems that the law of presumption of possession of seats relies on something I will proceed to explain, which is if Leah has a presumption of possession to these seats, and Rachel seeks to remove it from [Leah’s] possession, Leah doesn’t even need to swear to refute Rachel’s witness. And even though most geonim decided that we make one swear an oath on a d’rabbanan level even regarding land, here [is different], since Leah has two women who can testify according to her, she is exempt [from such an oath]. And even though normally a woman’s testimony has no substance [in court], in this such case they are normally more discriminating than men, so we can believe them more. And similarly I found a passage from halachic decisions of a certain great rabbi that the reliability of women to testify regarding a widow, that these are the clothes she wore during the life of the husband, because men don’t normally look at women’s clothing, and he brought a proof from the Talmudic statement that three are believed regarding a first-born, [and one of them is] a midwife. What emerges is that regarding matters that men would not normally know, we believe women, even to extract money [from someone], as the case there regarding the widow’s clothing [which is extracted from the inheritor’s estate]. And it seems that women’s seats in the synagogue are not something that men would normally know, as to which seat is for this woman and which for this one. And it seems that we can bring a proof about it that we would believe women in such cases,  from that which we said in the first chapter of Bava Kama (15a), “The last clause is necessary to teach us freemen, to exclude slaves. It states ‘people of the covenant’ - to exclude gentiles, who are invalid for testimony regarding damages.” And it also states there “And it is necessary, for if we taught slaves, because they have no mercy, and if we taught gentiles, because they are not relevant to mitzvot. And the Rambam in his Sefer Nezikin, (Nizkei Mamon 8:13), states: “Damages should not be collected... without clear testimony. One does not say that since we are not with shepherds, servants, and the like are found in the stables of horses, the stalls of cattle and the corrals of sheep, their testimony should be accepted if they testify that one animal damaged another. Similarly, if minors or women testify that one person injured another or caused another type of damage, [one might think] that we rely on them. [But this is not so.]” And it seems from the words of the Rambam that he wishes to provide a reason why regarding damages that slaves and gentiles are excluded from the category of testimony more than the rest of the entire Torah laws, for it is obvious that they should be invalid for testimony, and for this reason he gave the reason that one might think they should be believed since they were the only ones there. And still there is the mistaken thought that it is specifically these [are invalid], because they don’t have mercy, or because they are not commanded in the mitzvot, but women and minors have both of these, and thus should be kosher [for testimony], for there are many instances when invalid witnesses are found when it comes to damages, and the Rambam comes to teach that we need clear testimony. That is how to explain the opinion of the Rambam. And even though that Ashiri explains there two other reasons, why was it necessary for the Tanna to explain specifically for damages that slaves and gentiles are invalid for testimony. Nevertheless, one could say that he is not disagreeing with the reasoning of the Rambam, that each master gives a reason, as is written in Bava Kama 46b these explanations that the geonim employed, on that which we say of the need to sue first. And now, since we learn from the Tanna the rationale that in cases where the invalid [witnesses] are more common that the kosher ones, one could validate the invalid [witnesses], even though the Tanna concludes that they should not be validated, one could say that that is distinct for damages, since if we believe them, life couldn’t continue for anyone, for anyone who is suspected of being a thief could pay slaves or gentiles or induce women or slaves to testify on his behalf that his fellow, or his fellow’s animal, damaged him 100 dollar’s worth every day. But we could say that things that occur occasionally, such as widow’s clothing or women’s seats in the synagogue, we can employ the rationale of the Tanna that one could validate the invalid [witnesses], and therefore Leah does not need to take an oath at all against the [one] witness, for she had witnesses on her side. And even if Rachel had the presumption of possession of the seats, and she had no support at all to support her [and though possession is usually paramount], Leah can take them from her through the testimony of the two women, as was explained. However, if Rachel had the presumption of possession, and one [male] witnesss supporting her, the seats would remain in her possession. And even if Leah had two women [witnesses], nevertheless it is of equal power [since this is possession plus one male witness versus two women witnesses]. And the proof for this is from Yevamot 117b, that concludes like the ultimate version of Rabbi Nechemiah regarding a woman’s testimony that her husband died, that two women against one man, is of equal power. Even though that there the women were also trusted to testify, nevertheless, we do not follow after most opinions, since one kosher witness was testifying against them, and they concluded there according to the ultimate version. And so it is proven from the Yerushalmi, as is there, and it appears [to me] to be the same thing in our case. And it is incorrect to distinguish, [saying] that that case is different, for by the law the women are not kosher, but rather they were lenient regarding women’s testimony, as is explained there, but regarding our case, where it is proper to believe women, we can say we are following after majority of opinions, even opposite one kosher witness, for there two women are extracting something from the presumed possessor, where there is no testimony against them, which is not true when there is one [kosher] witness. Nevertheless, one may answer that since one kosher witness testifies that he knows with certainty that these seats are Rachel’s, we are not vetting women as kosher in our case, but rather that because it sort of cannot be done with one [kosher] witness, therefore we are lenient regarding this, and not because they have more power. If so, it is comparable to a woman’s testimony, and therefore it is of equal power, like there [in that case], that there as well one woman could not come and say [the husband] died, and one kosher witness come and says he did not die, her words are not voided against the one [kosher] witness, while her words would be voided against two [other] women. So we see that even though they are better, they are still of equal power [to one man in other cases].

<b>Paragraph 235:</b> However that which you wrote, that if he would have given the [first born] son to the priest (kohen), he would have fulfilled [the commandment] with this, like with the first born donkey, it is a joke! As I do not know from where you deduced that one has fulfilled [the commandment] with the first born donkey itself, if he gave the first born to the priest. Perhaps he actually has to redeem or to behead [it]. And that which we learned [it] from sanctified property is that he doesn't specifically need a sheep, but can redeem it with other things as they may be. However it nevertheless requires redemption. But even if it would be effective there, that is because the body of the donkey before its redemption is holy as the first born, even regarding benefit. Whereas with a first born son, about which it is clearly learned from Scripture that he is completely mundane (not holy), what would the priest need him for? If as a slave, a free man cannot be made into a slave; if as a son, behold he is not his offspring!
