Reuben said to Shimon: Give me my deposit that I gave you to look after. Shimon said to him: I did not receive the deposit from you and I don't need to הא ביתא קמך. And he said the direction that you brought the deposit. I said to him: Rather, the things that I do not need הא ביתא קמך, if Shimon has witnesses בהא ביתא קמך and Reuben receives or thanks (?) him

Regarding your question about someone who constantly takes oaths and is accustomed to swearing for everything, and a legal case arises where an oath is administered to him in court, and he violates the oath, thus exempting him from the consequences of the oath - once he has transgressed the oath, he becomes distant from the obligation of oath-taking and says, "I will not swear at all." However, now he is fearful of the oath. What is the ruling in such a case? Since he was accustomed to taking oaths before this incident, and when obligated by the court, he says, "I will not swear," they administer the oath to him.
