Teshuva 253

You asked: A community has a local synagogue,and a wealthy resident of the city has acquired many seats there in expensively. The seats have appreciated because of him, and since the rate has appreciated, he has raised the rent for the seats to the point that the renters now desist from coming to the synagogue, because the cost of seats is expensive. The community wants to add seats in an open space in the synagogue and to sell them to these people, benefiting the community financially and improving the righteousness of the community as they come to synagogue and use those extra seats. This wealthy person  has  stood to challenge this, saying this would narrow his path to reach his seats ...
Answer: The law is with that wealthy person. Since he owns seats there,  and he has a broad path to his seats through that empty space, the community may not reduce it, as that would increase the path he would need to travel to his seats, through that narrow space. It is like the Tosefta [Bava Batra] “One who owns an entrance [from his property] into the street cannot be compelled by the other residents of the street to put a door  on [the entrance into] the street. He may say, ‘I want to enter  [directly] with my burden on my shoulder, to reach my entrance.” ... 
Also,  regarding  your suggestion that some of the people without  seats could put portable seats in the middle of  the synagogue and sit there, or sit on rows of clean mats on the ground if they wish, for no  individual owns  anything other than his space and its entrance and exit access, but everyone owns the rest equally: They also may not do this. For even those who own seats, with access for entrance and exit, may not use that which is a path belonging to others ... just as  residents of a street or [shared] yard may not use the street or yard other than in ways that residents normally use streets or yards ... 
But that which residents of the city may do, and it would be good for them, would be to cap the rental price of seats, and to obligate owners of seats they do not need to rent them to others for sitting.  As taught in Bava Batra 8b, “A city’s residents may stipulate conditions for measures,  prices, and wages of workers, and may punish those who violate  their norms.” ...
