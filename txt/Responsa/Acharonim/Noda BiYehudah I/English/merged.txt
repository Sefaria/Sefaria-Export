Teshuva 1

Responsum One of the <i>Noda B’Y’huda</i> First Edition on <i>Orakh Khayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is his first Responsa; not on O”H 1!</i><br>‘To hear the Ram’s Horn, may his peaceful life never be torn, In the book of life may he merit to be signed, sealed and borne!’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I know…I took liberties with the translation: The Ram’s horn is a reference to <i>Rosh Hashana</i> and its traditional<i> mitzvot</i> (hearing the Shofar) and prayers, as this missive was likely sent around this time of year. May his ‘covenant of peace not be voided may he be signed and sealed with all who are written in the book of life- a common theme in the prayers of <i>Rosh Hashana</i>.</i> (to) The great scholar, my respected and beloved relative, my dear friend who is a great light and amazing and wonderful in all levels of Torah, and in all levels of honor, our teacher, the Rabbi <i>Yitkhaq HaKohain</i>- may the merciful one watch over him and redeem him- the chief of the Jewish court and head of the Academy of the holy congregation of Bonn. I saw his letter as a ‘flying scroll’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Zecharya 5:1-2 to the prophet’s vision of a flying scroll, to which the rabbis, in Talmud Bavli Gittin 60a-b imply to mean a scroll of Torah.</i>, as he is a <i>Kohain</i> - whose knowledge is beautiful and whose words are pure- concerning phylacteries that came to a certain scribe who wished to make outstandingly beautiful boxes<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘houses’. This is an abbreviated version, as more details of the question will be elaborate later on.</i> for them.
Indeed, they are made with a plaster, which was plastered on with a thick coat on the leather boxes on which, afterwards, mineral spirits<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These ‘spirits’ are the aromatic hydrocarbons like turpentine</i> are applied, such that the boxes are a ‘brilliantly declared’ black- which his eminence plans to disqualify<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">At this point, the relevant source for the production of the <i>tfillin</i> boxes are from Menachot 35 where the Talmud relates that many of the specific laws regarding <i>Tefillin</i> are <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i> – an ‘ancient law of Mosaic tradition’. For example:<br>Rav Chananel quotes Rav as teaching that the need for a base for the square <i>Tefillin</i>, called the <i>titura</i>, is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>.<br>Abayye teaches that the hollow area through which the strap of the <i>Tefillin</i> is pulled, called the <i>ma’abarta</i>, is <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i><br>Similarly, Abayye teaches that the letter <i>shin</i>, formed in the leather or the <i>Tefillin shel rosh – Tefillin</i> worn on the head – is <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>Rabbi Yitzhak teaches that the rule requiring the leather straps of the <i>Tefillin</i> to be black is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>A <i>baraita</i> (extra-Mishnaic teaching) is quoted as teaching that the requirement that <i>Tefillin</i> must be square is a <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i><br>Each tefillah, it must be remembered, is in the form of a square leather box upon a base, that of the hand consisting of one compartment and of the head of four compartments. In order to obtain the necessary shape (usually in the form of a cube) a mould or frame is used over which the skin whilst moist and pliable is tautly stretched. On being removed from the frame the skin is cut around to an equal length on three sides, whilst on the fourth side there is left a long strip of skin which, after allowing for a projection on this fourth side in order to provide a loop or a duct through which the straps are passed, is bent under the whole box so as to form the underside or the base of the tefillah. After inserting the necessary texts into the several compartments, the base is stitched carefully to the extremities of the box on three sides The stitching of the underside to the box must be done very carefully so that the box should remain a perfect square; thus the stitches should not be pulled too much for fear that the leather will become creased and so lose its correct shape [see appendix].</i>.
He comes (to this conclusion) from several sides: Firstly, this plaster covers the leather of the [<i>tfillin</i>] boxes! If so, these boxes are not exposed to the outside. Also, from the aspect of ‘adding’, as this plaster is an extra, and one is violating ‘You shall not add [nor detract]’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Deuteronomy 13:1 one may not add nor detract from the commandments – specifically the ritual ones- such as having 5 or 3 fringes of <i>tzitzit</i> instead of the mandated 4.</i>
 Additionally, when this plaster was plastered on thickly, it covered the corners of the letter <i>shin</i> on the <i>tfillin</i> box sides, as only the edges are noticed and there may be an aspect of erasing Hashem’s name.
 He also wrote to support his reasoning that they are disqualified because the leather is covered, which would not be beneficial<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">From the point of view of ‘beautifying’ one’s <i>mitzvot</i>. The context of this matter as to whether it affects the performance of ritual, will be analyzed.</i>, as it is akin to covering them with gold, which disqualifies [the boxes].
 His most elevated eminence expanded on this issue with casuistry and reasoning<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The entire text of this missive is not available, see note 4, ans as an example, see note 196</i>.
It is here that I will respond on a few of the comments of my esteemed interlocutor. These are the words of his eminence: We merited this legal decision based on the conclusions of the <i>Mordechai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Mordechai ben Hillel HaKohen (c. 1250–1298), also known as The Mordechai, was a 13th-century German rabbi and posek. His chief legal commentary on the Talmud, referred to as <i>The Mordechai</i>, is one of the sources of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. He was killed in the Rintfleisch massacres in 1298.</i>, that the use of leather from non-kosher animals or coating the boxes in gold, also disqualify [the <i>tfillin</i>].
‘…So too did the <i>Beit Yosaif<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, also spelled Yosef Caro, or Qaro (1488 – March 24, 1575),[1] was author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the Shulchan Aruch, which is still authoritative for all Jews pertaining to their respective communities. Beth Yosef (בית יוסף), a commentary on Arba'ah Turim, the current work of Jewish law in his days. In this commentary Karo shows an astounding mastery over the Talmud and the legalistic literature of the Middle Ages. Kesef Mishneh (כסף משנה) (Venice, 1574–75), a commentary of Mishneh Torah by Maimonides</i>, Ba”kh<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Joel ben Samuel Sirkis also known as the Bach - בית חדש) ב"ח)—an abbreviation of his magnum opus, <i>Bayit Chadash</i>—was a prominent Jewish posek and halakhist. He lived in central Europe and held rabbinical positions in Belz, Brest-Litovsk and Kraków. He lived from 1561 to 1640</i>,</i> the words of the <i>Tur<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob ben Asher, also known as Ba'al ha-Turim as well as Rabbi Yaakov ben Raash (Rabbeinu Asher), was probably born in the Holy Roman Empire at Cologne about 1269 and probably died at Toledo, then in the Kingdom of Castile, about 1343. Also known as the <i>Riv”A</i>.</i> and the Rambam</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (מֹשֶׁה בֶּן־מַימוֹן‎} and also referred to by the acronym Rambam"Our Rabbi Moses son of Maimon"), was a medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages. In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician</i> and I found none who disagree with this reasoning’- is the end of his eminence’s statements.  [and] I say: I have not found in any of the earlier rabbinic decisors who implied that when the Talmud stated ‘If one coated them [<i>tefillin</i> boxes] with gold or hung upon them the hide of a non-kosher animal, they are disqualified [for use as phylacteries]’ to mean that it meant coating gold over the box. The illuminating<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘light of our eyes’</i> rabbi, the Beit Yosef<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. note 15</i> was not specific enough in this regard.
The source of the matter here is in Tractate Menachot 42b: “This, however, is a matter of dispute between Tannaim, for it has been taught: If a man overlaid [the tefillin] with gold or covered them with the skin of an unclean animal, they are invalid<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth (Ex. 13:9)</i>, the tefillin should be made from that which is permissible for food; if with the skin of a clean animal, they are valid, even though he did not prepare it for this specific purpose. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says, even if he covered them with the skin of a clean animal they are invalid, unless it had been prepared for this specific purpose<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly the first Tanna and Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel would differ as to the necessity for weaving the threads specifically for the purpose of zizith</i> “.
<i>Rashi</i>, loc. cit.” ‘If a man overlaid [the tefillin] with gold’ The boxes containing the <i>tfillin</i> are disqualified, as leather boxes are a requirement, as even the straps that are wrapped (around the arm) must be from that material (lit. ‘species’ or ‘type’, meaning: leather), as was stated in the tractate ‘One (a priest) who takes a handful ‘<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Menachot 35a see below note 32</i>. ‘Or one placed upon them’: That if one makes the boxes from the hide of a ritually impure animal, they are disqualified, as was stated in the chapter ‘Eight Crawling Species<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Tractate Shabbat 108a see below</i>’: “So that the torah of Hashem will be in your mouth”- that which is permitted to be in your mouth. “- this is the end of <i>Rashi’s</i> text.
It is apparent that <i>Rashi</i> unquestionably intended when he wrote ‘covered the <i>t’fillin</i> in gold’ meant that the boxes themselves were made of gold, and he coated the scriptural verses in gold. It is those verses which <i>Rashi</i> calls ‘<i>tefillin</i>’, which is identified in the companion<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘and his friend will say this about him’</i> (next) text which disqualifies the use of an impure animal. <i>Rashi</i> explained that it applies toone who made the phylactery boxes from an impure animal. If that is so, then when he (<i>Rashi</i>) states “coated in gold”, it means the actual boxes
Additionally, when <i>Rashi</i> expounded on the disqualifications of <i>tefillin</i> boxes, it included the qualification of being made out of leather, as even the straps that are tied on must be made from a similar animal hide, as was explained in the chapter ‘One who takes a Handful’.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See note 31</i> His (<i>Rashi)</i> intention was to that which was written on page 35a ‘that <i>tefillin</i> should not be tied with anything other than that (kosher) species.
Indeed, if one presumes that leather boxes were made and then coated with gold, what is the logical connection to the straps?  The straps essence is to the tying (of the <i>tefillin</i>)? With regard to the straps, what is the reason they are disqualified?
If one made (the requisite) black straps and then coated them with gold; and if one would posit that the reason for the disqualification would be secondary to the leather box not being visible<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is coated with gold</i>, if that is so, the reason was not enumerated by <i>Rashi</i>! Why would <i>Rashi</i> abandon this basic explanation and employ an apriori reasoning to the straps instead?  The concepts must be related.
Also, that which <i>Rashi</i> stated “The boxes are disqualified”, it is obvious that <i>Rashi’s</i> intent was not the the actual <i>tefillin</i>- meaning, the verses on the parchment- that are disqualified, as they made be taken out and placed into other boxes.
Should one presume that this involves making leather boxes which were then coated with gold, if so, then the boxes are not disqualified, as the coating can be removed, and will revert to their original state.
If it is so that in any case, prior to removing the gold coating it is entirely disqualified and when the coating is removed even the boxes are qualified; why then did <i>Rashi</i> write that the boxes are disqualified, <i>Rashi</i> should have explained that the <i>tefillin</i> were disqualified! Rather it is unquestionably obvious that Rashi explained that <i>braitta</i> of “One who coats the <i>tefillin</i> with gold” , means, that he coated the compartments with gold and made the boxes themselves out of gold. However, if he made the boxes from the hides of a kosher animal and then coated it with something else- that is not mention in this <i>braitta</i> [ruling].
Our great Rabbi, the <i>Rambam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See note 19. For a more complete quote, See the Appendix.</i>, in chapter 3 of Laws Pertaining to <i>Tefillin</i>, and these are his words in section 15: “The leather used to cover the <i>tefillin</i> and from which the straps are made should come from a kosher species of animal, beast, or fowl….If, however, leather from a non-kosher species was used or if they were covered with gold, they are not acceptable”. Indeed, in his (Maimonides) language there is no doubt that when he wrote “leather used to cover the tefillin ”meant the actual leather of the boxes. Indeed, there is no mention anywhere in the words of the Rambam regarding covering another leather on top of the original leather of the boxes.
It is true that according to the opinion of the <i>Rambam</i>, a cloth must be folded on to the compartments before they (the parchments) are placed in the boxes, as noted in Chapter 3:1 and 3:8.
However, that one would have to cover the leather boxes with leather on the outside- that was not understood (lit. ‘heard’) at all. These are his words in the beginning of Laws Pertaining to Phylacteries: “Four passages [of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Which contain references to the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i></i>, which are ‘Make unique to me’<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13</i>….are written on separate parchments and covered with leather, and are called <i>tefillin</i> (phylacteries)…” If that is so, then that which he specifies ‘and covered with leather’, specific to the word ‘leather’<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew that is designated by the designating letter ה- ‘hay’, meaning “THE leather”. There are other forms that the letter is used for, such as the ‘questioning’ hay.</i>, meaning the leather referred to in the initial wording of these laws, that when her states ‘covered with leather’, it means the leather of the actual boxes. It is to this that he refers to when he stated “If he made them from the hide of an impure animal, they are disqualified”.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3:15. See page 6 above.</i>
If that is so, then that which he stated ‘the leather that covers the <i>tefillin</i>’ means the leather of the boxes. Indeed, he calls the scripture parchments ‘<i>tefillin’,</i> therefore, when he states ‘coated with gold’ or ‘coated the <i>tefillin</i> in gold’, ‘<i>tefillin’</i> are the parchments and ‘coated with gold’ means, however, that the boxes were made of gold, and not that they were made of leather and coated with gold<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I found the syntax here a little difficult and hope I preserved the intent.</i>. At no point was this regulation mentioned by the <i>Rambam</i>, as the <i>braitta</i> meant that the actual boxes were made of gold or the hide of an impure animal, as was explained by <i>Rashi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Menachot 42b, see page 4 above.</i>
It is because of this that I am perplexed by what the <i>Beit Yosaif</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See note 16; In this case it is 32:39 see note 47</i> wrote in <i>Orakh Khayim</i> 32, writing that from the words of the <i>Rambam</i> it appears that that when one disqualifies another leather on the boxes, it is <i>not</i> that the boxes themselves were made from  aan impure animal etc.. It seems overturned<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Drawing from the reference to Esther 9:1</i>, as the words of Maimonides are the exactly opposite!
The <i>Rosh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Asher ben Jehiel (Hebrew: אשר בן יחיאל‎, or Asher ben Yechiel, sometimes Asheri) (1250 or 1259 – 1327) was an eminent rabbi and Talmudist best known for his abstract of Talmudic law. He is often referred to as Rabbenu Asher, “our Rabbi Asher” or by the Hebrew acronym for this title, the ROSH (רא"ש‎, literally "Head").</i>, in his smaller collection of <i>Halachot</i>, wrote: “Our rabbis taught: If they were coated with gold…..Rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel states: Even the hides of a ritually pure animal are disqualified untio they are made specific to the task<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘made to its name’- meaning here, made for making tefillin.</i>. In the Laws Concenring <i>Sefer Torah</i> (Torah Scrolls) I wrote that the law is like rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel, that it must be made specific to the task, ergo, the parchment, straps and the boxes must be made specific to the task”- end of quotation.
As the <i>Rosh</i> thought there, towards the end of his statement, that the parchment, straps and the boxes, and compares them to the hide of the boxes, as they are also disqualified if they are not made to the specific task, so that one can generalize that he also explains that <i>braitta</i> as pertaining to the actual boxes; it does not seem to apply to the hide that is <i>on the boxes at all</i>.
It should be noted, however, that this reasoning can be deflected, as towards the end of his opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh The ‘Smaller’ volume of Halcahot Concenring Tefillin, on Tractate Menachot. It is fully quoted here</i>, he posits that it is absolute in its application to the <i>tefillin</i> (the actual parchment writing), but not to any leather that is on the boxes- even if the boxes were covered with leather that was not made specifically for that purpose- are disqualified, as per rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel
Nevertheless, there is no obligation at all for there to be leather on top of the boxes, and this was not included in their thinking.
It should be noted, that later on, considering that the straps should have a pass-through<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See note 35f</i> as a <i>halacha passed down from Moses at Sinai</i>, the <i>Rosh</i> wrote: “There are those who interpret the ‘pass-through’ as made from a small strap that is passed over the arm <i>tefillin</i>….and even if the interpretation is not that it’s a small strap, nevertheless, such <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified, as the outer casing, that does not see the outside air in these cases, unless one has made another box for it. The reason that ‘caoting them with gold’ disqualifies, is that they require being covered by the hides of a ritually pure animal, and this is akin to covering it with the hides of a ritually impure animal”- end quote of the <i>Rosh.</i>
On first impression, how does the <i>Rosh</i> bring proof for that which is ‘coated with gold’? The reasoning cannot be that since the boxes do not see the outside environment, one then hangs the hide of a ritually impure animal on it- does that not need a valid comparison? Would it seem that if one hangs a ritually impure animal hide on it, it is also disqualified (as kosher <i>tefillin</i>) because it is not exposed to the outside air? Therefore, it must be that the boxes were made from the hide of a ritually pure animal.
Seemingly, according to the reasoning of ‘external exposure’<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">That the <i>tefillin</i> boxes themselves should be exposed to the outside environment</i> there is no reason to disqualify golden boxes<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">As those golden boxes are also ‘exposed to the outside air’!</i>, as there is no biblical directive to make the boxes from hides? Rashi, here in tractate Menachot, truly had difficulty with this and had to employ an a priori reasoning utilizing a comparison to the straps that must be made of (kosher) leather; as the straps are used to don the <i>tefillin</i>, so too, a priori, should the boxes.
In the chapter entitled ‘Once the Sentence is Passed’<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Bavli Sanhedrin 48b; see note 61</i>,<i> Rashi</i> explained that it is law ‘passed down to us from Moses was on Mount Sinai’. However, in truth, we have not found any source in the Talmud that explicitly states the need for the boxes to be made from hides! I would understand<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘this would be good’</i> if the boxes were made from the hide of a ritually impure animal- it would certainly be disqualified- as it requires ‘the work of heaven’’ that ‘which is permitted in your mouth’.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See note 27</i> However, something which is not forbidden, despite it not being hide, we have not found any place that explicitly disqualifies, except for this <i>braitta</i> stating that ‘coated with gold, disqualifies’.
Ergo, it is better to explain this <i>braitta</i> as <i>not</i> dealing with the case of making the actual boxes out of gold, rather, that it deals with boxes made with permissible leather hide(s), and then coated them with gold, that is what the <i>braitta</i> intended. The disqualification is secondary to box being covered<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘not exposed to the outside air’</i>, to wit, brings credence to the disqualification of boxes not exposed to the outside air.
It is on this that the <i>Rosh</i> comments<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See note 49 and page 10</i>, that it (the <i>braitta</i>) is not so, rather, it deals with the case of making the actual boxes out of gold, comparing it (the boxes) to making them from an impure animal. Obviously, when made from an impure animal it is certainly disqualified, as we required them (<i>tefillin</i>) to be made ‘from that which is permissible to your mouth’
Here too, ‘coated with gold’ -that the boxes themselves were made from gold- are disqualified, as they need to be made from hide, as explained by Rashi. If that is so, there is no longer a need to explain the <i>braitta</i> as pertaining to boxes made of leather hide and then coated with gold, and then to state that they require exposure to the outside environment, as this <i>braitta</i> can be understood simply as the case of the actual boxes were made from gold.
Know that the opinion of the <i>Rosh</i>, prima facie (on this topic) are bewildering: What was the need<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>braitta</i> to write</i> to write ‘coated with gold’ if the reason was not that ‘it must see the outside air’? Did it not state in that <i>braitta</i> that the hide of a ritually pure animal qualifies? If it was (disqualified) because it ‘could not be exposed to the outside environment’ then even covering it with the hide of a permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I am trying not to be repetitive; here- the hide of a ritually pure animal.</i> animal would be disqualified!
Then perforce, one would say that in the case of coating with the hide of a ritually pure animal, we are unconcerned about it not seeing the outside air. In any case, it would seem that  in the case of the passageway made for the straps (<i>ma’avarta</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See note 37(f)</i>, there is no detriment for that small strap, as it is made from a permissible hide, and one would have to say that it is covered with the hide of a ritually pure animal.
If that is so, the entire box would be ‘coated’ from each side<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">There are 6 sides to a cube and the ‘little’ strap covers the underside of the <i>tefillin</i> box.</i>. If that is so, the coating itself is what is on the outside which is ‘exposed to the outside environment’- it is qualified because of this covering and not what is inside it.
However, this small strap-that goes across the width of the arm<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The width of the area of the arm the <i>tefillin</i> box is placed upon</i>- as explained by the <i>Tur</i> in chapter 32<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">To be more specific: <i>Orakh Khayim</i> 32. See below 70</i>, note that it does not cover all sides of the box. If that is so, one cannot think that this small strap was for the box itself, and one must know that this small strap is under the leather of the box. Ergo, one could argue, prima facie, that is should disqualify secondary to preventing the box from being exposed to the outside air! The <i>Rosh</i> would have to contend that in the case of ‘coated with gold’, the reason cannot be secondary to exposure to the outside environment, only that the reason is the necessity of being covered with a permissible hide<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, that despite there being a ‘covering’ around a portion of the box (albeit, the underside which has NO ‘exposure to the outside, as it rests on the ‘width of the arm’!) -and that it is still ‘kosher’ <i>tefillin</i>- then being covered by a kosher hide is permissible.</i>.
Yet here, there is a possibility to explain the opinion of the <i>Rosh</i> that he too would interpret the <i>braitta</i> ‘coated with gold or covered with the hide from an impure animal…’ applies to the situation where, underneath, the box was made from permissible hide(s) and on the top, it was coated with gold or with hides from ritually impure animal.
Rather, the <i>Rosh</i> stated specifically that gold is not permissible to make <i>tefillin</i> boxes, and that is why he disqualifies it even when (just) covering the top of the box. However, the hide from a permissible animal, which certainly qualifies the <i>tewfillin</i> box when it covers the top of the box, even if it is comparable to the <i>ma’avarta</i> strap, that does not cover all the sides of the box- that it could still be called a ‘[<i>tefillin</i>] box’-  even in that case, it does not disqualify the box underneath it. Look at what the <i>Mordechai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See notes 14 and 15</i> stated in the name of the <i>R”i</i>.
However, whether we regard the initial understanding of the <i>Rosh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See note 50 for the relevant <i>Rosh</i>; see page 12 for the comments of the initial understanding.</i>, or this recent understanding, it is still difficult<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">As just stated on the previous page, that even if only partially covered.</i>, as why did the <i>Rosh</i> derive the law from a comparison of gold coating to that made from a ritually impure animal? From its position (in the legal argument), one can decide that gold is not a suitable substance to make a <i>tefillin</i> box- as had it been suitable- then if so, what difference is there from covering the box with a permissible hide or with gold? Why is one <i>kosher</i> and the other not?
It would appear that the <i>Rosh</i> did not want to elaborate and brought a proof from the subject that which was connected to it<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Look at the the first line of note 50</i>, meaning, ritually impure animals.
Additionally, that which the <i>Beit Yosaif</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See note 47</i> wrote, that the <i>Rambam</i> explained the latter portion of that <i>braitta</i> of ‘the hide of a ritually impure animal’ as applicable to the scriptural parchments and straps, and not to the boxes. Despite the <i>Rosh</i> seeming not to reason that way, nevertheless, he wanted to rest his opinion on that proof<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">That the <i>braitta</i> included gold along with the hide of an impermissible animal (‘coated with gold or an impermissible hide’)</i>.
It would also appear from the words of the <i>Beit Yosaif</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Likely misprint or error quoting the <i>Rosh</i>; a search of his responsae and literature using terms like אויר or בית אחר from this quote here, reveals no source at all. Ergo, Rabbi Landau is likely referring to the <i>Beit Yosaif.</i> -note 47</i> ‘that the <i>teffilin</i> are not disqualified because they do not see the outside environment, unless they had another box made for them.’ This implies, specifically in these situations they are disqualified and not for any other reason. ‘Coating with gold’ implies that the boxes were made of gold.
Concerning the <i>Sma”g</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, also known as Moses Mikkotsi (משה בן יעקב מקוצי‎), was a French Tosafist and authority on Halakha (Jewish law). He is best known as author of one of the earliest codifications of Halakha, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol In 1240 he was one of the four rabbis who were required to defend the Talmud, in a public disputation in Paris, and it is likely that the need for a work like the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol was driven by the decrees against the Talmud which had been promulgated in France, and had led to the confiscation and burning of all Talmud manuscripts in 1242 The "Sefer Mitzvot Gadol" (ספר מצוות גדול: The Great Book of Commandments; abbreviated סמ"ג " SeMaG" ) deals with the 365 negative commandments and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud and the decisions of the Rabbis. "SeMaG" also contains much non-legal, moralistic teaching. [No, he did not live in LA (‘smog’) or defend a cavern of gold (Smaug)- and that was Middle Earth, not Middle Ages…]</i> on this issue, I have not seen him copy this <i>braitta</i> at all. It would seem to me, apparently, that he completely ignored it and it never appears in his book<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Confirmed with the Bar Ilan database search of ציפן זהב in the סמ"ג.</i>! If that is so, since he also explains that if the actual boxes were made from gold or from an impermissible hide, which is why he did not need to bring that (as a proof), since he alsready explained in the beginning of his Laws Concerning <i>Tefillin</i> that the parchment upon which the releveant scriptures are written vas well as the strps and the hides of the boxes must be made from ritually pure animals or beasts, and are requires to be made specifically for that purpose. – see the text.
If that is so, indeed we have excluded anything that is not from the hide of a ritually pure animal, which is exactly like that <i>braitta</i> and rabbi Shim’own ben Gamliel. However, if one posited that the <i>braitta</i> of ‘coated with gold or with the hide of a ritually impure animal’ he should have brought that (as a proof). The <i>Tur</i> in chapter 32- with a sharp commentary<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘with a sharp knife’ see relevant Tur, note 83</i>- cut this <i>braitta</i> out, neither the first or the last part. These are the words of the <i>Tur</i>: “If one coated them with gold or made them from the hide of a ritually impure animal, they are disqualified”. Indeed, he does not state that the boxes were made of gold, rather he stated that they were ‘coated with gold’, which implies, that underneath them is qualified leather hide, and upon them one coated the gold.
In regards to hides from a ritually impure animal, he wrote ‘that were made from the hide of a ritually impure animal’, implying that the boxes were made from the hide of a ritually impure animal.
The <i>Beit Yosaif</i> also wrote that, and is seen from the wording of the <i>Tur</i>, that if the hides were made from a ritually pure animal, and then placed on them a cover made from the hide of a ritually impure animal, they are not disqualified.
Rather, we need a reason why ‘coating with gold’ disqualifies? How is it worse than hide made from a ritually impure animal? If that is not so, then the <i>Tur</i> refutes himself<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">For more on this expression see note 87 below</i>, I would have been able to answer the question of the <i>Beit Yosaif</i>: The reason that coating with gold disqualifies, is because the boxes have to be black on the outside, similar to the straps which must be black, just as the straps must be black<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See the appendix on note 81</i>. If one coats them with gold, they will not be black, and hence disqualified.
However, if one placed over them the hide of a ritually impure animal, that leather hide may also be black, and therefore, he does not disqualify, except if one made the actual boxes from the hide of a ritually impure animal, because it must be made from ‘that which is permissible in your mouth’.
I say to myself, that this reason, when I say that the boxes need to be black, is the reasoning of the Tosafot in tractate Shabbat 28b<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See the next note for the relevant Talmud and Tosafot</i> loc. cit. ‘In the case of <i>tefillin</i>, it explicitly states’, writing these words: “Since the straps are required to be black like the capsule [‘<i>ketzitza’</i>] of the <i>tefillin</i>…”. Indeed, their explanation regards that the capsule must be black.
The <i>Mordechai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See note 15</i> wrote explicitly in the name of <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob ben Meir (1100 in Ramerupt – 9 June 1171 (4 tammuz) in Troyes),[1] best known as Rabbeinu Tam, was one of the most renowned Ashkenazi Jewish rabbis and leading French Tosafists, a leading halakhic authority in his generation, and a grandson of Rashi. Known as "Rabbeinu" (our teacher), he acquired the Hebrew suffix "Tam" meaning straightforward; it was originally used in the Book of Genesis to describe his biblical namesake, Jacob.</i>, that the boxes must be black, and he brought his proof from the argument employed above.
That which I have stated, that it is for that reason it is disqualified if it was ‘coated with gold’. In my humble opinion, this is brought down in the Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Megillah<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">See following note for the fuller text</i>, in the chapter entitled ‘One Who Reads [the Megillah] Standing Upright’, that on the Mishan that was taught there: ‘One who makes his <i>tefillin</i> boxes round, is susceptible to danger… If one coats it with gold…’- it states there in the Jersulamen Talmud: ‘It has been taught in a <i>braitta</i> by rabbi Yosseh, son of Bibi: <i>Tefillin</i> must be mad square and black- is an ancient tradition (lit. ‘A <i>halacha</i> that was transmitted orally from Moses when he was on Mount Sinai’).’
To my mind, it is hard to place the adjective ‘black’ on the <i>tefillin</i> straps, as straps were not mentioned at all. In addition, the text combined the terms ‘square’ and ‘black’; just as square describes the boxes, so so the term ‘black’. Then the Jerusalem Talmud gave a reason for what was stated in the Mishna, as to why round <i>tefillin</i> are potentially hazardous and do not fulfill the obligation (<i>mitzva</i>) of donning <i>tefillin</i>.
Also, that which it referred to as ‘coated with gold… being the way ‘outside’ thinkers do things’, the Talmud gave a reason for these two religious legal statements, as ‘square’ and ‘black’ are ancient traditions (as if they are dated back to Moses).
So, for now, the <i>Tur</i> has been saved from the question of the <i>Beit Yosaif</i>. However, despite that, the <i>Tur</i> is still internally inconsistent, as he wrote in chapter 32, deciding that that it is only an obligation to make the boxes black, and if they were made of another color, they are still permissible<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">This is all from the casuistic logic of rabbi Landau zt”l. see note 25 which the Tur states that if coated with gold they are disqualified, that is referring to the parchment itself and not to the straps and certainly not to the boxes. Because of the constraint on terminology (whether for ‘fun or profit’- that each letter cast the typesetter, and that brevity is divine) there are adjectival difficulties that are being resolved with casuistic logic. In truth, the Tur could also have meant the boxes as well, as there is no adjectival evidence that the Tur excepted them either.</i>.
The <i>Ran</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Bavli Tractate Megillah 15b. The <i>Ran</i>, rabbi Nissim ben Reuven (1320 – 9th of Shevat, 1376, Hebrew: נסים בן ראובן) of Girona, Catalonia was an influential talmudist and authority on Jewish law. He was one of the last of the great Spanish medieval talmudic scholars. He is also known as the RaN (ר"ן), the Hebrew acronym of his name, as well as the RaNbaR (רנב"ר), the Hebrew acronym of his full name, including his father's name, Reuven. He wrote a commentary on the <i>Rif</i>, rabbi Isaac Al-Fezi of Morocco.</i> commented on that same <i>Mishna</i> in the Bavli tractate Megillah ‘Coating it with gold is an indication of following thinkers outside the rabbinic tradition’, writing that “the reason the writ states (in Ex. 13:9) ‘So that the Torah of God shall be in your mouth’ – from that which is permissible to be in your mouth. Meaning, that the parchment should be written on that which is permissible to eat. The Hebrew letter <i>shin</i> is also an ancient tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Understood here is that the letter <i>shin</i> (ש) is imprinted on the box itself, ergo, the box too needs to be made from a kosher hide.</i>, ergo it requires writing it on that which is permissible to be in one’s mouth”- end quote.
It is apparent from his words that ‘coating with gold’ means the ‘leather hide’ of the box was made from gold, and his words seem to imply that the reason for disqualifying gold was because of ‘that which is permissible in your mouth’. It also appears that <i>Rashi</i> also explained that <i>Mishna</i> in the same way.
This is perplexing to me: Can gold be considered ‘forbidden to be in my mouth’? Until now, we have not excluded items based on ‘oral consumption ‘(‘in your mouth’) based on hides from animals that are ritually impure. With gold, however, what ritual prohibition or permission applies to it?
Truthfully, <i>Rashi</i> in tractate Menachot<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">See page 4b towards the bottom of the page</i> wrote the reasoning behind disqualifying gold, since even that which is used for tying must be of the ‘same species’, hence the requirement for leather hide. As far as a ritually impure animal is concerned, he explained the reason for disqualification as secondary to ‘that which is permitted in your mouth’. In the chapter entitled ‘After the Sentence was Passed’, <i>Rashi</i> explained that it was an ancient tradition (like ‘from Moses on Sinai’) that it is disqualified!
In any case, however, the concept of ‘that which is permissible in your mouth’ does not apply to gold and later on I will provide an explanation. However, in any case, we proved from the words of the <i>Ran</i><sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See top of page 23</i> that ‘coated with gold’ means that the boxes themselves were made from gold. The <i>Mordechai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">See note 72</i> in his Laws Concerning Tefillin, these were the words he wrote: ‘Our master rabbi Shimshon in his <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i> wrote that one should fold over a [blank] parchment over each <i>tefillin</i> parchment, and it is not disqualified for that reason<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tefillin</i> box being covered with anything else.</i>, as we saw here with ‘hung a hide over it’. Here, the hide of the boxes does not see the outside air.
Nevertheless, I found that rabbi Yaakov [Tam]<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">A most ‘famous’ Tosafot, where Rabbeinu [Yaakov] Tam (here called the <i>R’I</i> as the I represents the letter <i>yod</i> which also could mean <i>Ya’akov</i>.) argues with his grandfather, Rashi, as to the order of the parchment scriptures in the <i>tewfillin</i>.

Chananel is often referred to as Rabbeinu Chananel - Hebrew for "our teacher, Chananel Rabbeinu Chananel" was born in 990 in Kairouan (modern Tunisia). R. Chananel studied under his father, Chushiel, head of the Kairouan yeshiva and through correspondence with Hai Gaon. He is closely associated with Nissim Ben Jacob in the capacity of rabbi and Rosh yeshiva of Kairouan. His most famous student is probably Isaac Alfasi.) quoting the tractate Sanhedrin 89a “Any [parchment] not on the outside, exposed to the outer air, is disqualified, as in “Make you first born unique to me” (Ex. 13:1-10)” and “Hear Oh Israel” (Deut. 6:4-9); so too was the custom of Rav Hai Gaon.</i> wrote that the disqualification was not secondary to being prevented from ‘seeing the outside air’, except, specifically to the <i>tefillin</i> box worn on the head. However, the <i>tefillin</i> box worn on the arm it does not apply as there is no ‘outer box covering’ issues for the arm <i>tefillin</i>.
Also, there is no practical difference as to that which is ‘inside’ etc., except for the case of the <i>tefillin</i> box for the head. However, for the arm-<i>tefilla</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Singular for <i>tefillin</i></i>, they are written out on one parchment. Ergo., there is no deductive proof from here to permit that for the head-<i>tefilla</i>.
It would seem that there is neither proof to disqualify or permit
Nevertheless, these examples cannot be considered as ‘beyond the legal bounds’, except for the case of one who would allow five scriptural parchments, as noted in the chapter entitled ‘Those Sentenced to Death by Asphyxiation”, or as was noted in our discussion concerning switching the order of the scriptural parchments<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See note 103</i>.
However, that parchment which was placed as a cover over the <i>tefillin</i> scriptural parchments- was for protective purposes- we do not find a disqualification for this from that we have learned in the chapters entitled ‘After Sentencing’ and ‘Those Who are Damaged’<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See note 61 and 106</i> concerning ‘coated with gold or if the hide of a ritually impure animal was placed upon them, they are disqualified. It is not because they were not ‘exposed to the outside environment’, rather, as the Notator (Rashi) explained: It is an ancient tradition that [the <i>tefillin</i> require the hide of a ritually pure animal, and that applied to the hides of the boxes themselves.
Nevertheless, it is possible to understand this to mean ‘hanging (placing) another hide over it’ as was noted<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See note 71</i> “…one could understand the wording of ‘one hide is hung upon’, as in this case of hanging upon<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">the <i>tefillin</i> boxes with another leather hide</i> as was noted<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">In tractate Berachot 43b discussing general advice given to scholars</i> “A scholar should not go out with patched shoes” and the Talmud clarifies this to mean patches on top of patches.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The following is the continuation of the <i>Mordechai</i> quoted in note 69 (until end quote)</i>
It still appears to me that we cannot act in accordance with the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Again, see note 71</i> , as noted, the Hebrew letter <i>Shin</i> (ש)<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">That extrudes (via mold) from the leather hide on the sides of the head-<i>tefillin</i> box</i>, he concludes, is an ancient tradition. It would seem that this did not apply to the head-<i>tefillin</i> box<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘the upper hide’</i>but, check it out, that which our people do (lit. ‘say’), as I am unsure about that ruling<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Lit’ ‘the <i>halacha</i> is loose in my hands’. The expression is found in the <i>Yerushalmi</i>. Here, in tractate Yevamot, the Talmud is discussing whether a woman betrothed to a <i>kohain</i> can eat of ‘special’ produce (tithes etc.) see note 116</i>, and they already behave in accordance with the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>, and one cannot prevent them from doing that, each one accepts with a clear proof- that is- our master and teacher Shimshon.
In retrospect, the wording of the <i>Mordechai</i> are perplexing, as how was he able to reverse the ruling of the <i>Shimushay Rabbah,</i> using the teaching derived from ‘if coated with gold’? In fact, it is the opposite! From there we derive a proof to act in accordance with the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>, as it explicitly staes there that the use of a hide from a ritually pure animal is permitted!?!
Another difficulty: Why did he bring the <i>braiita</i> form the chapter ‘After Sentencing’ and ‘Those who Have Been Damaged’<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">See note 106</i>? Why did he not bring proof from that orderly Mishna in tractate Megillah, in the chapter entitled ‘One who Reads, Stands<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">See note 122</i>”: “One who caots them with gold, is the way of outside thinkers’?
This can be answered, as he (the <i>Morcechai</i>) wished to state afterwards that the meaning of ‘hung upon it’ meant ‘another hide’. In that Mishna, there is no mention of that, except ‘coating with gold’.
Yet another difficulty: His conclusion<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">That it means the box itself, instead of simply coating the hide with gold.</i>: “It still appears to me that we cannot act in accordance with the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>….as the <i>Shin</i>….did not apply to the head-<i>tefillin</i> box”. This incredible! Clearly, the head-<i>tefillin</i> box of the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>, has the letter <i>‘</i>shin(ש) on it! As it is because of the parchment folded between (and covering over) the scriptural parchments that one makes that <i>Shin</i>. This cannot be! The explanation of the <i>Anshay Shayme</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Actually, it cannot be the<i> Anshay Shayme</i>, written by Rabbi Solomon ben Judah Aaron Kluger <b>(1783–June 9, 1869</b>) born at Komarow, Congress Poland, was chief dayan and preacher of Brody, Galicia. I sincerely doubt that this book was published by the time he was 10, since,in 1793, Rabbi Yekhezk’el Landau died. This part- or perhaps the entire Response(?)- was obviously penned by someone else, likely, one of his sons. I am unclear as who the author was, however, it seems to be an amlgam of quotes from several Rishonim eras rabbi (see the appendix) See note 123 for a photo of the commentary and its translation; they are comments on the Mordechai being discussed at this point.</i> also does not appeal to me.
In addition to that which he stated; ‘It is impossible to act according to the explanation of the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>- this is what he should have stated: It is impossible to act according to the legal decision (‘<i>p’sak</i> -<i>halqachic</i> decision) of the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>!
[This is also the opinion of our master rabbi and teacher, Joseph Saul Nathanson<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph Saul Nathansohn (1808–1875) was a Polish rabbi and posek, and a leading rabbinical authority of his day. In 1857 Nathanson was elected rabbi of Lemberg (Lviv, Ukraine), where he officiated for eighteen years. He was a widely recognized rabbinical authority, and was asked to rule on various contemporary issues; his rulings are still widely cited (for instance he was one of the first to permit the use of machinery in baking Matzah, which created a widespread halachic controversy; Sho'el u-Meshiv", responsa , was his Magnum opus (Lemberg, 1865–79). Nathanson was very wealthy, and was known for his activity as a philanthropist. he left no children after himself. He died at Lemberg March 4, 1875. Rabbi Landau died on 17 Iyar 5553 (1793!!)- see the appendix.</i>, may his memory empower us, who was the head of the Jewish Court in Lvov.]- Editor’s note: As this is from the Bar-Ilan data base, this quote was inserted into the text (likely as a supportive text and out of the context of this translation), as it was impossible (see the footnote!) for Rabbi Yekhezk’el Landau to have quoted it. Also, see footnote 126.
Ergo, it my humble opinion, that which he wrote initially that there is no proof neither to disqualify or permit<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">See note 73 (highlighted in green)</i>- which he stated after what was taught in the chapters entitled ‘After Sentencing’<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">See note 61</i> and ‘Those Who are Damaged’<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">See note 130</i> concerning ‘coated with gold etc.’. If one would postulate that the meaning was coating the [<i>tefillin</i>] boxes with gold, if that is so, then that which he<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The ‘Mordechai’: Mordechai ben Hillel 1250-98 -again, note c15</i> stated there ‘the hides of a <i>kosher</i> animal are permitted for use’, would also mean that the <i>kosher</i> hide was place on top of the boxes.
If that is the case, then we have a good reason to permit, as it was for that reason he did not refute the reasoning with the concept of ‘seeing the outside air’, as they were only specific to the actual boxes. However, should one have coated the hide of the boxes was not mentioned at all, not to disqualify gold or non-kosher hides, nor to permit it with kosher hides, and then made his statement afterwards.
Nevertheless, there is a possibility to examine the wording of ‘another hide…’ , which if so, it does well according to this understanding, as it isa support for the opinion of the <i>Shimushay Rabbahi,</i> as on this, he stated: ‘the hides of ritually pure animals are qualified’, and then he concludes that he cannot agrtee with the <i>Shimushay Rabbah,</i> meaning: he cannot say that the explanation mentioned above that brings a proof to the position of the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i> , that ‘he hangs upon them another hide’.
As if so, how could one make sense of ‘ritually pure animals are qualified’? Does not the letter <i>Shin</i> (ש), which he concludes is an ancient tradition, could not be seen in the hide of the head box?! Rather, it is obvious that he made the actual boxes out of that. . If that is so, there is no need to mention ‘coating with gold or with a hide from a ritually impure animal’ on the boxes.
Ergo, we have no proof at all to disqualify secondary to ‘coating with gold or covering with the hide of an impure animal, or to qualify it with ritually pure animal hide. Since we have no basis to decide, then, logically, all of that is permitted. As that is under the rubric of ‘if that is allowed, everyone will make a fifth compartment’, or ‘it does not see the outside environment, then everyone will make a fifth compartment’, or will flip the inside parchments of the <i>tefillin</i> to the outside<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">This may also mean the order of the <i>parshiyot</i>, as to which are on the ‘outside’. In other words, this is not violating the ancient tradition (lit. “from Moses on Sinai”) to the point where one could then logic from this leniency to do forbidden procedures, like adding a fifth scroll or compartment. He is stating that these issues of coverings of a box that is already kosher, is a non-issue.</i>.
As I would humbly see it, the explanation of the Mordechai’s should be viewed in the context of his [initiaql presumed] conclusion that ‘coating with gold’ meant making the boxes themselves out of gold
Now, from this we can learn that not one of the previous halachic decisors understood ‘coating with gold’ meant making the boxes out of gold, or from a ritually impure animal hide, and so too, is the final conclusion of the Mordechai.
We see in the Tosafot in tractate <i>Menachot</i> 35a in two cases, citation beginning with ‘<i>Ma’avarta</i>’ and the citation beginning with ‘The <i>Shin</i>  of the <i>Tefillin</i>’. Their words are difficult to understand<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘Sealed and closed’</i> and the edition is sparse and corrupted, and without all these great scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘Men of Valour’ a reference to the kind of men Yitro asked Moses to appoint for the judiciary. See Ex. 18:21</i> to understand the authorial intent, how can we take their meaning to either disqualify or permit?
The <i>Maharsha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel Eideles (1555 – 1631) (שמואל אליעזר הלוי איידלס‎‎), was a renowned rabbi and Talmudist famous for his commentary on the Talmud, <i>Chiddushei Halachot</i>. Eidels is also known as Maharsha (מהרש"א, a Hebrew acronym for "Our Teacher, the Rabbi Shmuel Eidels"). The Maharsha was born in Kraków, Poland. From early childhood, the Maharsha's remarkable talents were evident. When he came of marriageable age, the Maharsha was offered many prestigious shidduchim (marriage partners), but he rejected them, asserting that he wanted to devote himself solely to Torah study. He married the daughter of Edel Lifschitz of Posen and the late Moshe Lifschitz, rabbi of Brisk. He then moved to Posen and he established a yeshiva there. For twenty years all the expenses of the yeshiva were assumed by his mother-in-law. In appreciation of her support he adopted her name. After her death, he served as rabbi in the following prominent communities: Chełm, Lublin and Ostroh. Eidels was also active in the Council of Four Lands.</i> and the <i>Morsha”k</i><sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">See note 122, as the acronym is likely Rabbi Shlomo Kluger. All the other choices, I have yet to access their works to verify. They are: Rabbi Shimshin Kinun (1300’s, France), who wrote ספר הכריתות on Talmudic principles; Rabbi Shaul Katzenelebogen-Wahl (1545-1617) who was once the king of Poland for one night (see appendix for details!).</i> edited each one according to his methodology. Anyone examining their writings will see that both were very strained, and the editions of each one of these and their explanations are difficult to understand.
In my research, in my humble opinion, the authorial intent in their commentary on the citation “<i>Shin</i>  of the <i>Tefillin</i>, is obviously one item, as was explained by Rabbi Shlomo Kluger<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">See note 122. Editor’s note: Hebrewbooks.org has an OCR of the 1776 edition of the <i>Noda B’yehuda</i> which contains this acronym. That is 7 years before Rabbi Kluger was born, ergo it is someone else. [with thanks to Rabbi Joshua Flug, YU]</i>, but not according to his explanation, except for what was mentioned beforehand, as they wrote “For one, the concept of ‘not being exposed to the outside air’ does not apply in such an instance, except if another box is placed upon it. In addition, perhaps the outside box is ‘not being exposed to the outside air’ also does not apply except to the head box of the <i>tefillin</i>, and not to the arm box, as was explained in the response literature of the <i>Gaonim</i>. ”.
Their explanation is obfuscating and they did not explain the reasoning why the concept of ‘not seeing the outside air’ applies only to the head box, and not to the arm box.
The <i>Rosh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">See note 50</i> in his chapter on the Laws concerning <i>Tefillin</i>, also wrote to permit this ‘small strap’ that was mentioned above, because, “nevertheless, the <i>teffilin</i> are not disqualified because of ‘not seeing the outside air’ in these instances, except if one ties another box to it….
Also, the concept of ‘not seeing the outside air’applies only to the head box of the <i>tefillin</i>, which is made of four compartments, moving any one from its designated place. However, in the arm box, which has only one compartment, it does not apply, and so it seems from the Responsae of the Gaonim.” – endquote of the <i>Rosh.</i>
We see tha the <i>Rosh</i> understands the reasoning of the <i>Gaonim</i> as that it does not apply  here except in the cxase of the <i>tefillin</i> head-box- since it has four compartments- and one of them has been moved out of place. However, in the case of the <i>tefillin</i> arm-box, which has only one compartment- it does not apply.
So too, the <i>Mordechai</i> wrote<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Note 71, first paragraph</i> that this applies only to the head-box, and reasoned that there is no application of the rule of ‘exposure to the outside’ for the arm-box, which seem to be the same intention as the <i>Rosh</i>! He also added that the concept of ‘switching the parchments from the inside to the outside’ only apllies to the head-box: in each compartment there are different scriptural passages written on the parchment, and when one switches the order, the passages that should be on the inside on then on the outside and vice versa.
However, <i>Tosafot</i>’s<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See note 133 and 134 above</i> explanations were unclear, and they did not explain why these principles applies to the head-box and not the arm-box.
Therefore, in my humble opinion, that all of the above considerations apply to what they wrote in the second location citation of “The <i>Shin</i>“<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">See note 137</i>. Their import: There is a prohibition in the case of the head-box when it ‘cannot see the outside air’, as the <i>Shin</i> of the <i>tefillin</i> (head-box only) is an ancient (‘Mosaic’) tradition, and must be on the outside of the <i>tefillin</i> head-box. It was because of that <i>Shin</i> on the head-box that the scripture referred to “So that the nations of the Earth see name of <i>Hashem</i> upon you…”<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 28:10 …and they shall fear you. The letter <i>Shin</i> is also the first of one the three-letter name of God, ‘<i>Shaddai</i>’.</i>.  Ergo, if one added something to the outside, the <i>Shin</i> would not be seen.
It is for that reason that the Talmud in the chapter ‘Those who are Sentenced to Death by Asphyxiation’<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">See note 106</i> discussing ‘adding a fifth compartment’, even if one creates the compartment on the outside of the <i>Shin</i>. It was on that point that they concluded that anything placed on the <i>Shin</i>, creates the disqualification, as the <i>Shin</i> that one puts on that<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">The ‘extra’ fifth compartment- one tries to add the letter Shin to that as well</i> is of no use, as that is not where the <i>Shin</i> belongs and one will find that the box (the parchments inside) ‘will not see the outside air’, meaning the box side that is supposed to have the <i>Shin</i> (imprinted) on it.
This, is my humble opinion, was the intent of the <i>Tosafot</i>. Despite that they did not articulate it enough, nevertheless, in my mind it is a better explanation that that of the <i>Mahar”sha</i> or the <i>Mahor”shak</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">See notes 138 and 139</i>.
The <i>Beit Yosaif</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">See note 17</i> in chapter 32<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">See note 47</i> stated specifically in the name of Rabbi <i>Shrira Gaon</i> that the requirement of the outer compartment/box to ‘see the [outside] air’, is secondary to the ‘air’ of the <i>Shin</i>, meaning that according to my interpretation of the <i>Tosafot</i>, they conclude that this only applies to the head-box because of the <i>Shin.</i> However, if the<i> Shin</i> can be recognized, there is no prohibition.
Whether their intentions are like mine or not, nevertheless, their intentions<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘their words’</i> are difficult to understand. Ergo, their words are unclear and one may not use them to derive a source to either prohibit or permit.
It appears that the <i>Beit Yosaif</i> in his commentary on the <i>Tur</i> in chapter 32<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. notes 149, 47</i> on “If one coated the boxes gold…”, The <i>Beit Yosaif</i> wrote: “The <i>Mordechai</i> wrote in his Laws Concerning <i>Tefillin</i> that this concerns the leather of the boxes, implying that if the boxes were made from a ritually pure animal and then coated with gold or with a hide from a non kosher (impure) animal, it is fit for use.
This is also evident from the language used by our master concerning the hides of an impure animal, writing ‘or it was made from the hides of an impure animal’ , rather, we need a reason as to why coating it with gold disqualifies (the <i>Tefillin</i>)? Why should gold be any worse than an impure hide?
After that, the <i>Beit Yosaif</i> concludes: “…Indeed, afterwards, the <i>Mordechai</i> reverses himself. Nevertheless, it could be seen that he was trying to say that another hide was hung over it, as he should have stated ‘a hide upon another hide’, which is also apparent from the words of the author of the <i>Terumah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">See note 47, where the text quoted stated ‘Tosafot'. The error is understandable: Baruch ben Isaac, called usually from Worms or from France (Tzarfat) was born approx. in 1140 and deceased in 1212 in Eretz Israel, where he emigrated in 1208 together with his friend Samson ben Abraham of Sens. <b>He is not to be identified with another Baruch ben Isaac (fl. 1200), a Tosafist and codifier who was born at Worms, but lived at Regensburg,</b> (he is sometimes called after the one and sometimes after the other city).<br>A pupil of the great Tosafist Isaac ben Samuel of Dampierre, Baruch wrote Tosafot to several treatises (e.g., Nashim, Nazir, Shabbat, Hullin); nearly all those extant on the order Zevahim are his. A. Epstein believes that the commentary on the Sifra contained in the Munich MS. No. 59 is the work of this Baruch<b>. He is the author also of the legal compendium, Sefer ha-Terumah</b> (Book of the Heave-Offering, Venice, 1523; Zolkiev, 1811), written circa 1202, containing the ordinances concerning slaughtering, permitted and forbidden food, the Sabbath, tefillin, etc. The book is one of the most important German codes, and was highly valued by contemporaries and successors. It is noteworthy by reason of the author's attempt to facilitate its use by presenting a synopsis of its contents, the first attempt at making a practical ritual codex in Germany.</i>, as well as the <i>Rambam, may their memories empower us,</i> perhaps our master (the <i>Tur</i>) may have intended this but it is not specified in his words.”- end quote of the <i>Beit Yosaif</i>.
In my mind, this is unclear:That which I wrote of the <i>Rambam’s</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">See note 25, Laws Concerning Tefillin 3:15. One could infer as well that it meant covering the boxes with gold or impure hide disqualified, rather than the actual boxes made from gold or impure leather.</i> opinion, I have explained his words to the opposite effect! That which I wrote as the conclusion of the <i>Mordechai’s</i><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Again, a reference to note 71 and comments on pages 15-16, concerning this parsing of the text.</i> opinion- meaning- a hide upon another hide, I already explained what the <i>Mordechai</i> concluded!
It also appears to me that one cannot explain it according to the <i>Shimushay Rabbah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">See page 27, note 114, again, the source being note 71.</i> which refutes the understanding of ‘a hide upon another hide’, that it means the actual hide itself. If that is so, then it is the opposite of the <i>Mordechai’s</i> conclusion?!
Nonetheless, I already explained that the <i>Mordechai’s</i> conclusion was that the <i>braitta</i> was speaking about the hide of the actual boxes. However, placing a hide on top of another hide was not discussed- either to disqualify or permit.
In the mind of the <i>Tur</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">See note 19</i> if we have come to say that the <i>Tur</i> is exacting in his terms and differentiates between ‘gold’ and ‘hides of an impure animal’, I might have considered that he meant that if the coating was from disqualified material, would not disqualify, and is considered ‘null’ in respect to <i>tefillin</i>. That is in spite of the fact that the opposite applies to laws of ritual impurity, as the coating is considered essential, whether to permit or restrict, as was noted at the end of tractate <i>Khagiga</i> (26a-27a),-
As that it is akin to the Shew-Table and Altars of the Temple, that all the utensils of the Shew-Table and the Altar were all coated above their surfaces.  So too the Shew-Table and the <i>Dulphaki</i><sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">See Appendix for a depiction.</i> that was mention there (tractate <i>Khagiga</i>), that there was no place left on the coating to place the cups or pieces. If so, its entire use was above the coated surface that it is akin to the Shew-Table and Altars of the Temple, that all the utensils of the Shew-Table and the Altar were all coated above their surfaces. So too the Shew-Table and the <i>Dulphaki</i> that was mention there (tractate <i>Khagiga</i>), that there was no place left on the coating to place the cups or pieces. If so, its entire use was above the coated surface, thereby disqualifying the Table in the Tabernacle’s Holy.
In the case of <i>Tefillin</i>, the opposite applies. The <i>tefillin</i>’s main purpose is their use in a <i>mitzva</i> as <i>tefillin</i>. However, gold is something important and is not nullified- as in the reasoning of <i>Resh Lakish</i><sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">See note 162. Shim‘on ben Lakish (Shim‘on bar Lakish or bar Lakisha), better known by his nickname Reish Lakish, was asecond generation ‘Palstenian’ amora who lived in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina in the third century. He was reputedly born in Bosra, east of the Jordan River, around 200 CE, but lived most of his life in Sepphoris. Nothing is known of his ancestry except his father's name.<br>He is something of an anomaly among the giants of Torah study as he was supposed to have been in his early youth a bandit and a gladiator. Reish Lakish was regarded as one of the most prominent amoraim of the second generation, the other being his brother-in-law and halakhic opponent, Johanan bar Nappaha. Rabbi Yochanan promised Reish Lakish his sister's hand in marriage if the latter would rejoin the yeshiva and begin his studies anew (Baba Metzia 84a). R. Yochanan might be called a teacher of Reish Lakish (Brachot 31a); but the latter, through his extraordinary talent and his exhaustless diligence, soon attained so complete a knowledge of the Law that he stood on an equal footing with R. Yochanan. They are designated as "the two great authorities" (Yer. Berakhot 12c). While R. Yochanan was still in Sepphoris, teaching at the same time as Hanina, Reish Lakish stood on an equality with him and enjoyed equal rights as a member of the yeshiva and council (Yer. Sanhedrin 18c; Yer. Niddah ii. 50b).</i> their who attempted to differentiate between vessels made of cheap <i>akhselag</i><sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">‘Generic’ wood- that found with a forrester (Ashkelag)</i> wood or vessels made of expensive <i>masmi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Polished or Coral Wood</i> wood. That the ritual law (<i>halacha</i>) is according to Rabbi Yokhanan<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Johanan bar Nappaha</b> (Hebrew: יוחנן בר נפחא‎‎ <b>Yoḥanan bar Nafḥa</b>) (also known as <b>Johanan bar Nafcha</b>, "Johanan son [of the] blacksmith") (lived 180–279 CE)[1] was a rabbi in the early era of the Talmud. He was born in Sepphoris in the Roman-ruled Galilee (then part of Syria Palaestina province). His father, a blacksmith, died prior to his birth, and his mother died soon after; he was raised by his grandfather in Sepphoris</i>, that there is no differentiation, as noted there, that the Shew-Table is completely coated, and cannot be see. Also, all use of it is on top of the coating, and hence, the Table is nullified, even if it is made of polished <i>mamsi</i> wood.
However, here, the coating is above. Rather, since the <i>Tefillin</i> are the essential, the coating is nullified, meaning –‘hide against/upon a hide’- meaning the hide of an impure animal is nullified in the presence of the hide of a ritually pure animal. However, gold cannot be nullified, as it carries importance.
All this could be potentially the intent of the <i>Tur</i>. I can find support for this, differentiating between ‘gold’ and ‘non-ritually pure animal hide’ from the <i>braitta</i>, as it is difficult: Why did the <i>braiita</i> specify both ‘gold’ and ‘non-ritually pure animal hide’, as it could have simply lumped them together and hidden the term ‘coat [with gold]’under the rubric of ‘things which disqualify, and hides from ritually pure animal are permitted, even if they were not made for a specific intention. Why not just include it anything that is not of the ‘hide of a ritually pure animal’?!
Just as was noted regarding the <i>tefillin</i> straps in the chapter entitled ‘One Who Takes the Handful [for the meal sacrifice]’<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">See note 30</i> on p35a: “The tefillin must be tied with straps of the same [material as the tefillin themselves…”, it is obvious that as the Talmud specified those two, they are separate issues. Gold is disqualified even for coating, as its importance cannot be ignored<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Since the religious obligation is hide from an animal one may eat, using gold in its place cannot be ignored.</i>. ‘Non-ritually pure animal hide’ only disqualifies when used to make the actual boxes.
This was how it appeared to me in my humble opinion, rather, that I defer my opinion in the face of the opinion of the <i>Rosh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">See note 48</i> may his memory empower me, who wrote coating with gold is akin to the ‘non-ritually pure animal hide’. If that is so, then the two are similar when applying ritual law.
It was good that Rabbi Karo, in his <i>Beit Yosaif</i> wrote that the <i>Tur</i> was ‘imprecise’<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Review page 39- where this argument begins.</i>. As certainly, the <i>Tur</i> would not plainly disagree with the Rosh<i>.</i> However, in this instance, one may presuppose it it not as according to the <i>Beit Yosaif</i>’s opinion. As after he states that he was ‘imprecise’, I would say that he (the <i>Beit Yosaif!!</i>) was unclear in the initial wording of ‘coating the boxes with gold’- imprecise- rather, that his intent was that the <i>tefillin</i> were coated with gold, meaning, the actual boxes themselves were made of gold, as I have already shown that this was the <i>Rosh</i>’s intent as well. Ergo, the opinions of the <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> coincide.
Up until now, we have discussed the opinions of our <i>halachic</i> precedents. Now, let us understand the Talmudic terms concerning ‘coated with gold’.
In tractate Shabbat 28b<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">See note 32 for more complete details</i>:” ….And, if so, that which Rav Yosef taught: ‘Only the hide of a kosher animal was suitable for heavenly service’, for what halakha is that relevant, as it is clearly not relevant to the Tabernacle? The Gemara replies: This halakha was stated with regard to phylacteries, which may be prepared only from the hide of a kosher animal….Did not <i>Abayay</i> state: The <i>Shin</i> of <i>tefillin</i> is an ancient custom?....” <i>Rashi</i> commented: “Since a letter from God’s name is written on it, it should be made from that which is ‘permissible to your mouth’…” .
This presents a difficulty: That which we require [the material of the <i>tefillin</i>] to be ‘permissible to your mouth’, as because there is nothing else permitted, only that which comes from a ritually pure animal. How much spinning did <i>Rashi</i> have to do in tractate Menachot 42 that coating with gold disqualifies? <i>Rashi</i> explained that the actual boxes were made from gold, and his reasoning was that even the straps had to be from the same species<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, a ritually pure animal hide, that which is ‘permissible to your mouth’. The straps and the boxes are to be made of the same material.</i>.
In the chapter entitled “After the Sentence was Passed”<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">See note 61 the blue colored notes are Rashi’s comments</i>, <i>Rashi</i> explained that it was an ancient tradition, and were it not for the verse (Ex 13:9) which is the source for that which is ‘permissible to your mouth’, we would not have known the requirement of the ritually pure animal hide. Perhaps it could be made from gold or other species; that is why Rabbi Yosaif taught us that it require that specific hide. Despite the fact that <i>Rashi</i> explained that it is an ancient tradition, nevertheless, it was not taught explicitly that it is an ancient (‘Mosaic’) tradition, as there was the question raised on Rabbi Yosaif<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">See note 33. However, see note for more relevant expansion to include Rav Yosaif’s question.</i>. Look and understand well the <i>Tosafot</i> loc. cit. “<i>Tefillin</i>”. <sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Tractate Shabbat 28b see also note 86 also see the next note</i>
It would be understandable at the outset when it stated ‘<i>tefillin</i>’, and then asked about the explicit verse (Ex 13:9) “The words of <i>Hashem</i> in your mouth’, on would not have been able to exclude that which is not made from hide, as there is a Mishna in tractate “Hands” 4:5 that states: “In general, an object cannot convey ritual impurity to the hands until it is written with the Assyrian ink (and script) and on hide-parchment”.
We also learned in a Mishna in tractate Megilla (1:8) “There is no difference between <i>sefarim</i> [books of the Tanach written in holiness, on parchment, and used for personal or public study, or for reading aloud in public. Sometimes the intent is specifically Torah scrolls] and tefillin…”<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">…..and mezuzot except that sefarim may be written in any language, while tefillin and mezuzot may only be written in ashurit [in the Hebrew language using a particular set of glyphs]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Even concerning sefarim, they only permitted them to be written in Greek”</i> If that is so, then we learned in a Mishna that <i>Tefillin</i> cannot be written on anything but hide. One cannot deduce, as Rav Yosaif that it means only ritually pure.
It was a good question that the scriptural basis of ‘that which is permitted in your mouth’, to employ it to establish the use of hides, why should the question be based on the concept of the <i>Shin</i>? Once we know ‘that which is permitted in your mouth’, now Rav Yosaif comes to teach us the requirement of hides? Rather, it is obvious that this is also part of a long Mishna in the chapter entitled “One Who Reads, Stands”One who coats [one’s <i>tefillin</i>] with gold…” If that is so, one perforce would deduce that it means that the actual [hide] boxes were coated from above with gold.
If that is so, then perhaps the disqualification is secondary to the box ‘not seeing the outside air’, despite the fact that the the actual box is permitted (‘kosher’)? If one would posit: if that is so, that which stated ‘coated with gold’ meant on top of hide(s) from a ritually pure animal , as I questioned above concerning the <i>Rosh</i>, this cannot be as we take it for granted that when one coated [the boxes] with the ‘hide(s) from a ritually pure animal’ has a Mishnaic source; The other case is [only] a <i>braitta</i>! For a <i>braitta</i>it is unworthy to question the [Masoretic] traditional law as received by Rav Yosaif, employing the term <i>‘tenina’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">See previous note</i>, as Rav yosaif also brought a <i>braitta</i>  as a support! Then it must be that ‘coated with gold’ means that the actual box was made of gold.
Yet, it is still difficult: On its basis, from where does the Talmud come to question Rav Yosaif? Perhaps this ‘coating with gold’ means ‘coating with gold’ on top of the hide of the boxes? Rather, the Talmud reasons that there is no reason to disqualify for such a case. This, in my mind, there is no doubt that if the hide boxes were coated with anything one wanted, with the exception of the head-box -if the <i>Shin</i> does not protrude- however, if they do protrude, it would be permissible (‘kosher’).
Now that we have supposed that even according to him<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yosaif</i>, the proof brought that ‘coating with gold and hanging upon it the hide of a ritually impure animal’, Applies to the boxes, like the halachic decision of the <i>Shukhan Aruch</i> in (<i>O”Kh</i>) 32:48<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">See the following note for the source. The point here is that it must mean ‘gold that stands by itself, and likely not on the box, but the box itself is made of gold. Gold being considered an ‘important thing’ has ‘substance’ – stands alone. This argument will then be applied to the blackening dyes of the tefillin.</i>, meaning in a coating that stands on its own and not relying on the box.
However, that the blackening that we apply to the <i>tefillin</i>, this applies to the hide and is secondary to it, and the concept of ‘the box does not see the outside air’ doesn’t apply to it. If we come to disqualifying with this, what parameters could we give to the dyes that blacken the boxes? If there is any ‘substance tro it, it would disqualify! This thinking cannot be acceptable, nor did any of our forbearers even consider this!
Since the hides of the boxes are also required to be black-and to some of the previous <i>halachic</i> authorities it is an ancient (‘Mosaic’) tradition- and to my understanding, also the opinion of the Jerusalem Talmud, in the chapter entitled ‘One Who Reads Must Stand’<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">See note 178</i>, is the same, as I stated above. Nonetheless, to the rest of the <i>halachic</i> authorities, there is a <i>mitzva</i> to do so
Additionally, that which is down with the black dye coloring, that it should be a deeper black or prettier, all goes under the rubric of making that dye, and there is no concern for any ‘addition’ that would make it fall under the prohibition of ‘You shall neither add (nor subtract from sopecified commandments)’ nor does it fall under the prohibition of ‘the box does not see the outside air’.
This can be understood as an a priori argument from the <i>techaylet</i> of <i>tzitzit</i><sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Techailet is the special blue dye (made from the tropical sea snail murex trunculus) for the wool fringe of the tzitzit which is a biblical requirement (Num. 15:38) of placing fringes on any four-cornered garment, in this case of linen, with one wool fringe.</i>, which the Torah was very specific about and quite stringent in its method of production<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">See Tractate Menachot 42b-43b</i>. Despite that one places various chemicals into the blood of the <i>khilazon</i> (<i>Murex</i> snail) as explained in tractate Menachot 42b<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">See the appendix</i>. The Tosafot wrote, loc. cit. ‘Ingredients (chemicals)’ were indeed perplexed by this and wrote that perhaps those chemicals could be [part of what is] called ‘<i>techaylet</i>’- the blue-ish dye.
To me it would seem, that the blood of this <i>khilazon</i> does not hold extraordinarily fast to the wool, except if one adds these chemicals to it, if so, then those chemicals are part of this particular color. So it was explained in the <i>Rambam</i>’s Laws Concerning <i>Tzitzit</i> 2:2<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">See appendix for the full text</i> : “The blood is placed in a pot together with herbs - e.g., chamomile - as is the dyers' practice.” [end quote of the <i>Rambam</i>], and this references the reasoning for putting in those chemicals ‘as is the dyer’s practice’, presumably, this was the intent of the Torah.
I can also apply this to the black coloring of <i>tefillin</i>. All that is added to increase the blackness belongs to this and all is subsumed under the rubric of ‘black coloring’.  I would also say the same applies to ‘coating it with gold’- even if one supposes that it means coating on top of the hide of the boxes- despite that, I would say specifically when they  coat it with gold, as this coating is an entity within itself, as one place a gold foil upon them. However, if one made the hide of the boxes gold colored, the way they color silver objects to make them look like gold, it would not disqualify to those who hold that the boxes do not necessarily have to be black, as this is a beautification that is subsumed to the purpose of the <i>tefillin</i> boxes.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Likely meaning that this would be masking one’s mitzvot beautiful (‘הידור מצוה’)</i>
It is a well-known fact that since the hides of the boxes have to be hard enough to be made into a cube, it does not absorb the black color as well if the dye that colors it is weak and thin, as the dye must have some ‘substance’ to it so that it absorbs well into the hide.
I have also seen that from time to time, they (? the dye or the boxes) harden by themselves, as the boxes, according to <i>halacha</i>,  do not need to be black. If that it so, what authority is there to blacken them? The dried dye is something that would be a partition, as we learned in [Babylonian] tractate <i>Shabbat</i> 120b? If that is so, then ‘the box does not see the outside air’- the dried blackening dye is a partition between the box and the outside air!?
It is also difficult pertaining to what the <i>Magen Avraham</i><sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham Abele Gombiner (c. 1635 – 5 October 1682), known as the Magen Avraham, born in Gąbin (Gombin), Poland, was a rabbi, Talmudist and a leading religious authority in the Jewish community of Kalish, Poland during the seventeenth century. His full name is Avraham Abele ben Chaim HaLevi from the town of Gombin. There are texts that list his family name as Kalisch after the city of his residence.[1] After his parents were killed in the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, he moved to live and study with his relative in Leszno, Jacob Isaac Gombiner.<br>He is known to scholars of Judaism for his Magen Avraham commentary on the Orach Chayim section of Rabbi Joseph Karo's Shulchan Aruch, which he began writing in 1665 and finished in 1671. His brother Yehudah traveled in 1673 to Amsterdam to print the work, but did not have the needed funds, and died on the journey. It was not published until 1692 by Shabbethai Bass in Dyhernfurth after Rabbi Gombiner’s death. His son Chaim wrote in the preface to the work that his father was frequently sick and suffered pain and discomfort.</i> wrote on (O”H) 33:7 concerning <i>tefillin</i> straps that were blackened by a non-Jew: If a Jew then reapplied the dye with the intent to fulfill that specific <i>mitzva</i>, then they are permitted for use. This was stated in tractate Gittin 20b: If one wrote the ‘Name’ of God and did not sanctify it, then one should pass the quill over it and sanctify it. Even according to the majority of Talmudic rabbis there is no argument, rather, it appears checkered/spotted; if that were not so, it would be permitted. If that is so, then all would permit it! See the <i>Evehn Haezer</i> chapter 131:4”-[end quote of the <i>Magen Avraham</i>].
In the case of that which hardens occasionally, how does a repeat blackening change things?  The initial dyeing on the straps ‘blocks’ the next coating and forms a partition between it and the strap?
Also, the concept of occasionally hardening is seen in the words of the <i>Magen Avraham</i> mentioned above, as he wrote that even according to the majority of the Talmudic rabbis, it was only because it would appear spotted etc., and this is only according to Rabbi Akha’s opinion there in tractate <i>Gittin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">See note 201 for fuller text. Essentially, Rabbi Akha is stating that going over the letters would not be appropriate for scriptural passages, which should be beautifully conceived and written. However, a Get is not scripture, and that’s why it can be done there.</i> However, according to the view of Rabbi <i>Khisda</i> there<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">See note 190 for fuller text. Also see the text in note 195</i>, that a Jewish Divorce document (‘<i>Get</i>’) not written for a specific person, then is gone over with a reed pen with the intent for a specific person, depends on the argument between Rabbi Yehuda and the majority of rabbis etc. According to Rav <i>Khisa</i>, the reason is not because of it appearing spotted<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">See note 202, the reason is that the rabbis transferred the ownership of the Get to the husband, so it is as if he wrote it for his wife. The act of going over it again is the husband’s way of acquiring the Get.</i>. Since we establish he <i>halachic</i> ruling in the <i>Shulkhan Aruch Evehn HaEzer</i> according to Rabbi <i>Khisda’s</i> opinion, if that is so, then I find the explanation of the <i>Magen Avraham</i> bewildering- end quote of my esteemed questioner<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">See note 14, we do not have the full text of the question. Also, the acronym מע"ל is confusing here, that earlier it meant ‘time to time’ (occasionally) and now it refers to ‘his eminence’.</i>.
It has been several years that I have been writing a journal on my [copy of the] <i>Magen Avraham</i>, and look at <i>Evehn HaEzer</i> 131<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">A cursory search at bothe the Bar Ilan database and Hebrewbooks.org did not reveal any commentary of Rabbi Gombiner (see note 192) on this section of the Shulkhan Aruch.

There I wrote: “He brought a proof to refute<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">The actual quote of the Magen Avraham is on page 46 (not a footnote).</i>. However, according to my humble opinion, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> did not lose sight of what Rav Khisda said in tractate <i>Gittin</i>, that it is disqualified. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> did not need to tell us that according to Rav <i>Akhai</i>, it was permissible even to the majority of the rabbis at that time. Apparently, according to the opinion of <i>Rabbeinu Khanan’el</i>, who is the ‘there are those who state’<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">See note 194. This gets more interesting, as I am unable to find a Rabbeinu Khana’el commentary on tractate Gittin.</i> quoted in the <i>Evehn HaEzer</i>, that this is undecided legally- whether the decision is according to <i>Rav Khisda</i> or <i>Rav Akhai.</i> Since <i>tefillin</i> that was blackened by a non-Jew, without any other qualifications, would clearly be disqualified, even if it was just the straps, it is still undecided, as was explained in the <i>Beit Yosaif</i> just recently discussed<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Actually, this refers internally to the Magen Avraham</i>.
Ergo, if a Jew then comes and blackens it again, that would be a case of double indecision (‘doubt’)<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">See the exceelent review by Rabbi Moshe Koppel שליט"א “Resolving Uncertainty: A Unified Overview of Rabbinic Methods” koppel@netvision.net.il, where he writes:“Roughly, if a particular prohibition holds only if both conditions A and B hold, and in fact, both A and B are in doubt, then we can assume the prohibition does not hold.” There is a doubt if it definitively needs to be black and a doubt about applying a second coating.</i>. In my humble opinion, that resolves the understanding of the <i>Magen Avraham</i>. Nonetheless, practically, my inclination is to be stricter, specifically to that of the <i>Rambam</i> who was the first opinion quotes there in the <i>Evehn HaEzer,</i> that obviously the <i>halacha</i> is as per Rav Akhai”- this is the end-quote from my journal on the <i>Magen Avraham</i>.
That which he wanted to explain as the position of the rabbinic majority in the passage in tractate Gittin 20a, concerning ‘moving a quill over the letter with specific intent (to write God’s name) is not the optimal way to write God’s name’ because the ink below it is a formed separation (to the parchment) to the ink from the quill above it, as the name of God is not directly written on to the parchment. He also mentions this reasoning in regards to writing a <i>Get</i> that the ink is a barrier, as the ink from the quill above does not reach the paper. Despite the fact that we do not require a <i>Get</i>  to be written on parchment<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘written as a book’- meaning- as a scroll on parchment.</i>, and can be written on anything substantive, as my esteemed questioners had mentioned at length.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Again, here we are getting fragments of the extended question which was presented in its briefest fashion at the beginning, obviously omitting these paragraphs.</i>
I would say to his reasoning: Why should Rabbi Yehuda and the majority of the rabbis of that time disagree about God’s name not written specifically?<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">See note 193</i> Even if one wrote God’s name intentionally and then passed the quill over it to make the ink clearer, would also be disqualified according to the majority of the rabbis- as the underlying ink is not seen- as it is covered by the upper ink applied and that second coat of ink isn’t even on the parchment!?
If my esteemed interlocutor would say: ‘Certainly that would be disqualified’, as he brought the case of writing (the name of God on a parchment) without specification in its usual manner of teaching those laws, then why should one pass a quill over it? Not only that, but by bringing up ‘not specified’ it comes as a support to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">That it would be ok to go over it with a quill (note 193)</i>. However, according the the rabbinic majority, even if it was written specifically, it is disqualified.
I would say that, if so, he would disqualify most Torah scrolls, <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">The Oral Torah has interpreted Deuteronomy 6:9 and 11:20 as actually placing scrolls with these sections on one’s doorposts. These are called mezuzot.</i>! As in now routinely done in many cases, when the ink of those parchments is drying up because of age (or environment), one takes it to a scribe who goes over it with a quill to make it look ‘good as new’. This religious law is explicit in the <i>Shulkhan Aruch</i>, <i>Orakh Khayim</i> 32:26: “If the letters of the words were erased slightly, if their impression is still recognizable a little bit such that a child…, it's permitted to pass over it with a quill to improve the writing and renew it, and this is not considered [written] out of order.”
Look also at the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 32:39, and this law is explained in the <i>Terumat HaDeshen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Israel Isserlin (ישראל איסרלן; Israel Isserlein ben Petachia; 1390 in Maribor, Duchy of Styria – 1460 in Wiener Neustadt, Lower Austria) was a Talmudist, and Halakhist, best known for his Terumat HaDeshen, which served as one source for HaMapah, the component of the Shulkhan Arukh by Moses Isserles. He is also known as Israel of Neustadt, Israel of Marpurk, Maharai <br>Terumat HaDeshen is written as 354 responsa. Note that Rabbi Shabbatai ha-Kohen comments in his famous commentary on Shulchan Aruch, the Shach, on Yoreh De'ah 196:20, that there is a tradition that Rabbi Isserlein was not answering questions posed to him in the Terumat HaDeshen, rather he actually wrote the questions and answers himself. Therefore, Shach concludes, in contrast with other responsa, the parameters of the questions posed in the Terumat HaDeshen are themselves binding when alluded to in the answer. However, with the printing of the work Leket Yosher of Joseph (Joselein) ben Moses in 1903, it became apparent that the responsa were in fact based on actual questions, as the individuals who asked the questions are clearly identified there.<br>The work is named for the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem of removing a part of the previous day's ashes from the furnace – 354 is the numerical value of Deshen (Hebrew: דשן). Terumat HaDeshen serves as an important source of the practices of the Ashkenazi Jews. The work was therefore used by Moses Isserles as one basis for HaMapah – the component of the Shulkhan Arukh which specifies divergences between Sephardi and Ashkenazi practice.</i> and the Responsa of the <i>MaHaRil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin (Hebrew: יעקב בן משה מולין‎‎) (c. 1365 – September 14, 1427) was a Talmudist and posek (authority on Jewish law) best known for his codification of the customs (minhagim) of the German Jews. He is also known as Maharil - the Hebrew acronym for "Our Teacher, the Rabbi, Yaakov Levi" - as well as Mahari Segal or Mahari Moelin. Maharil's Minhagim was a source of law for Moses Isserles’ component of the Shulkhan Arukh Maharil's best known work is Minhagei Maharil, also known as Sefer ha-Maharil or simply the Minhagim. It contains a detailed description of religious observances and rites, at home and in the synagogue, and thus provides an authoritative outline of the minhagim of the German Jews, Another pupil of Moelin, Eleazer b. Jacob, collected some of Moelin's responsa; these were published in Venice in 1549. Many more of Moelin's responsa remained in manuscript. These were collected and edited by Rabbi Yitzhak Satz, and, published in 1977 under the title SHuT Maharil heChadashot</i>.
This is also proved from the <i>Tur</i><sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">See note 19</i> in <i>Yoreh Day’ah</i> 276: “If the letters of the name(s) of God appear inseparable, he may move the ink away, and there is no need afterwards to go over it with a quill to re-sanctify it…” Similar language is used in the Responsa of the <i>Rosh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">See note 46</i> 3:11 and the terms used come to teach us that one does not have to go over it with a quill, however, if one desires to do so, it is permissible.
According to the terms of my esteemed interlocutor, one who goes over the script with a quill completely ruins and disqualifies! It is then rather obvious that this is not so, and since one does so in order to make the script nicer, it does not replace the ink underneath it, as the new ink is subservient to the ink underneath it, allowing the underlying ink to remain viable for ritual use. Ergo, this would even be permitted when writing the scriptural passages for <i>tefillin</i>, as it would not be ‘writing it out of order’. Anything done to beautify it not considered a separation. However, it is not my intention to prolong this part of the discussion. In any case, my esteemed interlocutor sensed the question, according to his line of reasoning, of how could one permit the blackening of the <i>tefillin</i> boxes at all, as one could state that it does not permit the boxes to ‘see the outside air’? Rather, it is obvious that this is not considered a partition.
That which my esteemed interlocutor wrote that this applies specifically to one who blackens with ink dyes, as this is only the application of a black color which has little substance, is akin to what was stated in the Talmud, tractate Bava Kamma, in the chapter entitled ‘One who Steals’ page 101a, concerning the topic of
Whether dyeing enhances the value of wool. With all due respect, it applies to its appearance, as the dyes to not affect the valuation of the wool, it is the wool’s appearance. We see a similar issue noted in in <i>Yoreh Day’ah</i> 221:8<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">See note 224</i>, when one gives a tableau to asn artist to draw upon it, there it also the case where the tablet and the dyes were provided by the owner/buyer’s expenses, it is just that the artist simply draws. However, to him- it is impossible that the dye has no substance.
Additionally, what is the relationship of the ink to its colour? Dye must have substance<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘we do not find any dye that does not have substance)</i>, but colour does not have ‘substance’, as was noted in <i>Yoreh Day’ah</i> 198:21<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">See note 228</i> in the <i>Sha”ch</i><sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen (Hebrew: שבתי כהן‎‎; 1621–1662) was a noted 17th century talmudist and halakhist. He became known as the Shakh, (Hebrew: ש"ך‎‎), which is an abbreviation of his most important work, Siftei Kohen (Hebrew: שפתי כהן‎‎) (literally Lips of the Priest), and his rulings were considered authoritative by later halakhists In Cracow in 1646, he published his magnum opus, the Siftei Kohen (Hebrew: שפתי כהן‎‎) or the Shakh, (Hebrew: ש"ך‎‎) a commentary on the Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah. This work was approved by the greatest Polish and Lithuanian scholars and since 1674 has been published in most editions of the Yoreh De'ah</i> You should know that it is not found as part of the ink, as it has no ‘substance’, since if it were not so, how are we to understand the the query posed in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat 120b-<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">See note 193- especially in red outine</i> ‘derive that it is an interposition in any case due to the ink (on his skin)’? Perhaps, this was in context of God’s name written on one’s skin, and not just the ‘color’ black- and it would have no substance! Rather, it is obvious that writing must have some substance to it.
Despite that<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">That the dye has substance to it, and therefore covers the boxes of the tefillin</i>, we still blacken the hides of the tefillin boxes, and it is not disqualified because it ‘cannot see the outside environment’. Nor is it disqualified for adding something to the <i>mitzva</i>, because this was done to beautify the boxes. That which my esteemed interlocutor wrote, then what is the difference between that and a woman finishing her ritual menstrual cycle, who immerses herself with her clothing on- if they are fastened, they are a partition (to the water of the <i>mikva</i>) despite being there to beautify!? I am perplexed!! Do her clothes always stay on her? Does she not take them off and put them on? How could one think they are part of her body?<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Landau is hammering home the comparison to the ‘substantive’ dye vs insubstantive ‘color’ – and despite the substantivenes ofr the dye, it may be used to cover tefillin, as it is used to beautify. Using the logic ad absurdium, then anything that beautifies should be permitted as a non-substance.</i>
From this, we can deflect that which was asked from tractate Pesachim 57a at the end of the chapter entitled ‘In places in Which the Custom Were…’, concerning the high priest Yissachar, the ‘man’ from the village Sunrise (<i>Barka’i</i>) <sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">See note 238 and the appendix for the complete reference.</i>. It should be noted that what her did was not to beautify, but to protect his hands from getting dirty. Perhaps, this can be employed to answer that which my esteemd interlocutor questioned  as to why <i>Rash’I</i><sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">See note 239</i> did not use the reason of ‘adding to a <i>mitzva</i> of the specified amount of priestly uniforms?Since it was not done to beautify, even though it was technically ‘clothing’ <sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">just a silk wrap around his hands</i>, perhaprs not even having the dimensions of three by three<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">The required minimum to be considered ‘clothing’ in the sense that- especially in the case of the Temple environs- to be succeptible to ritual impurity, a severe violation.</i>, perhaps when he covered his hand, it was not even the entire hand? See tractate <i>Zevakhim</i> 19- and this is not the lace to discuss this.
Against all this, the dye that is placed on the <i>tefillin</i> boxes does no ‘harm’<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">By causing the tefillin to be disqualified for use</i> despite having ‘substance’. Besides, limits could one place on this? If the dye is thin, then if it is a little thicker, one would disqualify; if that is the case, then one reduces this ritual legal issue to a matter of measurements, in which case, reducing the issue to futility<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘there will be no end ‘ to the squabbling over the limits to regard what is forbidden and what is permissible.</i>. Ergo, this is a simple matter, that anything that blackens or improves blackening can be included in that which beautifies the <i>tefillin</i>.
That which he<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yitzkhaq HaKohain of Bonn, the ‘esteemed interlocutor’ from the first paragrapgh….</i> wrote concerning the erasure of the letter <i>Shin</i> of God’s name<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">The shin is embossed on the sides of the head box of the tefillin See the appendix</i>, I am perplexed! If one accepts that line of reasoning, then what if he holds that the letters <i>Daled</i> and <i>Yod</i> in the knots of the straps of the head and arm <i>tefillin</i> respectively, which complete God’s name- as there are the letters <i>Shin, Daled, Yod</i> -if so, ask yourself how is it that at times one can undo those knots as necessary, perhaps one is then erasing God’s name?! “According to our master rabbi Eliyahu<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">One of the few English Tosafists, who perished at Clifford’s Tower during the crusades, 8 Nissan 1146. This is a quote from Tosafot, see note 247</i>, there is a daily requirement to undo those knots and renew them”, go examine that which was explained in the Tosafot tractate Menachot 35b loc. cit. ‘From the Time’.
Rather, it must be, that since these letters are not ‘together’: The <i>Shin</i> is on the box, the <i>daled</i> is in the knot of the straps of the head <i>tefillin</i> and the <i>yod</i> in the straps of the arm <i>tefiilin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Again, the letter shin, daled, yod spell out one of the names of God: Shaddai.</i>, there is no prohibition of ‘erasing God’s name’.<i></i>
If my esteemed interlocutor would say: The <i>daled</i> and the <i>yod</i> do not possess the ‘sanctity’ God’s name- just the <i>shin</i>- as per the opinion of the <i>Tosafot</i> on that same page in tractate Menachot, loc. cit. ‘These are the <i>Tefillin</i>’. If that is so, then there is no letter other than the <i>shin</i>- it is obvious that there is no prohibition of ‘erasing God’s name’, as was explained in <i>Yoreh Day’ah</i> 276:10: “[erasing] <i>shad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, the appellation of God as Shaddai (lit.

See the appendix</i> from the word <i>Shaddai</i> or <i>tzav</i> from the word <i>Tzva’ot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">AS in the previous note, this appellation means ‘the Lord of Hosts’, in Hebrew: Tzva’ot. It is usually spelled with five letters, the first two being tzaddi (צ) and bet (ב).</i>, may be erased”.
That which he brought from the end of the tractate <i>khagiga</i><sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">See note 160</i>, that the vessel’s ritual use is negated secondary to its coating’, I have already written that this source is not a proof for his positions. Therre, the coating is for ritual use, as the coating is essential to its (ritual)  function. Here, however, the coating is just for beautification, as there is no ritual use for this coating.
The same applies to the Shew-Bread Table and the Altars in the Unique Temple, the gold coating was essential to their ritual purposes. Since that is so, despite the fact that in the written Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘The merciful one’ meaning, it is God who ‘wrote’ our Torah via Moshe, our master teacher A”H</i> it states (Ex. 25:23) ‘Tree(s)’, its coating is not subsumed by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning: Despite the Torah writing that the Table was to be made of wood (‘tree’) and that one could surmise that its ritual function was to ne made on a wood surface, the coating would NOT be subsumed under the heading of ‘wood’, and, its gold coating is essential, not just for beautification.</i> If one would say that the coating of the Temple’s Table and Altar was for ornamentation, I have already written about this above, that gold is an unusual case, in that it has importance/value, and therefore cannot be ‘subsumed’, and will not be negated in term of ritual use. It was there that I answered the many question that arose from the discussion in tractate <i>Khagiga</i>, but this is not the place to impose yet another lengthy analysis<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">See pages 37-8 and note 162</i>.  This line of reasoning is quite deep and one needs time and patience to understand it.
When one examines the statements of the <i>Rambam</i> in his Laws Concerning Vessels, chapter 4:4, he wrote: “So too, any wooden or bone vessel that have…”, then, there too, there is no proof that the essence of the ritual use of a vessel is on its coating. Indeed, it may be just the opposite!  The vessel is not negated, since the coating is simply considered as a ‘covering’ for the vessel.
However, coating which is only ornamental, is subsumed to the essence of the vessel. Search out the laws concerning a clay vessel that is coated on the inside surface, the <i>Sm’ak</i><sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil (d.1280) was a French rabbi and Tosafist who flourished in the second half of the thirteenth century. he is best known as the author of Sefer Mitzvot Ḳatan</i> wrote that it is immersed without a blessing. This is also because of the inside coating, as the essence of that vessel’s use was for what is inside the coating<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">In that case, the coating was insignificant to the actual substance of which the vessel was made, which without this quasi-metal coating, would require ritual immersion.</i>.
That which my esteemed interlocutor wrote: “Also, even if one would consider that it is insignificant compared to the hide, if that is so, it will further bolster my argument<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘adds water and flour’</i> that one is making the <i>tefillin</i> boxes from something that is not leather”; I say: The boxes must be made of leather, but their adornments, although insignificant to the leather, does not have to be made from hides. You should study the concept of beautification of the <i>Sukkah</i>, as the reason they do not disqualify the <i>Sukkah</i> , is that they are ‘insignificant’ compared to the <i>Sukkah</i>. This is also the words of the <i>Tur</i><sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">See note 19</i> (O”H) 627: “Even if one spread a sheet…however, if it within four handbreaths of the roof, it is not considered significant in regars to the roof, as it was placed only to beautify”- end quote of the <i>Tur</i>.
According to the words of my esteemed interlocutor, we can state the opposite- since it is insignificant compared to the <i>s’chach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">The ‘roof’ of the Sukkah. Lit. that which covers.</i>, it is like covering the <i>Sukkah</i> with something that disqualifies it! Rather, it is obvious that it is not insignificant compared to the <i>s’chach.</i>  However, despite that, the <i>s’chach</i> still remains as it is.
The same applies to the concept of blackening the <i>tefillin</i> boxes, which is insignificant regarding the hide of the box, which remains in essence- a hide. This is what we were given and what we conclude that these are the <i>tefillin</i> given to us by the master of the universe, and therefore, it has an aspect of ‘This is my Lord, and I will glorify him’<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 15:2 It is interesting to note that this verse from Exodus is not applied to tefillin. The verse applied is from Detu. 28:10 “So that the peoples of the Earth shall see that the name of Hashem is upon you”.</i>. In this matter, I agree with him, so despite the above reasoning, the blackening plaster should not be thicker than the hide of the <i>tefillin</i> boxes, as the insignificant should not be ‘more’ than the significant- this is also a stringency.
However, that which my esteemed interlocutor stated that one may not cube the <i>tefillin</i> box leather, except for this (blackening) plaster- in this he ruled and taught beautifully- that the boxes must be made into natural cubes and that the hides of the boxes should be molded into cubes.  Also, the <i>Tosafot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Menachot 35a see note 264</i> were unclear if the <i>tefillin</i> boxes require being made as cubes, as the Talmud only applies this to the stitching of the undersides and its diagonal (to make it a square) etc... Nevertheless, the major halachic decisors have deemed that the boxes must be made into cubes. With this, it is obvious that making the plaster into a cube is of no assistance, and my esteemed interlocutor was indeed correct vin this matter.
Additionally, that which he mentioned about those who place an elephant bone into this plaster as a joke, in that too, he decided well to forbid that practice. It is clear to the halachic decisors of the past that the boxes need to be black, as it is an ancient Mosaic tradition. It is obvious that the concept of ‘that which is permitted in one’s mouth’ applies here. One can analyze this, as they are not necessary and are placed for appearances sake, as to whther the concept of ‘that which is permitted in one’s mouth’ applies to it. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to be stringent<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">Besides ridiculing the addition of an elephant bone to this blackening plaster, the issue of whether it has to be from a kosher animal does apply to this- only to the actual tefillin. He still advocates not using a non-kosher item.</i>.
Even according to those halachic decisors of the past who held that the boxes do not have to be black- except to beautify them- even then it is a good idea to be stringent, tha one should not use a rituaslly impure animal for this.
It is for all the concerns placed upon me that I cannot elaborate further on this, so I will bid you a peaceful farewell.

In the Talmud, the word ‘<i>nayma</i>’ is used so often that I do not have to list examples, and not only in the Talmud, but the Mishna as well, who linguistics are clear and precise, also used this term.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>nayma</i> is of the same word source as <i>nam</i> meaning: to say. </i>

Now that I have brought examples from the Talmud and the Mishna<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As the changes were made to the liturgy, the primary language style used is rabbinic (Talmud/Mishna), it was appropriate to begin with those examples. </i>, I will show him an example from the Bible<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘holy writ’</i>, from the Book of Ezra 4:8<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">רְח֣וּם בְּעֵל־טְעֵ֗ם וְשִׁמְשַׁי֙ סָֽפְרָ֔א כְּתַ֛בוּ אִגְּרָ֥ה חֲדָ֖ה עַל־יְרוּשְׁלֶ֑ם לְאַרְתַּחְשַׁ֥שְׂתְּא מַלְכָּ֖א כְּנֵֽמָא׃Rehum the commissioner and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes [saying] as follows</i> “to King Artaxerxes [saying-<i>kenama</i>] as follows:…”.

The Hebrew root of the verb is <i>nam<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nam</i> is a two letter word, as Rabbi Landau is expressing the knowledge of Rashi’s grammatical sense. This is likely incorrect, as the grammatical giant of Spain, such as Ibn Gevirol and Ibn Ezra have determined the three letter root for nearly all verbs. All Hebrew verbs (and many nouns) derive from a 3-consonant (and rarely 4) <i>shoresh</i> or root, which is not a word itself but which forms the basis for a number of Hebrew verbs and words that share the same root. As a matter-of-fact, the 4 letter roots are almost always repetitive sets of two letters. In this case, <i>nam-nam</i> which, as we saw on page 4 above, implies dozing or sleeping!</i></i>, as the letter <i>aleph</i> (א) at the end of <i>na-ma</i> denotes a sense of plural. It has been repeatedly used in other places in the Book of Ezra.
Towards the end of the Concordance<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus was a French Jewish philosopher and controversialist. He lived at Arles, perhaps at Avignon also, and in other places, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<i> Meïr Netib</i>, a Hebrew Biblical concordance upon which the author worked from 1437 to 1447 The <i>Meïr Netib</i> was the first Bible concordance in Hebrew, and was distinguished from the similar Latin work of Arlotus of Prato in that its vocabulary was arranged in the order of the roots. In the introduction the author says that his work aimed to facilitate the study of Biblical exegesis and to prevent Jewish converts to Christianity from making, in their religious controversies, incorrect quotations from the Bible, as was often the case with Geronimo de Santa Fé. The "Meïr Netib," with its complete introduction, was first published at Venice (erroneously under the name of Mordecai Nathan) in 1523; in 1556 it was published at Basel by Buxtorf, but with only a part of the introduction</i> – which is on the books of Daniel and Ezra – under the letter <i>kaff</i> (כ), these are his terms: ‘<i>ke-nam</i>’. ‘<i>ke-na-ma</i>’ are defined ‘as was stated’ – end quote.
Now that we have proven that the grammatical source of this verb is the two letter ‘<i>nam</i>’ [N-M], then it belongs as a present tense, single – as ‘<i>namata</i>’. Indeed, the current version of ‘<i>zechor namata</i>’ (remember you declared) is correct, as the liturgical poets chose brilliant<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. ‘bright’</i> linguistics.
Regarding the vowels<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Like most early Semitic alphabetic writing systems, the alef-bet has no vowels, although there are letters potentially used as vowels such as <i>aleff</i> (א), <i>ayin</i> (ע), <i>vav</i> (ו) and <i>yod</i> (י). People who are fluent in the language do not need vowels to read Hebrew, and most things written in Hebrew in Israel are written without vowels. However, as Hebrew literacy declined, particularly after the Romans expelled the Jews from Israel, the Rabbis realized the need for aids to pronunciation, so they developed a system of dots and dashes known as nikkudim (points). These dots and dashes are written above or below the letter, in ways that do not alter the spacing of the line. Text containing these markings is referred to as "pointed" text.</i>, that which was edited concerning the word <i>m-m-ch<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>machzor</i> of <i>Rosh HaShana</i>, the term <i>m-m-ch</i> occurs in the sentence “…nothing is hidden <i>from you</i>”. מִמְּךָ (<i>mi-meh-</i>cha is a contraction of ‘from you’ (מן שלך), and pronounced with slight gutteral <i>ch</i> as oposed to the full gutteral kh- ח) is more common in the Bible than מִמֶּךָּ (<i>mi meh-kah</i> the dot, known as a <i>dagesh</i>, ‘hardened the last consonant from the slight gutteral ‘ch’ to the ‘hard’ ‘kah’) .

Indeed, I have no business dealing with the rules of Hebrew grammar – specifically this word – which I have only found in the personal present or plural present as in “you [plural] send”.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Technically there is an ‘extra <i>mem</i> in <i>mimchem</i>, meaning ‘from you’ The verse referenced is from Gen 42:16 </i> It can also be seen in “Any matter that is difficult from you”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This from Deut. 1:17 The extra letter <i>mem</i> is not there (and may be the reason the letter is ‘dotted’ by a <i>dagesh</i>) to be read as ‘<i>meekehm</i>’ instead of ‘<i>mimchem</i>’.</i>.

It is well known that even the masters of Hebrew grammar<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The most noted probably being Menahem ben Saruq (also known as Menahem ben Jacob ibn Saruq) was a Spanish-Jewish philologist of the tenth century CE.

Certainly, in any case it is proper not to engage in disputes about these things, as noted by ‘The <i>Waheb</i> of <i>Suphah</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">עַל־כֵּן֙ יֵֽאָמַ֔ר בְּסֵ֖פֶר מִלְחֲמֹ֣ת יְהוָ֑ה אֶת־וָהֵ֣ב בְּסוּפָ֔ה וְאֶת־הַנְּחָלִ֖ים אַרְנֽוֹן׃ Therefore the Book of the Wars of the LORD speaks of “…Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis: the Arnon </i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Kiddushin 30b:<br>מאי את אויבים בשער אמר רבי חייא בר אבא אפי' האב ובנו הרב ותלמידו שעוסקין בתורה בשער אחד נעשים אויבים זה את זה ואינם זזים משם עד שנעשים אוהבים זה את זה שנאמר (<b>במדבר כא, יד</b>) את והב בסופה אל תקרי בסופה אלא בסופה <br>The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“enemies in the gate”</b> with regard to Torah study? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Even a father and his son,</b> or <b>a rabbi and his student, who are engaged in Torah</b> together <b>in one gate become enemies with each other</b> due to the intensity of their studies. <b>But they do not leave there until they love each other, as it is stated</b> in the verse discussing the places the Jewish people engaged in battle in the wilderness: “Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, <b>Vahev in Suphah [<i>beSufa</i>],</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (<b>Numbers 21:14</b>).

I received your letter. Regarding your question as to whether a mourner may act as Shaliach ‎Tzibbur, passing before the Ark between the beginning of the month of Elul and Yom Kippur: You ‎ruled correctly that there is no prohibition in this, and one should not prevent a mourner from ‎leading the prayers, other than on Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur. On the other days, even on ‎days when Selichot are said and during the Ten Days of Repentance, there is no basis for protesting ‎against a mourner. Even on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur there is no element of prohibition, ‎only custom. Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur should be no stronger than Shabbat and Yom Tov, ‎which are actual days of joy and rest, and yet there is no prohibition [against having a mourner lead ‎the prayers], only custom, per Rama Yoreh Deah 376. Further, it is explained clearly in Maharil that ‎the custom applies only to Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur... We see that the entire custom is only ‎for Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur, which are occasions declared to be holy and which interrupt ‎mourning. Their added status does not relate at all to Elul or the Ten Days of Repentance.  
Those ‎who disagree say that this period [Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance] is one of judgment, but ‎just the opposite! For this reason one should even permit [a mourner to lead] even on Rosh ‎haShanah and Yom Kippur! Indeed, this was the exact question put to the Maharil, thinking that ‎because these are days of judgment, without any joy, Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur should be ‎viewed as different from the other holidays [which are days of joy]. Further, even according to ‎their view, what would associate days of judgment and the month of Elul? Even the days of ‎Selichot before Rosh haShanah are not days of judgment –  just the opposite, they are days of ‎mercy and desire, the last set of forty days when Moshe Rabbeinu was on the mountain and the ‎Holy One showed him favour. It is only on Rosh HaShanah that the judgment begins... Moreover, ‎the Ten Days of Repentance are not called “days of  judgment”. Just the opposite, they are days of ‎mercy, during which Hashem avails Himself to every individual. Only Rosh HaShanah and Yom ‎Kippur are “days of judgment”...‎

Regarding your fourth question, about the‏ ‏proper version of‏ ‏L’Shem Yichud, which has‎‏ ‏newly ‎spread and been printed in siddurim: I‏ ‏reply that before you ask me about the‏ ‏version, it would be ‎more appropriate to ask‏ ‏whether saying it is appropriate at all. In my opinion, it is an evil sickness ‎for our‏ ‏generation. Previous generations did not‏ ‏know of this prayer, and did not say it at all. These ‎people toiled their whole lives in Torah‏ ‏and in mitzvot, all according to the Torah‏ ‏and according to ‎the halachic authorities,‎‏ ‏whose words flow from the source of living‏ ‏waters, the vast sea of the ‎Talmud, regarding‏ ‏which it is said, “the integrity of the upright‏ ‏shall guide them.” They bore ‎excellent fruit‏ ‏and their kindness exceeded the heavens.‎ However, in our generation people have left G-d’s Torah and the source of living waters, the two ‎Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi, to dig for themselves broken cisterns. Each one raises himself in the ‎arrogance of his own heart, saying, “I am the one who sees, the gates to heaven are open for me, ‎and for me the world exists.” These people are the destroyers of the generation. For this ‎orphaned generation I say that G-d’s paths are just, and the righteous walk in them, and the ‎Chasidim stumble in them [This is an alteration of Hoshea 14:14, in which the prophet says that ‎sinners will stumble in them.] I have much more to say on this matter, but just as it is a mitzvah to ‎say what will be heard, so too is it a mitzvah not to say something that will be ignored. (Yevamot ‎‎65b) G-d should have mercy upon us … 

As far as his honour's suggestion that it would be good to ‎have a strong connection between our speech, thought, and action [via the L’Shem Yichud ‎recitation]: The Great Assembly established prayers and blessings for us, and there is nothing that ‎is not hinted to in the text of the prayers and blessings. A blessing awakens our speech and ‎thought, and each mitzvah that is preceded by a blessing does not need anything else before it, ‎just the blessing. If there is no blessing, my practice is to say, “Behold, I am doing this to fulfill the ‎will of my Master,” and this is enough, and nothing else is necessary. We are meant to focus only ‎on the meaning of the words; repair of celestial realms is accomplished inherently, through our ‎actions… I have already revealed my thinking on the matter, that silence would be better, and let ‎the matter sink into oblivion. In thought, too, one should think only about the meaning of the ‎words. One will walk securely on this path, and will not stumble in any way. There is no point in ‎elaborating more on this matter…‎
