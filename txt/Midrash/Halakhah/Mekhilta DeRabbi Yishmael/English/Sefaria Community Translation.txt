Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael

Tractate Pischa



Chapter 1

“And Hashem said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, ‘I hear that the word was to Aaron and to Moses. When it says, ‘It happens on the day Hashem spoke to Moses (in the land of Egypt)’ (Exodus 6) - it was to Moses and not to Aaron. If so why does it teach, ’to Moses and to Aaron'? Except it teaches that just as that Moses was crowned for leadership, thus also Aaron was crowned for leadership. For what reason did he not speak with him? Because of his respect for Moses. Aaron  is found excluded from all of the leadership that is in the Torah except from three places, from which it is possible.
