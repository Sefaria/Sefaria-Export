Parasha 1



Chapter 1

The words of Koheleth, king in Jerusalem. Midrash: This is to say that this the writing is done with "ruach hakodesh" (divine inspiration) by the hand of King Solomon (Mishlei 22:29). You see [that the work of] a man [who is] adept at his trade will endure [when it is done] in front of kings. It happened that Rebbe Chanina ben Dosa saw people in his city taking up vow-offerings and free-will offerings to Jerusalem. He said, "Everyone is bringing up vow-offerings and free-will offerings to Jerusalem, and I don't have a thing to bring up." What did he do? He went to the walkway of his city and saw one stone and chipped it, chiseled it, and polished it and said: "Now I have something to bring up to Jerusalem." He sought to hire workers. Five men passed by him. He said to them "Will you take this stone for me up to Jerusalem?" They said to him, "Give us 5 Selayim [currency] and we will bring it up to Jerusalem." He sought it for them but he could not find a single thing...

(8) "All the streams flow to the sea" (Ecclesiastes 1) -- All of Israel only ever gather together in Jerusalem, and they go up at the time of the festivals each and every year."Yet the sea is never full" (Ecclesiastes 1) -- Yet Jerusalem is never filled. As it was taught "They stand crowded, [yet] they bow spaciously". Rav Shmuel Bar Chova said in the name of Rav Acha who said, "Four cubits space between each and every one of them, and one cubit on each side, so that no one would hear the prayer of his friend and come to err"."To the place the streams flow [there they shall return again]" -- To the place Israel gathers in this world, there they shall gather in the world to come, in the time to come, as it is said (Isaiah 27) "And it shall be in that day, that a great horn shall be blown; and they shall come, those that were lost in the land of Assyria and those that were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship G-d at the holy mountain in Jerusalem"

Look at God's work - for who can straighten what He has twisted? (Ecclesiastes 7:13). When the Blessed Holy One created the first human, He took him and led him round all the trees of the Garden of Eden and said to him: “Look at My works, how beautiful and praiseworthy they are! And all that I have created, it was for you that I created it. Pay attention that you do not corrupt and destroy My world: if you corrupt it, there is no one to repair it after you. And not only that - you cause the death of that tzadik [Moses]. A simile - to what does Moses our teacher can be compared? To a pregnant woman who was incarcerated in a prison and there she gave birth to a son, she raised him there and died there. Some time later, when the king was passing by the entrance of the prison, the son shouted and said: 'My lord the king! I was born here! I was raised here! I don't know what is the sin that keeps me put in here. He answered him: Your mother's sin. It is the same with Moses, as it is written: Behold, the man has become one (Genesis 3:22) and it is written [also] Behold, your day of death is approaching (Deuteronomy 31:14)
