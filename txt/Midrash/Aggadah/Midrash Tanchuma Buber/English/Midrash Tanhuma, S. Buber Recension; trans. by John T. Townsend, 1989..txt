Bereshit



Siman 1

(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>. It is written (in Ps. 104:3): <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS, WHO SETS THE CLOUDS AS HIS CHARIOT</small>…. R. Johanan said:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 1:3; <i>PRE</i> 4; M. Pss. 104:7. See below, sec. 1:12; M. Pss. 24:4.</i> Heaven and earth were created on the first day, and on the second the Holy One<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this translation “the Holy One” (apart from biblical quotations) represents the Hebrew acronym, <i>HQBH</i>, which stands for “The Holy One Blessed be He.” A somewhat abbreviated form is called for because this acronym has become the common midrashic name of the Deity and is treated as a single word. The full title would be awkward and only appears in the translation where the full title occurs in the Buber text.</i> created the firmament and the angels. Where is it shown that they were created on the second day? Where it is stated (ibid.): <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this roof as the firmament of Gen. 1:6-8. Thus Ps. 104:3f. is seen as a reference to the second day of creation.</i> <small>WHO SETS THE CLOUDS AS HIS CHARIOT, WHO WALKS ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND (<i>ruah</i>)</small>. And what is written next (in vs. 4)? <small>WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS SPIRITS (<i>ruah</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Hebrews 1:7.</i> R. Hanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. Thus it is written concerning the fifth (in Gen. 1:20): <small>AND LET FOWL FLY (<i>ye'ofef</i>) ABOVE THE EARTH</small>. Now the word <i>ye'ofef</i> only refers to the flying of angels, as it is used (in Is. 6:2): <small>AND WITH TWO HE DID FLY (<i>ye'ofef</i>)</small>. And why were the angels not created on the first day? So that the heretics (<i>minim</i>) would not say: Michael was standing in the north with Gabriel in the south, and together they spread out the heavens and the earth. So who did create them? The Holy One by himself, as stated (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED &lt; THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH &gt;</small>. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree. R. Judah says: The world was being created for six days. Thus it is written concerning the work of each and every day (in Gen. 1:7, 9, 11, 15, 24, 30): <small>AND IT WAS SO</small>. That is R. Judah's opinion, but R. Nehemiah says: The whole world was created on the first day. R. Judah said to him: What is the meaning of what is written concerning the work of each and every day: <small>[AND IT WAS SO]?</small> R. Berekhyah said concerning R. Nehemiah's opinion: (According to Gen. 1:24) <small>GOD SAID: LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH</small>. The expression <small>LET BRING FORTH</small> is only used of something that was prepared from <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>, as stated concerning the first day (in vs. 1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING.</small>

Siman 2

There was once a certain matron<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>matrona</i>.</i> who asked R. Jose ben Halafta: In how many days did the Holy One create his world? He said to her: &lt; He did it &gt; on the first day. She said to him: How do you teach me that? He said to her: Have you never made a {drinking} banquet?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ariston</i>.</i> She said to him: Yes. And how many <i>missus</i> {i.e., kinds of food}<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word means “dinner courses.”</i> did you have? She said to him: Thus and so. He said to her: Did you set all of them before them simultaneously? She said to him: No, I cooked all the foods simultaneously, but only brought them in before them <i>missus</i> by <i>missus</i>. And all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., the courses which represent the parts of the creation.</i> are from a single scripture, as stated (in Jer. 10:16): <small>FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO FORMS THE ALL</small>….

Siman 3

R. Judah bar Shallum said: The world was created for the sake of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See 4 Ezra 6:55, 59; 7:11; 8:1; <i>Gerim</i> 1:5; Lev. R. 36:4.</i> "From of old" is not written here (in Gen. 1:1), nor is "from the start" written here, but <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>? This is Israel, which is called <small>BEGINNING.</small> It is so stated (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS HOLY TO THE LORD, THE <i>BEGINNING</i> OF HIS HARVEST</small>. {From what &lt; verse is it shown &gt; that they were called <small>BEGINNING</small>? In the verse where it is stated:} [Where &lt; is the original proposition shown &gt;? From what we read on the subject:] <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>….

Siman 4

(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR SHIELD OF YOUR SALVATION</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 41:4; M. Pss. 18:28f.; see <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 9:15.</i> &lt; The words &gt; [speak of Israel. What is written (in vs. 31 = vs. 31)? <small>HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM.</small>] (The verse continues:) <small>AND YOUR RIGHT HAND SUSTAINS ME</small>. This is Torah according to what is stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND IS A FIERY LAW</small> (<i>dat</i>). (Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36 continues:) <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>. Now is anyone more humble than the Holy One? R. Abba bar Aha said: The student sits before his master. When he is finished, the student says to the master: How I have tired you! But Israel was learning from the Holy One. When they are departing, he says to them: How I have tired you! It is so stated (in Deut. 1:6): <small>THE LORD OUR GOD SPOKE TO US IN HOREB, SAYING: &lt; YOU HAVE SAT LONG ENOUGH AT THIS MOUNTAIN &gt;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
{R. said:} [Another interpretation:] <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>: R. Simeon ben Zera said: Who is as humble as the Holy One? The student says to his master: Rabbi, teach me one chapter. Then he says to him: Go on ahead to such and such a place. But the Holy One said to Ezekiel (in Ezek. 3:22): <small>GO OUT INTO THE PLAIN [AND I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU]</small>. Then Ezekiel went out and found the Holy One, who had gone there ahead of him. It is so stated (in vs. 23): <small>THEN I AROSE AND WENT OUT TO THE PLAIN; AND, LO, THERE WAS THE GLORY OF THE LORD</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
{R. said:} [Another interpretation:] <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>: R. Julianus ben Tiberinus said in the name of R. Isaac: See the humility of the Holy One. See what is written (in Exod. 19:19): <small>MOSES SPOKE, AND GOD ANSWERED HIM OUT LOUD</small>. Should it not rather have said, "God spoke, and Moses answered him out loud"? He did not do that. Instead, <small>MOSES SPOKE, &lt; AND GOD ANSWERED HIM &gt;</small>…. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
R. Abba bar Kahana said: Come and see the humility of the Holy One. What is written (in Ezek. 44:2)? <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: THIS &lt;EAST&gt; GATE WILL BE CLOSED {AND} WILL NOT BE OPENED &lt; … FOR THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL, HAS ENTERED IN BY IT &gt;</small>. A King of flesh and blood has the glory of entering by a main gate and not by a lesser one, but the Holy One in his glory entered by a lesser gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one insignificant enough to remain closed.</i> Ergo, {it says} (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: The students proceed &lt; first &gt; and after that, the master; but the Holy One does not act so. Rather, for the sake of Abraham, who was sitting in pain (due to his recent circumcision in Gen. 17:26), the Holy One said to his angels: Let us go and visit Abraham. While they were proceeding, &lt; first &gt; God appeared to him and after that, the angels. It is so stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM BY THE TEREBINTHS OF MAMRE</small>, and after that (in vs. 2): <small>RAISING HIS EYES, HE LOOKED; &lt; AND HERE WERE THREE MEN &gt;</small>…. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
R. Simon said: See what is written (in Gen. 18:22): <small>AND THE MEN TURNED FROM THERE AND WENT TO SODOM, BUT ABRAHAM WAS STILL STANDING BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Should it not rather have said, "And God was still standing"? &lt; There is here &gt;, however, a scribal emendation.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Such an emendation (Heb.: <i>tiqqun soferim</i>) occurs where the biblical text was perceived as offensive or lacking in respect for the Divine. For lists of passages with these emendations, see <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 4:16, which attributes them to the scribes; also <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Shirah</i> 6; <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 10:35 (84), both of which regard the “emendations” as euphemisms belonging to the original text. See <i>Encyclopaedia Judaica</i> 15(1971), cols. 1139—1140; and especially Saul Lieberman, <i>Hellenism in Jewish Palestine</i>, 2nd edition (New York: JTSA, 1962), pp. 28—37.</i> Ergo {it says} (in Ps. 18:36 = II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.
Ben 'Azzay said: Come and see the humility of the Holy One. &lt; The matter is comparable to &gt; a king of flesh and blood who mentions his name &lt; and &gt;, afterwards mentions his creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ktisma</i>.</i> But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he mentioned his works, &lt; it was &gt; afterwards &lt; that &gt; he mentioned his name. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:1, following the Hebrew word order): <small>IN THE BEGINNING CREATED GOD</small>.

Siman 5

[(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>]:<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 1:1 ; <i>TDER</i> 29(31); see <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 1:1.</i> This text is related (to Prov. 8:30): <small>AND I WAS WITH HIM AS AN CONFIDANT</small>. What is the meaning of <small>CONFIDANT 'MWN</small>? R. Judah bar Il'a'y said: &lt; That he was &gt; an expert <small><i>'WMN</i></small> in the Torah. The Holy One would scrutinize the Torah as he was creating the world. Ergo: <small>AND I WAS WITH HIM AS A CONFIDANT</small>. What is written (in Gen. 1:1)? <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>. There is no <small>BEGINNING</small> but Torah, as stated (in Prov. 8:22): <small>THE LORD ACQUIRED ME</small><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">“Me” here refers to wisdom, which is regarded as the equivalent of Torah.</i> <small>AS THE BEGINNING OF HIS WAY</small>. Ergo: <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small> (i.e., in Torah) <small>GOD CREATED</small>.

Siman 6

R. Simeon ben Johay said:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 1:13.</i> Woe to blasphemers who take the name of the Holy One lightly, for one should not say: To the <small>LORD</small> an offering, to the <small>LORD</small> a burnt offering. Rather, &lt; use the biblical wording &gt; (as in Lev. 1:2): <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Numb. 8:12): <small>A SIN OFFERING &lt; … &gt; TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Lev. 23:18; Numb. 8:12; 28:11, 19; 29:8; Jud. 13:16; etc.): <small>A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Gen. 4:3; Is. 66:20; Ezek. 46:14; Mal. 2:12; II Chron. 33:23): <small>A MEAL OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>. Learn (from the Hebrew word order in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING CREATED</small>, and after that, <small>GOD</small>. When he mentions his creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ktisma</i>.</i> &lt; it is only &gt; afterwards &lt; that &gt; he mentions his name.

Siman 7

The <i>minim</i> questioned {R. Ishmael} [R. Simlay].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yBer</i>. 9:1 (12d); Gen. R. 8:9; Deut. R. 2:13; <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:4.</i> They said to him: How many deities created the world? He said to them: Let us, me and you, inquire of the Torah. They said to him: See, it written (in Josh. 24:19): <small>FOR … HOLY GODS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">While “God” in the Bible is commonly plural, here the adjective “holy” is plural as well.</i> He said to them: Read the rest of the verse, &lt; where &gt; "they" is not used but <small>HE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the text reads literally: <small>FOR HE IS HOLY GODS.</small></i> R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Abba the Edomite: Why is <small>HOLY</small> plural (in Josh. 24:19)? Because he is holy in all categories of holiness. R. Aha bar Hanina said: In regard to the Holy One, his way is in holiness; he processes in holiness; he is seen in holiness; his speech is in holiness; the uncovering of his arm is in holiness; [he is beautiful and glorious in holiness]. His way is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 77:14): <small>YOUR WAY, O GOD, IS IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place, the Temple). He processes is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 68:25): <small>THE PROCESSIONS OF MY GOD, MY KING, ARE IN HOLINESS</small>. He is seen in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 63:3): <small>SO I HAVE BEHELD YOU IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place). His speech is in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 60:8): <small>GOD SPOKE IN HIS HOLINESS</small> (Holy Place). The uncovering of his arm is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 52:10: <small>THE LORD HAS UNCOVERED HIS ARM OF HOLINESS</small>. He is beautiful and glorious in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD, &lt; GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS &gt;</small>? Hence &lt; the plurals &gt; (in Josh. 24:19): <small>FOR HE IS HOLY GODS</small>, in &lt; the sense &gt; that he is holy in all types of holinesses. &lt; The <i>minim</i> &gt; said to him: But he caused to be written (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD</small> (in the plural) <small>CREATED</small>. He said to them: &lt; The plural form of &gt; "created" is not written here, but <small>CREATED</small> &lt; in the singular to agree with the singular subject &gt;.

Siman 8

R. Ishmael questioned R. 'Aqiva,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Hag</i>. 12b; Gen.R. 1:14; 22:2; 53:15.</i> who was interpreting the words <i>akh</i> ("but") and <i>raq</i> ("only") as &lt; indicating &gt; exclusions, with <i>et</i> (either the sign of a definite accusative or the preposition "with") and <i>gam</i> ("also") as &lt; indicating &gt; inclusions. R. Ishmael said to him: "In the beginning God created heaven and earth" is not written here but <small>ET THE HEAVEN AND <i>ET</i> THE EARTH</small>. &lt; The use of <i><small>ET</small></i> is simply &gt; a clarification of Scripture. R. 'Aqiva said to him: It is written (in Deut. 32:47): <small>FOR IT</small> (the Torah) <small>IS NO EMPTY THING FOR YOU</small>. If "heaven and earth" had been stated (in Gen. 1:1), we should have said: They are two deities.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Without the use of <i>et</i> the two might be seen as the subject of “create” along with God.</i> But <small><i>ET</i> THE HEAVEN AND <i>ET</i> THE EARTH</small> means those &lt; two creations &gt; and what was created along with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Aquila apparently followed the principle of his master ‘Aqiva in his Greek rendering of Gen. 1:1.</i>

Siman 9

R. Huna says in the name of R. Eliezer the son of J. Jose the Galilean:<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 1:13.</i> He created the new heavens and the new earth ahead of time. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:22): <small>FOR AS <i>THE</i> NEW HEAVENS AND <i>THE</i> NEW EARTH &lt; WHICH I MAKE REMAIN BEFORE ME &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The argument is that the definite articles imply an already existing new heavens and new earth. Cf. the comment in the nineteenth-century commentary, <i>‘Ets Josef</i>, by Enoch Zondel ben Joseph, ad loc.: “They existed potentially as an idea and not actually.”</i> David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, I offer you praise for the wonders which you have done in the world. It is so stated (in Ps. 104:1): <small>BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL. O LORD, MY GOD, YOU ARE VERY GREAT. YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>. How do the great ones of the world (i.e., the scholars) expound &lt; this verse &gt;? R. Eleazar and R. Joshua: You were great before you created, but you became very great after you created your world. <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>.

Siman 10

R. Nathan ben Eleazar questioned R. Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 10:6; Gen. R. 3:4; Exod. R. 50:1; Lev. R. 31:7; M. Pss. 104:4.</i> He said to him: How did the Holy One create the world? R. Samuel said to him: When the Holy One desired [to create] the world, he wrapped (rt.: '<i>TP</i>) himself in light, as stated (in Ps. 104:2): <small>PUTS ON (rt.: '<i>TP</i>) LIGHT LIKE A GARMENT</small>. He said to him: You have told me in a whisper. Why in a whisper? He said to him: Just as I received &lt; this tradition &gt; in a whisper, so I have transmitted &lt; it &gt; to you in a whisper. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said to him: Have we not already heard R. Isaac expounding it publicly?
When did the Holy One become magnified? When he had created heaven and earth. And for whose sake did he create it? For the sake of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See above, sec. 1:3.</i> of whom it is said (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS HOLY FOR THE LORD, [THE BEGINNING OF HIS HARVEST]</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: The written text spells <small>HIS HARVEST <i>tevu'atoh</i></small>. Why do we read (<i>qorin</i>) <i>tevu'ato</i> (with a final <i>waw</i> instead of a final <i>he</i>)? Because we only eat from the <i>tevu'atoh</i> (i.e., the interest of the written text) and not from the principal (<i>qeren</i>), since it is preserved for us for the world to come.
Another interpretation: By virtue of the Torah were heaven and earth created. It is so stated (in Is. 51:16): <small>MOREOVER, I HAVE PUT MY WORDS</small> (i.e., the Torah) <small>IN YOUR MOUTH; [AND I HAVE COVERED YOU IN THE SHADOW OF MY HAND, SO THAT I MAY PLANT THE HEAVENS AND LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH]</small>.
Another interpretation: &lt; Creation came about &gt; for the sake of Zion. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>&lt; TO PLANT HEAVEN, LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH &gt;, AND SAY TO ZION: YOU ARE MY PEOPLE</small>.

Siman 11

R. Isaac said: It was only necessary to write the Torah from &lt; the words &gt; (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from where the actual commandments begin. Cf. <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael</i>, which does in fact begin here.</i> Why did he write from &lt; the words &gt; (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>? To make known his mighty power. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 111:6): <small>HE HAS DECLARED TO HIS PEOPLE THE POWER OF HIS WORKS IN GIVING THEM THE HERITAGE OF THE GENTILES</small>.
Resh Laqish said: A word, as it were, came from the mouth of the Holy One (according to Ps. 33:6): <small>BY THE WORD OF THE LORD WERE THE HEAVENS MADE</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 1:1-27) &lt; that &gt; by it he <small>CREATED</small>. &lt; This account was &gt; simply for exacting retribution from the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with toil and wearisome labor, and to give a good recompense to the righteous who preserve the world, which was created by the word of the <small>LORD</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED &lt; THE HEAVENS &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Avot</i> 5:1.</i>
R. Aha said: When the Holy One spoke to the heavens that they should be created, they went on expanding. If he had not said: Enough, they would have gone on expanding out until the dead arose.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See below, 3:25; 10:12, 17.</i>
<small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS</small>: These are heavens. From what was the &lt; earth &gt; created? From a lump of snow, as stated (in Job 37:6): <small>FOR TO THE SNOW HE SAYS: BECOME EARTH</small>. So the Holy One blessed them, and they became fruitful and multiplied. David said (in Ps. 134:3): <small>MAY THE LORD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH BLESS YOU FROM ZION</small>.

Siman 12

(Gen. 2:4:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. Let our master instruct us: When someone sees shooting stars and lightnings, what blessing does he say over them? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ber.</i> 9:2): <small>OVER SHOOTING STARS, EARTHQUAKES, LIGHTNINGS, AND THUNDERS ONE SAYS: BLESSED BE THE ONE WHOSE POWER FILLS THE WORLD</small>. Note that this is from the Mishnah. Where is it shown from Scripture? Where it is stated (in Ps. 104:32): <small>WHO</small> (i.e., the <small>LORD</small>) <small>LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES</small>. And what is written in connection with it (in vs. 31)? <small>MAY THE GLORY OF THE LORD BE FOREVER</small>. Elijah, of blessed memory, asked Rav Mari:<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>yBer</i>. 9:3 (12c); M. Pss. 18:12; 104:25.</i> Why do earthquakes come upon the world? He said to him: When the Holy One sees Israel not separating their tithes as they should, earthquakes come upon the world. Elijah, of blessed memory, said to him: Upon your life, that is the &lt; apparent &gt; reason for the phenomenon, but the root of the phenomenon is this: When the Holy One looks at his world and sees temples of star worship sitting upon their tells in safety, security, and serenity, while his Holy Temple is destroyed, at that time he wants to overthrow the world and shakes &lt; it &gt;. The Holy One said: All this quaking is for the sanctification of my name, as stated (in Is. 43:7): <small>EVERY ONE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME [AND WHOM I HAVE CREATED FOR MY GLORY, I HAVE FORMED HIM, EVEN MADE HIM]</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah goes on to list the blind and the deaf as examples. Thus God is sanctified by all creation, even earthquakes.</i> Also, through that for which I deserve to be praised, the nations provoke me to anger. One says: The <small>LORD</small> does such and so. Another says to worship the constellations. Another says: I serve the sun and its rays. Therefore, I bring earthquake into the world. Although the heavenly bodies did not sin, because people provoke me to anger through them, they (the heavenly bodies) are also stricken along with them. So it is stated (in Joel 3:4 [2:31]): <small>THE SUN WILL BE CHANGED TO DARKNESS, AND THE MOON, TO BLOOD</small>. And what concern do they have? To make known that no other god created my world along with me. You yourself know that it is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 1:1, and the notes there.</i> R. Johanan said: The angels were created on the second day, as stated (in Gen. 1:6): <small>LET THE FIRMAMENT BE IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS</small>. Another text (Ps. 104:3) says: <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS</small>. And what is written next (in vs. 4)? <small>WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS SPIRITS (<i>ruah</i>)</small>. Ergo, it says: The angels were created on the second day. R. Hanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 1:20): <small>AND LET THE FOWL FLY (<i>ye'ofef</i>) ABOVE THE EARTH</small>. These are angels, as stated (in Is. 6:2): <small>AND WITH TWO HE WOULD FLY (<i>ye'ofef</i>)</small>. Ergo, it says: They were created on the fifth day. Either according to the words of R. Johanan or according to the words of R. Hanina, you have learned this, that the angels were created only after the Holy One had created his world. Why so? It is simply that the Holy One said: If I create them at the beginning, people will say: They assisted me with my world. The Holy One said: I created my world by myself, as stated (in Is. 66:2): <small>[AND] ALL THESE THINGS MY HAND HAS MADE</small>. Where is it shown about the created beings of heaven and earth? {Where it is stated} [From what they have read on the matter] (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>….

Siman 13

Another interpretation (of Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. This text is related (to Job 25:2): <small>DOMINION AND AWE ARE WITH HIM</small>. Thus Job had said (in 23:3): <small>OH THAT I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM [THAT I MIGHT COME TO HIS ABODE]</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: If he is in a temple above, I will come to his abode; and if he is in a temple below, I will come to his abode. Now <small>HIS ABODE (rt.: <i>KWN</i>)</small> is nothing but a temple, as stated (in Ezra 3:3): <small>AND THEY SHALL SET THE ALTAR UPON ITS BASE (rt.: <i>KWN</i>)</small>. Ergo he says: This &lt; abode &gt; is a temple. (Job 23:4:) <small>LET ME LAY MY CASE (<i>mishpat</i>) BEFORE HIM</small>. His friends said to him: Do you not know that he is called the God of justice (<i>mishpat</i>)? It is so stated (in Is. 30:18): <small>FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE (<i>mishpat</i>)</small>. (Job 23:4, cont.:) <small>AND FILL MY MOUTH WITH PROTESTS</small>. He said to him: If that man's mouth would close, (according to vs. 5) <small>I WOULD KNOW {WHAT} WORDS HE WOULD ANSWER ME [AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD-SAY TO ME]</small>. Oh that he would answer me point for point as to whether I have sinned or not sinned. (Job 23:8:) <small>SEE, I GO EAST, AND HE IS NOT THERE; AND WEST, BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE HIM</small>. R. Johanan said: You learn from here that the Divine Presence is in the west. I went south and north without finding him (cf. vs. 9). Why? (Job 23:10:) <small>BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE WAY I TAKE. WHEN HE HAS TRIED ME, I SHALL COME FORTH LIKE GOLD</small>. His friends said to him: Job, how long will you pester with words? Are we not telling you that you cannot go out to meet him and speak insolently with him? They said to him: Can you speak insolently with Michael?

Gemini says: I am first, and does not see what is in front of him. And so each and every one says: I am first. Ergo, it says: The heavenly beings need peace.

(Gen. 3:22:) <small>AND THE LORD GOD SAID: BEHOLD, THE HUMAN HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US</small>. Let our master instruct us: What is the rule about saving the scroll case<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>deche</i>.</i> along with the scroll from fire on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab</i>. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY SAVE THE SCROLL CASE ALONG WITH THE SCROLL AND THE PHYLACTERY CASE ALONG WITH THE PHYLACTERIES</small>. See, our masters have taught (ibid.): <small>ALL SACRED SCRIPTURES MAY BE SAVED FROM FIRE</small>. Why? So that the words of Torah not be burned. Then why does one save the scroll case so that it will not burn? Are the words of Torah written on it? &lt; The case &gt; deserves to be saved with &lt; the scroll &gt; because &lt; the case &gt; is joined to the scroll. Solomon said (in Prov. 13:20): <small>ONE WHO WALKS WITH THE WISE &lt; BECOMES WISE: BUT THE COMPANION OF FOOLS SHALL SUFFER HARM &gt;</small>. Woe to the wicked and those joined with them, but blessed are the righteous and those joined to them. What is written about the generation of the flood (in Gen. 7:23)? <small>AND HE WIPED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. If people sinned, how had cattle sinned? &lt; The principle applies &gt;: Woe to the wicked and those joined &lt; with them &gt;, since they pronounce themselves guilty by being joined to them. R. Judah bar Idi said:<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 26:5; Lev.

Ergo: Blessed are the righteous, and blessed are those joined with them. But woe to the wicked and those joined with them. You find that when Korah separated himself, two hundred and fifty heads of the Sanhedrin went with him in the dissension. In addition their wealth went with them. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED &lt; ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY &gt;</small>. If they had sinned, how had their property sinned? &lt; The principle applies &gt;: Woe to the wicked and to those joined with them; but blessed are the righteous, and blessed are those joined with them. See what is written about Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (in Dan. 3:21): <small>THEN WERE THESE MEN BOUND IN THEIR MANTLES [THEIR TUNICS, THEIR HATS, AND THEIR OUTER GARMENTS; AND THEY WERE CAST INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE]</small>. And when they came out from the fiery furnace, this is written about them (in vs. 27): <small>THEY SAW THOSE MEN, THAT THE FIRE HAD NO POWER OVER THEIR BODIES, [THAT THE HAIR OF THEIR HEAD WAS NOT SINGED, NOR WERE THEIR MANTLES ALTERED]</small>. Why were their mantles not altered? Because they were joined to them. Ergo: Blessed are the righteous and blessed are those joined to them. The Holy One said Adam heeded his wife, was joined to her, and was driven out, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND HE DROVE OUT THE MAN</small>. If he had heeded and been joined to me, he would have been like me. Just as I remain alive, so he would have remained alive forever. Where is it shown?

In the seventh he breathed the breath of life into him. In the eighth he brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth he gave him the commandment. In the tenth he sinned. In the eleventh he was sentenced. In the twelfth he drove him out, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE HUMAN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO HE DROVE OUT</small>? That he drove him out in afflictions.
Another interpretation: <small>SO HE DROVE OUT (<i>WYGRSH</i>)</small>: &lt; The Holy One did so &gt; since because of him the Temple was destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 21:8.</i> Thus it is stated (in Lam. 3:16): <small>HE ALSO HAS BROKEN (<i>WYGRS</i>) MY TEETH WITH GRAVEL STONES; HE HAS MADE ME WALLOW IN ASHES</small>.
(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>AND AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE POSTED THE CHERUBIM</small>. They were called cherubim, therefore, because they were many (<i>rabbim</i>). Resh Laqish said:<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. R. 13:3; <i>PR</i> 7:2.</i> Adam did not leave the Garden of Eden until he had cursed and blasphemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. R. 13:3.</i> Here (in Gen. 3:24) cherubim are mentioned. It is also stated (in II Kings 19:15, part of the passage) concerning Sennacherib: <small>O LORD {OF HOSTS} [GOD OF ISRAEL], WHO SITS UPON THE CHERUBIM</small>. Just as the cherubim mentioned there &lt; appear in the context of &gt; curses and blasphemies (vs. 22; cf. vss. 16, 23); so also here (in Gen. 3:24) &lt; the cherubim imply &gt; curses and blasphemies.
(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>AND THE FLAME OF THE EVER-TURNING SWORD</small>. This &lt; flame &gt; is Gehinnom, which is ever turning from hot to cold and from cold to hot over the wicked. R. Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said: Now where &lt; do we find that &gt; they deliver themselves to the cold?<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">On the wording, see L. Gruenhut, <i>Midrash Shir haShirim</i>, 2nd edition by J. Ch. Wertheimer (Jerusalem: Ktav Yad Sefer Inst., 1981), p. 60 on Cant. 2:12.</i> Where it is stated (In Ps. 68:15 [14]): <small>IT SNOWED IN ZALMON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Zalmon is a name for Gehinnom.</i> And who will be delivered from the judgment of Gehinnom? One who is busy in the Torah. (Gen. 3:24:) <small>AND THE FLAME OF THE EVER-TURNING SWORD: SWORD</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Ps. 149:6 concerning Israel's saints): <small>&lt; LET THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD BE IN THEIR MOUTH &gt;, AND A TWO-EDGED SWORD IN THEIR HAND</small>.
(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THE WAY [TO THE TREE OF LIFE</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: <small>TO KEEP THE WAY]</small> comes before <small>THE TREE OF LIFE</small>. The Holy One said to &lt; Adam &gt;: I put you in the Garden of Eden so that you would labor in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRE</i> 12.</i> and eat from the tree of life; but now that you have sinned, what are you doing here? Get out! So he drove out the human. The Holy One said to him: You should have uttered songs before me about how I created you and about what I did with you, but you did not speak. Here I was talking to myself, as stated (in Is. 5:1): <small>LET ME SING TO MY BELOVED</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">In the biblical context both the singer and the beloved are God.</i> What did the Holy One do? He drove him from this world, as stated (in Job 14:19): <small>ITS TORRENTS WASH AWAY THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. 2:7; 3:19, Adam is dust.</i> R. Simon said: Even the first Adam was washed away in water.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 28:3.</i> R. Simeon ben Judah the man of Kefar 'Akko said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay: The radiance of the first Adam's face was unchanged, and &lt; its &gt; lights were not eclipsed until the Sabbath ended; for when he had judged him, he kept the Sabbath holy. Therefore, he utters (according to Ps. 92:1): <small>A PSALM, A SONG FOR THE SABBATH DAY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 22:13.</i> You find that when Cain killed Abel, the Holy One appeared to him and said to him (in Gen. 4:9): <small>WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER ABEL</small>? He sought to deceive the one above. The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 4:10): <small>WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIES OUT UNTO ME</small>. When Cain heard &lt; that &gt;, he began to make a fraudulent repentance, as stated (in Gen. 4:13): <small>AND CAIN SAID TO THE LORD: MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, since you bear with the heavenly and the earthly ones, can you not bear my sin?
Another interpretation: He said to him: Sovereign of the World, you have been proclaimed (in Micah 7:18): <small>WHO IS A GOD LIKE YOU, FORGIVING SIN AND PASSING OVER TRANSGRESSION</small>? (Gen. 4:13:) <small>MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have repented. By your life, I am revoking one decree from you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 4:16): <small>AND CAIN WENT OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND DWELT IN THE LAND OF NOD</small>. While he was going away, the first Adam met him. He said to him: What happened about your sentence. He said: If I had not confessed, I should already have disappeared from the world. Adam said at that time (in Ps. 92:2 [1]): <small>IT IS GOOD TO CONFESS TO THE LORD</small>. In this world individuals confess to the Holy One, but in the world to come they all confess to him. So it is stated (in Is. 12:1): <small>I WILL CONFESS TO YOU, O LORD; FOR, THOUGH YOU WERE ANGRY WITH ME, YOUR ANGER IS TURNED AWAY, AND YOU COMFORT ME</small>.

(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>. Let our master instruct us: May one cease being fruitful and multiplying at a time when he has no children? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Yev</i>. 6:6): <small>ONE IS NOT TO CEASE FROM BEING FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYING UNLESS HE ALREADY HAS CHILDREN. THE BET SHAMMAY SAY: TWO MALES; BUT THE BET HILLEL SAY: A MALE AND A FEMALE, AS STATED</small> (in Gen 5:2): <small>MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yev</i>. 61b for a different explanation.</i> What is the reasoning of the Bet Shammay? Through analogy with Cain and Abel.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after the birth of these two, there were no more children until Adam begot Seth after a long interval. See Gen. 5:3.</i> What is the reasoning of the Bet Hillel? Through analogy with Adam and Eve. R. Simon said: Adam separated himself from his wife Eve for a hundred and thirty years after Abel was killed. Adam said: How am I to beget children when they go to destruction? What did he do? R. Simon said: Female spirits would come to him and become inflamed with passion from him; for so the Holy One told David (in I Chron. 22:8): <small>BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN TO YOU, {AND} HE SHALL BE A MAN OF REST</small>. (II Sam. 7:14:) <small>I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER, AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON</small>. When? When he is busy in the Torah. But when he forsook me and walked in the way of his &lt; own &gt; heart, (ibid., cont.): <small>WHEN HE TRANSGRESSES, I WILL PUNISH HIM WITH THE ROD OF MEN AND WITH THE PESTILENCES OF THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THE ROD OF MEN</small>? These &lt; words &gt; refer to Hadad and Rezon ben Eliada. Thus it is stated (in I Kings 11:23) <small>AND [GOD] RAISED UP AN ADVERSARY (<i>satan</i>) FOR HIM {FOR SOLOMON}, [REZON BEN ELIADA]</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verses (14-22) concern the adversary. Hadad the Edomite.</i> <small>[AND WITH THE PESTILENCES OF THE CHILDREN OF ADAM.]</small><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 20:11; 24:6.</i> <small>PESTILENCES</small> can only be the demons (<i>mazziqin</i>). Thus it is stated (in Ps. 91:10): <small>NEITHER SHALL PESTILENCE COME NEAR YOUR TENT</small>. &lt; The above is &gt; to make known to you that during the whole 130 years in which Adam had withdrawn from Eve, the spirits were coming to him and being inflamed with passion from him so that he was begetting demons (<i>mazziqin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>‘Eruv</i>. 18b.</i> At that time the Holy One said: I created my world only for fruitfulness and multiplying. So it is stated (in Is. 45:18): <small>HE DID NOT CREATE IT AS A VOID; HE FORMED IT FOR HABITATION</small>. What did the Holy One do? He put a sexual desire for Eve into the heart of Adam. So he had intercourse with her, and she bore Seth. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:3): <small>WHEN ADAM HAD LIVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS, HE BEGOT &lt; A SON &gt; IN HIS OWN LIKENESS {IN} [AFTER] HIS IMAGE</small>. When Seth was born, Adam said: I did not ascribe my former sons a lineage. Why? Because they were accursed. But to this one I am ascribing a lineage because he is the head of [the] generations. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Gen. 5:1-3): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM…. HE BEGOT &lt; A SON &gt; … AND CALLED HIS NAME SETH</small>.

Siman 27

[<small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS … AND ADAM LIVED … AND BEGOT &lt; A SON &gt; IN HIS OWN IMAGE AFTER HIS LIKENESS</small>.] From here they have said: Whoever has sexual intercourse with the spirits does nothing wrong. There is no fornication. Although he brought forth an issue of semen, it is like a nocturnal emission of fluid. And what is that which is written (in Exod. 20:13)? <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small> with the children of Adam and with cattle. Also <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small> with the hand or the foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Through masturbation. See <i>Nid</i>. 13b (Bar).</i> In regard to spirits, however, there is no fornication. Moreover, there is a story about a certain saint<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yShab</i>. 1:3 (3b); cf. below, 10:15.</i> whom a female demon (<i>shedah</i>) came across in the likeness of a woman. When she had enticed him,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The text, which reads, “When he had seduced him,” has been emended.</i> she had intercourse<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zugon</i> or <i>zeugos</i>.</i> with him; and it was the Day of Atonement. Now afterwards that saint was exceedingly remorseful until Elijah, of blessed memory, met him. He said to him: On what account are you depressed? He told him the whole story as it had happened to him. He said to him: You are acquitted. She was a demon. Now, if he had been guilty, Elijah, of blessed memory, [would not have] appeared to him, spoken with him, and acquitted him. [Rather] you may infer from this &lt; appearance &gt; that there was no fornication, and that he was acquitted.

Siman 28

(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:16): <small>&lt; AS &gt; MY LIFELESS FORM (<i>golem</i>), YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>. While Adam was lying as a lifeless form (<i>golem</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ARN</i>, A, 31; Gen. R. 24:2; <i>PR</i> 23:1; M. Pss. 139:16.</i> the Holy One showed him every generation with its preachers, every generation with its righteous, every generation with its wicked, up to &lt; the age &gt; when the dead are raised. He said to him (ibid.): Whatever <small>YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN, IN YOUR BOOK THEY WERE ALL WRITTEN DOWN, &lt; EVEN THE DAYS WHICH WERE ORDAINED &gt;</small>. And what is the meaning (of the end of the verse): <small>AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small>? R. Eliezer and R. Joshua disagree. [R. Eliezer &lt; following the written text &gt; says: <small>EVEN THE DAYS WHICH WERE ORDAINED, AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small> &lt; that belied what was written &gt;. The Holy One said: On this day I am redeeming my children from Egypt, and on this day I am dividing the sea and throwing down their enemies. On this day I am bestowing the Torah. Yet not one day was changed or transferred &lt; from what was written &gt;. Ergo, it says: <small>AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small>. R. Joshua &lt; following the oral text &gt; says: <small>AND ONE OF THEM WAS {NOT} [HIS OWN]</small>. Of the days which the Holy One created, he chose <small>ONE OF THEM</small> as <small>HIS OWN</small>. And which one was it? This was the Day of Atonement, as stated (in Is. 58:6): <small>IS NOT THIS THE FAST THAT I HAVE CHOSEN?</small>
Another interpretation (of the oral text to Ps. 139:16): <small>AND ONE OF THEM WAS [HIS OWN]</small>. This refers to the Sabbath day, as stated (in Exod. 21:11): <small>WHEREFORE THE LORD HAS BLESSED THE SABBATH DAY AND HALLOWED IT</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 139:16): <small>&lt; AS &gt; MY LIFELESS FORM, YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>. &lt; The verse implies &gt; that the Holy One showed the first Adam all the generations and put them in his book. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:1): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>.

Siman 29

(Job 37:7:) <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON'S HAND</small>. What does that mean? That when the Holy One created the human, he had all generations pass before him up until the dead would rise, the righteous and the wicked. He said to him: Look at how you have brought death upon the righteous. When Adam heard that, he began to be depressed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, have I also done this to your world? I have no concern over the wicked, that they should die, but over the righteous, lest they murmur against me. If you please, just do not record concerning me that I brought death upon them. The Holy One said to him: Thus shall I do: When someone is going to depart from this world, the Holy One appears to him. He says to him: Write down the deeds which you have done, since you are dying for the deeds which you have done. So he writes. When he has written, he says to him: Sign; and he signs, as stated (ibid.): <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON'S HAND</small>. Then, in the age to come, when the Holy One sits in judgment with his creatures, he will bring all the books of the children of Adam (mentioned in Gen. 5:1) and reveal their deeds to them. Therefore, it is stated (Job 37:7): <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON'S HAND</small>….

Siman 30

Another interpretation (of Gen. 5:1): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK &lt; OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 41:2): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND DONE IT? THE ONE WHO NAMED THE GENERATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. If the generations were worthy, the Holy One gave them their names just as he had given names to Adam and Eve. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:2): <small>AND HE GAVE THEM THE NAME ADAM</small>. You also find that when the Holy One sees a righteous one born, he gives him his name as a mark of honor. He named Noah because he was righteous, as stated (in Gen. 5:29): <small>AND HE CALLED HIS NAME NOAH</small>. He named Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 17:5): <small>BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ABRAHAM</small>. So also with Isaac, Jacob, Solomon, and Josiah. Thus it is stated (in I Kings 13:2): <small>BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN UNTO THE HOUSE OF DAVID; JOSIAH SHALL BE HIS NAME</small>. If the generations were worthy, he would give a name to each and every one; and from his name he would make known his works. Our masters have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 83b; <i>yRH</i> 3:9 (59a).</i> When R. Me'ir would see a person, he would learn his name, and from his name he would know his works. Once upon a time two students came to him, and one had the name Kidor. R. Me'ir said to his students: Beware of this Kidor. They said to him: He is a Torah scholar. He said to them: [Nevertheless], you yourselves beware of him. One day they went to the bathhouse and deposited their clothes with Kidor. He took their clothes and went away. When they came out, they did not find &lt; him &gt;. They went to their houses and put on other clothes. They came to R. Me'ir. R. Me'ir said to them: Why did you change your clothes? They said to him: We went to the bathhouse and deposited our clothes with Kidor, but he took them. He said to them: Did I not say to you: Beware of this man? They said to him: O our master, if you please, &lt; tell us &gt; how you knew. He said to them: From his name, for it is written (in Deut. 32:20): <small>FOR (<i>Ki</i>) A GENERATION (<i>dor</i>) OF PERVERSITY ARE THEY</small>…. So also you find in Egypt (in Numb. 3:21): <small>THE LIBNITE FAMILY</small>. At what time did he give them their names? When Pharaoh arose and worked them with clay and brick (rt.: <i>LBN</i>). Ergo: <small>THE LIBNITE (rt.: <i>LBN</i>) FAMILY</small>. (Deut. 32:20, cont.:) <small>AND THE SHIMEITE (rt.: <i>ShM</i>') FAMILY</small>. When they complained of the servitude, the Holy One heard (rt.: <i>ShM</i>') their prayer. (Deut. 32:27:) <small>AND THE HEBRONITE (rt.: <i>HBR</i>) FAMILY</small>, to whom the Divine Presence was allied (rt.: <i>HBR</i>). &lt;These examples &gt; are to teach you that if the generations were worthy, the Holy One would give them their names, as stated (in Is. 41:4): <small>THE ONE WHO NAMED THE GENERATIONS</small>….

Siman 31

Another interpretation (of Is. 41:4): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND PRODUCED</small>. The Holy One also told Rebekah what he was going to do, as stated (in Gen. 25:22f.): <small>SO SHE WENT TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD; AND THE LORD SAID TO HER: TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB</small>. Then he said to her: Esau I hate, and Jacob I love,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See Mal. 1:2f.; Romans 9:13; Gen. R. 63:7.</i> as stated (at the end of vs. 23): <small>AND THE ELDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER</small>. The Holy One made known to her everything &lt; about them &gt; before they were born. He said to her: You are like a field that is sown and thrives, so that the storehouses are full of grain and the stables<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>stabula</i>.</i> &lt; full of &gt; straw. He said: {She shall be the} [You shall be blessed like that] field which fills the barns with grain, and the stables<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> with straw. The Holy One said to Rebekah: Let there be prosperity in this belly, since it is going to fill up the Garden of Eden with righteous &lt; offspring &gt; and Gehinnom with wicked &lt; offspring &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB</small>. It is therefore stated (in Is. 41:4): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND PRODUCED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The two verbs are understood as referring to Jacob and Esau respectively.</i>

Siman 32

(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK</small>…. What did the Holy One do to Adam? He cast a sleep upon him and showed him Noah and all the unblemished, Abraham and all the proselytes, Isaac and all who sacrifice burnt offerings, Jacob and all tent dwellers, Moses and all the humble, Aaron and all the priests, Joshua and all the community leaders, David and all the kings, [Solomon and all the Judges]. Then, when he had seen them all, he awakened from his sleep. The Holy One said to him: Have you seen [these? By your life], all these righteous [are] coming forth from you. When he had told him this, his spirit was at rest. David said: Sovereign of the World, you have written me into the book of the first Adam, as stated (in Ps. 40:8 [7]): <small>THEN SAID I: LO, I HAVE COME. IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN CONCERNING ME</small>. Therefore I must utter a song to you, since it is stated: <small>THEN SAID I</small>. Now <small>THEN</small> can only be <small>A SONG</small> [according to what is stated (in Exod. 15:1): <small>MOSES SANG THEN</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><small>THEN</small> is understood as the object of the verb <small>SANG</small>.</i> &lt; David &gt; therefore praises<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> him (in Ps. 40:6 [5]): <small>YOU HAVE DONE MANY THINGS, O LORD MY GOD</small>.

(Gen. 6:5:) <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT HUMAN EVIL HAD BECOME GREAT ON THE EARTH</small>. Let our master instruct us: How great is the judgment against the wicked in Gehinnom? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>'Eduy</i>. 2:10): <small>THE SENTENCE</small> of the wicked in Gehinnom <small>IS TWELVE MONTHS</small>. These &lt; words&gt; are from the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ySanh</i>. 10:3 (29b); <i>PRK</i> 10:4.</i> Where is it shown from Scripture? Where it is written (in Is. 66:23): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHENEVER A MONTH &lt; FALLS &gt; IN ITS MONTH</small>, i.e., from that month to the same month &lt; in the following year &gt;. Ergo: twelve months. Thus it is stated (in Esth. 3:7): <small>FROM DAY TO DAY AND FROM MONTH TO MONTH &lt; EQUALS &gt; [TWELVE MONTHS]</small>. How were they judged? By fire and by snow, since it is stated (in Prov. 31:21): <small>SHE IS NOT AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW</small>. This is Gehinnom.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps because Mount Zalmon, a name which means “darkness” and can designate Gehinnom, is a place of snow in Ps. 68:15 [14]. Cf. M. Pss. 68:9.</i> Now they take that &lt; wicked one &gt; out of the snow and cast him into the midst of the fire. David said (in Ps. 40:3 [2]): <small>AND HE RAISED ME UP FROM THE PIT OF DESOLATION, FROM THE MIRY MUD</small>. And why is it called by the name <small>MIRY MUD (<i>YWN</i>)</small>? Because when they take them and cast them into the fire, they cry: <i>Vay</i> (<i>WY</i>). Then after that they cast them into the snow, and they cry: Vay. Its name is therefore called <small>MUD (<i>YWN</i>)</small>, a place where they say: <i>Vay, vay</i> (<i>WY</i>)! And where do they deliver their souls? Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said:<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">See M. Prov. 21.</i> In the midst of the snow, as stated (in Ps. 68:15 [14]): <small>IT SNOWS IN ZALMON</small>.

R. 28:8; 33:7; Lam. R. 1:14 (40); Seder ‘Olam R. 4.</i> &lt; The basis is &gt; that, just as the judgment of the former is to fire and to snow, [so the judgment of the latter was to fire and snow. Where is it shown that it was to fire?] Where it is stated (in Job 6:17): <small>THROUGH ITS HEAT THEY ARE OBLITERATED FROM THEIR PLACE</small>. And where is it shown that it was to snow? Where it is stated (in Gen. 7:12): <small>AND THERE WAS RAIN UPON THE EARTH</small>. And why so? Because by the measure with which a person measures one will measure out for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sot.</i> 1:7; <i>TSot.</i> 3:1; Matthew 7:2 // Luke 6:38; cf.

Idi: The verdict against the generation of the flood was not sealed until they wrote <i>gamika</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Greek.</i> {i.e., marriage contracts} for males and cattle. For that reason the waters came over them in the form of a woman. Thus it is stated (in Job 6:18): <small>THE WAYS OF THEIR COURSE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">These words may also denote ways of living.</i> <small>TURN ASIDE</small>. Now <small>TURN ASIDE</small> must imply a woman, since it is stated (in Ruth 3:8): <small>&lt; NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT &gt; THAT THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO TURNED HE ASIDE, AND HERE WAS A WOMAN</small>. And <small>WAYS</small> &lt; can &gt; only &lt; denote &gt; {a woman} [women], since it is stated (in Gen. 18:11): <small>THE WAY OF WOMEN &lt; HAD CEASED FOR SARAH &gt;</small>. So also <small>THEIR COURSE (<i>derekh</i>)</small>, since it is stated (in Gen. 31:35): <small>FOR THE PERIOD (<i>derekh</i>) WOMEN IS UPON ME</small>. Hence one may say: In the manner that they sinned retribution was exacted from them. You know yourself that it is so. See what is written (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY ALL THE SPRINGS OF THE GREAT ABYSS BURST FORTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GREAT</small>? &lt; That &gt; the Holy One said: Just as they have sinned greatly, so I have exacted retribution from them greatly. Where is it shown?

Where it is stated (in Ezek. 1:26): <small>[AND UPON THE LIKENESS OF THE THRONE WAS] A LIKENESS WITH THE APPEARANCE OF A PERSON UPON IT FROM ABOVE</small>. (Eccl. 2:21:) <small>WHOSE TOIL IS WITH WISDOM</small>, as stated (in Prov. 3:19): <small>THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED THE EARTH WITH WISDOM</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 15:3): <small>IN EVERY PLACE THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE OBSERVING THE EVIL AND THE GOOD</small>. It is also written (in II Chron. 16:9): <small>{EVERY PLACE THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE RANGING ABOUT.} [FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD RANGE OVER THE WHOLE EARTH]</small>. They watch the deeds of the righteous and the deeds of the wicked. <small>THE GOOD</small>: These are Noah and his children. <small>AND THE EVIL</small>: These are the generation of the flood.

Siman 36

Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:6): <small>FOR TO EVERY MATTER THERE BELONGS A TIME AND A JUDGMENT</small>. &lt; Why &gt;? Because the wicked provoke the Holy One when [they say]: The Holy One has sworn never to bring &lt; another &gt; flood; so we may do whatever we wish. And where is it shown that the Holy One has sworn? Where Isaiah says so (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS AS THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME; [FOR I HAVE SWORN THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH SHALL NO MORE PASS OVER THE EARTH]</small>. The Holy One sees how the wicked are provoking him. He regrets, as it were, what he had sworn and says: What shall I do now that I have sworn? Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 59:15): <small>AND THE TRUTH IS LACKING … [BUT THE LORD SAW IT, AND IT DISPLEASED HIM THAT THERE WAS NO JUDGMENT]</small>. Why did the Holy One say: <small>THE LORD SAW IT AND IT DISPLEASED HIM</small>? Why is it, as it were, <small>THAT THERE WAS NO JUDGMENT</small>? The Holy One said: The wicked ones in the world speak this way because I have sworn never to bring &lt; another &gt; flood. By your lives, I have other judgments to exact from you. So what does he do to the wicked? He drowns them in water, either in a river or in the midst of a cistern. For that reason it states (in Eccl. 8:6): <small>FOR TO EVERY MATTER THERE BELONGS A TIME AND A JUDGMENT</small>. For that reason it is also stated (in Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT HUMAN EVIL HAD BECOME GREAT ON THE EARTH</small>.

Siman 37

Another interpretation: <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: This text is related (to Prov. 28:5): <small>EVIL PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>: These are the generation of the flood, who were sinning without considering that retribution was coming upon them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING</small>. These are Noah and his children, who heard from the Holy One that he would bring the flood and stood in awe of the Holy One. Come and see why the Holy One told Noah and his children to make an ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 108ab.</i> &lt; He did so &gt; for them to see him while he was working on it and repent. Otherwise, could not the Holy One have rescued Noah through the heavens or through other means instead of telling him (in Gen. 6:14): <small>MAKE YOURSELF AN ARK OF GOPHER WOOD</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">The translation is emended slightly in agreement with <i>Aggadat Bereshit</i> 1:2. The Buber text translates as follows: Otherwise, could not the Holy One have rescued Noah through the heavens or through commands after he had told him: <small>MAKE YOURSELF AN ARK OF GOPHER WOOD?</small></i> (Gen. 6:16:) <small>AND YOU ARE TO MAKE A WINDOW</small> (for enlightenment)<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for <small>WINDOW</small> here (<i>tsohar</i>) can also carry the connotation of enlightenment.</i> <small>FOR THE ARK</small>. And why so? The Holy One said: For this reason: When I tell him to make an ark and he is busy at it, they will gather about him and say to him: Noah, what are you making? Then he will say to them: An ark, for the Holy One has told me that he is bringing a flood to the world because they are provoking him; and thereby they will repent. So the Holy One calculated, but they paid no attention to him. Ergo it says (in Prov. 28:5): <small>EVIL PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>.

Siman 38

Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: This text is related (to Eccl. 10:5): <small>THERE IS AN EVIL WHICH I HAVE SEEN UNDER THE SUN</small>. The Holy One said: See what these evil ones have done! I made two natures in people, a good drive and an evil drive. Thus it is stated (in Eccl. 9:14): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. R. 9:14/15:8; below, 11:1.</i> <small>A SMALL CITY</small>: This is the body. <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>: These are &lt; its &gt; members. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT</small>: This &lt; king &gt; is the evil drive. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>: These are sins. (Ibid., vs. 15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A [POOR WISE] PERSON {WHO WAS POOR, WILLING, AND WISE}</small>. This one is the good drive. (Ibid., cont:) <small>AND HE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>, in that it brings a person to life. (Ibid., cont:) <small>BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT &lt; THAT POOR PERSON &gt;</small>: This is the generation of the flood who did not accept the good drive for themselves.

Siman 39

Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: What is written above on the subject (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; &lt; AND NOAH BEGAT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 26:2.</i> Come and see all who preceded Noah. They were begetting at seventy, eighty, and a hundred years of age; but Noah begat at five hundred years. And why so? Noah had reflected on the children of Adam who would rise and provoke the Holy One. So he said: Why should I join in intercourse for fruitfulness and multiplying? Therefore, he did not beget until he was five hundred years old; but after that he said: Is this person to die without children? Now the Holy One has commanded Adam about fruitfulness and multiplying, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM, [AND GOD SAID TO THEM: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY]</small>; yet I am dying without children. What did Noah do? He joined in intercourse for fruitfulness and multiplying after five hundred years. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; [AND NOAH BEGAT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH]</small>.

Siman 40

(Gen. 6:3:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED IN HUMANS FOREVER</small>. Resh Laqish said: The Holy One said: I am not creating another soul for humans. Thus it is stated: <small>MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED IN HUMANS FOREVER</small>. R. Johanan said: What is the meaning of <small>SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 26:6.</i> When their souls come up to me, I do not restore them to their &lt; sheaths &gt;. Compare what is stated (in I Chron. 21:27): <small>THEN THE LORD COMMANDED THE ANGEL, AND HE PUT HIS SWORD INTO ITS SHEATH</small>. The Holy One said to them: You are doing evil to yourselves in that you are falling (<i>nophelim</i>) from the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 6:4): <small>THE NEPHILIM WERE IN THE EARTH</small>…. Why are they named <small>NEPHILIM (rt.: <i>NPL</i>)</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 26:7.</i>
Because they cause the world to fall (rt.: <i>NPL</i>). (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ALSO AFTER THAT … &lt; THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS &gt; BORE &lt; CHILDREN &gt; TO THEM</small>. R. Berekhyah said: "Bore of them" is not written here, but <small>BORE TO THEM</small>. &lt; These words &gt; teach that when a woman saw one of them, she immediately would become hot with passion towards him and bear &lt; children &gt;. Similarly Ezekiel said (in Ezek. 16:32): <small>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN &lt; RECEIVES STRANGERS INSTEAD OF HER HUSBAND &gt;</small>.
(Gen. 6:4, cont.:) <small>THESE WERE THE MIGHTY MEN THAT WERE OF OLD, THE MEN WITH A NAME</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; men whose names have been specified above (in Gen. 4:18): Mehujael, since the Holy One (i.e., <i>El</i>) blotted (<i>mihah</i>) their names from the world; Methushael (ibid.), since God (<i>El</i>) drove him out (<i>nethasho</i>). <small>THE MEN WITH A NAME</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Gen. 1:12.</i> because they were obstinate and rebellious against the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Job 21:14): <small>YET THEY SAY TO GOD: DEPART FROM US</small>…. R. Isaac said: Why were they rebellious? Because they would sow one year and it would produce a harvest for forty years. R. Samuel bar Ammi said: Why were they rebellious? Because they were seeing children and children's children; yet they &lt; themselves &gt; were not dying. The Holy One said: From now on (according to Gen. 8:22) <small>WHILE THERE ARE DAYS ON EARTH, &lt; THERE SHALL BE NO CESSATION OF &gt; SOWING AND HARVEST</small>; i.e., they were begetting and burying. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>COLD AND HEAT</small>; i.e., &lt; while &gt; afflictions had not come upon them, from now on they would be afflicted by fire and snow.

Siman 1

(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>. [Let our master instruct us: For how many transgressions do women die at the time of their childbirth? Thus] have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 2:6):<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:1.</i> <small>WOMEN DIE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CHILDBIRTH FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS: [BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CAREFUL IN REGARD TO MENSTRUATION, IN REGARD TO THE <i>HALLAH</i></small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priest’s share of the dough.</i> <small>AND IN REGARD TO THE LIGHTING OF THE &lt; SABBATH &gt; LAMP</small>. These three commandments are also from the Torah.] Where is it shown about menstruation? Where it is stated (in Lev. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>. And where is it shown about the <i>hallah</i>? Where it is stated (in Numb. 15:20): <small>YOU SHALL SET ASIDE THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH AS A <i>HALLAH</i> OFFERING</small>. And where is it shown about the Sabbath lamp? Where it is stated (in Is. 58:13): <small>AND YOU CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>. And why are the women charged with regard to these commandments?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.R. 17:8; <i>yShab</i>. 2:4 (5b).</i> Our sages have said: In the creation of the world Adam was first. Then came Eve, and she shed his blood in that he had heeded her. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND TO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. The Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of menstrual blood [so that she may have atonement] for that blood which she shed. And why the commandment of the <i>hallah</i>? Because Adam was the <i>hallah</i> of the world when she came and defiled him,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 14:1.</i> the Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of <i>hallah</i> so that she may have atonement for the <i>hallah</i> of the world, which she defiled. And where is it shown that Adam is the <i>hallah</i> of the world? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Hal</i>. 3:1): <small>ONCE THE WOMAN PUTS WATER</small> into the dough, <small>SHE IS TO REMOVE HER <i>HALLAH</i></small>. Thus did the Holy One do. R. Jose ben Qetsarta said: Once the Holy One put water on the ground, he immediately removed Adam as his <i>hallah</i> from the ground. Thus it says (in Gen. 2:6): <small>BUT A MIST (<i>'D</i>) WENT UP FROM THE EARTH. THEN</small> immediately (in vs. 7) <small>THE LORD GOD FORMED &lt; THE HUMAN (<i>'DM</i>) OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND &gt;</small>…. And the commandment of the lamp exists because Adam was the lamp of the Holy One, as stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>THE LAMP OF {GOD} [THE LORD] IS THE BREATH OF ADAM</small>. But Eve came and extinguished it. The Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of the lamp in order that she may have atonement for the lamp which she extinguished. Thus women have been charged with the commandments of the Sabbath lamp. The Holy One said: If you are careful with the Sabbath lamp, I also will be shining for you, as stated (in Is. 60:19): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</small>.
(Is. 41:2:) <small>WHO HAS AROUSED RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE EAST, IS CALLING HIM TO HIS FEET</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen.

Because his whole generation was wicked; and from all of it I found only one, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE</small>. Were there two? Only one with his righteousness. And so the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:11): <small>ABRAHAM! ABRAHAM</small>! Why two times? Because Abraham was righteous from his beginning to his end. Similarly &lt; we read &gt; (in Gen. 46:2): <small>JACOB! JACOB</small>! similarly (in Exod. 3:4): <small>MOSES! MOSES</small>! and similarly (in I Sam. 3:10): <small>SAMUEL! SAMUEL</small>! They were righteous from their beginning to their end. &lt; Where is it shown &gt;?

Siman 2

(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>: Thus did R. Tanhuma bar Abba open &lt; his teaching &gt; in the academy: It is written (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 30:6.</i> R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:2.</i> When a righteous one is passing from the world without offspring, he is depressed and weeping. The Holy One says to him: For what reason are you depressed and weeping? For the reason that you have not raised up the fruit of offspring? In this world I have fruit more beautiful than offspring. Then he says to him: Sovereign of the World, what is that fruit? The Holy One says to him: This is &lt; the &gt; Torah, in which you were busy, for thus it is written: <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. Now there is no tree of life but Torah, as stated (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&lt; WISDOM &gt; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. Who is this &lt; righteous one &gt; ? This is Noah. Our masters have said: Noah did not die until he had seen all the world in its entirety with its population,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:2, which explains in this context that the Holy One treats a person with due consideration to ancestors and descendants. So also Gen.

See <i>‘Arakh</i>. 9:6.</i> of Sepphoris, not until he had seen the seventy peoples who would go out from his loins; and of all these only he had his righteousness mentioned, as stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH: [NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT]</small>. Shem, Ham, and Japheth &lt; appear &gt; (in the next verse), &lt; but &gt; only his (Noah's) righteousness is recorded here. Thus it is stated: <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. You yourself know that the above verse (Prov. 11:30) speaks about Noah, since there is written at the end of it: <small>AND A WISE ONE WINS SOULS</small>. Now this was Noah, since he had won souls. Thus he nurtured and fed them. And what did he feed them? R. Aqiva says: He fed fig cake to all of them, human, cattle, beast, and fowl, as it is stated (in Gen. 6:21): <small>AND IT SHALL BE FOOD FOR YOU AND FOR THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 31:14.</i> Now what is &lt; the one &gt; thing of which the children of Adam eat as well as the cattle, the beast, and the fowl? Thus he (Aqiva) says: This is fig cake. But our masters say: No! Rather each and every species ate what it had been used to: the camel, straw; the donkey, barley; the elephant, vine wood; the ostrich, glass. Ergo it says (in Prov. 11:30): <small>AND A WISE ONE WINS SOULS</small>.
Another interpretation: <small>AND &lt; A WISE ONE &gt; WINS SOULS</small>: Some cattle would eat at the first hour in the day, some at the second &lt; hour &gt; of the day, some at the third &lt; hour &gt; of the day, and some at cockcrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh</i>. 108b; Gen.

Thus it says (in Prov. 11:30): <small>AND &lt; A WISE ONE &gt; WINS</small> (the care of) <small>SOULS</small>. This one is Noah.

(Prov. 11:31:) <small>BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH. BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE</small>: This is Noah, since it is stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. Because he was diligent [in making] the ark, he was immediately recompensed, as stated (in Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>. R. Huna said: When he came out of the ark, he gave a heartfelt groan,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>BQ</i> 80a.</i> since it is stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT</small>.

The Holy One said: The righteous one angers him for an hour and immediately becomes reconciled; but in the case of the generation of the flood, not one of them survived. The Holy One said: What caused Noah to escape? The righteousness which he had. (Gen. 6:9:) <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>: What is written on the matter above (in vs. 6)? <small>AND THE LORD REPENTED (<i>wayyinnahem</i>) FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN &lt; ON THE EARTH &gt;</small>. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 27:4.</i> R. Judah says: The Holy One repented, as it were, over having made the human. The Holy One said: If I had created him in the heavens, he would not have sinned, even as the angels do not sin. For that reason <small>THE LORD REPENTED</small>. For what reason? <small>FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN ON THE EARTH</small>; for, if he had been in the heavens, he would not have sinned. But R. Nehemiah said: What is the meaning of <i>wayyinnahem</i> (rt.: <i>nhm</i>)? It is a word meaning "comforted" (rt.: <i>nhm</i>). Why so? The Holy One said: I am comforted that I made the human on earth, because if I had made him in the heavens and had had him dwell with the angels, he would have incited them to rebellion, even as he rebelled with the earthly beings. I was, therefore, comforted because I had created him on the earth, as stated: <small>AND THE LORD WAS COMFORTED (<i>wayyinnahem</i>) &lt; FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN ON THE EARTH &gt;</small>. R. Aha b. R. Hanina said: When the Holy One saw that his world was ruined, he, as it were, lamented and grieved over it. Similarly you say (in II Sam. 19:3): <small>THE KING IS GRIEVED OVER HIS SON</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE</small> (the <small>LORD</small>) <small>WAS GRIEVED IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Abbahu said: He only lamented over the human heart. Like one who had made something inferior, &lt; the Holy One &gt; knew that he had not made something right, and said: What have I made? So, may the name of the Holy One be blessed, I am the one who put the evil leaven in the dough (according to Gen. 8:21): <small>FOR THE INSTINCT OF ONE'S HEART IS EVIL FROM HIS YOUTH</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE WAS GRIEVED IN HIS HEART</small>, [in the heart] of Adam.
(Gen. 6:7:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY &lt; WHICH I CREATED &gt;</small>. "I will cut off," "I will annihilate," "I will kill," &lt;or&gt; "I will destroy" is not written here, but <small>I WILL BLOT OUT (rt.: <i>MHH</i>)</small>. R. Berekhyah said: The heavenly creatures are water within water, and the lower creatures are dust and ashes. Now how does water behave? It descends upon the dust and blots &lt; it &gt; out. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as the &lt; creatures of &gt; dust have rebelled against me, behold, I am bringing down water upon them and blotting them out, as stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY &lt; WHICH I CREATED &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>. Gen. 2:5.</i> Why is he given the name <small>RIGHTEOUS</small>? Inasmuch as he fed the creatures of the Holy One, he became like his Creator. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 11:7): <small>FOR THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS; HE LOVES RIGHTEOUS DEEDS</small>. So also Joseph. Inasmuch as he fed the creatures for seven years, he was called righteous, as stated (in Amos 2:6): <small>BECAUSE THEY SELL A RIGHTEOUS &lt; ONE &gt;</small> (i.e., Joseph) <small>FOR SILVER</small>. {Thus, because he fed the creatures for seven years, he was therefore called righteous.}

Siman 5

(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; [NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN]</small>. Why the twofold <small>NOAH NOAH</small>? Because his children were righteous like him. R. Aha bar Ze'era said: Would you say the children of Noah were righteous, seeing that the generation of the flood was born in wickedness! Even as one would go unto a wife who was not his own, so would the cattle go to another species which was not their own. And where is it shown that the cattle were commanded not to go unto a species which was not their own? Where it is stated (in Gen. 1:25): <small>AND GOD MADE THE BEAST OF THE EARTH AFTER ITS SPECIES, &lt; THE CATTLE AFTER THEIR SPECIES &gt;</small>…. The Holy One <small>SAID</small>: You are permitted to be joined with your own species, but with another species it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:5.</i> The cattle, beasts, and fowl who entered the ark, however, were righteous in that they had been joined, not with another species, but only with their own. R. Pinhas bar Hiyya the Priest said: For thus it is written (in Gen. 8:19): <small>THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES</small>. Did the cattle actually have families as it states: <small>ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES</small>! &lt; These words mean &gt; simply that only those which were joined with their own species were worthy of entering the ark.

(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS [OF NOAH; NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT IN HIS GENERATIONS]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS GENERATIONS</small>? Some interpret &lt; the phrase &gt; to his praise, and some interpret &lt; it &gt; to his shame, &lt; i.e., &gt; <small>IN HIS GENERATIONS</small> but not in other generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 108a; Gen. R. 30:9.</i> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? If one should put a silver <i>sela'</i> among [a hundred] <i>sela'im</i> of copper, the one of silver would seem beautiful. Thus did Noah seem righteous in the generation of the flood. &lt; Then &gt; how do some interpret it to his praise? &lt; The situation is comparable &gt; to a young woman who dwelt in the harlot district and remained pure (<i>kasher</i>). If she had been in a quarter where decent young women (<i>kesehrot</i>) &lt; dwelled &gt;, how much the more &lt; would she have remained pure &gt;. &lt; The situation &gt; is like a jar of balsam<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>balsamon</i>; Lat.: <i>balsamum</i>.</i> which was put in a tomb where its aroma was good. If it had been in a house, how much better &lt; would its aroma have been &gt; !
(Gen. 6:9:) <small>&lt; NOAH &gt; WAS … PERFECT</small>, in that he was born circumcised. Ten children of Adam were born circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For details of this well-known tradition, see <i>Tanh</i>.,Gen. 2:5; <i>ARN</i>, A, 2:5; cf. M. Pss. 9:7; <i>Sot</i>. 12a.</i>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; NOAH</small>: Why two times? The Holy One said: &lt; It was &gt; in order to persuade<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>peithein, peisai</i> in the aorist.</i> all those who enter the world, lest they think of saying: He was only righteous in his generation. The Holy One said: For me he is the equal of Abraham. R. Judah bar Shallum [the Levite] said: &lt; His name &gt; is stated two times (in Gen. 22:11): <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM</small>. So also with Jacob (in Gen. 46:2); so also with Moses (in Exod. 3:4); so also with Samuel (in I Sam. 3:10); so also with Noah (here in Gen. 6:9). &lt; The double name is used &gt; in order to give equality to the righteous ones.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH; NOAH:</small> &lt; One &gt; <small>NOAH</small> is<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 30:5.</i> concerning this world; &lt; the other &gt; <small>NOAH</small> is concerning the world to come. The Holy One said: When we come to comfort Jerusalem, I have sworn by the righteousness of Noah never again to enslave its children. Thus it is stated (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS AS THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME: &lt; AS I SWORE THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH SHOULD NEVERMORE GO OVER THE EARTH, SO I SWEAR THAT I WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU OR REBUKE YOU &gt;.</small>

Siman 7

(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. [Let our master instruct us: In the case of one who sees the bow in the clouds, what blessing must he say?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:6.</i> Thus] have our masters taught: One who sees a bow in the clouds must say a blessing. What blessing does he say? Blessed be the one who remembers the covenant, is trustworthy in his covenant, and has stood by his word. This is from the Mishnah,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Actually the blessing is found, not in the Mishnah, but in the <i>gemara, Ber</i>. 59a.</i> but where is it shown from the Torah? The text reads (in Gen. 9:13): <small>I HAVE SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUD, AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN OF A COVENANT &lt; BETWEEN ME AND THE EARTH &gt;</small>. The conduct of the Holy One is not like the conduct of flesh and blood. In what respect? With flesh and blood, as long as one's close friend is alive, love has its place; and if one dies, love ceases. The Holy One, however, is not like that. When Abraham died, his (the Holy One's) love was preserved for his son Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>.
Another interpretation: When someone poor seeks alms from a human, he gives him &lt; enough for &gt; a day or two, a month, or a year; but the Holy One gives a person food for as long as he lives.
Another interpretation: When the king loves someone, he honors him with silver, gold, and garments so as to make [him wealthy]. Then, while he is traveling by ship, the wind comes and destroys the ship. Where &lt; now &gt; is the king's gift? Here he had honored him and enriched him. Could he possibly have saved him from the sea? Or from robbers?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai</i>.</i> But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he gives one a gift, he protects him, as stated (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. He blessed Abraham and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>&lt; NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS &gt;, AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS</small>. He blessed Isaac and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. He blessed Jacob and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN [… AND BLESSED HIM]</small>.
Another interpretation: Someone boards a ship and there are cattle with him. Now, if a storm arose at sea, what would they do? They would cast the cattle into the sea and save the human, since they do not take pity on cattle as they would take pity on a human. But the Holy One is not like that. Just as he takes pity upon the human, so he takes pity upon the cattle. You know yourself that this is so. When the Holy One wanted to destroy his world in the generation of the flood, when they had sinned, he considered humanity as equal to the cattle, since it is stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT [… HUMANITY TOGETHER WITH CATTLE]</small>. When he came to be reconciled, just as he was reconciled to the children of Adam and took pity upon them; so he showed pity to the cattle, according to what we have read on the matter (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH &lt; … AND ALL THE CATTLE &gt;</small>.

Siman 8

[(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> (literally: <small>MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>); &lt; <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP; HUMAN AND BEAST YOU DELIVER, O LORD &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:5; Gen. R. 33:1; Exod. R. 14:2; Lev. R. 27:1; Numb. R. 1:1; <i>PRK</i> 9:1.</i> &lt; The passage&gt; is speaking allegorically about the righteous in their dwelling and speaking allegorically about the wicked in their dwelling. It speaks allegorically about the righteous [in their dwelling]. (So in Ezek. 34:14:) <small>I WILL FEED THEM IN A GOOD PASTURE, [AND UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF] &lt; THE LOFTY ONE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE THEIR FOLD &gt;</small>. It speaks allegorically about the wicked [in their dwelling]. (So in Ezek. 31:15:) <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD [GOD]: IN THE DAY THAT HE WENT DOWN TO SHEOL, I CAUSED HIM TO MOURN; [I COVERED HIM WITH THE DEEP]</small>. R. Judah bar Hama said: With what does one cover a vat? With &lt; a lid of &gt; its own kind &lt; of material &gt;. Certainly not with another article of silver or gold! Thus Sheol is darkness, and the deep which covers it is darkness. The wicked also, who are in its midst, are darkness, as stated (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>. Darkness will come, and darkness will cover &lt; them up &gt;.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. There is a story about R. Joshua bar Levi. When he went up to Rome and entered a certain palace,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>palation</i>; Lat.: <i>palatium</i>.</i> he saw marble columns there which were covered with carpets<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>tapetes</i>.</i> so that they would not crack in the heat and contract &lt; and break &gt; in the cold. He went out of there and found a certain poor person with a reed mat under him and a reed mat over him. Over the columns he cited (Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> (i.e., almsgiving) <small>IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Wherever you give, &lt; you &gt; bestow in abundance. Over the poor person he cited (ibid.): <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. Wherever you afflict, you deal strictly.
Another interpretation: <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. R. Aqiva said: The righteousness (i.e., mercy) which you have appointed for us is for the world to come because we have received your judgments in this world.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>: These are the deeds of the righteous. As the mountains are &lt; clearly &gt; visible, so are the deeds of the righteous &lt; clearly &gt; visible, as stated (in Ps. 72:5): <small>&lt; BECAUSE &gt; THEY FEAR YOU, THEY ARE IN THE SUN</small>. (Ps 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the deeds of the wicked. As the deep is darkness, so are the works of the wicked, as stated (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. As the mountains are sown and bear fruit, so also the works of the righteous bear fruit. Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:10): <small>TELL THE RIGHTEOUS THAT &lt; ALL IS &gt; WELL, FOR THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WORKS</small>. (Ps. 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. As the deep neither is sown nor bears fruit, so also the works of the wicked do not bear fruit. Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:11): <small>WOE TO THE WICKED; &lt; ALL IS &gt; ILL</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 7:16-20 // Luke 6:43-44; Matthew 12:33.</i>
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. R. Simeon bar Johay said:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 36:5.</i> Just as the mountains hold down the deep so that it does not rise and flood the world, so righteousness holds down divine justice and retribution so that they do not come into the world. <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> is over your judgments as <small>THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> are over the great deep.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; &lt; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &gt;</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said: The righteousness (i.e., mercy) which you showed with Noah in the ark caused his ark to rest for him upon the mountains, as stated (in Gen. 8:4): <small>AND THE ARK RESTED [… UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF ARARAT]. YOUR JUDGMENTS</small> are those which you carried out with the generation of the flood. You dealt strictly with them &lt; even &gt; unto the deep, as stated (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY [ALL THE FOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT DEEP] BURST APART</small>. Then after the retributions, behold {it says} (in Ps. 36:7 [6], end): <small>HUMAN AND BEAST YOU DELIVER, O LORD</small>. When? When (in Gen. 8:1) <small>GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>.

Siman 9

(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 10:7): <small>THE REMEMBRANCE OF A RIGHTEOUS ONE IS FOR A BLESSING</small>. This is Noah, concerning whom it is written (in Gen. 6:9): <small>A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. (Prov. 10:7, cont.:) <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>. This is the generation of the flood, which rotted from the world, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT &lt; ALL LIVING THINGS &gt;</small>. And what is the meaning of <small>HE BLOTTED OUT</small>? Compare what is stated (in Exod. 17:14): <small>FOR I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT &lt; THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK &gt;</small>…. Ergo (in Prov. 10:7): <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>.

Siman 10

Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. It is written (in Prov. 12:10): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE KNOWS THE SOUL OF HIS CATTLE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 2:7.</i> The righteous one of the world (i.e., God) even understands the soul of his cattle, even when he is angry. The characteristics the Holy One are not like flesh-and-blood character. In the case of flesh-and-blood character, when the province revolts against &lt; the king &gt;, he sends his legions<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legiones</i>.</i> and destroys it. So he treats the good and the evil equally as one, as there is no one present to say: Such and such a person is blameless. Leave him alone. Instead one kills them all. But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when the whole generation was provoking him, so that he was angry with them, and when only a single righteous one was present, he saved him. Thus it says (in Prov. 12:10): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE KNOWS THE SOUL OF HIS CATTLE</small>. So also it says (in Nahum 1:7): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD, A STRONGHOLD IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; AND HE KNOWS THOSE SEEKING REFUGE IN HIM</small>. (Prov. 12:10, cont.:) <small>BUT THE COMPASSION OF THE WICKED IS CRUEL</small>. These &lt; wicked &gt; are the generation of the flood, since they were cruel. Our masters have said: When the Holy One caused the deep to arise and they saw the fountains rising up over them, what did they do? They had a lot of children. So each and every one, taking his child, set him on the deep; but the waters prevailed. Thus it says: <small>BUT THE COMPASSION OF THE WICKED IS CRUEL</small>. [And where is it shown that they did this?] Where Job said so (in Job 24:20): <small>COMPASSION FORSAKES HIM; THE WORM SWEETLY FEEDS ON HIM; IT SHALL NO LONGER BE REMEMBERED</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; the compassion of the one whose children they were.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The usual interpretation of the verse renders <i>rhm</i> as “womb” rather than “compassion” and understands “him” as what is no longer remembered, but this translation makes more sense in the present context.</i> What did the Holy One do to them? He brought a flood down upon them from above and destroyed them. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS DESTROYED AS A TREE</small>. R. Berekhyah said: They were more than solid enough, and they had &lt; physical &gt; height (rt.: <i>QWM</i>). Thus, if he had not punished them from above, the waters would not have overcome them. Thus Job has said (in Job 22:20): <small>SURELY OUR ADVERSARIES (rt.: <i>QWM</i>) WERE DESTROYED, AND FIRE HAS CONSUMED THEIR REMNANT</small>. How so? When the Holy One saw that they had not died in the ocean depths below, he brought down fire upon them from above, which burned them up. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>SURELY OUR ADVERSARIES WERE DESTROYED, &lt; AND FIRE CONSUMED THEIR REMNANT &gt;</small>. Moreover, the fowl, the cattle, and the wild animals turned on them and they diminished their numbers, as stated (in Gen. 7:21): <small>AND ALL FLESH WAS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER</small>…. When they themselves saw that they were lost, they sought to overturn the ark. What did the Holy One do? He surrounded the ark with lionesses, which ate them, as stated (in Gen. 7:16): <small>AND THE LORD SHUT &lt; HIM &gt; IN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SHUT IN (rt.: <i>SGR</i>)</small>. &lt; Its meaning is &gt; like that used in the context (of Dan. 6:23 [22]): <small>MY GOD SENT THE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text reads <small>HIS</small>.</i> <small>ANGEL WHO SHUT (rt.: <i>SGR</i>) THE LIONS' MOUTHS</small>.

Siman 11

Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH, &lt; ALL THE BEASTS, AND ALL THE CATTLE &gt;</small>. If he remembered Noah, why &lt; also &gt; the beasts and the cattle? May the name of the Holy One be blessed, who never deprives any creature of its reward. If even a mouse has preserved its family<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As in English, the Hebrew word for “family” can also mean “species.”</i> and not intermingled with another species, it deserves to receive a reward. But all the people from the generation of the flood did mingle their families, as stated (in Gen. 6:12): <small>THEN GOD SAW THE WORLD; AND BEHOLD, IT WAS CORRUPT</small>. Thus, just as he had exacted retribution from the humans who had sinned, so he exacted retribution from the cattle, the beasts, and the fowl. And where is it shown that retribution was exacted from them? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT &lt; THE HUMANITY WHICH I CREATED FROM UPON THE FACE OF THE GROUND, HUMANITY TOGETHER WITH CATTLE, CREEPING THINGS, AND THE FOWL OF THE HEAVENS &gt;</small>…. And why all those? In order to teach you that they also had mingled their families and were having intercourse with species that were not their own, each and every species with a species that was not its own. Then the Holy One called Noah and said to him: Choose for yourself cattle, beasts, and fowl [from those] who have not mingled their families, as stated (in Gen. 7:2): <small>FROM EVERY CLEAN BEAST</small>, &lt; those &gt; just as clean as when they were created. Then, when they went out from the ark, the Holy One testified concerning them that they had not mingled their families. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 8:19): <small>THEY WENT OUT BY THEIR FAMILIES</small>. The Holy One, therefore, remembered them along with Noah, as stated (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH, &lt; ALL THE BEASTS, AND ALL THE CATTLE &gt;</small>.

Siman 12

(Gen. 8:1, cont.:) <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS &lt; OVER THE EARTH</small> &gt;. {Which wind? The Holy One passes over the wind} [Which one? The Holy One caused a wind to pass over the earth] and over the waters. Thus he restored them just as they were at their beginning. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS OVER THE EARTH, [AND THE WATERS SUBSIDED]</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 1:2): <small>AND THE WIND OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER FACE OF THE WATERS</small>. That very wind he caused to pass over them, and immediately they settled down.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS OVER THE EARTH, AND THE WATERS SUBSIDED</small>. They <small>SUBSIDED</small> in that the Holy One cooled his anger, [in the same way] that it is stated (in Esth. 7:10): <small>AND THE ANGER OF THE KING SUBSIDED</small>. And so he is going to do when he exacts retribution from the wicked and eradicates them from the world; however, he is creating the righteous as a new creation and setting within them a spirit, of which it is stated (in Ezek. 37:14): <small>AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. David said (in Ps. 104:29): <small>WHEN YOU HIDE YOUR FACE, {O LORD,} THEY ARE TERRIFIED; &lt; WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR SPIRIT, THEY PERISH AND RETURN UNTO THEIR DUST &gt;</small>. These are the wicked; but in regard to the righteous (according to Ps. 104:30): <small>WHEN YOU SEND FORTH YOUR SPIRIT, THEY ARE CREATED</small>. The Holy One said: In this world I exacted retribution from the wicked because they rebelled against me and I eradicated them from the world; but for Noah, his children, [and his descendants] I have done a good deed. Also, in the world to come I am exacting retribution from the wicked and doing a good deed for the righteous, for so has Isaiah stated (in Is. 40:10): <small>BEHOLD, THE LORD GOD COMES IN MIGHT</small>…. These &lt; words &gt; concern the nations of the world. For the righteous, however, (these words of ibid., cont. apply): <small>BEHOLD HIS REWARD IS WITH HIM AND HIS RECOMPENSE BEFORE HIM</small>.

Siman 13

[(Gen. 8:15:) <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH, SAYING: GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.] {Our masters have taught} [Let our master instruct us]: Is it permitted &lt; for one &gt; to put tasteless spittle<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., spittle of one who has not eaten. See <i>Nid</i>. 9:7.</i> upon the eye on the Sabbath?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:8; <i>Shab</i>. 108b.</i> R. Hiyya bar Abba said: It is forbidden to put tasteless spittle upon the eye on the Sabbath because he would be like one who heals on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mark 3:1-6 &amp; //s.</i> Come and see that there is no affliction in the world for which there is no cure. Then what is the cure for the evil drive? Repentance. R. Judah bar Shallum said in the name of R. Eliezer: Three things nullify a harsh decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySanh</i>. 10:2 (28c); Gen. R. 44:12; Eccl. R. 5:6:1; 7:14:1.</i> These are the following: prayer, repentance, and almsgiving. R. Huna b. R. Jose said: Also a change of name and good works. For that reason the Holy One was waiting for the generation of the flood, in case they should repent and he accept them. But since they did not repent, he blotted them out with water, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. He left Noah and his sons as a remnant in the ark. When the waters came to rest, Noah had to go out of the ark. Noah said, however: I entered with authorization [from the Holy One], as stated (in Gen. 7:1): <small>COME YOU &lt; AND ALL YOUR HOUSE INTO THE ARK &gt;</small>. So shall I now go out without authorization? The Holy One said to him: Are you seeking permission? Here is permission for you, {as stated} [concerning which we have read on the matter] (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.

Siman 14

(Gen. 8:16:) <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:14; see Gen. R. 34:1.</i> &lt; The verse &gt; is speaking about Noah when he was in the ark. Noah said to the Holy One: <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>; for he had been imprisoned there. R. Levi said: The whole twelve months that Noah was in the ark, neither he nor his children tasted a bit of sleep because they were responsible for feeding the cattle and the wild animals. R. Abba bar Kahana said:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 31:14.</i> He brought branches for the elephants and glass for the ostriches into the ark to feed the cattle and the wild animals. Now some of them ate in the second hour of the night, and some of them ate in the third hour of the day. Hence you yourself know that Noah did not taste a bit of sleep. R. Johanan said in the name of R. Eleazar b. R. Jose the Galilean: One time, when Noah was late in feeding the lion, the lion bit him; and he went away limping. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND NOAH ONLY [SURVIVED]</small>. R. Huna said in the name of R. Jose: When Noah went forth from the ark, he gave a heartfelt groan. He therefore said (according to Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON…. THROUGH ME SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS WEAR A CROWN</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; through me shall the righteous take up a crown in the world. For they said: What! If in the case of Noah, who was righteous [but not completely righteous], the Holy One so performed miracles for him—Thus it is stated (in Job 22:30): <small>HE SHALL DELIVER THE ONE THAT IS NOT INNOCENT, AND HE SHALL BE DELIVERED [THROUGH THE PURITY OF YOUR HANDS]</small>, since he was innocent and not innocent. R. Hanina b. R. Aha said: <i>Uncia</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Latin; cf. Gk.: <i>ougkia</i>.</i> (i.e., a little) merit was in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 29:1.</i> &lt; If God did miracles for Noah &gt;, how much the more, in the case of one who { was } [is] completely righteous, would the Holy One perform miracles for him. Thus it says (in Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>THROUGH ME SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS WEAR A CROWN, FOR YOU SHALL REWARD ME</small>.
R. Judah bar Il'ay said: If I had been there, I should have broken the ark to get myself out of there.
(Gen. 8:5:) <small>IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS BECAME VISIBLE</small>, but he did not go out from there. Instead he waited in the ark for him (i.e., for the Holy One) to give him permission. The Holy One said to him: Are you seeking permission? (Gen. 8:16:) <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.

Siman 15

Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:2-3): <small>I &lt; SAY &gt;: KEEP THE KING'S COMMAND, AND BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, &lt; DO NOT BE DISMAYED &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:10; Lev. R. 33:6.</i> The Holy Spirit said to them: I made you swear that if a kingdom makes decrees over you, you shall not rebel against it in respect to anything which it has commanded concerning you. Rather, <small>I &lt; SAY &gt;: KEEP THE KING'S COMMAND</small>. However, if it commands you to abolish the Torah, the commandments and the Sabbath, do not obey them. <small>I &lt; SAY &gt; KEEP THE KING'S COMMAND</small>, in respect to anything which is necessary, but <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, DO NOT BE DISMAYED. LEAVE HIS PRESENCE; [DO NOT REMAIN IN SOMETHING EVIL]</small>. Why? Because they will not separate you from the commandments, unless you deny the Holy One. Ergo: <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD</small>. And thus did Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah do when Nebuchadnezzar set up the image. They said to him: What do you think? That when you cast us into the midst of a fiery furnace, the Holy One will not save us? Whether he saves or does not save us, we will not bow down to the image. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 3:17): <small>IF OUR GOD WHOM WE SERVE IS ABLE TO SAVE US, HE SHALL SAVE US FROM THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE AND FROM YOUR HAND. O KING</small>. It is also written after this (in vs. 18): <small>BUT IF NOT, BE IT KNOWN TO YOU, O KING, THAT WE SHALL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS NOR PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to them: Are you telling the truth? It is so stated (in vs. 14): <small>IS IT TRUE, SHADRACH, MESHACH, &lt; AND ABEDNEGO &gt;</small>? They said to him: <small>WE DO NOT {CARE} [NEED] TO ANSWER YOU IN THIS MATTER</small>. They said to him: With respect to whatever you may decree for us, crop taxes,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>annona</i>.</i> imposts, poll taxes, we shall obey you; but with regard to denying the Holy One, we will not obey you. (Eccl. 8:2f.:) <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, DO NOT BE DISMAYED. LEAVE HIS PRESENCE</small>. When he heard that from them, he began to be angry, as stated (in Dan. 3:19): <small>THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS FILLED WITH RAGE</small>. When they had heated the furnace, they threw them in bound. When they had descended into the midst of the furnace, they raised their eyes to the Holy One, Blessed Be He, and said: Sovereign of the Universe, you know that we have not trusted in our works but in your name. (Ps. 115:1:) <small>NOT UNTO US, O LORD, NOT UNTO US, BUT UNTO YOUR NAME GIVE GLORY</small>…. Behold now, this wicked man had assembled all the tongues, as stated (in Dan. 3:3): <small>THEN WERE ASSEMBLED THE SATRAPS</small>…. {(Ps. 115:2:) <small>WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY &lt; WHERE NOW IS THEIR GOD &gt;</small> ?} Immediately the angels wanted to go down to free them. The Holy One said to them: Was it for your name that they descended (into the furnace)? For my name they descended, and I will descend to free them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 146:7): <small>[THE ONE WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED]…. THE LORD FREES THOSE WHO ARE BOUND</small>. The Holy One freed them immediately, flooded the furnace, and raised them up.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 92b (bar.), according to which the furnace was raised.</i> Then he leveled it (the furnace) to the ground, since it was deep. When the angel saw that, he said to them: Come out of there; for behold, the Holy One has freed you, performed miracles for you, and leveled the furnace to the ground. Come forth! They said to him: We are not coming forth without Nebuchadnezzar lest they say: They fled from the furnace. (Eccl. 8:2:) <small>I &lt; SAY &gt;: KEEP THE KING'S COMMAND</small>: With his permission we entered into here, and with his permission we are going forth. When Nebuchadnezzar came and saw them, he was astonished. He began crying out to them, as stated (in Dan. 3:26): <small>HE SPOKE AND SAID: SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO, SERVANTS OF THE GREAT GOD [GET OUT AND COME]</small>. "Get out and come up" is not written here, but <small>GET OUT AND COME</small>. Hence &lt; one may conclude &gt; that the furnace was leveled to the ground. They immediately said to the king: Now we will leave. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEN SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO CAME OUT [FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE]</small>. From whom had they learned &lt; what to do &gt;? From Noah, who had entered the ark with the permission of the Holy One. Now it is stated (in Gen. 8:15-16): <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH &lt; … &gt; GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. For when the earth had dried out and the ark had come to rest, as stated (in Gen. 8:4): <small>SO THE ARK CAME TO REST</small>, his sons said to him: Let us go out. He said to them: Heaven forbid! With the permission of the Holy One we entered, and with the permission of the Holy One we will leave. When the Holy One heard that, he immediately gave them permission, as stated (in Gen. 8:15-16): <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH &lt; … &gt; GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.

WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM?</small> Ergo (in Prov. 12:13): <small>IN THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LIPS LIES A SNARE FOR THE WICKED</small>.

This one is Noah, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.

Siman 17

Another interpretation (Gen. 8:16): <small>[GO FORTH FROM THE ARK].</small> David said to the Holy One (in Ps. 142:8 [7]): Sovereign of the World, <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:11; cf. Gen. R. 34:1.</i> When Noah was within the ark, he prayed constantly. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 32:6): <small>THEREFORE, LET EVERY SAINT PRAY TO YOU IN A TIME WHEN YOU MAY BE FOUND, THAT WHEN THE GREAT WATERS OVERFLOW, THEY WILL NOT REACH HIM</small>. And what did he pray? <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>. The Holy One said to him: It is a decree from me that twelve months be fulfilled (in the ark). Unless they are fulfilled, you are not going forth. Even so Isaiah has stated (in Is. 49:8f.): <small>IN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME I HAVE ANSWERED YOU … SAYING TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND: GO FORTH</small>. These (who were bound) are Noah and his sons, who were prohibited (literally: bound) from sexual intercourse.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 31:12; 34:7.</i> Joseph also acted in this way when he saw the years of famine that were going to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta‘an</i>. 11a.</i> He engaged in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying before they came, as stated (in Gen. 41:50): <small>AND UNTO JOSEPH WERE BORN TWO SONS BEFORE THE YEAR OF FAMINE CAME</small>. Likewise Noah and his sons, the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl acted in this way.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yTa‘an</i>. 1:6 (64d).</i> They did not engage in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying when they had entered the ark, for so had the Holy One commanded them when they had entered the ark. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 7:7): <small>AND THERE WENT INTO THE ARK NOAH AND HIS SONS</small>, the males by themselves; <small>ALSO HIS WIFE AND HIS SONS' WIVES</small>, the females by themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh</i>. 108b.</i> Thus all the days that Noah was in the ark, Noah, his sons, and all who were with him were prohibited (literally: bound) from sexual intercourse. The Holy One said to them: How can I be destroying the world in anger while you are building it up! When the flood passes on, however, you will engage in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying, as stated (in Is. 49:9): <small>SAYING TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND</small> (i.e., <small>PROHIBITED</small>): <small>GO FORTH</small>. So, when the earth had become dry, the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK, [YOU AND YOUR WIFE]</small> (with male and female mentioned together). Thus he released (i.e., permitted) them to be fruitful and multiply. And he also released the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>AND LET THEM ABOUND IN THE EARTH, BE FRUITFUL, AND MULTIPLY</small>. Noah said to him: Sovereign of the World, might you possibly bring &lt; another &gt; flood to the world? He said to him: Thus have I sworn: I am not bringing another flood, as stated (in Gen. 8:21): <small>THEN THE LORD SMELLED THE PLEASING ODOR; SO THE LORD SAID IN HIS HEART: I WILL NOT AGAIN CURSE THE GROUND ANY MORE</small>…. How did he swear to him? Our masters say he swore to him by the covenant of Abraham, which is cited (in Neh. 9:7): <small>AND YOU MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM</small> (Abraham). So also Isaiah said (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS LIKE THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME: [AS I SWORE THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH WOULD NEVERMORE GO OVER THE EARTH]</small>. You find, nevertheless, that forty days in every year these waters made a mark on the world until Solomon arose and built the Temple. Then those forty days ceased, as stated (in I Kings 6:38): <small>AND IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR IN THE MONTH OF BUL … &lt; THE HOUSE WAS FINISHED &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL</small>? In the month that the cattle are given mixed fodder (<i>BLYM</i>) from the house.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yRH</i> 1:2 (56d).</i> Another interpretation: <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL</small>: In the time that the earth turns into clods (<i>bulim bulim</i>). Another interpretation: <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL: &lt; BUL &gt;</small> is lacking the letter M to correspond with the forty days that were cut off from the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The letter M (<i>mem</i>) in Hebrew also represents the number forty. When <i>mem</i> is prefixed to <i>bul</i>, the word for flood results.</i> Now, if the Holy One has sworn to Noah by the covenant of our father Abraham and fulfilled &lt; the oath &gt;, he will certainly fulfill the three oaths he has sworn to Zion. These are the three oaths: {He swore by the covenant of our father Abraham, as stated (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS LIKE THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME</small>.} He swore by his own soul, so to speak, as stated (in Amos 6:8): <small>THE LORD GOD HAS SWORN BY HIS OWN SOUL</small>. He has also sworn by the Sabbath (<i>ShBT</i>), as stated (in Exod. 31:17): <small>&lt; IT &gt; (the Sabbath) IS A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FOREVER; FOR IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE RESTED (<i>ShBT</i>) AND WAS REFRESHED</small>. {And it is written} [And he has sworn by Torah, as stated] (in Is. 62:8): <small>THE LORD HAS SWORN BY HIS RIGHT HAND</small>. This is Torah, as stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND A FIERY LAW (<i>dat</i>) FOR THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber</i>. 6a.</i> And what did he swear to Jerusalem? That he would build it up. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 147:2): <small>THE LORD BUILDS UP JERUSALEM</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: It is an aggadic tradition that Jerusalem will not be built up until all the exiles are gathered. If someone says to you that all the exiles have been gathered but Jerusalem is not built up, do not believe &lt; him &gt;, since it is stated: <small>THE LORD BUILDS UP JERUSALEM</small>, and afterwards (ibid., cont.): <small>HE GATHERS THE EXILED ONES OF ISRAEL</small>. Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, has not Jerusalem already been built up and destroyed? He said to them: It was destroyed and you went into exile from it because of your sins. Now, however, I will build it up and never destroy it, as stated (in Ps. 102:17 [16]): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS BUILT UP ZION; HE HAS APPEARED IN HIS GLORY</small>.

(Gen. 9:18:) <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &lt; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; WERE &lt; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Gen. 2:12.</i> [Let our master instruct us: Who is the one commanded about being fruitful and multiplying, the man or the woman? Thus] have our masters taught (in <i>Yev</i>. 6:6): <small>THE MAN IS COMMANDED ABOUT BEING FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYING BUT NOT THE WOMAN</small>. R. Johanan ben Baroqah says: It says concerning both of them (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM, [AND GOD SAID TO THEM: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY]</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yTa‘an</i>. 7:9 (69c); <i>yMeg</i>. 1:6 (70c); Gen. R. 8:12.</i> However, the man is commanded more than the woman. You know yourself that it is so. Look at how Abraham showed a lot of determination in taking a wife for his son Isaac; for thus it says (in Gen. 24:2-4): <small>SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE … AND I WILL MAKE YOU SWEAR BY THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE HEAVENS … THAT YOU &lt; GO &gt; UNTO MY LAND &lt; WHERE I WAS BORN &gt;</small>…. Thus Abraham showed determination about being fruitful and multiplying. So also Isaac sent Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 28:2): <small>ARISE, GO TO PADDAN-ARAM, TO THE HOUSE OF BETHUEL</small>. He sent him to take a wife who was suitable for him. &lt; In doing so he was &gt; unlike the people of the flood generation, who were lecherous, who were going for what was indecent for them. See what is written (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE DIVINE SONS SAW &lt; HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES</small> &gt;. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as they have done this, let them perish from the earth. But why were the cattle destroyed with them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>BOTH HUMAN AND CATTLE</small>? Because the cattle also were acting immorally and going with species that were not their own, the horse with the donkey, the lion with the bull, the snake with the lizard.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 108a.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 6:12): <small>THEN GOD SAW THE EARTH, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS CORRUPT; [FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED ITS WAY UPON THE EARTH]</small>. It does not say "Every person," but <small>ALL FLESH</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; even the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl. Therefore, they were blotted out along with them. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Just as none but the righteous entered the ark,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh</i>. 108b.</i> so the cattle, wild beasts, and fowl who were with them were righteous, as stated (in Gen. 8:19): <small>&lt; THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; BY THEIR FAMILIES</small>. Do cattle have families? Only those cattle who had not joined themselves to another species entered the ark; therefore, the Holy One ascribed a lineage for them. So, if cattle, wild beasts, and fowl, who are nothing, were ascribed a lineage, was it not proper for Noah and his sons to be ascribed a lineage? The Holy One immediately ascribed them a {lineage, according to what is written} [lineage. Where is it shown? In what we have read] on the matter (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE SONS OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE &lt; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;</small>….

[Another interpretation (of Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &lt; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; EXISTED</small>.] This text is related (to Ezek. 26:21): <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE; YOU SHALL BE SOUGHT, BUT YOU SHALL NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN, SAYS THE LORD GOD</small>. &lt; The text &gt; is speaking about the nations of the world. What is the meaning of <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE</small>? The nations of the world had no existence and are not going to exist, as stated: <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE. HORRORS (<i>BLHWT</i>)</small> means "not to exist" (<i>BLHYWT</i>); <small>AND YOU ARE NO MORE</small> now. <small>YOU SHALL BE SOUGHT, BUT YOU SHALL NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN</small> in the world to come. But Israel had existence and is also going to exist. It existed before the world was created, as stated (in Ps. 74:2): <small>REMEMBER YOUR CONGREGATION WHICH YOU ACQUIRED OF OLD</small>. And it exists now, as stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY, ALL OF YOU</small>. You are also going to exist, as stated (in Mal. 3:17): <small>AND THEY SHALL BE MINE, SAYS THE LORD {GOD} [OF HOSTS], ON THE DAY THAT I PREPARE A PERSONAL TREASURE</small>. The nations of the world, however, had horrors (i.e., nonexistence) in that they did not exist in the world; but the children of Noah did have {purification} [existence] in the world, as stated (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &lt; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; EXISTED</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &lt; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; WERE &lt; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;</small>. R. Levi said: It was by virtue of what they had done in the ark that they went forth from the ark. But &lt; specifically &gt; for what? The whole twelve months that they spent in the ark they had been girding up their loins and feeding the cattle and the beasts. So it was by virtue of this that they went forth from the ark.
{Thus it is stated} (in Gen. 9:18): <small>THE CHILDREN OF NOAH, WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK, WERE [SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH]</small>. Was Shem really the oldest in that he comes first? Is it not also written (in Gen. 10:21): &lt; <small>AND UNTO SHEM &gt; … THE BROTHER OF JAPHETH, WHO WAS THE OLDEST</small>? Why &lt; then &gt; did Shem precede Japheth? Because he was worthy (<i>kasher</i>) and virtuous for his creator.
(Gen. 9:18, cont.:) <small>AND HAM IS THE FATHER OF CANAAN</small>. There is a tradition that R. Berekhyah said: <small>HAM IS THE FATHER OF CANAAN</small>: He is the father of a <i>peroah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The word denotes something shameful. Parallel accounts in Gen. R. 36:2 and <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i> on Gen. 9:18 read <i>pahatah</i>, a word denoting a degraded person. <i>Leqah Tov</i> on Gen. 9:18 reads <i>shefahot</i>, a word meaning “female slaves.” This interpretation may have been suggested by deriving “Canaan” from the verb <i>kana</i>‘, which means, “he was humbled.”</i> {(Gen. 9:19:) <small>THESE THREE WERE THE SONS OF NOAH</small>.}

He gave them their reward,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew words for reward (<i>SKR</i>) and for being drunk (<i>ShKR</i>) are similar.</i> a fringed &lt; Jewish &gt; shawl for Shem and a Greek cloak<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>fibula</i>, i.e., the <i>pallium fibulatum</i>.</i> for Japheth.
(Gen. 9:25:) <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Ham looked; is Canaan cursed?<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 36:7.</i> R. Judah said: The curse does not coexist with a blessing. &lt; Ham could not be cursed &gt; because it is stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED [NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. R. Nehemiah said:] Canaan had looked and told his father; so the curse had returned to its source. For that reason it is stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Our masters have said: When Noah was in the ark, he said: Oh, that my children had slaves so that, while they were seated, those &lt; slaves &gt; would go forth before them. When, however, I go out from the ark, whomever I beget I shall make into slaves for them. He said to him (Ham): You did not allow me to beget a fourth son who would be a slave for his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh</i>. 70a, according to which Rav maintained that Ham had castrated his father.</i> By your life, I am making your fourth son a slave. Thus it stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN; [A SLAVE OF SLAVES SHALL HE BE TO HIS BROTHERS]</small>. Resh Laqish said: Behold, those from Ham are slaves forever, but the children of Shem go forth into the world free. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 15:12, 17): <small>IF THERE IS SOLD TO YOU &lt; A FELLOW HEBREW, MAN OR WOMAN … IN THE SEVENTH YEAR YOU SHALL SET HIM FREE &gt;…. THEN YOU SHALL TAKE AN AWL &lt; AND PUT IT THROUGH HIS EAR INTO THE DOOR &gt;</small>. What is written there (in vs. 17)? <small>AND HE SHALL BE YOUR SLAVE FOREVER</small>. Here, however, is a slave of slaves, &lt; i.e., &gt; a slave who does not take his freedom and never goes away. What caused this curse for him? &lt; It came about &gt; because he had treated his father with contempt. So also the Holy One is going to exact punishment from the children of Ham and humiliate them at the hands of the king of Assyria, as stated (in Is. 20:4): <small>SO SHALL THE KING OF ASSYRIA DRIVE OFF &lt; THE CAPTIVES OF EGYPT AND THE EXILES OF NUBIA &gt; … [NAKED AND BAREFOOT]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>NAKED AND BAREFOOT</small>? That he would humiliate them and parade them naked. Now, in regard to Japheth, who honored his father, how does the Holy One repay him? When Gog (Japheth's descendant) comes, the Holy One will overshadow him and cover him over, as stated (in Ezek. 39:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY THAT I WILL GIVE UNTO GOG A BURIAL PLACE THERE IN ISRAEL</small>. And how did he reward Shem? When the sons of Aaron came in to offer sacrifice, their bodies (according to Lev. 10:2) were burned but their clothes were not burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Shab</i>. 113b; <i>Sanh</i>. 52a, according to which their bodies were not burned.</i> Why? Because they were children of Shem. That is how it is with the righteous. But where is it shown about the wicked? When Sennacherib went up to Jerusalem, and all his soldiers with him, their bodies were burned and their clothes were not burned. Why? Because they were children of Shem, as stated (in Gen. 10:22): <small>THE SONS OF SHEM ARE ELAM, ASSHUR, ARPACHSHAD, LUD, AND ARAM</small>.
(Gen. 9:27:) <small>MAY GOD ENLARGE (<i>YPT</i>) JAPHETH (<i>YPT</i>);</small> but, nevertheless, (ibid., cont.): <small>LET HIM DWELL IN THE TENTS OF SHEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 36:8.</i> Now all these things happened because of the wine. Thus, wherever you find wine, you find a downfall. And so with Noah &lt; it was &gt; on account of wine. And likewise with the tribes. When they sat down to eat, they sold their brother Joseph. So also in Shittim (according to Numb. 25:2): <small>AND &lt; THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB &gt; INVITED THE PEOPLE TO SACRIFICE TO THEIR GODS</small>. So also in the making of the golden calf, &lt; that too &gt; was on account of wine (according to Exod. 32:6): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK</small>. Moreover, the tribes only went into exile because of wine, as stated (in Is. 5:11): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO PURSUE STRONG DRINK</small>. (Amos 6:6:) <small>THOSE WHO DRINK &lt; STRAIGHT &gt; FROM THE WINE BOWLS</small>. And the tribes of Judah and Benjamin also only went into exile because of wine, as stated (in Is. 28:7): <small>AND THESE ALSO ARE MUDDLED BY WINE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world it has turned into a stumbling block, but in the world to come I am turning the wine into fresh grape juice, as stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev.

When she (the acquaintance) kisses and embraces him, his mother says: Indeed she does love me; so let my heart be with her. Thus it turns out that they make peace because of the <i>'eruv</i>. The Holy One said: I put peace in my world, but these wicked ones arose to put in dissension. And where is it shown that they took issue with the Holy One? From what they have read on the matter (in Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS</small>.

[(Gen. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 59:12 [11]): <small>DO NOT KILL THEM LEST MY PEOPLE FORGET; MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER AND BRING THEM DOWN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:17; cf.

David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, do not kill them by a death that you use on the rest of Adam's children; but {make them wander in the world} <small>[MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER]</small> to be homeless nomads in the world. <small>[AND BRING THEM DOWN:]</small> and bring them down from their arrogance. Why? (Ps. 5:11 [10]:) <small>BECAUSE THEY REBELLED AGAINST YOU</small>. (Ps. 59:13 [12]:) <small>FOR THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTH AND THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small> &lt; means &gt; that they had sinned with their mouth and again with their lips. Doeg said (in I Sam. 22:9): <small>I SAW THE SON OF JESSE COME TO NOB</small>…. Ahithophel said to Absalom (in II Sam. 16:21): <small>GO IN TO YOUR FATHER'S CONCUBINES….</small> &lt; That was &gt; <small>THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTH</small>, which they had sinned with their mouth. <small>THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small>: By the &lt; actual &gt; utterance on their lips.

Another interpretation: He spoke it against none other than the generation of the dispersion. (Ps. 59:12 [11]:) <small>DO NOT KILL THEM</small> by the death that you used on the generation of the flood. Rather (ibid., cont.): <small>MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER</small>.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small> &lt; means &gt; that they had sinned with their lips. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>LET THEM BE TRAPPED BY THEIR PRIDE</small>. {Thus it is stated.}

(Gen. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>.

Thus <small>HIS FOLLY WILL NOT LEAVE HIM</small>.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 27:22): <small>IF YOU POUND THE FOOL IN A MORTAR</small>. R. Nehemiah the son of R. Samuel bar Nahman said: To what are they comparable? To a full bottle when locusts climb up on it. The first &lt; climbed up &gt; and fell. [The second &lt; climbed up &gt; and fell. The third &lt; climbed up &gt; and fell.] But the second did not learn from the first {nor the second from the third} [nor the third from the second]. So are the wicked. The first arises, grows powerful, and falls; but the second does not learn from the first. Thus the generation of Enosh arose and cried out to idols, as stated (in Gen. 4:26): <small>THEN THERE WAS PROFANATION IN CALLING &lt; OTHER GODS &gt; BY THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is consistently understood in this sense throughout rabbinic literature.</i> What did the Holy One do?

So they perished from the world and did not learn from the generation of Enosh. [The generation of the dispersion arose and did not learn from the former generations.] Ergo (in Prov. 27:22): <small>IF YOU POUND THE FOOL IN A MORTAR WITH A PESTLE, ALONG WITH THE GRAIN</small>. This is the generation of the dispersion, in that they were bringing forth words of blasphemy against the Unique One of the world, as stated (in Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS</small>.

Another interpretation: <small>ONE LANGUAGE (<i>SPH</i>)</small>, in that they poured out (rt.: <i>ShPH</i>) retribution for the world. <small>[AND THE SAME WORDS</small>, which they uttered against the Unique One of the world.]
Another interpretation (of Gen. 11:1): <small>AND THE SAME</small> (<i>ehad</i> in the plural) <small>WORDS</small>, which they uttered against two unique ones of the world:<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD [ONE LANGUAGE]</small>. R. Ayyevu said in the name of R. Eleazer the son of R. Jose the Galilean: Those who come into the world have taken issue with the Holy One in three places:

<br>Once in the days of Joshua, as stated (in Josh. 9:2): <small>THEN &lt; ALL THE KINGS &gt; GATHERED TOGETHER [WITH ONE ACCORD] TO FIGHT AGAINST JOSHUA [AND AGAINST ISRAEL]</small>.

What is the meaning of <small>THEY DISPLACE BOUNDARIES</small>?

[That they were carrying off each other's flocks.] <small>THEY DRIVE AWAY THE DONKEYS OF THE ORPHANS</small>: When they saw a donkey in the hands of an orphan, they would immediately take it from him.

[(Gen. 11:4:) <small>THEN THEY SAID: COME, LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY AND A TOWER WITH ITS TOP IN THE HEAVENS TO MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELVES</small>.] R. Simeon bar Johay said: They took an idol and put it on top of the tower. [They said:] If the Holy One issues decrees against it, it will be against him and inhibit him.

Although they rebelled, I extended my right hand to them.

Thus it is stated (in Zeph. 3:9): <small>FOR THEN I WILL TURN OVER TO THE PEOPLES A PURE LANGUAGE [FOR ALL OF THEM TO INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD, TO SERVE HIM WITH A SINGLE SHOULDER</small> (i.e., with one accord)]. Why? Because the Holy One spoke thus to Israel: I will abolish oppression from you, destroy the nations on your account, and bring you near me so that you may serve me with fear. And again the Holy Spirit said through David (in Ps. 2:11): <small>SERVE THE LORD WITH FEAR</small>.

This tradition is based on Gen 15:17, with <small>UR (<i>‘ur</i>) OF THE CHALDEES</small> understood as <small>FIRE (<i>‘ur</i>) OF THE CHALDEES</small>.</i> up to that time the Holy One had performed no miracles for him. The ministering angels said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, behold, Nimrod has cast Abraham into the midst of the fiery furnace! R. Eliezer haQappar said: <small>WE HAVE A LITTLE SISTER</small>. &lt; The passage &gt; speaks of one who rends asunder &lt; a garment in mourning &gt; and does not sew &lt; it &gt; together Abraham, &lt; however &gt;, sewed the world together before the Holy One. Since up to then he had no children, for that reason it (Cant. 8:8) called him "<small>SISTER</small>." (Cant. 8:8, cont.:) <small>WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR OUR SISTER [IN THE DAY THAT SHE IS SPOKEN FOR]</small>? On the day that Nimrod said to throw him into the midst of the fiery furnace, the Holy One said to the ministering angels (in vs. 9): <small>IF SHE IS A WALL, WE SHALL BUILD UPON HER A SILVER TURRET</small>. [If he gives his life for the sanctification of the name (i.e., in martyrdom), we shall build upon it (his life) a silver turret.] (Vs. 9, cont.:) <small>AND IF SHE IS A DOOR (<i>DLT</i>), WE SHALL ENCLOSE HER IN A CEDAR PANEL</small>. If he is too wretched (<i>DL</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>DL</i> corresponds to the first two letters of the Hebrew <i>DLT</i>, which means “door.”</i> to give his life for the sanctification of my name, <small>WE SHALL ENCLOSE (rt.: <i>TsUR</i>) HER IN CEDAR PANEL</small>. Just as a picture (rt.: <i>TsUR</i>) which is on a panel is easy to erase, so it is easy for him to perish from the world when I am not looking after him. Abraham said (in vs. 10): <small>I AM A WALL</small>. I am giving my life for the sanctification of your name. Straightway he gave his life. How? His father, Terah, was serving idols [and worshiping them]. The Holy One said to him. These are idolaters; yet you are residing among them. (Gen. 12:1:) <small>GO FROM YOUR &lt; NATIVE &gt; LAND</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): GO. This text is related (to Ps. 45:11 [10]): <small>HEAR, O DAUGHTER, TAKE NOTE, AND INCLINE YOUR EAR: FORGET YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:3; cf.

This refers to the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, &lt; who takes pleasure in &gt; <sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The reading follows the traditional <i>Tanhuma</i>.</i> adorning you in the world.

What did a certain one do? He took it and moved it from place to place, &lt; so that &gt; its aroma began to disperse abroad. Similarly Abraham was dwelling among those who served idols. The Holy One said to him: Why are you residing among the wicked? Go out from among them, and make your good works known abroad. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>.

Siman 4

Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>. R. Levi said: What is the meaning of <small>GO (<i>LK LK</i>)</small>? The Holy One said to him: At age one hundred you will produce a son. It is so stated &lt; in the words &gt; <small><i>LK LK</i></small>: <i>L</i> = thirty; <i>K</i> = twenty. &lt; <i>LK</i> appears &gt; two times, <i>LK LK</i>. Ergo, one hundred.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO (<i>LK LK</i>)</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: Throw away your (<i>LK</i>) life in this world, but in the world to come your reward is prepared for you (<i>LK</i>).
Another interpretation: <small>GO</small>. R.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO (<i>LK LK</i>)</small>. The Holy One said to him: I sought (rt.: <i>ShHR</i>) you <small>(<i>LK</i>)</small> early. Thus R. Joshua ben Qorhah said: David said (in Ps. 110:3): <small>YOUR PEOPLE (<i>'MK</i>) OFFER THEMSELVES WILLINGLY IN THE DAY OF YOUR WARFARE (rt.: <i>HYL</i>)… &lt; FROM THE WOMB OF THE DAWN (rt.: <i>SHHR</i>). &gt; YOURS (<i>LK</i>) IS THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Hence<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">By understanding Gen. 26:5 to mean: <small>172 YEARS ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE</small>.</i> you learn that at the age of three years Abraham knew his Creator. The Holy One said to him: I am making all the evil deeds which you did in those three years like this dew. Ergo (in Ps. 110:3): <small>THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>. For your sake I created the world. R. Tahalifa said: The Holy One said: I looked at you when I created the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHEN THEY WERE CREATED (<i>BHBR'M</i>)</small>? In Abraham (<i>B'BRHM</i>) he created them.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO &lt; … &gt; UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. &lt; Here is &gt; a testing within a testing, since he did not tell him which place to go to. &lt; He &gt; merely &lt; said &gt;: <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO &lt; … &gt; UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said: [This text is related (to Ps. 32:8): <small>LET ME INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU IN THE WAY IN WHICH YOU SHALL GO</small>.] So shall I instruct you. What is the meaning of <small>LET ME INSTRUCT (<i>askil</i>) YOU</small>? Let me place wisdom within you, as stated (in Josh. 1:7): <small>SO THAT YOU MAY BE SUCCESSFUL (<i>taskil</i>)</small>. (Ps. 32:8:) <small>AND TEACH YOU ('<i>WR</i>)</small>, in the sense that I am enlightening (rt.: '<i>WR</i>) your eyes.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 32:8): <small>AND TEACH YOU</small>. &lt; The words mean &gt; that I am guiding you onto a good way. (Ps. 32:8, end:) <small>IN THE WAY IN WHICH YOU SHALL GO, LET ME GIVE COUNSEL WITH MY EYES UPON YOU</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 32:8): <small>LET ME INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND TEACH YOU? &lt; AND TEACH YOU THE WAY TO GO &gt;</small>, (according to Gen. 12:1) <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>.

Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:8): <small>AND WHAT GREAT NATION</small>….

Siman 5

Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>FOR I WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT NATION</small>. What is the greatness of your children? &lt; It lies &gt; in the Torah, as stated (in Deut. 4:6) <small>SURELY &lt; THIS GREAT NATION &gt; IS A WISE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE</small>. (Gen. 12:2, cont.:) <small>I WILL BLESS YOU</small> when I bless you with my glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:4.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND MAGNIFY YOUR NAME</small> so that your name is magnified throughout the world. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>? Your blessing shall precede my blessing, since (in the Eighteen Benedictions of the liturgy) they say: <small>THE SHIELD OF ABRAHAM</small> (in the first benediction), and afterwards <small>WHO REVIVES THE DEAD</small> (in the second one, which is called God's Benediction).
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i>, 31(suppl. 1):11; cf. M. Pss. 1:5.</i> The Holy One said to him: From the time that I created my world until now I have been obliged to bless my people. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM</small>. So I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>AND GOD BLESSED NOAH &lt; AND HIS CHILDREN &gt;</small>. From now on you are responsible for the blessing. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. But he did not act, except &lt; that &gt;, when Isaac arose, Abraham wanted to bless him. &lt; Still &gt;, when he foresaw that Esau and Jacob would issue from him, he did not bless him. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king of flesh and blood who had an orchard.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 61:6.</i> So he gave it to a tenant so that he would tend it. Now within the orchard were a tree with the elixir of death and a tree with the elixir of life. &lt; The two &gt; were clinging to each other. The tenant said: What shall I do? I cannot water one and leave the other alone. Instead I shall leave them alone until the owner of the orchard comes. Then he will know what to do. Similarly Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Jacob and Esau will issue from him. Instead I shall leave him alone until the Holy One is willing to bless him. As soon as Abraham and Isaac had passed away, the Holy One blessed Jacob by himself, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB… [AND BLESSED HIM].</small>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. The Holy One said to him: I am going to raise up a tribe from you so that it may bless Israel. And which one is this? The tribe of Levi, since that &lt; is the one which &gt; blesses Israel. Abraham said to him: Sovereign of the World, who is to bless that tribe? The Holy One said to him: When they bless Israel, I will bless them. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 6:27): <small>THUS THEY SHALL SET MY NAME UPON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND I WILL BLESS THEM</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world the tribe of Levi is blessing you in my name, but in the world to come I will bless you in my glory. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 31:22 [23]): <small>MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU, O HABITATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, O HOLY MOUNTAIN</small>.

(Gen. 14:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. Let our master instruct us: In regard to a proselyte who converts on the eve of Passover, how does he eat his paschal offering? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Pes.</i> 8:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:6.</i> <small>THE BET SHAMMAY SAY: HE IMMERSES AND EATS HIS PASCHAL OFFERING ON THE EVE, BUT THE BET HILLEL SAY: ONE WHO TURNS ASIDE FROM A STATE OF UNCIRCUMCISION IS AS ONE WHO TURNS ASIDE FROM THE GRAVE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Thus such a proselyte might not eat his paschal offering because he needed a far more elaborate purification than could be carried out in a single day or less.</i> Resh Laqish said: The proselyte who converts is more beloved than Israel when they stood at Mount Sinai. Why? Because, if they had not seen the thunder and lightning, the mountains trembling, and the noise of the trumpets, they would not have accepted the Torah. But this &lt; proselyte &gt;, who did not see one of them, came, resigned himself to the Holy One, and took upon himself the Kingdom of Heaven. Is there one of you more lovable than this one? Once upon a time Onqelos the Proselyte questioned a certain elder and said to him: How the Holy One loves the proselyte when he has stated (in Deut. 10:18 that one should) <small>LOVE {THE} [a] PROSELYTE IN GIVING HIM FOOD AND CLOTHING</small>!<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:20): <small>AND &lt; IF GOD &gt; GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small> &lt; … &gt;. Our masters have said: The proselyte is beloved because the Holy One had &lt; the following &gt; written about himself (in Jer. 14:8): <small>WHY ARE YOU LIKE A PROSELYTE IN THE LAND</small>?

This refers to Cain, for until then no murderer had existed in the world. But Cain came and began (<i>PTH</i>) murder, as stated (in Gen. 4:8): <small>CAIN AROSE [AGAINST HIS BROTHER ABEL AND MURDERED HIM]</small>. The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, you have started using (rt.: <i>PTH</i>) the sword in the world. (Ps. 37:14:) <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN (rt.: <i>PTH</i>) A SWORD</small>. This refers to Cain. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO BRING DOWN THE POOR AND NEEDY, &lt; TO SLAY THOSE WHO WAY IS UPRIGHT &gt;</small>. This refers to Abel.

(Ps. 37:15:) <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:14-15): <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN (rt.: <i>PTH</i>) A SWORD</small>. This refers to Hanun ben Nahash. When his father died, David sent him his condolences. What did Hanun do?

What is written above concerning the matter (in Gen. 12:1): <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM: GO &lt; FROM YOUR NATIVE LAND &gt; … UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. "Unto such and such a land" is not written here, but <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. So Abraham was on the move until he came to the land of Israel. May the name of the Holy One be blessed!<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:5.</i> He desired to test the righteous one and to make his good works known. For his sake there immediately came a famine. When he encountered the famine, he said to his wife, Sarah: See, there is a famine here. Our masters have said: There was never a famine in the world more severe than &lt; that &gt; one. Abraham said to Sarah: Consider Egypt. It would be nice to settle there inasmuch as famine has come. The supply is available there, and meat is plentiful. Let us go there. At that time they went down to Egypt. When they arrived at the gate<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pule</i>.</i> of Egypt, Abraham said to Sarah: My girl<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “daughter.” For a similar use of “daughter,” see Ruth 8:2, Ps. 45:11 [10].</i> Egypt is a place of whoredom, as stated (in Ezek. 23:19-20): … <small>&lt; SHE WAS A WHORE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, AND SHE LUSTED OVER THEIR PARAMOURS &gt; WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>. Let us, however, put you in a box and lock you in it. Then he did so. When they arrived at the gate of Egypt, the customs officers said to him: What are you carrying in the box? He said to them: Beans. They said to him: No, it is pepper. Give us the duty for pepper. He said to them: I shall hand it over. They said to him: It is not that. Rather this box is full of gold coins. He said to them: I shall hand you over the duty for gold coins. When they saw that he was accepting whatever they would say about it, they said: Unless he had something of value in his possession, we &lt; could &gt; not be raising the price for him. At that moment they said to him: You are not moving from here until you open the box. Then he said to them: It is up to me to give you whatever you want, but you are not to open the box. Nevertheless, they insisted on opening the box against his will and saw Sarah. When they saw her, they said: In the case of one like this, it is not seemly to touch her. Immediately they took &lt; her &gt; and brought her to Pharaoh. So they brought her into his palace<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>palatium</i>.</i> When Abraham saw that they had taken her and brought her unto Pharaoh, Abraham began to cry. &lt; Sarah &gt; also said: Sovereign of the World, Abraham came with you under a promise,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

But now, &lt; when &gt; I have been left isolated from my father, my mother, and my husband, this wicked man has come to mistreat me. He (Abraham) had acted because of your great name and because of our trust in your words. The Holy One said to her: By your life, nothing evil shall harm you, as stated (in Prov. 12:21): <small>NO HARM SHALL BEFALL THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT THE WICKED ARE FULL OF EVIL</small>. So in regard to Pharaoh and his house, I will make an example<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>dogma</i> or <i>deigma</i>.</i> of them.

What is the meaning of <small>AT THE WORD OF SARAI</small>?

It is written (in Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BLOSSOM LIKE THE DATE PALM, &lt; AND GROW LIKE A CEDAR OF LEBANON &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

You find that &lt; of &gt; all the trees, there is none &lt; about which &gt; one can say at a distance: This such-and-such a tree. Why? Because they are short. But the date palm and the cedar, because they are tall in stature, are seen at a distance. So the righteous are seen at a distance.
Another interpretation: Why are the righteous likened to a date palm and a cedar? Because you find that with most trees, even though they are chopped down, if one takes shoots from them and plants them in another place (i.e., to replace the lost trees), they will immediately grow. However, when the date palm and the cedar are chopped down, who can make others grow in their stead, except with a lot of years and with great toil? Thus, if a righteous person is lost from the world, who can raise up another in his stead, except after several years?

R. 42:1; <i>ARN</i>, A, 6; B, 13; <i>PRE</i> 1-2.</i> who was a child of the palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>palatium</i>; Gk.: <i>palation</i>.</i> Now his father was connected with the government and with matters of the army commander.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>stratelates</i> or perhaps <i>stratiotes</i>.</i> One day R. Eliezer's father went to another place. When he had realized that they<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear whom “they” represents.</i> were coming, he had said to his children: Let us rise and flee from them. He immediately called his servants and attendants. He said: Bring me the cattle and the camels. They loaded the vessels upon the cattle. Then Hyrcanus and his sons fled. R. Eliezer, however, did not go with his father. Instead, he fled to Jerusalem. Moreover, he took with him no loaf of bread, no money, nothing at all. Rather he entered Jerusalem as a pauper. Then he saw Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay sitting and teaching Torah, with his students sitting before him &lt; as they studied &gt; the chapter. When they had finished the chapter, he told them <i>haggadah</i>. Then afterwards he would tell them a <i>mishnah</i>. He (Eliezer) entered and sat by Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay. He spent two or three weeks before him; but when he came to speak to the &lt; regular &gt; students, they smelled a foul odor from his mouth. So they hid and said nothing. Again he came to speak, but they hid and said nothing. Again he came to speak, and &lt; again &gt; they hid and said nothing. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay knew that his mouth odor was not from something bad which he had in his mouth, but from hunger, since he had not been eating anything. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay said to those students: By your lives, you should look into the thing so as to know what is the matter with this student, whether he is hungry and what he is eating. So they went around through all Jerusalem and asked innkeepers:<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pandokeus</i>.</i> Is there a <i>haver</i> lodging<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>xenos</i>.</i> here? They said to them: No. They came to a certain woman. They asked her: Is there a <i>haver</i> lodging here? She said to them: Yes. Does he have anything in here? She said to them: He has a single sack. They said to her: Show it to us. She immediately brought it to them. They opened it and found dirt in it, for he would put his head in it and suck as on a wine bag. They went and told Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, who was astonished over the matter. Then he saw &lt; that there was &gt; righteousness with R. Eliezer in that he had not sought out someone at once and said: Give me something. In that very hour he designated a great deal of money for him, so that he would eat good food like that to which he had been accustomed in his father's house. So he ate and drank well until the odor from his mouth was cured. He spent a year before Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, then two, then three years, until R. Eliezer's father returned to his place. When he had returned to his place, he remained there a month, then two months; but his son, R. Eliezer, did not come. He became angry and said: I left him, and he went to Jerusalem. {R. Eliezer's daughter also said to her father:} [R. Eliezer's brothers also said to their father:] Look at your son, Eliezer! What has he done? He has forsaken you and gone to Jerusalem to eat fattened &lt; meats &gt;, while you have moved away from your home and gone after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The reading in <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34, “gone to a lodging house,” would make more sense here.</i> If something bad (i.e., your death) had happened, would he not have jumped to obtain an inheritance? How great a difference there is between us and your son! We have given our lives for you and did not forsake you, but he did not come to see you in your trouble. Yet now, if he hears that something has happened to you, he is going to come unto us and share &lt; the inheritance &gt; with us. In that very hour he said to them: By thus and so, he is not inheriting anything from me. They said to him: Before you die, should you &lt; not &gt; disinherit him? He said to them: Summon me a tablet.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pinax</i>.</i> They said: It will not be of any use. There is a certain <i>nasi</i> in Jerusalem whose name is Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, {he has helped me.} [and he is helping him.] After you die, he will surely come and say: Who will say that his father disinherited him? Then we shall bring out the document, but he will say: It is a <i>plaston</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Greek.</i> {i.e., a forgery}. You made it, and I will not believe it until we go to court. He said to them: Inasmuch as you have told me this, &lt; even though &gt; Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay is praising him, I am disinheriting him. In that hour his sons mounted him in a <i>basterna</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word denotes an enclosed litter or sedan chair that is carried by mules.</i> {i.e., a carriage}, and he entered Jerusalem on the eve of the Sabbath. He said: I am not disinheriting him &lt; anywhere &gt; but [on the Sabbath] in the academy. When? When the whole congregation will be assembling. He went in to sit down in the academy, and all Israel entered according to their custom to hear the sermon that R. Eliezer was preaching in public &lt; from &gt; upon the seat of honor, with the <i>hazzan</i> standing before him. His father saw him wrapped in his <i>tallit</i> with <i>tefillin</i> on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">On R. Eliezer wearing <i>tefillin</i> on Sabbath eve, see <i>Sanh</i>. 68a.</i> He immediately saw the one whom he thought had departed for bad ways. When he saw him sitting upon the throne and preaching, Hyrcanus stood upon the bench<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>subsellium</i>.</i> and said before the people of Jerusalem: I only went up to Jerusalem to cast you out, Eliezer my son, and also to remove you from your inheritance. Now behold, I am giving you two portions more than your brothers. And on what subject was R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus preaching at that time? Our masters have said: On this subject (in Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus began: This text is related (to Ps. 37:15): <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>. This whole subject is what there is at the beginning of the <i>parashah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 3:7.</i>

Siman 11

Another interpretation (of Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 44:6 [5]): <small>THROUGH YOU SHALL WE PUSH DOWN OUR ADVERSARIES. THROUGH YOU</small> means "through your Law." [R. Isaac said:] <small>THROUGH YOU (<i>BK</i>)</small> &lt; is to be interpreted &gt; by gematria:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>geometria</i> or <i>grammateis</i>.</i> <i>B</i> = two; <i>K</i> = twenty. Ergo: twenty-two. &lt; Thus, <small>THROUGH YOU</small> means &gt; "through the twenty-two letters which are in the Law. (Ps. 44:6 [5], cont.:) <small>{IN YOUR NAME SHALL YOU RAISE UP OUR BRIGHTNESS.} [AND IN YOUR NAME WE SHALL TRAMPLE DOWN THOSE WHO ARISE AGAINST US.]</small> Abraham said: Sovereign of the World, If you had not united your glory with me and helped me, what could &lt; I as &gt; a single person have done against nine kings (of Gen. 14:9) and their forces? However, because you helped me they fell at my hand. What is written (in Gen. 14:15)? <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 43:3; <i>PRK</i> 7:5.</i> Masters say: The night divided of its own accord. R. Benjamin ben Jafeth said in the name of R. Johanan: The Holy One, the one who knows his moments and his instants, he divided it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The words used here for “moment” and “instant” are ‘<i>et</i> and <i>rega</i>‘ respectively. Although these words are generally used quite loosely, they can have more exact meanings. See <i>TBer</i>. 1:3 (Zuckermandel ed.): <small>AN ‘<i>ONAH</i> IS ONE TWENTY-FOURTH OF AN HOUR, AN ‘<i>ET</i> IS ONE TWENTY-FOURTH OF AN ‘<i>ONAH</i>, AND A <i>REGA</i>’ IS ONE TWENTY-FOURTH OF AN ‘<i>ET</i></small>. R. Benjamin’s point is that only the Holy One knew enough about exact time measurements to divide the night accurately. See <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha</i> 13.</i> The Holy One said: You have worked with me from yesterday evening until midnight and killed my enemies. By your life, I am working with your children from midnight until the morning and killing their enemies. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. Therefore it is stated (in Gen. 14:1, 15): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL … &lt; AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM &gt;</small>.

Siman 12

R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: The Holy One transmitted a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion</i>.</i> to Abraham that whatever had happened to him would happen to his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 40:6.</i> Abraham was chosen from the whole household of his father. Israel also was chosen from seventy tongues. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO … &lt; FROM YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE &gt;</small>; and it was said for Israel (in Exod. 3:17): <small>AND I HAVE SAID: I WILL BRING YOU UP &lt; OUT OF THE AFFLICTION OF THE LAND OF EGYPT &gt;</small>. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:3): <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>; and also for Israel (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:2): <small>[THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION, BLESS YOU], AND MAKE YOUR NAME GREAT</small>; and also concerning Israel (in Deut. 4:8): <small>AND WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE &lt; WHICH HAS STATUTES AND ORDINANCES AS RIGHTEOUS AS ALL THIS LAW THAT I SET BEFORE YOU THIS DAY &gt;</small>? Abraham was called an individual, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE (<i>ehad</i>)</small>; and also Israel (in I Chron. 17:21): <small>AND WHO IS LIKE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, A UNIQUE (<i>ehad</i>) NATION ON EARTH</small>? Just as with Abraham, when he came to the land, there was a famine in the land; with Israel also, when they had settled in the land of Israel, there was famine, as stated (in Gen. 43:1): <small>BUT THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN THE LAND</small>. Just as Abraham went down to Egypt because of famine, [as stated (in Gen. 12:10): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND, AND ABRAM WENT DOWN TO EGYPT]</small>; so with Israel, as stated (in Gen. 42:3): <small>SO THE TEN BROTHERS OF JOSEPH WENT DOWN TO BUY GRAIN &lt; FROM EGYPT &gt;</small>. Just as in the case of Abraham, when he went down to Egypt, the Egyptians provoked him; so in the case of Israel, as stated (in Exod. 1:10): <small>COME, LET US (Egyptians) ACT SHREWDLY &lt; TOWARD THEM (Israel), LEST THEY MULTIPLY &gt;</small>…. Just as in the case of Abraham, four kings engaged him in battle;<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">“Engage in battle” comes from the Hebrew root <i>ZWG</i>, which corresponds to the Greek <i>zeugos</i> or <i>zugon</i>.</i> so in the case of Israel, the nations are going to make an alliance<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>omonoia</i>.</i> against them, as stated (in Ps. 2:2): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TAKE THEIR STAND, &lt; AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED &gt;</small>. Just as in the case of Abraham, the Holy One went out to fight before him and slew his enemies; so the Holy One has fought for Israel. In the age to come the Holy One is going out to fight their wars, as stated (in Zech. 14:3): <small>THEN THE LORD WILL COME FORTH AND FIGHT WITH THOSE NATIONS AS WHEN HE FIGHTS IN THE DAY OF BATTLE</small>.

(Gen. 15:1:) <small>AFTER THESE THINGS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ABRAHAM</small>. Let our master instruct us: For what reason was the burnt offering brought?<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:10.</i> R. Ishmael says: Because of positive and negative commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 36ab (bar) for the views of Aqiva and R. Jose the Galilean.</i> R. Simeon ben Johay says: On account of &lt; evil &gt; thoughts in the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 7:3.</i> as stated (in Job 1:5): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN THE DAYS OF THE FEAST HAD COME TO AN END, JOB WOULD SEND AND SANCTIFY THEM … &lt; AND WOULD OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS … FOR JOB SAID: PERHAPS MY SONS HAVE SINNED AND BLASPHEMED GOD IN THEIR HEARTS &gt;</small>. You find that Abraham would reflect on the quality of &lt; Divine &gt; justice. What would he say? R. Levi said: It seems to me that I have received my reward in this world when the Holy One helped me with the kings and delivered me from the fiery furnace (of Nimrod). The Holy One said to him: Since you have reflected on me, you must bring a sacrifice, as stated (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON … &lt; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING &gt;</small>. R. Isaac said: He was saying this: My heart is uttering gall and wormwood. Perhaps among these whom I have killed there were righteous ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 44:4.</i> The Holy One said to him: Have no fear of this. They were thorns; and for them you have, not a punishment, but a reward. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:1, end): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM! I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU; {ALSO} YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>.

Siman 14

Another interpretation (of Gen. 15:1): <small>AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>.,Gen. 3:11.</i> [What is the meaning of <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT</small>?] Before the world was created, the Holy One reserved the Law for Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS &gt;</small>. &lt; This &gt; teaches that Abraham kept all the commandments and all the Torahs. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Jonathan said: Our father Abraham also maintained the <i>'eruvim</i> of cooked foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the use of <i>torah</i> in the plural indicates that Abraham knew even the oral Torah. See above, 3:1; below, 11:12. For a full description of the ‘<i>eruvim</i> of cooked foods, see Maimonides, <i>Yad, Yom Tov</i> 6:1-3.</i> Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE</small>. For that reason, Solomon stated (in Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT, [A SHIELD FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BLAMELESSLY]</small>. The Holy One said to Abraham: You have been occupied with my Law. By your life, I am a shield for you, as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM! [I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU]</small>. Just as, when one grasps the shield, even if darts and stones are thrown at him, he is not afraid; [so I am doing for you], as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU; YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>—not for you alone, but also for your children, if they are occupied with my Law just as you have been occupied. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 30:5): <small>[EVERY] UTTERANCE OF GOD IS PURE, A SHIELD FOR {ALL} WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT, [A SHIELD FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BLAMELESSLY]</small>.

Siman 15

(Gen. 15:1:) <small>AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 11:18): <small>A WICKED ONE DOES THE WORK OF FALSEHOOD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:12; Gen. R. 44:2.</i> This refers to Nimrod the Wicked, who used to make images and lead astray the children of Adam; for idolatry resembles falsehood, as stated (in Jer. 10:14): <small>FOR HIS MOLTEN IMAGE IS FALSEHOOD AND THERE IS NO BREATH IN THEM</small>. (Prov. 11:18, cont.:) <small>THE ONE WHO SOWS RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS A TRUE REWARD</small>. This refers to our father Abraham, who did sow righteousness when he would serve food to those who passed back and forth,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 43:7; M.Ps. 110:1.</i> as stated (in Gen. 21:33): <small>THEN HE PLANTED AN INN</small><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Eshel</i> is usually translated “tamarisk,” the word is interpreted here by <i>notrikon</i>, i.e., a method of interpretation which understands each letter of a word as an initial letter for a whole word. In this case the three Hebrew letters in <i>Eshel</i> are understood as the initial letters for “eating,” “drinking,” and “spending the night,” i.e., what one does at an inn.</i> <small>IN BEERSHEBA</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life you have a true reward, as stated (in Gen. 15:1, end): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM!… [YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT]</small>.

Siman 16

What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 14:14)?<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:13.</i> <small>WHEN ABRAM HEARD THAT HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN CAPTURED</small>. Was he Lot's brother? Look, however, at the humility of our father Abraham after all the strife they had had with him, [as stated (in Gen. 13:7): <small>NOW THERE WAS QUARRELING BETWEEN THE HERDSMEN OF ABRAM'S CATTLE AND THE HERDSMEN OF LOT'S CATTLE</small>.] Our father Abraham did not remember the strife but called him his brother, as stated (in Gen. 13:8): <small>FOR WE ARE BROTHERS</small>.
(Gen. 14:14, cont.:) <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN</small>? That he took silver and gold and covered them with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ned</i>. 32a; Gen. R. 43:2.</i> He said to them: You know that we are going off to war and that we are going in order to save lives. Do not set your eyes on wealth. If &lt; you are going &gt; for the sake of silver and gold, here it is before you, as stated (ibid.): <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN. HE ARMED (<i>YRQ</i>)</small> &lt; means &gt; nothing but that he covered them with silver and gold, as stated (in Ps. 68:14 [13]): <small>THE WINGS OF A DOVE ARE COVERED WITH SILVER AND ITS PINIONS WITH THE YELLOW (<i>YRQRQ</i>) OF GOLD</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 14:14): <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN. HE ARMED (<i>yareq</i>)</small> means nothing but that he made them turn pale (<i>horiq</i>) with words, just as it is written in the Law (in Deut. 20:8): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO IS AFRAID (<i>yare</i>) AND FAINT (<i>rakh</i>) OF HEART</small>. Abraham did this: He said to them: We are going off to war. Let anyone who has transgressions on his hand and is afraid because of his actions not go off with us. When they heard that, anyone who knew in his heart that he had sinned was afraid and did not go off. So they went back, and no one was left with him (Abraham) but Eliezer alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 44:9; Numb. R. 18:21; <i>PRE</i> 27; M. Pss. 110:4.</i> In that hour the Holy One said: All have forsaken you, and no one is left except Eliezer alone. By your life I am putting within him the power of three hundred and eighteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Targum Pseudo-Jonathan</i> to Gen. 14:14.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:14) <small>AND HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN, THE ONES BORN IN HIS HOUSE, THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN &lt; OF THEM &gt;</small>. Where is it shown? The numerical value of Eliezer by gematria is three hundred and eighteen.

(Gen. 14:14, end:) <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS DAN</small>. Our masters have said: What was his reason for him to go in pursuit as far as Dan?<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 43:2.</i> Two things smite &lt; people &gt; before and behind. These are idolatry and one who plants on the eve of the Sabbath Year and in the period just after the Sabbath Year. Just as one who plants on the eve of the Sabbath Year and on the periods just after the Sabbath year is culpable, so idolatry smites one beforehand and afterward. Now up to then Jeroboam ben Nebat had not arisen to practice idolatry, &lt; but &gt; Abraham saw it, as stated (in I Kings 12:29): <small>THEN &lt; JEROBOAM &gt; SET UP ONE &lt; IDOL &gt; IN BETHEL AND [PLACED] THE OTHER IN DAN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 96a.</i> So, when Abraham arrived as far as that place, his strength failed him and he did not go on in pursuit, as stated (in Gen. 14:14): <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS DAN</small>. Thus he judged (<i>dan</i>) them and found them guilty (rt.: <i>HWB</i>), as stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS HOBAH (<i>HWBH</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The place-name means “guilt.”</i>
(Gen. 14:14:) <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 43:3.</i> Because of the Holy One the night was divided with Abraham, as stated: <small>AND &lt; THE NIGHT &gt; WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For what is meant here, see above, 3:13.</i>
(Gen. 14:16:) <small>THEN HE RETURNED ALL THE PROPERTY</small>. &lt; There &gt; immediately &lt; follows &gt; (in vs. 17): <small>AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT</small>. When he saw Abraham pursuing the sixteen kings and their legions,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legio</i>.</i> the Holy One set him on the right, as stated (in Ps. 110:1): <small>THE LORD SAYS TO MY LORD, SIT ON MY RIGHT &lt; UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES YOUR FOOTSTOOL &gt;</small>. They<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. R. 43:3, R. Levi and R. Eleazar in the name of R. Jose.</i> said: In this war the pace of our father Abraham was four miles<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>mille</i>, i.e., a Roman mile of 1000 paces.</i> long; and he ran until, having killed all the kings and their legions, he traveled on in peace. Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:3): <small>HE PURSUES THEM AND TRAVELS ON IN PEACE</small>…. Immediately the king of Sodom came out to meet him, as stated (in Gen. 14:17): <small>AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT TO MEET HIM</small>. He said to him: If you please, (according to Gen. 14:21): <small>GIVE ME THE PEOPLE AND TAKE THE PROPERTY FOR YOURSELF</small>. Wanting &lt; the former &gt; and not wanting &lt; the latter &gt;, he said to him: If they had killed me, they would have taken all my assets. Now that you have rescued me, receive the property for yourself, and <small>GIVE ME THE PEOPLE</small>. So it is therefore stated: <small>AND TAKE THE PROPERTY FOR YOURSELF</small>. Abraham immediately took an oath, as stated (in vs. 22): <small>THEN ABRAM SAID UNTO THE KING OF SODOM: I HAVE LIFTED UP MY HAND &lt; UNTO THE LORD, GOD MOST HIGH &gt;</small>…. &lt; Such a &gt; lifting up is nothing but an oath, as stated (in Dan. 12:7): <small>WHEN HE LIFTED UP HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT HAND UNTO HEAVEN AND SWORE BY THE ONE WHO LIVES FOREVER</small>.
(Gen. 14:23:) <small>THAT &lt; I WILL TAKE NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP &lt; FROM ANYTHING THAT IS YOURS &gt;</small>…. Why? Because the Holy One has promised me that he will make me rich, as stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>I WILL MAGNIFY YOUR NAME</small>. Now should I receive from what belongs to you, so that you might say (ibid., cont.): <small>I HAVE MADE YOU RICH</small>? The Holy One said: You have said: <small>&lt; NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. By your life I am giving your children an altar around which <small>A THREAD OF RED PAINT</small> encompasses, just as our masters have taught (in <i>Mid</i>. 3:1).
Another interpretation: I am giving your children a commandment concerning thread, as stated (in Numb. 15:38): <small>THAT THEY MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES … &lt; AND PUT ON THE TASSEL OF EACH CORNER A THREAD OF BLUE &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 43:9, in reference to the commandment of “tassels” or “fringes.”</i>
<small>OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. The Holy One said: I am giving your children the commandment of the sandal, as stated (in Deut. 25:9): <small>THEN SHE SHALL TAKE OFF HIS SANDAL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sot.</i> 17a; <i>Hul.</i> 89b, in reference to the ceremony for refusing a levirate marriage.</i>
<small>OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. The Holy One said: By virtue of this I am giving your children the commandment of Passover, as stated (in Exod. 12:11): <small>AND THUS SHALL YOU EAT IT: WITH YOUR LOINS GIRDED, YOUR SANDALS &lt; ON YOUR FEET &gt;</small>….
Another interpretation: You have stated (in Gen. 14:23): <small>&lt; NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. I am exalting your children, as stated (in Cant. 7:2 [1]): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR FEET IN SANDALS</small>. Another interpretation: <small>&lt; NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. I am exalting your children with a thread, as stated (in Cant. 4:3): <small>[YOUR LIPS ARE] LIKE A SCARLET THREAD</small>. Another interpretation: You have stated: <small>&lt; NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. By virtue of this I am punishing your enemies, as stated (in Ps. 60:10 [8]): <small>UPON EDOM WILL I CAST MY SHOE</small>. You have refused a reward of flesh and blood. See what a reward is prepared for you with me. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>.

So he was afraid, saying: I have killed the children of a saint, and now he will curse me so that I die. What did he do? He went out to meet him there in order to mollify him. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:18): <small>AND MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM &lt; … &gt;</small>. The Holy One said: By your life I will not curse you but bless you. Thus it is stated (in the next verse): <small>THEN HE BLESSED HIM, AND SAID: BLESSED BE ABRAM</small>…. He said to him: Because you have killed my sons, I am blessing you.

(Gen. 17:1:) <small>WHEN ABRAM WAS NINETY &lt; -NINE &gt; YEARS OLD</small>…. Let our master instruct us: Is it correct that one is permitted to heal on the Sabbath?<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:16; Deut. 10:1.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Yoma</i> 8:6.): <small>WHERE LIFE IS IN DOUBT, IT OVERRIDES THE SABBATH</small>; but if it is doubtful whether one is recovering or not recovering, one does not override &lt; it &gt;. For the sake of circumcision, however, one does override the Sabbath. R. Jose said: Come and see how dear circumcision is to the Holy One. When he told Abraham that he should be circumcised, it was hard on him. He said: If I circumcise &lt; myself &gt; now, I am lacking one member ('<i>BR</i>). The Holy One said to him: Before you circumcise yourself, [your name is Abram '<i>BRM</i>] and the numerical value of its letters is 243. Now, since a person has 248 members, it is evident that you are lacking five members.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ned.</i> 32b.</i> But when you circumcise yourself, you are whole.

Siman 21

(Gen. 17:1:) <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS</small>. This text is related (to Hos. 9:10): <small>I HAVE FOUND {YOUR ANCESTORS} [ISRAEL] LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT; [I HAVE SEEN YOUR ANCESTORS LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON]</small>. &lt; The text &gt; speaks about Israel. When it stood at Mount Sinai, it resembled grapes. Just as grapes are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside, so was Israel when it stood at Mount Sinai and responded (according to Exod. 24:7): <small>WE WILL DO AND OBEY</small>. Note that &lt; the response was &gt; with their mouth, but their heart was not steadfast. Thus David has said (in Ps. 78:36-37): <small>YET THEY DECEIVED HIM WITH THEIR MOUTH, AND WITH THEIR TONGUE THEY LIED TO HIM, FOR THEIR HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST WITH HIM</small>. See, &lt; they were &gt; <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>. Just as the grapes have food and drink within them, so Israel has within itself children of Torah (i.e., scholars) and has within itself children of action.
Another interpretation: Just as these grapes have seeds within them, so did Israel. It is so stated (in Numb. 11:4): <small>THEN THE RABBLE WHICH WAS IN THEIR MIDST &lt; BECAME FILLED WITH LUST &gt;</small>….
Another interpretation (of Hos. 9:10): <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>. Now why does it say <small>DESERT</small>, and not "settlement"? When someone is walking in the desert, if they give him something to eat, he wants to drink; and if they give him something to drink, he wants to eat. If, however, they have given him grapes, he eats them and does not desire anything, because they have within themselves &lt; both &gt; food and drink.
{Another interpretation: <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>.} [(Hos. 9:10, cont.:) <small>LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE</small>.] &lt; The verse &gt; compares the ancestors with the fig tree. Just as this fig tree has several kernels<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The text has “granaries.” The translation follows <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 34.</i> in &lt; its figs &gt;, so the ancestors of the world had several good works in them.
Another interpretation: <small>LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE</small>. Just as this fig has no waste at all in it, &lt; … &gt; Whatever one eats has waste in it, and one throws away some of it; but in the case of the fig, one throws away none of it at all. &lt; Just as this fig has no waste at all in it &gt;, so the Holy One said to Abraham: You are whole, and there is no wasteful deficiency in you except the foreskin.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS NINETY &lt; -NINE &gt; YEARS OLD</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 45:3f.

About Abraham. He was fairer than children of the first Adam. And who were his children? Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah. Moreover, some of the children of Noah are called children of Adam. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 11:5): <small>AND THE TOWER WHICH THE CHILDREN OF ADAM HAD BUILT</small>. (Ps. 45:3 [2]:) <small>GRACE IS POURED OUT ON YOUR LIPS</small>. How was that? When you swore to the king of Sodom. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:22f.): <small>THEN ABRAM SAID UNTO THE KING OF SODOM: I HAVE RAISED MY HAND (in an oath) UNTO THE LORD GOD MOST HIGH … THAT &lt; I WILL TAKE NOT &gt; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GRACE … ON YOUR LIPS</small>? When you spoke, grace poured out. And what was his reward? That the Holy One said this to him: Leave me all that you have done and everything for which you have been proud of yourself. You descended into the fiery furnace and experienced a lot of trials for my name. You arose and pursued the kings. But you have been proud of yourself in the world for all that you have done. From now on, you will seek to make my valor known. (Ps. 45:4 [3]:) <small>GIRD ON YOUR SWORD</small>. Put circumcision between your thighs. In that hour your glory and splendor shall be in the world.

What is the meaning of <small><i>SWD</i></small>? One's years: <i>S</i> is sixty; <i>W</i> is six; <i>D</i> is four. That makes seventy years.

And out of them &lt; I &gt; am raising up seventy elders, as stated (in Numb. 11:16): &lt; <small>GATHER FOR ME &gt; SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.

So what shall I give you? It is enough for you to be like me, as stated (in Gen. 17:2-4): <small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU … THEN ABRAHAM FELL UPON HIS FACE … AS FOR ME, BEHOLD, MY COVENANT IS WITH YOU</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 25:14): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.

Siman 24

Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS NINETY &lt; -NINE &gt; YEARS OLD</small>. The Holy One said to him: When I had created my world, I was patient &lt; with you &gt; for twenty generations<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ket</i>. 50a, according to which a parent must be patient with a son until the age of twelve.</i> until you would come and receive circumcision.

I have had enough (<i>DY</i>), O world. But if you accept &lt; circumcision &gt; for yourself, we are enough for the world, &lt; just &gt; I and you.
(Gen. 17:2:)<small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU</small>. Abram said to him: And who will circumcise me?<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 49:2 (but not in the Theodor edition).</i> He said to him: You yourself. Abraham took the knife and took hold of his foreskin, but he was afraid; because he was old, he was shaking. He said to him: Sovereign of the world, I am an old man. What did the Holy One do, as it were? He stretched out his hand and took hold along with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. R. 4:6:1.</i> So Abraham cut away until he had performed circumcision. Thus Ezra gives praise and says (in Neh. 9:6, 8): <small>YOU ALONE ARE THE LORD … AND YOU FOUND HIS HEART FAITHFUL BEFORE YOU, &lt; AND CUT THE COVENANT ALONG WITH HIM &gt;</small>. "And cut the covenant for him" is not written here, but <small>AND CUT THE COVENANT ALONG WITH HIM</small>. Then there is written at the end of the verse: <small>AND YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR WORDS BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS</small>.
Another interpretation: Why did he circumcise at the age of ninety-nine?<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:17; cf. Gen.

Let him learn from Abraham, who performed circumcision when he was ninety-nine years old.

Up to now foreskin has been customary, but circumcision has been concealed. It is enough (<i>DY</i>) for the world that I am his God.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>I AM GOD ALMIGHTY ('<i>L ShDY</i>)</small>. R. Abbahu said: When the Holy One created his world, he created the heavens and the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hag</i>. 12a; Gen.

If he had not said: Enough! to them, they would have continued to be spread out until the dead rise (at the end of time). &lt; What &gt; the Holy One said to Abraham &lt; was &gt;: I am the one who said to my world: Enough (<i>DY</i>)! So &lt; also &gt; he says to foreskin: Enough!
(Gen. 17:1, cont.:) <small>WALK BEFORE ME &lt; AND BE PERFECT &gt;</small>. Before he performed circumcision, &lt; the Holy One &gt; never said: <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. Why? Because he was uncircumcised. After he performed circumcision, &lt; the Holy One &gt; said: <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. Before he performed circumcision, he was not whole. After he performed circumcision, he became whole.

Siman 26

It is written of Noah (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. It is also written of Abraham (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. One who reads &lt; this might &gt; think that Noah was greater than Abraham, but it is not so. R. Johanan and Resh Laqish differed.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 30:10.</i> R. Johanan told &lt; this &gt; parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had two sons, one elder and one younger. The younger would hold onto him so as not to fall, but the elder would walk before him. Thus it is written of Noah: <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. &lt; He did so &gt; lest he be drowned with the generation of the flood. In the case of Abraham, however, because he was without peer in the world and was righteous, to him the Holy One said (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT</small>. Resh Laqish &lt; also &gt; told a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend who was sunk in the mire. He took hold of his hand and lifted him out of the mire. So Noah was sunk in the mire. The Holy One saw him, gave him a hand, and raised him out of the mire. Then to what was Abraham comparable? To a king who used to walk in the dark. His friend came, saw him, and provided him with light. The king said to him: As long as you are providing me with light, come and go before me. Thus [in the days of] Abraham the whole world was wicked, while he was righteous. The Holy One said to him: As long as you are providing light in the east, <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>.
It is written of Noah (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. It is also written concerning the ancestors of the world (in Gen. 48:15): <small>THE GOD BEFORE WHOM MY ANCESTORS &lt; ABRAHAM AND ISAAC &gt; WALKED</small>. R. Johanan said: To what were the ancestors comparable &lt; in their position &gt; before the Holy One? To a shepherd who walks with his flock before him. Resh Laqish said: Up to now the flock has been necessary for the shepherd. Then to what were the ancestors comparable &lt; in their position &gt; before the Holy One? To a prince who walks with his elders before him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 48:15): <small>BEFORE WHOM MY ANCESTORS &lt; ABRAHAM AND ISAAC &gt; WALKED</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT</small>.

In the world to come, however, the Holy One will save Israel from Gehinnom by virtue of circumcision, as stated (in Prov. 31:21): <small>SHE (i.e., Israel) HAS NO FEAR FOR HER HOUSEHOLD ON ACCOUNT OF (Gehinnom's) SNOW BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE DRESSED IN SCARLET</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Scarlet is the color of the blood from circumcision.

For what reason did he come to Abraham? For the reason that he was sitting &lt; there &gt; suffering from his circumcision. He therefore came to visit him.

Siman 4

Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &lt; THE LORD &gt; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>…. R. Isaac the Smith began (with Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>AN ALTAR OF EARTH YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 48:4.</i> The Holy One said: Whoever slaughters an ox or a lamb and sheds a little blood, such a one I am coming to bless. Thus it is stated: <small>AN ALTAR OF EARTH &lt; YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME, AND YOU SHALL SACRIFICE UPON IT YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND YOUR PEACE OFFERINGS, YOUR SHEEP AND YOUR OXEN &gt;</small>. Then it is written (ibid.): <small>I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. How much the more must I bless Abraham, since a river of blood was pouring forth from his house because of the circumcision! It is therefore stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &lt; THE LORD &gt; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>. So also Moses said (in Lev. 9:6): <small>THIS IS THE THING WHICH THE LORD HAS COMMANDED &lt; YOU TO DO &gt; THAT &lt; THE GLORY OF THE LORD &gt; MAY APPEAR UNTO YOU</small>. What did the <small>LORD</small> say (in vs. 7)? <small>THEN MOSES SAID UNTO AARON: DRAW NEAR &lt; UNTO THE ALTAR AND PERFORM YOUR SIN OFFERING AND YOUR BURNT OFFERING TO ATONE FOR YOURSELF … AS THE LORD HAS COMMANDED &gt;</small>. R. Aha said: Come and see the power which the Holy One set in Abraham, who in one day circumcised himself, the slaves born in his house, and his son Ishmael. So the blood was dripping.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Cant. R. 4:6:1.</i> Look at how many of his home-born slaves there were! According to what is written (in Gen. 14:14), <small>HE MUSTERED HIS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN HOME-BORN SLAVES</small>. Now, if his home-born slaves numbered so many, how many more were those which his money had purchased! And he circumcised them all in a single day, as stated (in Gen. 17:26f.): <small>ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM AND HIS SON ISHMAEL WERE CIRCUMCISED; AND ALL THE MEN OF HIS HOUSE, &lt; HOME-BORN SLAVES AND ONES PURCHASED WITH MONEY FROM A FOREIGNER &gt;, WERE CIRCUMCISED ALONG WITH HIM</small>. Then Abraham took all the foreskins which he had circumcised and made a mound of them in the midst of his house, with the result that a river of blood flowed forth from the midst of his house. So the Holy One called the angels and said to them: Come, let us visit the sick one. They said to him: Sovereign of the World, (Ps. 8:5): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM AND A CHILD OF ADAM THAT YOU SHOULD VISIT HIM!</small> Also, are you going into a place of defilement, into a place of blood and of uncleanness? He said to them: So you have said. By your life, the odor of this blood is sweeter to me than myrrh and frankincense. If you are not going, then I am going by myself. And so has Solomon said (in Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL… &lt; I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE &gt;</small>. (Josh. 5:3:) <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FORESKINS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Buber suggests reading (with Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE.</small></i> This &lt; refers to &gt; Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM … IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY</small>, since the Holy One had made that day hot.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to Cant. R. 4:6:1, it was heat from the sun that caused the foreskins to emit the aroma of frankincense.</i>

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, since he was not suffering from the circumcision because he was attending them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH (<i>mor</i>)</small>. This &lt; refers &gt; to Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">There is probably an allusion here to Gen. 22:2: <small>GO UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH (<i>Moriyyah</i>)</small>.

Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL</small>. This &lt; refers to &gt; the day of judgment. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, since the wicked have no &lt; protective &gt; shadow. It is so stated (in Job 34:22): <small>THERE IS NEITHER DARKNESS NOR SHADOW OF DEATH FOR WORKERS OF VANITY TO BE HIDDEN</small>. (Cant. 4:6, cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH</small>. This is the Holy Temple where they would burn the offering of myrrh.
Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL</small>. Until the kingdom of the Holy One appears in this world. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, i.e., the shadows of the kingdom. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH</small>, i.e., Jerusalem. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 5:1): <small>WHEN I COME TO MY GARDEN, MY SISTER, MY BRIDE, I HAVE PLUCKED MY MYRRH ALONG WITH MY SPICE</small>. (Josh. 5:3:) <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FORESKINS</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Buber again suggests emending to fit Cant. 4:6: <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE</small>.</i> since he took the foreskins and made a mound of them. For that reason the Holy One was revealed to him, as stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &lt; THE LORD &gt; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>. Now when the angels saw this, they also came along with the Holy One, as stated (in Gen. 18:2): <small>WHEN HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND LOOKED, BEHOLD, THERE WERE THREE MEN &lt; STANDING NEAR HIM &gt;</small>. And so David gives praise (in Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>? &lt; With reference to &gt; the Torah, its beginning is steadfast love,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 4:1; below, 5:2.</i> its end is steadfast love, and its middle is steadfast love.

Abraham said to him: Is this good manners for me to be sitting while you are standing? The Holy One said to him: Do not trouble yourself. You are an old man of a hundred years. Sit down! The Holy One said to him: By your life, because you are sitting while I stand, your children at the age of three years, at the age of four years, are going to be sitting in the academies and in the synagogues with me standing over them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>.

Now these are the three races which Abraham ran:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>TSot</i>. 4:1; <i>BM</i> 86b-87a; <i>ARN</i>, A, 13; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 4:4; Gen.

(Gen. 18:17:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &lt; WHAT I AM DOING &gt;</small>? Let our master instruct us: When someone is translating for one reading the Torah, is it correct for him to look at a written text?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Gen. 4:5; <i>PR</i> 5:1; cf. <i>yMeg</i>. 4:1 (74d); <i>Meg</i>. 32a (bar.)</i> Thus have our masters taught: The translator is forbidden to look at a written text, and the reader is forbidden to take his eyes away from the Torah since the Torah was given only in a written text, as stated (in Exod. 34:1): <small>AND I WILL WRITE UPON THE TABLETS</small>. But it is forbidden for the translator to look at the Torah. R. Judah ben Pazzi said: There is a text (Exod. 34:27) which explicitly proves &lt; this injunction &gt;: <small>WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small>. Thus, the Scripture was given in writing. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR THESE WORDS ARE BY MOUTH</small>. Here is &lt; a reference to &gt; the translation, which is given by word of mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pe‘ah</i> 2:6 (17a); Exod. R. 47:3.</i>
R. Judah bar Simon said (Ibid., cont.): <small>I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH YOU AND WITH ISRAEL</small>. &lt; It was done &gt; through writing and through word of mouth: <small>FOR THESE WORDS ARE BY MOUTH</small>. If you preserve what is in writing in writing and what is by word of mouth by word of mouth, <small>I HAVE MADE &lt; A COVENANT &gt; WITH YOU</small>. But, &lt; if &gt; you change what is by mouth into writing and what is in writing into word of mouth, <small>I HAVE not MADE &lt; A COVENANT &gt; WITH YOU</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Exod. 9:34. See Exod. R. 47:1; Cant. R. 2:7:1; cf. <i>Hag</i>. 13a; <i>Ket</i>. 111a.</i> Moses wanted the Mishnah also to be in writing, but the Holy One foresaw that the peoples of the world were going to translate the Torah and read it in Greek. Then they would say: We too are Israel. The Holy One said to him (in Hos. 8:12): <small>SHOULD I WRITE THE FULL ABUNDANCE OF MY TORAH (i.e., including the Mishnah) FOR YOU</small>? If so, <small>THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RECKONED AS STRANGERS</small>. And why all this? Because the Mishnah is a mystery<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>mysterion</i>.</i> belonging to the Holy One, and the Holy One reveals his mystery only to the righteous. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 25:14): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>. And so you find that even when the Holy One was angry over Sodom because of their evil deeds and when the Holy One sought to destroy Sodom, the Holy One did not seal their judgment until he had consulted with Abraham. {Thus it is stated:} [Where is it shown? From what we have read on the matter] (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &lt; WHAT I AM DOING &gt;</small>?

Siman 7

It is written (in Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE AND GOOD FAVOR IN THE EYES OF GOD AND HUMANITY</small>. You have one who is pleasing to the king but is not pleasing to the people of the king's palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>palation</i>; Lat.: <i>palatium</i>.</i> There is also one who is pleasing to the people of the palace and not pleasing to the king. In the case of the righteous, however, when they are pleasing before the Holy One, they are pleasing before angels and before mortals. This is what you find in &lt; the case of &gt; Daniel. When the angel came to him, he called that person beloved three times: (Dan. 10:11:) <small>&lt; O DANIEL &gt;, GREATLY BELOVED ONE, UNDERSTAND THE WORDS</small>. It is also written (in Dan. 10:19): <small>FEAR NOT, O GREATLY BELOVED ONE!</small> (Dan. 9:23:) <small>AND I HAVE COME TO DECLARE &lt; IT &gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE {ONE WHO IS} GREATLY BELOVED</small>. And why did he call him <small>GREATLY BELOVED</small> three times? It is simply that a person is blessed when the angel brings him good news and says: You are beloved before the Holy One. You are also praised among the heavenly beings and beloved with your generation. Bezalel also was praised before the heavenly beings and among lower beings as well. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 31:2f.): <small>SEE, I HAVE CALLED BEZALEL &lt; … &gt; BY NAME; &lt; AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM &gt;</small>…. It is also written (in Exod. 35:30f.): <small>THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &lt; … &gt; BY NAME; &lt; AND HE HAS FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM &gt;</small>…. See, &lt; he is praised in one verse &gt; among the heavenly beings; see, &lt; he is praised in the other verse &gt; among the lower beings. Ergo, it says (in Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE &lt; AND GOOD FAVOR IN THE EYES OF GOD AND HUMANITY &gt;.</small>
Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE</small>. This is Abraham, who was pleasing to mortals and to angels. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 23:6): <small>HEAR ME, MY LORD &lt; ABRAHAM &gt;, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST</small>. Ergo, &lt; he was pleasing &gt; to mortals. Where is it shown &lt; that he was pleasing &gt; to the Holy One and to angels? Where it is stated (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &lt; WHAT I AM DOING &gt;</small> ?
R. Levi said: Why did the Holy One give a revelation to Abraham? Because he had reflected in his heart about the generation of the flood, and said: It is impossible that there are not some righteous ones among them. You yourself know that it is so. <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &lt; WHAT I AM DOING &gt;</small>? What did &lt; Abraham &gt; answer him (in Gen. 18:23)? <small>WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED</small>?
R. Levi said: That thing which Abraham said is the same thing which Job said.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 49:9.</i> Job, however, swallowed unripe fruit (i.e., spoke rashly), &lt; while &gt; Abraham ate it cooked. Job said (in Job 9:22): <small>IT IS ALL ONE; THEREFORE, I SAY: HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. But Abraham, who was wiser, said: <small>WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY</small> … ? &lt; Then &gt; he repented and said (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING, TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE, SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED!</small>
Another interpretation: Why did the Holy One give a revelation to Abraham? R. Judah the Levite spoke a parable:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 49:2.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and gave it to his friend as a gift. After some days the king needed to cut down &lt; some &gt; beams from it. The king said: Although it was mine, I gave it to my friend. I shall not cut them until I consult with my friend. So &lt; it was with &gt; the Holy One. When he brought &lt; Abraham &gt; up into the land of Israel, he said to him (in Gen. 13:14f.): <small>PLEASE LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND LOOK {TOWARD THE SEA AND TOWARD THE NORTH}</small> … and it is also written (in the next verse): <small>[FOR] ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, &lt; TO YOU WILL I GIVE IT, AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER &gt;</small>. When, therefore, the Holy One wanted to destroy those five cities, he said: I am not destroying them without Abraham knowing. If you should say that they were not part of the land of Canaan, see what is written (in Gen. 10:19): <small>AND THE BORDER OF CANAAN WAS FROM ZIDON, &lt; AS YOU GO TOWARD GERAR, UNTO GAZA; AS YOU GO TO SODOM, GOMORRAH, ADMAH, AND ZEBOIIM, UNTO LASHA &gt;</small>. He did not, therefore, destroy them until he had consulted with Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &lt; WHAT I AM DOING &gt;</small>?

It is written (in Job 20:23): <small>LET IT BE FOR FILLING HIS BELLY, LET HIM CAST HIS BURNING ANGER AT HIM, AND LET HIM BRING DOWN RAIN UPON {THEM} [HIM] IN HIS FLESH (<i>LEHUM</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. 4:7.</i> The retribution which came upon the Sodomites was for filling their belly, because they had filled their belly with transgressions, violence, and plunder. Therefore, when retribution came upon them, it filled their belly, as stated (ibid.): <small>LET HIM CAST HIS BURNING ANGER AT {THEM} [HIM]</small>. R. Me'ir said about the destruction of Sodom: The Scripture says (ibid.): <small>AND LET HIM BRING DOWN RAIN UPON {THEM} [HIM] IN HIS <i>LEHUM</i></small>. (Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS <i>LEHUM</i> (rt.: <i>LHM</i>)?</small> &lt; That it happened &gt; because of the wars (rt.: <i>LHM</i>) which they had fought with the Holy One.

R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said in the name of R. Johanan bar Nahman: When Amraphel and his associates came to fight with the Sodomites, because they had captured Lot, Abraham went out to fight against them. So he killed the kings, and they fled, just as it is written (in Gen. 14:10): <small>NOW THE VALLEY OF SIDDIM WAS FULL OF BITUMEN PITS; [AND THE KINGS OF SODOM &lt; AND GOMORRAH &gt; FLED] &lt; AND FELL THERE &gt;</small>. Abraham began reflecting: The kings came to fight with the Sodomites. So the kings fell, but those &lt; of Sodom and Gomorrah &gt; fled. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THOSE WHO REMAINED FLED TO THE MOUNTAIN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The following argument is to explain that, while some escaped, such sinners could not evade divine judgment forever.</i> Perhaps you will say: There were worthy ones among them.

(Gen. 18:15:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING!</small> Let our master instruct us: Is it correct for someone to stand and pray &lt; the <i>Amidah</i> &gt; with frivolity? Thus have our masters taught (in Ber. 5:1):<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>TBer</i>. 3:21; <i>yBer</i>. 5:1 (8d); <i>Ber</i>. 31a.</i> <small>ONE STANDS TO PRAY &lt; THE <i>AMIDAH</i> &gt; ONLY WITH REVERENCE</small>. David said (in Ps. 2:11): <small>SERVE THE LORD WITH FEAR, AND REJOICE WITH TREMBLING</small>. There is a story about a certain person who stood &lt; for the <i>Amidah</i> &gt; with frivolity and supported himself against the wall, but R. Samuel bar Nahmani turned him back. He said that he should not behave with frivolity. And so you find with the ancestors of the world. When they prayed, they would pray with fear. &lt; It is &gt; just as Moses said (in Deut. 9:18, 25): <small>THEN I PROSTRATED MYSELF BEFORE THE LORD</small>, when he was seeking mercy for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:11): <small>BUT MOSES IMPLORED &lt; THE LORD HIS GOD &gt;</small>. He girded his loins in prayer [to speak in defense<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synegoria</i>.</i> of Israel]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, (according to Exod. 32:11-13) <small>WHY DOES YOUR WRATH BURN AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE… ? WHY, O LORD, SHOULD THE EGYPTIANS SPEAK, &lt; SAYING: WITH EVIL INTENT HE BROUGHT THEM OUT TO KILL THEM IN THE MOUNTAINS &gt; … ? REMEMBER YOUR SERVANTS, ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND ISRAEL</small>…. Hezekiah bar Hiyya said: It was not pleasing to the Holy One until Moses mentioned the merit of the ancestors. The Holy One said to him: Moses, if they had not had the merit of the ancestors, I would have destroyed them. You do not know how to plead merit. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest in the name of R. Simon and R. Abbin in the name of R. Aha said: What did the Holy One do? He put on his prayer shawl, like the representative (<i>shaliah</i>) of a congregation [when he is passing] before the ark (i.e., leading the prayers), and said to Moses: Thus are you to pray to me and say (as in Exod. 34:6): <small>THE LORD, THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD</small>…. &lt; This interpretation is suggested by the beginning of the verse &gt;, where it is stated: <small>THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE MOSES AND PROCLAIMED</small>…. What is the meaning of <small>PASSED</small>? &lt; That the Holy One <small>PASSED BEFORE MOSES</small> &gt; like &lt; a prayer leader &gt; passing before the ark.

It is written (in Job 41:4 [12]): <small>I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT ABOUT HIS BOASTINGS, HAUGHTY TALK, AND HIS FAIR ARRAY OF WORDS</small>. The Holy One said: Lest the children of Adam say: We also speak with the Holy One just as Abraham spoke, and he is keeping silent for us, the Holy One said: No, <small>I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT ABOUT HIS BOASTINGS</small>. Only for Abraham alone do I keep silent. Why? Because he kept silent for me, I also keep silent for him. When did Abraham keep silent? When I said to him (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED</small>, and afterwards I said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON … &lt; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING &gt;</small>. Then he kept silent for me, as stated (in Ps. 38:14 [13]): <small>BUT I AM LIKE A DEAF PERSON, NOT HEARING, &lt; LIKE A DUMB PERSON, NOT OPENING HIS MOUTH &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout Gen. 21 &amp; 22 Abraham never responds to God.</i> I also will keep silent for him; and, even though he said harsh things, as stated (in Job 41:4 [12]): <small>HAUGHTY TALK, HIS FAIR ARRAY OF WORDS</small> was pleasing to me. And what is the meaning of <small>HAUGHTY TALK</small>? See what is written (in Gen. 18:23): <small>THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID: WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY &lt; THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED &gt;</small>? Abraham said to the Holy One (in Gen. 18:25): Sovereign of the World, <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &lt; TO DO SUCH A THING &gt;</small>, for will not those coming into the world say: This is his trade, that he destroy the generations by a rule of cruelty. He destroyed the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion &lt; of humankind &gt;. He did not abandon his trade. [Thus, Abraham said] (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>!<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 49:9.</i> The Holy One said to him: You have said this. Come and see, as I make all the generations that I have destroyed pass before you. Then I will show you that I did not collect their divine punishment from them &lt; before it was finally sealed &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34, ad loc.</i> Now, if it should cross your mind that I did not act fairly, teach me; and I will act &lt; accordingly &gt;. Thus it is stated (in Job 34:32): <small>WHAT I DO NOT SEE, YOU TEACH ME. IF I HAVE DONE WRONG, I WILL NOT CONTINUE</small>. So I will continue no more. They said to him: Sovereign of the World, far be it from you to issue judgment over all creation. Thus it is stated (in Job 34:10): <small>LISTEN TO ME, THEREFORE, O PEOPLE OF UNDERSTANDING; MAY WICKEDNESS BE FAR FROM GOD AND INJUSTICE, FROM THE ALMIGHTY</small>. Rather (in vs. 11): <small>FOR HE REPAYS A PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS ACTIONS</small>…. Therefore, he says (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &lt; TO DO SUCH A THING, TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED! FAR BE IT FROM YOU &gt;</small>!

Siman 11

Another interpretation: What is the reason that he says two times (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>? Abraham said: <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small> to bring all creation to judgment either in this world or in the world to come. He therefore says: <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU! FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>!

Siman 12

Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU!</small> Abraham said: Sovereign of the World, I see through the Holy Spirit that a certain woman is going to deliver an entire town.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 94:9; Eccl.. R. 9:18:2; M. Sam. 32.</i> So am I not worthy to deliver these five cities? Which woman was that? That was Serah bat Asher, in the time that Sheba ben Bichri rebelled against David and came to Abel, as stated (in II Sam. 20:15): <small>[THEN THEY CAME AND BESIEGED HIM IN ABEL] … AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH JOAB WERE DESTROYING THE WALL TO THROW IT DOWN</small>. When Serah perceived the situation, she began to cry out &lt; for Joab &gt;. They called Joab to her. When Joab came, she said (in vs. 17): <small>ARE YOU JOAB? AND HE SAID: YES</small>. You are a sage, since the Scripture praises you (in II Sam. 23:8) as <small>ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small> (i.e., in the academy)…. <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">These words are commonly understood as the proper name, <small>JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE</small>; but this midrash, along with Numb. R. 23:13 and <i>PR</i> 11:3, understands the passage as translated here. The attribution of the verse to Joab, the head of David’s army, is assumed because the person depicted here comes first in a listing of David’s mighty men and is identified as the chief of David’s captains. Moreover, although the listing contains no specific mention of Joab, it does contain the names of Joab’s brothers (in vss. 18 &amp; 24) and even his armor bearer (in vs. 37).</i> Have you not read in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY &lt; TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT &gt;</small> ? Thus, was it not up to you to do so? (II Sam. 20:18:) <small>{YOU} [THEY] USED TO SPEAK IN EARLY TIMES, SAYING: LET THEM SURELY ASK IN ABEL</small>. (Deut. 20:10f.:) <small>YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT (a hostile city). &lt; THEN IT SHALL BE, IF IT MAKES YOU AN ANSWER OF PEACE &gt;</small>…. (II Sam. 20:18f.:) <small>&lt; LET THEM SURELY ASK &gt; IN ABEL; AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE MATTER…. SO WHY WOULD YOU DEVOUR THE LORD'S HERITAGE</small>? When he heard that, Joab became afraid and said: There is a requirement here, as stated (in vs. 20): <small>{THEN JOAB SAID:} [THEN JOAB ANSWERED AND SAID: FAR BE IT], FAR BE IT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Note that these words return the argument to Gen. 18:25, in which the same expression also occurs.</i> <small>FROM ME &lt; THAT I SHOULD DEVOUR &gt;</small>…. But you, since you are a merciful &lt; God &gt;, is it pleasing for you to destroy these? (Gen. 18:25:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING, &lt; TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE, SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED! FAR BE IT FROM YOU &gt;</small> ! Now what did Joab say to her? (II Sam. 20:21:) <small>THE SITUATION IS NOT THE SAME, FOR A MAN FROM THE HILLS OF EPHRAIM NAMED SHEBA BEN BICHRI &lt; HAS RAISED HIS HAND AGAINST KING DAVID &gt;</small>…. Sheba is a man with a blemish, one who serves idols. (II Sam. 20:1:) <small>NOW THERE HAPPENED TO BE THERE A MAN OF BELIAL WHOSE NAME IS SHEBA BEN BICHRI</small>. She said to him (in vs. 19): <small>I AM THE SHELUME (rt.: <i>ShLM</i>) OF THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the new JPSA translation here: <small>I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE WELFARE OF THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL.</small></i> I am the one who completed (rt.: <i>ShLM</i>) the number of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 26:46): <small>AND THE NAME OF ASHER'S DAUGHTER WAS SERAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. 46:27, <small>THE TOTAL OF JACOB’S HOUSE WHO CAME INTO EGYPT WAS SEVENTY PERSONS</small>, but those named number only sixty-nine including Joseph, his two sons, and Serah. The extra person comes from counting Serah twice because of her long life. Numb. 26:46 shows that she was still alive at the time of the Exodus. Moreover, it was not too difficult to imagine that so old a woman had lived even longer into the reign of David and identify her with the wise woman of II Sam. 20:16. See the version of this tradition in <i>PRK</i> 11:13.</i> Just stay in your place, and I will make peace (rt.: <i>ShLM</i>). Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:21): <small>BEHOLD, HIS HEAD WILL BE THROWN TO YOU OVER THE WALL</small>. And so she had confidence in herself that she would deliver his head to Joab. But see what she did (according to vs. 22)! <small>THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HER WISDOM</small>? Simply that she said to them: Understand that Joab and all Israel are standing outside to kill us, our sons, and our daughters. They said to her: Why? She said to them: He would take a hundred people and go. They said to her: Let him take two hundred. She said to them: He only wants fifty people. They said to her: Let him take a hundred. She said to them: He only wants five: They said to her: Let him take ten. She said to them: He only wants one whose name is Sheba ben Bichri. When they heard that, they immediately went and cut off his head. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:22, cont.): <small>SO THEY CUT OFF THE HEAD OF SHEBA BEN BICHRI</small>. Look at the wisdom of this woman! In the same way Abraham came in wisdom before the Holy One. He came &lt; down &gt; from fifty to forty, from forty to thirty, from thirty to twenty, and from twenty to ten. So also with this woman (according to II Sam. 20:22): <small>THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM</small>. Regarding her Solomon gave praise<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> (in Eccl. 9:18): <small>WISDOM IS BETTER THAN INSTRUMENTS OF WAR</small>. The wisdom of Serah was better than the instruments of war that were in the hands of Joab. When Joab received the head of Sheba ben Bichri, he immediately went back without touching the city. Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, now if Joab, when he took the head of one person who was guilty, left the city alone, would you, who are merciful, destroy everyone? (Gen. 18:25:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>!

See how serious sexual perversion is when &lt; it is punished &gt; by burning. R. {Simeon} [Joshua] ben Levi said in the name of Bar Qappara: The Holy One granted atonement for everything except sexual perversion, as stated (in Prov. 6:29): <small>NO ONE WHO TOUCHES HER WILL BE CLEANSED</small>. R. Joshua bar Nehemiah said: The Sodomites also were liable to fire because they had erupted into sexual perversion. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE</small>. When they were found guilty, the Holy One said to the angels: Why are you standing about? Go and destroy them.

Solomon has said in (Prov. 22:6): <small>TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO</small>. Because Lot had grown up in Abraham's house, he had acquired &lt; Abraham's &gt; moral standards. &lt; Thus &gt; (in Gen. 19:1, cont.): <small>AND HE BOWED DOWN WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND</small>.

(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &gt;</small>…. Let our master instruct us: When a court has ordained a fast for the community so that rains may come down, and they do come down on that day, is it correct for them to finish it? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ta'an</i>. 25b [bar.]):<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The first half of the citation is also in <i>Ta‘an</i>. 3:9.</i> <small>IF THEY WERE FASTING, AND THE RAINS CAME DOWN BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN, THEY SHALL NOT FINISH IT. AFTER THE RISING OF THE SUN THEY SHALL FINISH IT. &lt; THESE ARE &gt; THE WORDS OF R. ME'IR, BUT R. JUDAH SAYS: BEFORE NOON THEY DO NOT COMPLETE IT; AFTER NOON THEY COMPLETE IT</small>. And where did the generations (i.e., the sages) find support that they should fast on Monday and Thursday? &lt; It is &gt; simply &lt; that &gt;, when Israel committed that act (i.e., of the golden calf), Moses went up &lt; onto the mountain &gt; on a Thursday and came down on a Monday. How is it shown? R. Levi said: He went up on a Thursday. Now from Thursday through &lt; the following &gt; Thursday to the Thursday &lt; after that &gt; there are fifteen &lt; days &gt;. And from Sabbath eve through &lt; the following &gt; Sabbath eve to the Sabbath eve &lt; after that &gt; there are fifteen &lt; days &gt;, for a total of thirty. Also from Sabbath to Sabbath there are eight &lt; days &gt;, for a total of thirty-eight. Then a Sunday and a Monday make forty &lt; days &gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The time Moses spent on Mount Sinai before he descended to discover Israel worshiping the golden calf. So Exod. 34:28; Deut. 9:9-11.</i> Therefore, the sages have ruled that one should fast on Monday and on Thursday, on &lt; the day of &gt; Moses' ascent and on &lt; that of &gt; his descent. Now at the end of forty days they fasted and wept before Moses, so that the Holy One was filled with mercy for them and appointed that day for them as a day of atoning for their sins. And this was the Day of Atonement, as stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU TO CLEANSE YOU</small>. See how lovely repentance (rt.: <i>ShVB</i>) is! The Holy One said (in Mal. 3:7): <small>RETURN (rt.: <i>ShVB</i>) UNTO ME AND I WILL RETURN (rt.: <i>ShVB</i>) UNTO YOU</small>. For, if there are some sins on one's hand and that person returns to the Holy One, he credits him as if he had not sinned. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 18:22): <small>&lt; NOT &gt; ANY OF HIS SINS WHICH HE COMMITTED &lt; SHALL BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM &gt;</small>…. But, when the Holy One has warned him a first time, and a second and a third, without him repenting, he exacts punishment from him, as stated (in Job 33:29): <small>BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS &lt; TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A PERSON &gt;</small>…. When he does not find pleasure in &lt; such a &gt; one, he immediately exacts punishment from him. You yourself know that it is so. When the Holy One desired to destroy Sodom and its people, Abraham stood and sought mercy for them. He thought that there might be hope for them, as stated (in Gen. 18:23): <small>THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID: &lt; WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED &gt;</small> ? What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 93:6.</i> R.

But the sages say: <small>DREW NEAR</small> is nothing but an expression of entreaty, as when it is stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM AND SAID: &lt; PRAY, MY LORD, PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK &gt;</small>…. Abraham said to the Holy One (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &lt; TO DO SUCH A THING &gt;</small>…. And he sought mercy for them until (in vss. 26-33) &lt; his request &gt; went down from fifty to ten. When he found no merit for them, the Divine Presence departed from him, as stated (in vs. 33): <small>THEN THE LORD WENT AWAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED</small>…. Immediately the retribution came upon them. {Thus it is stated} [Where is it shown? From what we read on the matter] (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &gt;</small>.

[(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 58:9 [8]): <small>LET THEM BE LIKE A SNAIL (<i>ShBLWL</i>),&lt; WHICH DISSOLVES AND GOES AWAY; LIKE A WOMAN'S STILLBIRTH, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE SUN &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen.

What &lt; else &gt; is written there (in vs. 24)? <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 58:9 [8]): What is the meaning of <small>LIKE A SNAIL (<i>ShBLWL</i>)</small>? Just as a flood stream (<i>ShBLT</i>) sweeps away whatever it comes upon, so it is with a rioter<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>thorubos</i> (tumult).</i> who rises up in a region. Anyone who is found with him is swept away with him. Thus it is stated: <small>LIKE A SNAIL (<i>ShBLWL</i>)</small>.

Because he was a rioter.

[(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 11:6): <small>UPON THE WICKED HE SHALL RAIN COALS; FIRE, BRIMSTONE, AND BURNING WIND SHALL BE THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. This portion was prepared before the world was created, as stated (ibid.): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>? (Ps. 75:9:) <small>FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP FOAMING WITH WINE, FULL OF MIXED WINE; AND OUT OF THIS HE POURS. &lt; AS FOR ITS DREGS, SURELY ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH SHALL DRAIN THEM OUT AND DRINK THEM. &gt; FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP</small>…. Lest you say that it was not full, the text says: <small>FULL OF MIXED WINE</small>. Lest you say: They did not drink from it, the text says: <small>OUT OF THIS HE POURS. AS FOR ITS DREGS, SURELY ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH SHALL DRAIN THEM OUT AND DRINK THEM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. From that cup they drank, as stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>.
(Ibid.:) <small>UPON THE WICKED HE SHALL RAIN COALS</small>. R. Hanina ben Pazzi said:<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 51:3.</i> The Holy One does not send down anything bad from above, only rain; and it &lt; then &gt; becomes brimstone.

Siman 19

Another interpretation (of Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FROM THE LORD</small>? It says (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>, while here (in Gen. 19:24) it says: <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD &gt;</small>. R. Berekhyah said: To what is the matter comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 51:2; <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 4:20.</i> To a king who was standing at a baker's oven. &lt; When &gt; his friend came in to him, he took out a piece of hot bread &lt; and &gt; gave it to him. &lt; When &gt; his enemy came in to him, he took up burning coals &lt; and &gt; gave them to him. So &lt; it is with &gt; the Holy One. When Israel came unto the desert, he brought down bread from the heavens for them, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. But when the Sodomites came to the point of transgressions, he brought down fire from the heavens for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND THE LORD</small>? That he sat over them with the authority of a court<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synedrion</i>.</i> of seventy-one,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The <small>AND</small> implies that it was <small>THE LORD</small> plus a Great Sanhedrin with seventy-one members, the proper court for trying an apostate town.

So they went forth to &lt; an execution by &gt; burning, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>&lt; FIRE &gt; FROM THE LORD</small>.

(I Kings 1:33:) <small>AND {HE} [THE KING] SAID {UNTO HIS SERVANTS} [TO THEM]: TAKE WITH YOU THE SLAVES OF YOUR LORD</small>. It was only necessary to say: "My servants." And where &lt; is an example found &gt; in the Torah? (In Gen. 4:23:) <small>AND LAMECH SAID TO HIS WIVES: ADAH AND ZILLAH, HEAR MY VOICE; O WIVES OF LAMECH</small>. It was only necessary to say: "My wives." So much for the Torah, but where &lt; is an example found &gt; in the Writings? Where it is stated (in Esth. 8:8): <small>FOR A WRITING WHICH IS WRITTEN IN THE KING'S NAME AND SEALED WITH THE KING'S SEAL</small>. It was only necessary to say: "With my seal." So also here (in Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN … FROM THE LORD</small>.

(Gen. 19:24:) <small>FROM THE LORD</small>. What is written before the verse (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 50:2.</i> Elsewhere (in Gen. 18:2) three came to Abraham, as stated: <small>WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES, HE LOOKED, AND BEHOLD, THREE PERSONS</small>. But here there are two, as stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME</small>. It is simply that the Holy One sent three angels, each one individually to perform his &lt; own particular &gt; mission. One went to bring good tidings to Sarah, one went to save Lot, and one went to destroy Sodom. An angel does not perform two missions, [nor do two angels perform one mission]. Michael went to bring good tidings to Sarah. "Surely we will return unto you" is not written here (in Gen. 18:14), but <small>I WILL RETURN</small>. He performed his mission and went away. Then the &lt; other &gt; two went to perform their missions, as stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING</small>. Elsewhere (in 18:2, 16, 19:5f.) &lt; Scripture &gt; has called them "persons," but here it has called them "angels." R. Alexandri, however, has said: &lt; When angels were &gt; near Abraham, they were &lt; called &gt; humans because angels were common in the house of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Qid</i>. 32b; cf. <i>BM</i> 86b.</i> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 31:27): <small>SHE OVERSEES THE ACTIVITIES (rt.: <i>HLK</i>) OF HER HOUSE</small>. Since those who went (rt.: <i>HLK</i>) to the house of Abraham were angels and because he was commonly among angels, they appeared to him in human form.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., angelic visits were as common as household activities in Abraham’s house.</i> But for Lot, who was ignorant<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idotes</i>, i.e., “lay person.”</i> &lt; about them &gt;, they appeared as angels. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM</small>….

Siman 21

It is written (in Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Beshallah</i> 7; <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 1:14; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:18; Cant. R. 1:9:1; see Exod. R.4:3.</i> R. Papias interpreted: Because he stands alone in his world, there is no one to interfere with him. Whatever he wants, he does. R. Aqiva said to him: Enough from you, Papias! One does not &lt; so &gt; interpret here. Rather, he does everything according to the Law. What is the meaning of <small>HAS ONENESS</small>? &lt; That &gt;, just as the petitioner petitions &lt; here &gt; below, so &lt; it is &gt; above. Just as the Sanhedrin conducts proceedings below, so &lt; it is &gt; above, as stated (in I Kings 22:19): <small>I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left {and right} above? And has it not already been stated (in Exod. 15:6): <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND, O LORD, GLORIOUS IN POWER, &lt; YOUR RIGHT HAND SHATTERS THE ENEMY &gt;</small> ? It is simply that the ones &lt; on the right &gt; tip the balance toward the side of merit, and the ones &lt; on the left &gt; tip the balance toward the side of guilt. Ergo, everything &lt; proceeds &gt; with justice. And, just as one who is a petitioner petitions &lt; here &gt; below, so &lt; it is &gt; above. Where is it shown? Where Daniel has said so (in Dan. 4:14 [17]): <small>THE RULING IS BY THE DECREE OF THE WATCHERS, AND THE PETITION {BY} THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONES</small>. Now you say: Because he stands alone in his world, he does whatever he wants! What is the meaning of <small>HAS ONENESS</small> (in Job 23:13)? R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Because he alone in his world knows justice for his creatures. [R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite &lt; said &gt;: Because he alone in the world knows the temperament of his creatures.] The one to whom he says: Go on my mission, goes. Hence it says (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. So also Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 1:6): <small>I AM &lt; BUT &gt; A LAD</small>. The Holy One said to him: <small>DO NOT SAY: I AM &lt; BUT &gt; A LAD</small>. So also with Sodom, he conducted the proceedings in their court and saw that their guilt merited destruction. Then after that he sent them (the angels) to destroy them. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM</small>.
Elsewhere (in 18:2, 16, 19:5f.) &lt; Scripture &gt; calls them "persons," but here it calls them "angels." To what is the matter comparable? To someone who received a dominion from the king. All the days that he was traveling on the road, he traveled as a <i>paganus</i> {i.e. alone} <sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word means “peasant.”</i> {He did not do otherwise.} When he arrived to take his place, his tax collectors and the natives of the region began honoring him. So &lt; it was with &gt; the angels when they came to destroy the region. Before they entered Sodom, they traveled like humans. After they came to Sodom, it is written (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME</small>. Did they depart from Abraham's place at noon and come to Sodom &lt; only &gt; in the evening?<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 50:1.</i> It is simply that they were angels of mercy and had waited for the possibility that Abraham might plead &lt; some &gt; merit on their account so that &lt; the city &gt; would not be destroyed. For that reason they had waited until the evening.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 19:1): Why <small>IN THE EVENING</small>? Because the deeds of the Sodomites were dark like evening and night.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 4:15.</i>
(Gen. 19:1:) <small>AND LOT WAS SITTING AT THE GATE OF SODOM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 50:3.</i> The written text has <small>SAT</small> (with a vowel letter missing from the Hebrew). There were five judges in Sodom. Now Lot was inferior to all of them, but they had him sit among them, for such is the written text: <small>AND LOT SAT AT THE GATE OF SODOM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the written text refers, not to Lot’s continuing to sit at the gate, but to his taking his seat as judge there.</i> (Prov. 22:6:) <small>TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO</small>. Since &lt; Lot &gt; had grown up in Abraham's house and had seen him receive travelers, he had learned from him. He therefore brought the angels home with him. What is written there (in Gen. 19:4)? <small>BEFORE THEY HAD LAIN DOWN, &lt; THE MEN OF THE CITY, THE MEN OF SODOM, HAD SURROUNDED THE HOUSE &gt;</small>…. The angels began to be astonished, saying: This matter has reached even us! Lot said to the angels: What have you come here to do? They said to him (in Gen. 19:13): <small>FOR WE ARE DESTROYING &lt; THIS PLACE &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 19:9; 68:2.</i> They revealed their <i>mysterion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Greek.</i> {i.e., secret} to him. For that reason they were banished one hundred and thirty-eight years from their precincts. R. Tanhuma said one hundred and thirty years according to the number of the sacred ladder &lt; as reckoned &gt; by gematria.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>geometria</i> or <i>grammateis</i>. The sacred ladder, seen in Jacob’s dream, bridged heaven and earth. The Hebrew word for “ladder” is <i>SLM</i>. By gematria <i>S</i> = 60, <i>L</i> = 30, and <i>M</i> = 40, for a total of 130.</i>

HER VINEYARDS</small>: These are the prophets. (Ibid.:) <small>THE VALLEY OF ACHOR (rt.: '<i>KR</i>) IS WITH A DOOR OF HOPE</small>. &lt; This means &gt;: A valley which I afflicted (rt.: '<i>KR</i>) with my wrath <small>IS WITH A DOOR OF HOPE</small>. At that time they will voice a song, as stated (in ibid., cont.): <small>AND SHE WILL RESPOND (rt.: '<i>NH</i>) FROM THERE AS IN THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH</small>; and one does not use <small>RESPOND (rt.: '<i>NH</i>)</small> except in reference to song. Thus one finds stated (in Ps. 147:7): <small>SING (rt.: '<i>NH</i>) TO THE LORD WITH THANKSGIVING</small>.

THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN &lt; UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE … AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES &gt;</small>. R.

Wherefore, note how David gives praise<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> (in Ps. 148:1, 7f.): <small>HALLELUJAH! PRAISE THE LORD FROM THE HEAVENS…. &lt; PRAISE THE LORD … FIRE AND HAIL &gt;</small>…. But there is no fire there &lt; in the heavens &gt;, no hail, and no brimstone. Our colleague R.

From on earth, as stated (in Ps. 148:7) <small>PRAISE THE LORD FROM THE EARTH, YOU SEA MONSTERS AND ALL OCEAN DEEPS</small>. Ergo: &lt; Retribution is &gt; <small>FROM THE EARTH</small>. &lt; Then &gt; how can it be written (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN … &lt; FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &gt;</small> ? Simply to teach you &lt; this &gt;: From the beginning when they were created, the Holy One gave a decree concerning them and said to them: In accordance with how you shall see the creatures, so let it be done to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

So &lt; also &gt; the Holy One said to the heavens: Whatever you see, do. For the Sodomites and the children of Esau there would be brimstone and fire; for Israel, dew. Thus it is stated (in Micah 5:6 [7]): <small>THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES, LIKE DEW</small>. The Holy One said: What need do I have for these people? He immediately destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25): <small>AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES</small>…. Ergo, it says (in Job 14:18): <small>AND YET A FALLING MOUNTAIN WILL CRUMBLE, AND THE ROCK IS REMOVED FROM ITS PLACE</small>.

(Gen. 20:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 26:4f.): <small>I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE… I HAVE HATED THE COMMUNITY OF EVILDOERS, &lt; AND WILL NOT DWELL WITH THE WICKED &gt;. I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE</small>. These are the people of the Tower &lt; of Babel &gt;, who were &lt; in fact &gt; false people. They went and said to Abraham: Come and dwell with us, since you are a valiant man, for we see that the Holy One has made his dwelling above and left us below. The Holy Spirit, however, cries out (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. You could not dwell in security even for one hour. (Ps. 82:5:) <small>THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN, AND THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; THEY WILL WALK ABOUT IN DARKNESS. THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN</small>. This is the generation of Enosh<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 4:26, which rabbinic texts interpret to mean that in the days of Enosh people began practicing idolatry.</i> <small>AND THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND</small>. [This is] the generation of the flood. <small>THEY WILL WALK ABOUT IN DARKNESS</small>. This is the generation of the Tower &lt; of Babel &gt;. Abraham said to them: What are you seeking from the Holy One who dwells above? Has he perhaps said to you: Come, labor and provide<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pronoos</i>, i.e., “thinking beforehand.”</i> for me? He creates, and he provides; he makes, and he sustains. What do you want from him? (Gen. 11:4:) <small>{THEY SAID TO HIM} [THEN THEY SAID]: COME, LET US BUILD FOR OURSELVES A CITY AND A TOWER</small>. Then let us place our idols above him and make war with him. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LET US MAKE A NAME (i.e., a god) FOR OURSELVES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See M.Pss. 74:2.</i> Thus it is &lt; also &gt; written (in Exod. 23:13): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MENTION THE NAME OF OTHER GODS</small>. Abraham said to them: What are all these for? They said to him: Lest he do to us something like what he did to earlier generations. He said to them: You have forsaken (what Prov. 18:10 calls) <small>A TOWER OF STRENGTH, THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>; yet you say: <small>AND LET US MAKE A NAME (i.e., a god) FOR OURSELVES!</small> What did the Holy One do? He dispersed them, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>. Now to what extent had they built and ascended the Tower? The Holy One was deriding them, as stated (in Ps. 2:4): <small>THE ONE WHO DWELLS IN THE HEAVENS WILL LAUGH; &lt; THE LORD WILL DERIDE THEM &gt;</small>. When they had gone up above on the Tower, &lt; there follows &gt; immediately (in vs. 5): <small>THEN HE WILL SPEAK UNTO THEM IN HIS WRATH</small>…. So it (the Tower) fell from on high, as stated (in Ps. 5:11 [10]): <small>CONDEMN THEM, O GOD, LET THEM FALL BY THEIR OWN COUNSELS</small>. Thus Abraham had no dealings with them. Then the Holy One looked down upon them and saw them, as stated (in Ps. 53: 3f. [2f.]): <small>{THE LORD} [GOD] OF HEAVEN LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CHILDREN OF ADAM … ALL OF THEM ARE DROSS</small>…. When they became dross, they made themselves deities. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, NOT EVEN ONE</small>. From here you learn that Abraham was not one of them. The <small>ONE</small> mentioned here is none but Abraham, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE AND HE INHERITED THE LAND</small>. Abraham began saying (in Ps. 26:4f.): <small>I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE; I HAVE HATED THE COMMUNITY OF EVILDOERS</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 20:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>.

(Gen. 20:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>. It is written (in Prov. 27:10): <small>&lt; DO NOT FORSAKE &gt; YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND … &lt; A CLOSE NEIGHBOR IS BETTER THAN A DISTANT BROTHER &gt;</small>. This &lt; verse refers to &gt; Hanun ben Nahash, king of the children of Ammon, as mentioned (in II Sam. 10:1f.): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THAT THAT {NAHASH} THE KING OF THE CHILDREN OF AMMON, DIED; &lt; AND HIS SON HANUN REIGNED IN HIS STEAD. &gt; THEN DAVID SAID: I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>. R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Pedat: And how did Nahash deal faithfully with David, since he had said (ibid., cont.), <small>AS HIS FATHER DEALT FAITHFULLY WITH ME</small>? Simply &lt; like this &gt;: When David fled from Saul, David and all his father's house went to Moab. He said to them: Receive my father, as stated (in I Sam. 22:4): <small>SO HE BROUGHT &lt; HIS PARENTS &gt; BEFORE THE KING OF MOAB</small>. (I Sam. 22:3:) <small>AND HE SAID [UNTO THE KING OF MOAB]: PLEASE LET MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER {DWELL} [GO AWAY] &lt; WITH YOU &gt;</small>. So he received them. When David went away, the king of Moab arose and killed the father, mother, and brothers of David. Only one of them survived, as &lt; only one &gt; is mentioned &lt; in David's census &gt; (in I Chron. 27:18): <small>BELONGING TO JUDAH &lt; THERE WAS &gt; ELIHU, ONE OF DAVID'S BROTHERS</small>. R.Levi bar Halafta the Priest said that only one of them survived. And how was Elihu saved? He simply fled from the king of Moab and came to Nahash, king of Ammon, who received him. The king of Moab sent and said to Nahash: Did, perhaps, one of David's brothers come to you? He said to him: No; and he kept him until David came. For that reason David said (in II Sam. 10:2): <small>I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>. When David's representatives<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The word here is <i>sheluah</i>, the Hebrew equivalent of “apostle.”</i> came to Hanun, the princes of the children of Ammon said to him (in I Sam. 10:3): What is this? <small>DO YOU THINK THAT DAVID IS HONORING YOUR FATHER &lt; JUST &gt; BECAUSE DAVID SENT COMFORTERS TO YOU</small>? Do not trust David. Why? Because the Holy One has warned him about us. It is written {for him} in his Law (in Deut. 23:4): <small>NO AMMONITE OR MOABITE SHALL COME INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 23:7): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE AND BENEFIT</small>. Thus the Holy One has warned him. So will he despise the words of his God, and say (in II Sam. 10:2): <small>I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>? (Ibid., vs. 3:) <small>IS IT NOT IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE CITY</small>? Immediately (in vs. 4) <small>HANUN TOOK THE SERVANTS OF DAVID AND SHAVED OFF &lt; HALF OF THEIR BEARDS &gt;</small>…. The Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 27:10): <small>&lt; DO NOT FORSAKE &gt; YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND</small>…. And so it was with Jehoram ben Jehoshaphat. When he became king, he killed all his brothers, as stated (in II Chron. 21:4): <small>WHEN JEHORAM HAD RISEN UP OVER THE KINGDOM OF HIS FATHER, HE CONSOLIDATED HIS POWER AND KILLED ALL HIS BROTHERS {AND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE}</small>.
What is the meaning (of Prov. 27:10): <small>A CLOSE NEIGHBOR IS BETTER THAN A DISTANT BROTHER</small>? The Holy One said to Abimelech ben Jerubbaal (of Jud. 9): King Abimelech of the Philistines is better than you because he gave a lot of honor to Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 20:15): <small>THEN ABIMELECH SAID: HERE BEFORE YOU IS MY LAND</small>. Why did he say this? It is simply that he saw all the honor with which the Holy One had honored him, as stated (in Gen. 20:3): <small>BUT GOD CAME UNTO ABIMELECH IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>. He said to him (ibid.): You fool! <small>HERE YOU ARE TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE WOMAN WHOM YOU HAVE TAKEN</small>. You have all this happiness at hand, and you are dying on account of a woman! Did you not consider that (in ibid., cont.) <small>SHE IS A MARRIED WOMAN (lit.: A HUSBAND'S WIFE)</small>? What is the meaning of this <small>HUSBAND'S (<i>ba'al</i>, rt.: <i>B'L</i>) WIFE (<i>be'ulah</i>, rt.: <i>B'L</i>)</small>? {Is it not} [simply that] she is the mistress (<i>ba'alah</i>, rt.: <i>B'L</i>) of a {mistress} [husband] (<i>ba'al</i>, rt.: <i>B'L</i>)?
(Gen. 20:4:) <small>NOW ABIMELECH HAD NOT APPROACHED &lt; HER &gt;</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, everyone is equal before you. Job has said (in Job 9:22): <small>IT IS ALL ONE … HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. (Gen. 20:4:) <small>WOULD YOU SLAY EVEN THE RIGHTEOUS GENTILE</small>? In the case of the Sodomites, when they had not sinned before you, would you have destroyed them? So with me, when I have not sinned before you, would you slay me? (Gen. 20:4f.:) <small>WOULD YOU SLAY EVEN THE RIGHTEOUS? DID HE NOT SAY TO ME: SHE IS MY SISTER?… I DID THIS WITH AN INNOCENT HEART AND CLEAN HANDS</small>. Moreover, I did not believe it until I had asked her (in vs. 5, cont.), <small>BUT EVEN SHE HERSELF SAID: HE IS MY BROTHER</small>. Still I did not believe it until I had asked her donkey and camel drivers, and they said: She is his sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The Buber text has “my sister.”</i> (Gen. 20:6:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO HIM IN THE DREAM: I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE THIS WITH AN INNOCENT HEART</small>. The Holy One said: In one way you are blameless, but in one way you have lied. Your innocent heart is here (in this text); your clean hands are not here. You know that this is so. "With clean hands" is not what is written here but <small>WITH AN INNOCENT HEART</small>. The Holy One said to him. You have desired to sin against me, <small>BUT I, EVEN I, SAVED YOU FROM SINNING AGAINST ME</small>. They said about this <small>ABIMELECH</small> that he was proper in that he did not touch her. Our masters have said: It was good for him that it is so written (in Gen. 20:4): <small>NOW ABIMELECH HAD NOT APPROACHED HER</small>. Abimelech said: Sovereign of the World, to be sure, you are persuaded<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. <i>peitho</i>.</i> that I did not touch her. Who will persuade her husband that I did not touch her?<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 52:8.</i> The Holy One said to him: What do you care about persuasion?<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. <i>peisis</i>.</i> He knows. Why? Because he is a prophet, as stated (in Gen. 20:7): <small>SO NOW, RESTORE THE MAN'S WIFE, FOR HE IS A PROPHET</small>. If he prays for you, you shall live; (ibid.): <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT RESTORE HER, KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DIE</small>. Blessed are the righteous, for so the Holy One glorifies them.

(Gen. 20:8:) <small>THEN ABIMELECH AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>…. Having observed the morning, when would he arise? Immediately (ibid.), <small>HE AROSE AND CALLED ALL HIS SERVANTS</small>. He said to them: The Holy One said thus and so to me in a dream at night. They said to him: Do not be afraid. Dreams speak empty talk; so would you be afraid of dreams? When they had said this to him, the Holy One said to him (in vs. 7): <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT RESTORE HER, KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DIE</small>. (Gen. 8f.:) <small>SO THE MEN WERE VERY AFRAID. THEN ABIMELECH CALLED ABRAHAM</small>. Abraham said to Abimelech (in vss. 11f.): <small>BECAUSE I SAID: SURELY THE FEAR OF GOD IS NOT IN THIS PLACE … AND MOREOVER SHE IS INDEED MY SISTER, MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER, BUT NOT THE DAUGHTER OF MY MOTHER</small>. Hence they have said: A gentile star worshiper has no father.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., one does not recognize the father’s family because a father’s daughter is permitted him, but a mother’s daughter is not. A marriage to her would be incestuous. So Gen. R. 18:5; 52:11; see <i>yYev</i>. 18:2 (12a); <i>Yev</i>. 98ab; <i>Sanh</i>. 57b-58a.</i>

(Gen. 20:14:) <small>THEN ABIMELECH TOOK &lt; SHEEP AND OXEN &gt;</small>…. He said to Abraham (in vs. 15): <small>HERE, MY LAND IS BEFORE YOU. &lt; DWELL WHEREVER YOU PLEASE &gt;</small>. See the honor with which he honored Abraham! And not only him, but Sarah as well. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in vs. 16): <small>AND TO SARAH HE SAID: LOOK, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER; &lt; LOOK, THIS BELONGS TO YOU AS A COVERING OF THE EYES &gt;</small> <sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In idiomatic Hebrew the clause means: <small>IT IS YOUR VINDICATION.</small></i> <small>BEFORE ALL WHO ARE WITH YOU</small>….

Siman 28

The Holy One said to Abimelech ben Gideon (of Jud. 9): O wicked one, see the honor that Abimelech paid to Abraham! Now you have arisen and killed your brothers, (according to vs. 5): <small>SEVENTY MEN ON ONE STONE</small>. Woe to that man, for thus Solomon has spoken (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO DIGS A PIT WILL FALL INTO IT</small>. Accordingly, he also was not killed other than by means of a stone, as stated (in vs. 53): <small>THEN A CERTAIN WOMAN CAST A MILLSTONE &lt; UPON ABIMELECH'S HEAD AND BROKE HIS SKULL &gt;</small>. The Holy One said to him: I have written in my Torah (in Prov. 10:27): <small>THE FEAR OF THE LORD INCREASES ONE'S DAYS, BUT THE YEARS OF THE WICKED WILL BE SHORTENED</small>. Now you have killed your brothers. By your life, I am shortening the years of that man (i.e., Abimelech). He therefore only reigned three years, as stated (in Jud. 9:22): <small>NOW ABIMELECH RULED OVER ISRAEL THREE YEARS</small>.

Siman 29

(Prov. 18:12:) <small>A PERSON'S HEART IS HAUGHTY BEFORE DESTRUCTION</small>. This person was Abimelech, who was not destroyed until he had exalted himself and killed his brothers. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HUMILITY GOES BEFORE HONOR</small>. This was his father, Gideon; for when they said to him (in Jud. 8:22): <small>RULE OVER US, YOU, [YOUR SON, AND YOUR SON'S SON AS WELL</small>], he said to them (in vs. 23): <small>I WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU MYSELF, [NOR SHALL MY SON RULE OVER YOU; THE LORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU]</small>. They said three things to him, and he said three things to them. The Holy One said to him: You say this. By your life, I am raising up from you a son who will reign three years corresponding to the three things that you said. Ergo (in Prov. 18; 12): <small>AND HUMILITY GOES BEFORE HONOR</small>. Therefore (in Jud. 9:22): <small>NOW ABIMELECH RULED [OVER ISRAEL THREE YEARS]</small>.
(Jud. 9:23:) <small>THEN GOD SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT &lt; BETWEEN ABIMELECH AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM &gt;</small>. Also at the end &lt; of the story &gt; it is written (in vs. 57): <small>AND UPON THEM CAME THE CURSE OF JOTHAM BEN JERUBBAAL</small>. What is written there (in vs. 7)? <small>BUT, WHEN THEY TOLD JOTHAM</small> (about the Shechemites making Abimelech their king), <small>[HE WENT AND STOOD AT THE TOP OF MOUNT GERIZIM]</small>. Now why did he stand at the top of Mount Gerizim for cursing, when (according to Deut. 27:13-26) they only gave curses on Mount Ebal? It is simply that Jotham said this: The Samaritans are going to say: Mount Gerizim is ours because there were the blessings given; but they will not know that curses are given there. How is that? It is simply this: The ones who were standing on Mount Ebal and cursing, at whom were they cursing? Was it not at those who were standing opposite them (on Gerizim)? The ones who were blessing, at whom were they blessing? Was it not at those who were opposite them (on Ebal)? It turns out that the curses come upon Mount Gerizim, and the blessings, upon Mount Ebal. For that reason, Jotham said: I am standing only on Mount Gerizim when cursing my brother and the people of Shechem. He began by saying (in Jud. 9:8): <small>THE TREES WENT &lt; TO ANOINT A KING OVER THEMSELVES &gt;</small>…. R. Meshe said: These words that Jotham spoke are a parable. How? <small>THE TREES WENT</small>. These are Israel. (Jud. 9:8, cont.:) <small>AND THEY SAID TO THE OLIVE TREE</small>. This is Othniel ben Kenaz, in that he was from the tribe of Judah (cf. Jud. 1:13; 3:9-11). Thus it is stated (about Judah in Jer. 11:16): <small>&lt; THE LORD HAS CALLED YOUR NAME &gt; A GREEN OLIVE TREE, &lt; FAIR WITH GOOD FRUIT &gt;</small>. Now what did Othniel say to them (in Jud. 9:9)? <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY FATNESS</small>? Olive oil is pure. They came to Deborah (according to Jud. 9:10): <small>AND [THE TREES] SAID TO THE FIG TREE: &lt; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &gt;</small>. This refers to Deborah. She said to them (in vs. 11): <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY SWEETNESS</small>? (Cf. Jud. 5:1:) <small>THEN DEBORAH SANG</small>. (Jud. 9:12:) <small>THEN THE TREES SAID TO THE VINE: &lt; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &gt;</small>. It said to them (in vs. 13): <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY NEW WINE? TO THE VINE</small> (in vs. 12) refers to Barak and Gideon (according to Jud. 8:22): <small>RULE OVER US, YOU, &lt; YOUR SON, AND YOUR SON'S SON AS WELL &gt;</small>. He said to them (in vs. 23): <small>I WILL NOT RULE</small>. When they saw this, (according to vs. 14:) <small>THEN ALL THE TREES SAID UNTO THE BRAMBLE: &lt; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &gt;</small>. This refers to Abimelech. Just as this bramble is full of thorns, so was Abimelech full of evil deeds. When they invited him to reign, what did he say to them (in vs. 2): <small>AND REMEMBER THAT I AM YOUR BONE AND YOUR FLESH</small>. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 29:26): <small>MANY SEEK AUDIENCE FROM A RULER, &lt; BUT IT IS FROM THE LORD THAT ONE RECEIVES JUSTICE &gt;</small>. What did the bramble say to them (in Jud. 9:15)? <small>COME AND TAKE REFUGE IN MY SHADE</small>. Is it not better for you to make me alone king rather than seventy? Immediately (according to Jud. 11:11): <small>AND [THE PEOPLE] SET HIM OVER THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The passage concerns the elders of Gilead and Jephthah, not the Shechemites and Abimelech.</i> Jotham said to them (in Jud. 9:16 or 19, also vs. 20): <small>IF &lt; YOU HAVE ACTED &gt; TRULY &lt; AND UPRIGHTLY…. BUT IF NOT, LET FIRE COME FORTH FROM ABIMELECH AND DEVOUR THE PEOPLE OF SHECHEM &gt;</small>…. Then it written (in vs. 57): <small>AND UPON THEM CAME THE CURSE OF JOTHAM</small>. When? (In Jud. 9:23:) <small>THEN GOD SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT &lt; BETWEEN ABIMELECH AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM &gt;</small>. Blessed are those who are righteous; for wherever they go, the Holy One preserves them; and they are recognized among the nations. Thus it is stated (in Is. 61:9): <small>AND THEIR SEED IS KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS</small>.

(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>. Let our master instruct us: If there is a quarrel between someone and his friend, how is there atonement for him on the Day of Atonement?<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PR</i> 38.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Yoma</i> 8:9): <small>FOR TRANSGRESSIONS THAT ARE BETWEEN SOMEONE AND THE OMNIPRESENT, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT ATONES. FOR &lt; TRANSGRESSIONS &gt; THAT ARE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS COMPANION, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT DOES NOT ATONE UNTIL HE MAKES PEACE WITH HIS COMPANION</small>. <sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

It is also written (in Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &lt; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &gt; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. R. Judah said: The one who confesses in order to forsake &lt; transgressions &gt; shall obtain mercy. Now you find it to be so (in Scripture). All the days that Job was angry with his companions and his companions with him, strict justice was extended against him. Thus it is stated (in Job 30:4): <small>BUT NOW THOSE WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN I LAUGH AT ME</small>. He said to Eliphaz: And are you not a son of Esau?<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash identifies Job’s companion with the Eliphaz mentioned in Gen. 36:4, 10-12, 15-16;I Chron. 1:35-36.</i> If your father had persisted in begging me to have him eat with my dogs, I should have refused him. (Thus Job 30:1 continues:) <small>WHOSE FATHERS I REFUSED TO SET WITH THE DOGS OF MY FLOCK</small>. Then his companions said: Are you the only venerable one? We also have venerable ones, as stated (in Job 15:10): <small>(WE ALSO HAVE) [WITH US ALSO ARE] BOTH THE OLD AND THE VENERABLE, &lt; OLDER THAN YOUR FATHER &gt;</small>. Then, when the Holy one appeared to them and said to them: Why are you persisting? Come and make peace with Job. Thus it is stated (in Job 42:8): <small>NOW THEREFORE, TAKE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS, &lt; GO UNTO MY SERVANT JOB, AND SACRIFICE A BURNT OFFERING FOR YOURSELVES. &gt; THEN LET MY SERVANT JOB PRAY FOR YOU</small>. &lt; When the Holy One had so spoken &gt;, they immediately went and did so. What is written there (in vs. 10)? <small>AND THE LORD RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF JOB</small>. When? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN HE PRAYED FOR HIS FRIENDS</small>. So &lt; it was with &gt; Abimelech (according to Gen. 20:17): <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED &lt; UNTO GOD; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &gt;</small>…. The Holy One said: Abraham has sought mercy for Abimelech; I will visit him. Immediately (there follows in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.

Eleazar ben Pedat said: Every place that you find <small>AND THE LORD</small>, &lt; the words mean &gt; "he and his <i>sygkletos</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “assembly” or “senate.”</i> {i.e., his host}.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yBer.</i> 9:7 (14b); Gen.

When they all agreed and said: Yes, the Holy One set his seal after theirs. This is the meaning of (Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>….

[(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.] There are four keys (rt.: <i>PTH</i>): the key to sustenance, the key to rain, the key to graves, and the key to barren women.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. below, Gen. 7:16; Frag.

Where it is stated (in Ps. 145:16): <small>YOU OPEN (rt.: <i>PTH</i>) YOUR HAND &lt; AND SATISFY THE DESIRE OF EVERY LIVING BEING &gt;</small>. Where is it shown about rain? Where it is stated (in Deut. 28:12): <small>THE LORD WILL OPEN (rt.: <i>PTH</i>) FOR YOU &lt; HIS BOUNTEOUS TREASURY, THE HEAVENS, TO GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND IN ITS SEASON &gt;</small>.

(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 20:17)? <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED &lt; UNTO GOD; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &gt;</small>…. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend and loved him exceedingly; so he did everything that his friend asked of him. Since everybody knew that the king loved him exceedingly, anyone who sought an office came to him. Then he would make a request of the king, and he would fulfill his desire for him. Yet, to that friend he did not give any office at all. The people of his palace<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>palation</i>; Lat.: <i>palatium</i>.</i> said to him: Our Lord King, this friend of yours makes requests for others, but for himself he requests nothing. Who is this friend? This is Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>THE SEED OF MY FRIEND ABRAHAM</small>. When Abimelech took Sarah, the Holy One closed up all their springs, as stated (in Gen. 20:18): <small>FOR THE LORD HAD COMPLETELY RESTRAINED &lt; EVERY WOMB IN THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH &gt;</small>. When, however, Abimelech made a request of Abraham, he was healed because he had prayed for him. It is so stated (in Gen. 20:17): <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED UNTO GOD; &lt; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &gt;</small>…. The ministering angels said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, Abraham is healing others, but he &lt; himself &gt; needs healing. He healed Abimelech and his house, so that they bore &lt; children &gt;. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND GOD HEALED &lt; ABIMELECH &gt;</small>. So are you not healing him? The Holy One said: He is worth having me give him children. Look at the work of the Holy One! It is not like the work of flesh and blood. A human promises to give a gift to his companion. Sometimes he gives it; sometimes he does not give it. But the Holy One is not like that. When he promises to do something good, he immediately does something good. Balaam said (in Numb. 23:19): <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN THAT HE SHOULD LIE</small>. And again he said (ibid.): <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike other interpretations of this verse, the midrash does not interpret these words as an interrogative.</i> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: In this verse the end does not correspond to the beginning, nor the beginning to the end. Thus he says &lt; at the beginning of the verse &gt;: <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN THAT HE SHOULD LIE</small>…. Yet again he says &lt; at the end of the verse &gt;: <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT; &lt; AND WHEN HE HAS SPOKEN, HE WILL NOT FULFILL IT &gt;</small>. It is simply that, in the case of a descendant of Adam, <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT</small>. But, when the Holy One promises, he acts; when he decrees, he fulfills.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yTa‘an</i>. 2:1 (65b); Gen. R. 53:4; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 4:13; M. Pss. 13:1.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH &lt; AS HE HAD PROMISED &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH &lt; AS HE HAD PROMISED, AND THE LORD DID UNTO SARAH AS HE HAD SPOKEN &gt;</small> at the very time (mentioned in Gen. 18:14): <small>AT THE SET TIME I WILL RETURN UNTO YOU, AT THE TIME THAT LIFE IS DUE, &lt; AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON &gt;</small>. Zavday bar Levi said: The Holy One scratched for her a mark on the wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Exod. R. 12:2.</i> He said to her: When the sun comes to here, you shall bear, as stated (in Gen. 18:14): <small>AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD DID UNTO SARAH AS HE HAD SPOKEN</small>.

(Gen. 21:2:) <small>SO SARAH CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON TO ABRAHAM IN HIS OLD AGE</small>. There is an analogy here between her conception and her giving birth. Just as her conception was painless, so was her giving birth painless.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">For the same tradition applied to Jochebed, cf. <i>Sot</i>. 12a; Exod. R. 1:20.</i> Hezekiah bar Hiyya said: What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS OLD AGE</small>? &lt; He &gt; was grinding &lt; away at sexual intercourse &gt; and emitting nothing. <small>IN HIS OLD AGE</small> &lt; means &gt; that he was exceedingly aged.
(Gen. 21:6:) <small>SARAH SAID: GOD MADE LAUGHTER FOR ME; &lt; EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME &gt;</small>. The verse teaches how in the hour that Isaac was born, the sick were healed, the deaf regained their hearing, and the blind began to see.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 53:8; <i>PRK</i> 22:1; cf. <i>PR</i> 42:4.</i> It therefore says: <small>GOD MADE LAUGHTER FOR ME</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME</small>? Surely not that everyone heard! But what is the meaning of <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS</small>? That the Holy One increased the light of the sun and the moon. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>AND GOD MADE THE TWO LIGHTS THE GREATER ONES</small>. Therefore: <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 53:8 and <i>PRK</i> 22:1, according to which, just as in Gen. 1:16 the word <small>MADE</small> speaks of God giving light to the world, so in Gen. 21:6 <small>MADE</small> implies the addition of more light for the world.</i>
(Gen. 21:7:) <small>THEN SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED (<i>MLL</i>) TO ABRAHAM</small>! &lt; These words imply &gt; that he had within himself the virility of youth!<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

R. 48:16.</i> Now the word <small>PROCLAIMED (<i>MLL</i>)</small> is nothing but a word &lt; implying &gt; virility, just as you say (in Deut. 23:26 [25]): <small>THEN YOU SHALL NOT PLUCK RIPE EARS (rt.: <i>MLL</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">This root may also be seen as related to <i>milah</i>, the “circumcised member.”</i> &lt; WITH YOUR HAND &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:7): <small>WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED! &lt; WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED &gt;</small> that my children are going to say to the Holy One at the &lt; Reed &gt; Sea (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU</small>….
(Gen. 21:7, cont.:) <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>! R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said in the name of R. Hilqiyah: Now she did not bear Isaac alone, since it says <small>SARAH WILL SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>. But what is the meaning (of ibid.): <small>WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED (<i>MLL</i>)!</small> <i>M</i> is forty; <i>L</i> &lt; plus &gt; <i>L</i> equal sixty for a total of one hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:7, cont.): <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN!</small> R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: When Sarah bore, the women of the gentile nations were skeptical and said: Is it possible for her to give birth? They also said to each other: Now is not Sarah an old woman? But perhaps it was her bondwoman. So what did they do? Taking their children, they went to Sarah and said: Suckle this child. Then she suckled their children, as stated (in Gen. 21:7, cont.): <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>!

Siman 38

Our masters have said: All the Egyptian women's children whom Sarah suckled, all of them became proselytes; and do not be surprised at the news. So you find the following in the case of Eliphaz ben Esau (of Gen. 36:10f.; I Chron. 1:35f.): Because he grew up in the bosom of Isaac, he became righteous and was worthy of having the Holy Spirit rest (<i>Sharah</i>) <sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">In an unvocalized text the verb could be read as (<i>Sarah</i>).</i> upon him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. R. Eleazar {bar Simeon} was the son of R. Simeon ben Johay.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>BM</i> 85a; also <i>PRK</i> 11:22.</i> R. Jose ben Halafta saw him. He said to him: You stem from a root of righteous people, but you are not a Torah scholar. He said to him: Then what should I do? He said to him: Do you want to learn? He said: Yes. He began teaching him one chapter, then a second, then a third. They brought him to the academy. Rabbi (Judah the Prince) saw him. He said to him: Have you brought this one with you? He said to him: He comes from the trunk of R. Simeon ben Johay. R. Jose brought him up to Sepphoris and instructed him. The next year he brought him down with him and entered the academy. When he began to give answers there, our holy master (Rabbi Judah the Prince) applied &lt; Prov. 11:30 &gt; to him: <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a line of righteous people.</i> Who caused him to become a Torah scholar? Was it not through R. Jose ben Halafta? Similarly in the case of the children who nursed from our mother Sarah, all of them became proselytes. The Holy One said: In this world individuals have become proselytes through the righteous ones, but in the world to come I will draw near the righteous and bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence. Thus it is stated (in Zeph. 3:9): <small>FOR THEN WILL I MAKE THE PEOPLES PURE OF SPEECH, SO THAT THEY ALL MAY INVOKE THE LORD BY NAME AND SERVE HIM WITH ONE ACCORD</small>.

Siman 39

(Gen. 22:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, &lt; THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 126:6): <small>THOUGH HE GOES AWAY WEEPING, BEARING HIS SEED BAG, HE SHALL SURELY COME BACK BEARING HIS SHEAVES WITH REJOICING. THOUGH HE GOES AWAY</small>: This refers to Abraham in the hour that the Holy One tested him and said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &lt; YOUR SON … AND OFFER HIM … AS A BURNT OFFERING &gt;</small>. Even though he was weeping in his heart, he told him with his mouth (in vs. 1): <small>HERE I AM</small>. When? When <small>BEARING HIS SEED BAG</small>. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>. (Ps. 126:6:) <small>HE SHALL COME BACK WITH REJOICING, BEARING HIS SHEAVES</small>. (Cf. Gen. 22:19:) <small>SO ABRAHAM RETURNED UNTO HIS YOUNG MEN</small>. What caused him to receive a reward? &lt; It was &gt; because he kept silent and made himself like a one who is dumb, as stated (in Ps. 38:14 [13]): <small>LIKE ONE WHO IS DEAF I DO NOT HEAR, [AND LIKE ONE WHO IS DUMB (<i>'LM</i>) HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH]</small>. Then he had an excuse for saying to him: Yesterday you said to me (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>; but now you are telling me to slaughter him. Still, he did not say anything but kept silent. Ergo (in Ps. 126:6): <small>HE SHALL COME BACK WITH REJOICING, BEARING HIS SHEAVES (rt.: '<i>LM</i>)</small>.

Siman 40

Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, &lt; THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT, NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>. R. Aha said: <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT</small>, the one which I made with Abraham when I said to him (according to Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>. (Ps. 89:35 [34]:) <small>NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>, because I have said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &lt; YOUR SON &gt;</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who said to his friend: I yearn to see a small child on my table. Immediately his friend went, brought his son, and set him on the table before the king. Then he went and brought his sword to slaughter him. Immediately, however, the king cried out and said to him: What are you doing? He said to him: But did you not say to me: I yearn to see a small child on my table. He said to him: I told you a living child. &lt; Would &gt; I have possibly &lt; meant &gt; a dead one? Similarly the Holy One said to Abraham: <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>. Immediately (in Gen. 22:9f.): <small>AND ABRAHAM BUILT AN ALTAR THERE … THEN ABRAHAM STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND &lt; AND TOOK THE KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER HIS SON &gt;</small>. The angel cried to him (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>. Abraham said to him: Did you not say to me (in vs. 2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>? He said to him: Would I have told you<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Buber reads “him” here.</i> to slaughter him? Ergo (in Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT, NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>.
Thus have our masters taught: (According to Jer. 19:5:) <small>&lt; AND THEY HAVE BUILT HIGH PLACES TO BAAL FOR BURNING THEIR SONS IN THE FIRE, BURNT OFFERINGS TO BAAL &gt;, WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED, NEVER SPOKE FOR, AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small>. I did not command Jephthah (in Jud. 11) to sacrifice his daughter, and I did not tell the king of Moab (in II Kings 3:27) to sacrifice his son. Moreover, it <small>NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small> to tell Abraham to slaughter his son. On what did they base a command concerning Jephthah? R. Mayasha said: <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Jephthah. Now I did give him many &lt; other &gt; positive commandments and negative commandments because he was of Israel, but I did not command him to sacrifice his daughter. Nor did I speak to the king of Moab. Our masters have said: On what did they base an oracle to the king of Moab? It is simply that the Holy One said: Would I ever have spoken with him? Would it not have been a disgrace? Rather I did not speak with him at any time &lt; about anything &gt;, much less that he sacrifice his son! So it <small>NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small> to tell Abraham to slaughter his son. Even though I said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &lt; YOUR SON &gt;</small>, it never entered my mind that he would slaughter his son. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, [THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM]</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 17:3): <small>A CRUCIBLE IS FOR SILVER AND A FURNACE FOR GOLD, BUT THE LORD TESTS HEARTS</small>. (Gen. 22:2:) <small>AND HE SAID: PLEASE TAKE &lt; YOUR SON &gt;</small>. Immediately (in vs. 3): <small>SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>. He went and built the altar. Then he put Isaac up on top of the altar, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>&lt; AND ABRAHAM BUILT AN ALTAR THERE &gt; … THEN HE BOUND HIS SON ISAAC [AND SET HIM ON THE ALTAR ABOVE THE WOOD]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ABOVE</small>? &lt; This &gt; teaches that he made the altar exactly under the throne of glory, just as one says (in Is. 6:2): <small>ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM</small>. <sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition Isaac was bound on the site where the Temple would be built.</i>

Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. What reflection took place there?<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 4:18; Gen. R. 55:4; cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 89b. There seems to be a play on words here between ‘<i>HR</i> (“after”) and <i>HRHR</i> (“reflection”). Thus the midrash here understands Gen. 22:1 to begin, “Now it came to pass that he reflected over these things.” See also Gen. R. 44:5.</i> Isaac was reflecting on when he had contended with Ishmael. [Now Ishmael had complained] and said: I am older than you. I shall inherit the world because I am my father's first-born, and the first-born always inherits twofold (according to Deut. 21:15-17). Isaac said to him: Tell me, what does the Holy One have of yours? Ishmael said to him: I will tell you what I have done, if I have done nothing else. Because I was thirteen years old when Daddy circumcised me, I could have said: It is not my wish to be circumcised; but I gave my life &lt; blood &gt; and took &lt; circumcision &gt; upon myself. Isaac said to him: See, all that you loaned<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The Buber text omits a letter and reads, “borrowed.”</i> to the Holy One were three drops of blood. But I know that when the Holy One wants me to be slaughtered, now when I am thirty-seven years old,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">See below, 46; Gen. R. 56:8; <i>PRE</i> 31; <i>TDER</i> 25 (27); <i>TDEZ</i> 2; <i>Seder</i> ‘<i>Olam</i> I.</i> and the Holy One is telling daddy to sacrifice me, I will not prevent &lt; him &gt;. The Holy One said to the angels: Now is the hour. He immediately rushed to Abraham. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER ('<i>HR</i>) THESE THINGS</small>. Hence you learn that there were reflections (<i>HRHR</i>) over things there.

(Gen. 22:1, cont.:) <small>THAT GOD TESTED (rt.: <i>NSH</i>) ABRAHAM</small>.

It also says this (in Deut. 8:16): <small>IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOU [AND IN ORDER] TO TEST YOU</small>…. Those who came later, however, were tested at the hands of the nations, as stated (in Jud. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NATIONS WHICH THE LORD LEFT TO TEST ISRAEL</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:6 [4]): <small>YOU HAVE GIVEN THOSE WHO FEAR YOU A TRIAL (<i>NS</i>) IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FLEE (rt.: <i>NWS</i>) ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH</small>? &lt; The words refer to &gt; whoever has been tested (rt.: <i>NSH</i>) and withstood trials (rt.: <i>NSH</i>).

It is so stated (in Ezek. 4:13): <small>SO SHALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL EAT THEIR UNCLEAN BREAD AMONG THE GENTILES WHERE I SHALL BANISH THEM</small>. Nebuchadnezzar arose and fulfilled the oracle. He began by saying: I decree that they eat of my food. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 1:5): <small>AND THE KING APPOINTED FOR THEM &lt; A DAILY PORTION OF THE KING'S FOOD &gt;</small>…. Daniel did not accept it. Instead he said: Although the Holy One has decreed for us to eat unclean bread, he wants to test us. We, however, will do our part; and the Holy One will do his. He began to say [to the captain of the guards (in Dan. 1:12f.): If you please], <small>PRAY, TEST (<i>NS</i>) YOUR SERVANTS FOR TEN DAYS, [AND GIVE US SOME LEGUMES TO EAT AND WATER TO DRINK. THEN LET OUR APPEARANCE AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHILDREN WHO EAT THE KING'S FOOD BE LOOKED AT IN YOUR PRESENCE, AND DEAL WITH YOUR SERVANTS ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SEE]</small>. He said to them: But are you able to stand the test (rt.: <i>NSH</i>) for ten days without eating bread or drinking wine? They said to him: Yes, because we are of the children of that person who withstood the test of ten trials from God. His merit will stand by us. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 1:12): <small>PRAY, TEST (<i>NS</i>) YOUR SERVANTS</small>. Has not the king already found us ten times better than the magicians? By whose merit?

(Gen. 22:2, cont.:) <small>GO UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH</small>. R. Jannay and R. Hiyya differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>yBer</i>. 4:5 (8c); <i>Ta‘an</i>. 16a.</i> R. Jannay says: What is Moriah?

Another interpretation of Moriah: [R. Joshua ben Levi said:] The place from which the righteous give instructions (<i>moreh</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The relevance of the following text rests upon the double meaning of <i>moreh</i>, which can also mean “cast,” as in the casting of lots.</i> to the Holy One, and he acts &lt; upon them &gt;. It is so stated (in I Chron. 24:5): <small>AND BY LOTS {HE} [THEY] ORGANIZED [THEM], &lt; ONE GROUP WITH ANOTHER &gt;</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: What is the meaning of Moriah? The place where the Holy One gives instructions (<i>moreh</i>) for the wicked and casts them down to Gehinnom, as stated (in Ps. 49:15 [14]): <small>LIKE SHEEP THEY ARE APPOINTED FOR SHEOL; [DEATH IS THEIR SHEPHERD, THE UPRIGHT SHALL RULE OVER THEM IN THE MORNING, AND THEIR FORM SHALL WASTE AWAY WITH NO LOFTY DWELLING FOR IT]</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay says: What is the meaning of Moriah? A place of teaching (<i>moreh</i>) situated (<i>MKWN</i>) directly under the Holy Temple above, as stated (in Exod. 15:17): <small>[O LORD, YOU HAVE MADE] A SITE (<i>MKWN</i>) FOR YOURSELF TO DWELL IN, [A SANCTUARY, O LORD, WHICH YOUR HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED]</small>. R. Judah ben Palma says: What is the meaning of Moriah (<i>Moriyyah</i>)? Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, to what place shall we go? The Holy One said to him: To the place that I <i>qoshet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The word can mean either “adorn” or “shoot forth.”</i> for you. Now this word (<i>qoshet</i>) is nothing but an expression for <i>qishshut</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Again there is a double meaning, either an “adornment” or a “shooting forth.”</i> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:13): <small>NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM, &lt; BUT HE SHALL SURELY BE STONED &gt; OR SHOT (<i>YRH</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">These letters could be understood as the root for <i>Moriyyah</i>. The argument is that the root for Moriah is used here in a sense that parallels one meaning of <i>qoshet</i>, which commonly means “adorn.” Thus Moriah, the Temple Mount, is a place of adornment.</i> R. Pinhas ben Hama the Priest says: What is the meaning of Moriah? The place of authority (<i>maruteh</i>) for the world. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: Where is it shown?

He said to him: Who are you? He said to him: An angel. He said to him: The Holy One told me (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE</small>…. Now you are saying (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT STRETCH OUT &lt; YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD &gt;</small>. At that time (in vs. 11): <small>BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED</small>. And Why did he call to him? To talk to him. And What did he say to him? He said to him (in vs. 11): <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM!</small> And why two times? It is simply like a person who is walking on a remote road with his companion and leaves him behind. Then he calls to him: My companion, my companion! So the angel called: <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM</small>, what are you doing? And why did he talk to him hurriedly? Because Abraham was in a hurry to slaughter him. At that time Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, one tests his companion when he does not know what is in his companion's heart. &lt; But &gt; you, since you search out hearts and kidneys, did you have to do this to me? Was it not revealed to you, when you told me to sacrifice my son, that I would wholeheartedly hasten to slaughter him?<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yTa‘an</i>. 2:3 (65d).</i> The Holy One said to him: &lt; I did so &gt; in order to make known to the peoples of the world that I did not choose you without a reason. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT &lt; YOU &gt; FEAR&lt; GOD &gt;</small>….
Another interpretation (of 22:11): <small>BUT &lt; THE ANGEL OF THE LORD &gt; CALLED UNTO HIM</small>. Abraham said to him: Who are you? He said to him: I am an angel. Abraham said to him: When the Holy One told me to sacrifice him, he told me so himself. So now I ask that he himself tell me &lt; to stop &gt;. Immediately the Holy One, having opened the firmament and the lower sky, said to him (in Gen. 22:16): <small>I BY MYSELF HAVE SWORN</small>. Abraham said to him: So now you have sworn! But I also have sworn that I am not coming down from this altar until I say everything that I must. He said to him: Say everything that you must. Abraham said to him: Did you not tell me that what you would raise up from me would completely fill up the world, as stated (in Gen. 15:5): <small>AND COUNT THE STARS … SO SHALL YOUR SEED BE</small>? The Holy One said to him: Yes. He said to him: From whom? He said to him: From Isaac. He said to him: And did you not tell me that you would multiply my children like the dust, as stated (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>? The Holy One said to him: Yes. He said to him: From whom? He said to him: From Isaac. He said to him: Just as I had the right to talk back to you and did not say anything to you, O Sovereign of the World—Yesterday you said (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>; but now you are saying (in Gen. 22:2): <small>AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING</small>. Yet I suppressed my urge and did not talk back to you. &lt; Just as I have acted in this way &gt;, you also, when Isaac's children sin against you and enter into sorrow, remember on their behalf the binding of their father Isaac. Forgive them, and redeem them from their sorrows. The Holy One said to them: You have had your say; I will also have mine. The Holy One said to him: Your children are going to be sinful in my presence, &lt; and I am going &gt; to judge them on New Year's day. However, if they ask me to forgive them and blow a <i>shofar</i> before me on that day—Abraham said to him: And what is a <i>shofar</i>? The Holy One said to him: Do you not know? He said to him: Turn around and look. Immediately (as we read in Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES [TO LOOK AND THERE WAS A RAM BEHIND HIM CAUGHT IN A THICKET ON HIS HORNS]</small>. It says here nothing but <small>ON HIS HORNS</small>. He said to him: They will blow on a horn before me, and I will forgive their sins. In that hour he gave praise and thanksgiving to the Holy One; and that is how David gave praise<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> (in II Sam. 22:3 // Ps. 18:3 [2]): <small>&lt; THE LORD … MY SHIELD &gt; AND MY HORN OF SALVATION</small>. And it says also (in Joel 2:15): <small>BLOW A <i>SHOFAR</i> IN ZION</small>. The beginning (of the verse) concerns New Year's day. Then afterwards (ibid., cont.): <small>SANCTIFY A FAST</small>. This refers to the Day of Atonement, &lt; which comes &gt; after ten days, on which the Holy One forgives their sins. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU</small>…. Blessed are you, O Israel! How the Holy One has loved you! &lt; He has done for you &gt; what he has not done for any people or tongue, as stated (in Ps. 111:6): <small>HE HAS DECLARED THE POWER OF HIS WORKS TO HIS PEOPLE &lt; IN GIVING THEM THE HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS &gt;</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL</small>.

From when the world was created until Abraham arose, the Holy One would bless his world. So, when he had created Adam and Eve, he blessed them, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM</small>….

Ergo (in Ps. 5:13 [12]): <small>FOR YOU BLESS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE</small> (i.e., Abraham), <small>O LORD, ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR AS WITH A BUCKLER</small>, in that the Holy One became like a shield for him, as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>I AM YOUR SHIELD</small>. Now a buckler is nothing but a shield, as shown in the verse (I Sam. 17:7): <small>AND THE ONE BEARING THE BUCKLER WAS GOING BEFORE HIM</small> (i.e., Goliath). What is the meaning of <small>ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR?</small> That he blessed Abraham in his old age, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.

[(Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>.

What is the meaning of <small>AND HE PLANTED?</small> &lt; It is &gt; as you say (in Gen. 9:20): <small>AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD</small>. (Prov. 31:17:) <small>SHE GIRDED HER LOINS WITH VIGOR</small>, when Abraham said to her (in Gen. 18:6): <small>HURRY UP WITH THREE SEAHS OF FINE MEAL</small>…. (Prov. 31:18:) <small>SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER MERCHANDISE WAS GOOD; AND</small> (in Gen. 21:7) <small>SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN?</small> (Prov. 31:18, cont.:) <small>HER LAMP WOULD NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT</small>. When? (In Gen. 14:15:) <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse assumes that Sarah was waiting up for Abraham to return from battle.</i> (Prov. 31:21:) <small>SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW</small>. When? When the Holy One showed him Gehinnom (with its snow), she foretold that none of her children would go down into its midst. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:17): <small>THERE APPEARED A SMOKING OVEN AND A FLAMING TORCH</small>. Why? Because they fulfilled two commandments, (as shown in Prov. 31:21, cont.): <small>BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED TWOFOLD</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The traditional text vocalizes <small>TWOFOLD</small> to mean <small>CRIMSON</small>.</i> i.e., with the Sabbath and with circumcision. (Prov. 31:22:) <small>SHE MADE COVERINGS FOR HERSELF</small>. When? When they said to him (in Gen. 18:9): <small>WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH</small>? He said to her: You have received good news that you are to bear &lt; children &gt;, and from them will go forth high priests who will serve in the Tent of Meeting. (Prov. 31:22, cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS LINEN AND PURPLE</small>, as stated (in Exod. 26:31): <small>&lt; AND YOU SHALL MAKE A VEIL OF &gt; {LINEN} [BLUE] AND PURPLE</small>…. (Prov. 31:23:) <small>HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES</small>. When Sarah died, old age sprang upon Abraham and he was called elderly. Now it is stated (in Gen. 23:6, after the report of Sarah's death): <small>HEAR US, MY LORD, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST</small>. Ergo, <small>HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES;</small> &lt; and the verse continues &gt; immediately: <small>AS HE SAT AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND</small>. He had become old; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.

Siman 4

[(Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.] Come and see: From Adam even to Abraham there are twenty generation, but there is no &lt; mention of &gt; old age written about &lt; any of &gt; them except about him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BM</i> 87a; <i>Sanh</i>. 107b; Gen. R. 59:6; 65:9; below, 6:7; <i>PRE</i> 52.</i> They sired children and grandchildren, but one did not recognize which was the son and which was the father. Also the children were striking the fathers without knowing it, as stated (in Ps. 78:33): <small>SO HE ENDED THEIR DAYS IN FUTILITY AND THEIR YEARS IN TERROR</small>, because they were all alike until Abraham came along. Then the Holy One gave him this &lt; gray &gt; crown which is an ornament for when one becomes old. And when did it come over him? When he practiced righteousness, since it is stated (in Prov. 16:31): <small>GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY</small>. And how do you find it? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IT IS FOUND BY WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. To whom does this &lt; verse &gt; refer? To Abraham, concerning whom it is written (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;</small>…. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you are worthy of an old age. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Now David also received this crown, as stated (in I Kings 1:1): <small>NOW KING DAVID WAS OLD</small>. Why? Because he had acted according to Abraham's standard, as stated (in II Sam. 8:15): <small>AND DAVID PRACTICED JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TOWARD ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 16:31): <small>GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Three people loudly demanded three things, and from them they had their beginning. <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 65:9; 97:1 (Vatican MS); <i>BM</i> 87a; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 5:1; <i>PRE</i> 52. See also above, 2:20.</i> Abraham demanded old age. Abraham said: When a father and his son enter into a city, no one knows which is the older and which is the younger. The Holy One said: You have loudly demanded old age. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Isaac demanded afflictions. Isaac said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, when someone sins, you exact retribution from him all at once. Afflict him little by little, and you are exacting retribution from him. If you had brought afflictions upon the generation of the flood, they would not have rebelled against you. You, however, bestowed prosperity upon them. They therefore rebelled against you. Thus it is stated (in Job 12:6): <small>THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have loudly demanded afflictions. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ISAAC WAS OLD, [AND HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE]</small>. Jacob demanded illness. Jacob said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the World, one dwells in contentment. Then his life departs, and strife comes into the world. For that reason it is required for one to be in the hands of others; or, in the case of others, it is required for them to be in his hand. Now he dies suddenly and strife comes about in the world. Rather let [one] become [ill] for five or six days until he has ordained for his children everything that is necessary. Then let him depart from the world. The Holy One said to him: Jacob, you have demanded illness. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 48:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS</small> {<small>THAT IT WAS TOLD</small>} <small>[THAT ONE SAID] TO JOSEPH: BEHOLD, YOUR FATHER IS ILL</small>. Ergo: The three patriarchs established these three things. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.

Siman 6

Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. In the beginning his name had been Abram; and now an <i>H</i> was added to it since he had inherited two worlds, for due to him this world and the world to come were created. R. Halafta bar Kahana said: It is written (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN THEIR BEING CREATED (<i>HBR'M</i>)</small>. These are the letters which (when rearranged) spell "Abraham."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Gen. 2:4 means that heaven and earth were created in Abraham.</i> Ergo: Due to him this world and the world to come were created. &lt; It was &gt; he to whom the Holy One said (in Gen. 12:2): <small>I WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT NATION</small>. Why did he not say to him: "I will establish you" instead of <small>I WILL MAKE YOU?</small> R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of his father, R. Hiyya, who spoke in the name of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel and his masters on behalf of our masters in the Diaspora: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am creating you as a new creation and renovating you. (Gen. 12:2:) <small>I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am making your name &lt; correspond &gt; to the number of the members within you. Just as &lt; there are &gt; two hundred and forth-eight members &lt; in the human body &gt;, so &lt; the letters of &gt; your name (when enlarged by an "H") &lt; shall add up to &gt; two hundred and forth-eight. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME, AND YOU SHALL BE A BLESSING</small>. When did he show him the blessing? In his old age, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD … &lt; AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING &gt;</small>.
(Gen. 24:1, cont.:) <small>COMING IN THE DAYS (<i>YMYM</i>)</small> (i.e., <small>GETTING ON IN YEARS</small>). What is the meaning of <small>COMING IN THE <i>YMYM</i></small>? R. Johanan said: &lt; Coming &gt; within the veil<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Wilon</i>, Lat.: <i>velum</i>, is the talmudic name for the first heaven and therefore represents the veil between this world and the world to come. This interpretation is suggested by the fact that <i>YMYM</i> can mean “seas” in an unvocalized text. Thus Gen. 24:1 is saying that Abraham was coming into the waters that separate heaven and earth.</i> of this world. R. Eleazar said: Of this world and the world to come. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>COMING INTO THE <i>YMYM</i></small>. He said to him (in Gen. 15:18): <small>TO YOUR OFFSPRING I HAVE GIVEN THIS LAND</small>…. &lt; I.e., &gt; he showed him what would happen in this world and what would happen in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that Abraham came to the veil of heaven would imply that he learned of the future. What R. Johanan and R. Eleazar dispute is whether that future extended into the world to come. See Gen. R. 44:22.</i> It is therefore written (in Gen. 24:1): <small>COMING INTO THE <i>YMYM</i></small>.
(Gen. 24:1, cont.:) <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN EVERYTHING (<i>BKL</i>)</small>? While he was between the &lt; sacrificial pieces (in Gen. 15), he brought him the good news that he would give him a son fifty-two years later.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The letters in <i>BKL</i> total 52.</i> How so?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. 21:5, Abraham was one hundred when Isaac was born.</i> R.

Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>.
Another interpretation: What is the meaning of <small>IN EVERYTHING</small>? By virtue of the tithes. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:20): <small>AND HE GAVE HIM A TITHE FROM EVERYTHING</small>. Isaac also [was blessed] by virtue of the tithes. [Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND AND REAPED IN THAT YEAR A HUNDREDFOLD, FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM</small>. He also says (in Gen. 27:33): <small>AND I HAVE EATEN OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU CAME AND HAVE BLESSED HIM</small>. Jacob also was blessed by virtue of the tithes.] Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:22): <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>.

(Gen. 25:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR</small>. What is the meaning of <small>YOUR CREATOR</small>? This is the Holy One. Aqavya ben Mahalal'el says: Look at three things [and you will not come to the point of transgression, etc.:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 3:1; Lev. R. 18:1; Eccl. R. 12:1:1. See also <i>ySot</i>. 2:2 (18a), which does not list the three things.</i> Where have you come from? From a fetid (seminal) drop. Where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots. Before whom are you going to render account and reckoning? Before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He.] R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: And the three of them are in this verse: <small>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR (<i>BWR'K</i>, rt.: <i>BR</i>'</small>). This is the Holy One. <small>YOUR</small> {<small>WELLS</small>} <small>[WELL] (rt.: <i>B'R</i></small>). This is a well that comes forth out of fetid (seminal) fluid. {<small>YOUR CREATOR</small>} <small>[YOUR PIT (BWRK)]</small> &lt; corresponds &gt; to the place where you are going to render account and reckoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For a more logical proof text, see Lev. R. 18:1; Eccl. R. 12:1:1.</i> Ergo (in Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER</small> &lt; all the above &gt;.
[(Eccl. 12:1, cont.:) <small>IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.] Do not wait until you have grown old, [but] (ibid., cont.): <small>BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS COME</small>. R. Isaac said: These are the days of old age,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shab</i>. 151a.</i> when one intends to do something and is not able. And why are the days evil? R. Simeon ben Johay &lt; answered in &gt; a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To an individual who dwelt by the road and robbed those who passed to and fro. The king told him to repent, but he did not repent. When he grew old he said: I will make peace with the king. They said to him: The king is not grateful to you. Why? Because you did not repent willingly. Ergo (in Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER &lt; YOUR CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS COME &gt;</small>.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE YEARS DRAW NEAR [WHEN YOU WILL SAY: I HAVE NO DELIGHT IN THEM]</small>. These are the afflictions (of old age).
(Eccl. 12:2:) <small>BEFORE [THE SUN, THE LIGHT], &lt; THE MOON AND THE STARS &gt; ARE DARKENED. [THE SUN]</small> represents the facial appearance,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>prosopon</i>.</i> <small>THE LIGHT</small> represents the eyes, <small>THE MOON</small> represents the cheeks, and <small>THE STARS</small> represent the teeth.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE CLOUDS RETURN AFTER THE RAIN</small>. When the rain comes, the clouds come; not (as one would expect), when the clouds come, the rain comes. It is simply that after one's eyes water, one's eyelids descend over them. Ergo: <small>AND THE CLOUDS RETURN &lt; AFTER THE RAIN &gt;</small>.
(Eccl. 12:3:) <small>IN THE DAY THAT THE GUARDS OF THE HOUSE TREMBLE</small>. These are &lt; the old &gt; one's knees. R. Hiyya ben Nehemiah says: These are &lt; the old &gt; one's bones.
(Ibid.,cont.:) <small>AND VALIANT ONES ARE BOWED</small>. These are &lt; the old &gt; one's arms.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE GRINDERS CEASE &lt; BECAUSE THEY ARE FEW &gt;</small>. These are &lt; the old &gt; one's teeth.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING &lt; THROUGH THE WINDOWS &gt; BECOME DIM</small>. These are the eyes. (Eccl. 12:4:) <small>AND THE DOORS TO THE STREET ARE CLOSED</small>. These are the feet. Why? When one has become old, he does not stretch his legs in the street. Thus his feet are disappearing from the street. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN THE SOUND OF THE MILL IS LOW</small>, because one tarries over the food. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ONE ARISES AT THE SOUND OF THE BIRD</small>. R. Levi b. R. Shallum said: Even though &lt; an old &gt; one hears the sound of a bird chirping, he is thinking that perhaps there are robbers.
Another interpretation: <small>AND ONE ARISES AT THE SOUND OF THE BIRD</small>. Just as the offspring of a bird lean toward their father when he comes to put &lt; food &gt; in their mouths, so one &lt; who is old &gt; waits for somebody to come and put &lt; food &gt; into his mouth. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF SONG ARE BROUGHT LOW</small>. These are the lips. Thus all the days that one is a youth his voice issues forth; but when he becomes old, they (the lips) become flabby, and his voice does not travel.
(Eccl. 12:5:) <small>ONE ALSO IS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS</small>. They say to him: Do you wish to come and visit this sick person? He says to them: Is there a ladder there to go up? There is a steep place there. &lt; An old person talks so &gt; because he is afraid of heights.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:5): <small>ONE ALSO [IS AFRAID] OF HEIGHTS [AND TERRORS IN THE WAY]</small>. They say to him: Come and let us go to the synagogue, but he breaks up the journey and makes it little by little.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE ALMOND TREE BLOSSOMS</small>. This is the nut (coccyx) which is at its end of the spine.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE GRASSHOPPER DRAGS ITSELF ALONG</small>. These &lt; the old &gt; are one's feet when they are swollen. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE CAPER BUSH FAILS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The caperberry was considered to be an aphrodisiac.</i> Even sexual desire ceases. All these things happen to the one who is old. But in the case of Abraham, although it is written of him (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>, his sexual desire had not ceased. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 11:6): <small>SOW YOUR SEED IN THE MORNING, &lt; AND DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR HAND IN THE EVENING &gt;</small>, because you do not know which of them {will protect you} [will be made to succeed for you].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 5:6; Gen.

R. Joshua says: If a religious obligation presents itself to you in the morning, <small>SOW YOUR SEED</small>. Do not say no. And if [a religious obligation] presents itself to you in the evening, <small>DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR HAND IN THE EVENING, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH</small> of them will endure for you, whether that of the morning, that of the evening, (ibid., cont.): <small>OR WHETHER THEY BOTH [ARE EQUALLY GOOD]</small>.

If you have raised up disciples in your youth, do not become idle in raising others up in your old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yev</i>. 62b.</i> &lt; There is &gt; a story about R. Aqiva, who had three hundred disciples in his youth, and all of them died. If he had not raised &lt; others &gt; up in his old age, he would not have had a single disciple. But he had applied &lt; Eccl. 11:6 &gt; to himself: <small>SOW YOUR SEED IN THE MORNING</small> &lt; … &gt;.
Another interpretation: R. Dostay<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>dositheos</i>.</i> said: If you take a wife who bears &lt; a child &gt; and dies, do not be idle in your old age without a wife. Why? (Eccl. 11:6:) <small>BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH WILL SUCCEED</small>. From whom do you learn &lt; this fact &gt;? From Abraham, who in his youth only sired one &lt; child &gt; but in his old age sired twelve. R. Levi said: He is the one to whom the Holy One said: (in Gen. 12:3): <small>AND IN YOU ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. Thus God arose in the generation of the dispersion and dispersed them into thirty families, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>…. R. Levi said: The Holy One said: I am producing them out of you. He is the one to whom the Holy One had said: <small>AND IN YOU &lt; ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH &gt; SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. So from him he produced thirty families; and they are the following: twelve princes which he produced from Ishmael (Gen. 25:13-16), the sixteen descendants of Keturah (Gen. 25:1-4), and (according to Gen. 25:23) <small>TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR</small> (Rebekah's) <small>WOMB</small>, for a total of thirty families. Ergo (in Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>.

Hagar and Keturah are the same person &lt; according to &gt; the words of Rabbi, but our masters say he took another wife. What is the logic of Rabbi? Hagar and Keturah are the same person because it is written (in Gen. 24:62): <small>NOW ISAAC HAD COME BY WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI</small>. &lt; Here is a reference to &gt; the same woman about whom it is written (in Gen. 16:14): <small>THEREFORE THE WELL WAS CALLED BEER-LAHAI-ROI</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The context suggests that Beer-lahai-roi might have been where Hagar had settled.</i>

(Gen. 25:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK AN ADDITIONAL</small><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Again the translation of the verse has been changed to fit the midrashic context.</i> <small>WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING, YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of R. Eleazar: You learn from here that an addition of the Holy One is more than the original.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 7:20; see Gen. R. 61:4.</i> Abraham had previously sired no one but Isaac. When the Holy One made an addition for him, he made his addition &lt; even &gt; more, as stated (in Gen. 25:2): <small>AND SHE BORE HIM &lt; ZIMRAN, JOKSHAN, MEDAN, MIDIAN, ISHBAK, AND SHUAH &gt;</small>. Thus you find in the case of the first Adam that when &lt; Eve &gt; gave birth, she bore Cain (Gen. 4:1). Then afterwards (in Gen. 4:2): <small>AND IN ADDITION SHE BORE &lt; HIS BROTHER ABEL &gt;</small>. And so you find in the case of Rachel that she bore Joseph and said (in Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. He added Benjamin for her and his twin sister. Where is it shown to be so? Here (in Gen. 35:17), &lt; where &gt; "This is a son for you" is not written, but <small>FOR THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU</small>. And so you find in the case of King Hezekiah, all the days of his reign were fourteen years; but when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. (Is. 38:5; cf. II Kings 20:6:) <small>SEE, I AM ADDING [FIFTEEN YEARS] TO YOUR LIFE</small>. Now when the prophets saw that an addition of the Holy One was more than the original, they began to bless Israel with an addition. Moses said (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD [GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS] ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES [MORE THAN YOU ARE]</small>…. David said (in Ps. 115:14): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS</small>. Also in the world to come the Holy One has procured an addition (rt.: <i>YSP</i>) for his people, as stated (in Is. 11:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: <i>YSP</i>) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME &lt; TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE &gt;</small>.

(Gen. 25:19:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISAAC BEN ABRAHAM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Except for most of the last section (# 24), <i>Toledot</i> is not found in Buber’s Oxford MS. Buber has filled in the gap mostly from <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34.</i> This text is related (to Prov. 17:6): <small>GRANDCHILDREN ARE A CROWN FOR ELDERS, AND THE GLORY OF CHILDREN IS THEIR PARENTS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 63:2; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 6:4.</i> Who caused Abraham to be magnified? Jacob, as stated (in Is. 29:22): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH REDEEMED ABRAHAM</small>. Why? Because, if one is meritorious as a Torah scholar together with his son and his grandson, it will never again be cut off from him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:9f.): <small>AND MAKE THEM (the statutes and ordinances) KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD &lt; BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB &gt;</small>. Just as the gift of &lt; the &gt; Torah did not become cease on the day it was given; so for one who teaches his son and his grandson Torah, it shall never again depart from him. And so it was when the Holy One saw Abraham was busy with the Torah. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY LAWS &gt;</small>. It is also written (above, in 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE KNOWN HIM</small>. Then Jacob arose up and did not move from the Torah, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small> (i.e., in the academies).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For this interpretation, see Gen. R. 63:10; Targum Onqelos, Gen. 25:27; <i>PRK</i> 5:7.</i> What stipulation did the Holy One make with them? (According to Josh. 1:8:) <small>&lt; THIS &gt; BOOK OF THE LAW SHALL NOT DEPART &lt; FROM YOUR MOUTH &gt;</small>…. It is also written (in Prov. 10:1): <small>A WISE SON SHALL MAKE A FATHER GLAD</small>. This is Isaac, since it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED</small>. (Prov. 10:1, cont.:) <small>BUT A FOOLISH SON</small>. This is Ishmael. Thus it is written (in Gen. 25:12): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL BEN ABRAHAM</small>. There are children who suffer disgrace through their parents. Josiah suffered disgrace through his father, as stated (in II Chron. 33:23): <small>FOR AMON INCURRED A LOT OF GUILT</small>. Hezekiah suffered disgrace through &lt; his father &gt; Ahaz, as stated (in Is. 8:16): <small>BIND UP THE TESTIMONY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. R. 42:3; Lev. R. 11:7; Ruth R., proem 7; and Esther R., proem 11, this verse alludes to Ahaz, who had seized (<i>ahaz</i>) the synagogues and the academies.</i> There are also parents who suffer disgrace through their children. Eli suffered disgrace through his sons, [as stated (in I Sam. 2:12): <small>NOW ELI'S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS</small>. And Samuel also suffered disgrace through his sons], as stated (in I Sam. 8:3): <small>BUT HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS</small>. It did not, however, turn out in this way for Abraham. Instead he was magnified through Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:19, cont.): <small>ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC</small>. Did he sire no one but Isaac? Now look, it is written {(in Gen. 25:19): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL</small>.} [(in Gen. 16:15): <small>SO HAGAR BORE A SON TO ABRAM</small>.] And in addition &lt; there are &gt; the sons of Keturah: Zimran and Jokshan, &lt; etc. &gt; (cf. Gen. 25:2). But it does not say that Abraham sired anyone but Isaac, simply because Isaac was righteous. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:19): <small>ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC</small>.
{(Gen. 26:1:) <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE</small>. This verse is related (to Prov. 18:3): <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING</small>. Who was this &lt; wicked &gt; one? This was Esau the Wicked, who came upon his feet to Abbadon (i.e., to hell, the place of damnation). What is written?} <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As these braces indicate, Buber believed the whole paragraph to be superfluous.</i>

Siman 2

(Gen. 25:27:) <small>WHEN THE BOYS GREW UP, ESAU BECAME A CUNNING HUNTER, &lt; A MAN OF THE FIELD; BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS &gt;</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: R. Levi said:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 63:10.</i> Both of them went to the elementary school, and both of them were equal until the age of fifteen. To what were they comparable? To a myrtle and a thorny plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><small><i>‘TsMWNYT</i></small>. Gen. R. 63:10 reads <small><i>‘TsBWNYT</i></small> (“wild rose bush”) here.</i> As long as they are small, no one &lt; can &gt; distinguish one from the other. After they have grown up, the one awakens (in bloom), <small>AND</small> (in the words of Gen. 1:12) <small>IT WAS GOOD</small>; but the other brings forth its thorns. Thus, so long as Esau and Jacob were small no one distinguished between them. After they were grown up, they were distinguishable. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>WHEN THE BOYS GREW UP…. JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small> (of learning).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 6:1.</i> &lt; But what about Esau? (According to ibid.:) <small>ESAU BECAME &gt; A CUNNING HUNTER, &lt; A MAN OF THE FIELD (<i>SDH</i>) &gt;</small>. R. Abbahu said: What is the meaning of <small>CUNNING HUNTER</small>? That his hunting was by entrapment (<i>SWDN</i>').<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In accordance with a suggestion from <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (Jerusalem: Eshkol, n.d.), vol. I, appendix, p. 38, n. 1, the text here is slightly emended from <i>SWRN’</i>. So emended the midrash is interpreting <small>FIELD (<i>SDH</i>)</small> of the biblical text as “entrapment” (<i>SWDN‘</i>). For a similar interpretation, see Gen. R. 63:10. See Buber’s note, ad loc.</i> He hunted at home [and he hunted] in the field. <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small>. The Holy One said to him: You are the first to sit in the tents (of learning). By your life, when I return to Jerusalem, I will return through your virtue. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 30:18): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: BEHOLD, I AM RESTORING JACOB'S TENTS FROM CAPTIVITY</small>. "Abraham's tents from captivity" is not stated &lt; here &gt;, but <small>JACOB'S TENTS FROM CAPTIVITY</small>.

Siman 3

(Gen. 25:29:) <small>NOW JACOB HAD BOILED &lt; A STEW &gt;</small>. Esau came in from the field and saw that Jacob's face was blackened. He said to him: What are you doing? He said to him: Do you not know that our grandfather Abraham is dead, and I am cooking food?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 63:11 ; <i>BB</i> 16b; (bar.); Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 25:27; <i>PRE</i> 35.</i> Now he was going to prepare the mourner's meal on his behalf. Esau said to him: My friend and my enemy, &lt; both &gt; alike have died. Abraham has died, and Nimrod has died. <small>SO (according to Gen. 25:32) WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small> What was he cooking? Lentils, because from ancient times they had brought lentils (on account of) [unto] the mourner and lentils to the house with a wedding. (Gen. 25:29:) <small>THEN ESAU CAME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 63:12; <i>PRK</i> 3:1; cf. <i>BB</i> 16b; <i>PR</i> 12:5.</i> They have said: This wicked man committed three transgressions on that day. He robbed, since it is written (of Edom in Obad. 5): <small>IF THIEVES HAVE COME TO YOU, PLUNDERERS (rt.: <i>ShDD</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash may also see an allusion here to Gen. 25:27: <small>A MAN OF THE FIELD (<i>SDH</i>).</small></i> OF THE NIGHT</small>. He also seduced a maiden who was betrothed, as stated (in Gen. 25:7): <small>&lt; EDOM BECAME A MAN &gt; OF THE FIELD</small>. A field is nothing but a maiden, since it is stated (in Deut. 22:25): <small>IF IN THE FIELD [THE MAN FINDS A MAIDEN] &lt; WHO IS BETROTHED, AND THE MAN SEIZES HER AND LIES WITH HER &gt;</small>…. And he took a life, since it is stated (in Gen. 25:29): <small>AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED. EXHAUSTED</small> can only &lt; imply &gt; "killing." Thus it is stated (in Jer. 4:31): <small>WOE UNTO ME, NOW! FOR MY LIFE IS EXHAUSTED BEFORE THOSE WHO KILL</small>.
The Holy One said: I made a stipulation with Abraham (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE; YOU SHALL BE BURIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE</small>. Now this was a good end; for when one who is righteous passes away, they say to him: Look at what your grandson is doing! David said (in Ps. 63:4 [3]): <small>FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE</small>. Therefore, Abraham passed away because of Esau. You know yourself that it is so. Isaac, who came from the fecundity of Abraham, lived to one hundred and eighty; but Abraham only lived to one hundred and seventy-five. The Holy One said: Lest he see Esau committing transgressions and voice a complaint over him, for that reason, let five years be deducted from the life of Abraham.

Siman 4

[(Gen. 25:30:) <small>PLEASE LET ME GULP DOWN SOME OF THIS RED RED STUFF</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>? R. Johanan said: From you and from those like you, &lt; i.e., &gt; from the righteous who are like you.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 63:12. The repetition of <small>RED</small> suggests that <small>ESAU</small> was not only making demands of Jacob, but that such demands would be repeated against the righteous in future generations.</i>
Another interpretation: <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>. "Give me" is not written here, but <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>. He said to him: <small>LET ME GULP DOWN &lt; SOME &gt;</small>. He gave him &lt; some &gt; in a saucer. He said: You are giving it to me in a saucer. Pour from the pot &lt; directly &gt; into my mouth. Now the word for "gulping down" (rt.: <i>L'T</i>) is nothing but the word for "pouring"; for so have our masters taught (in <i>Shab</i>. 24:3): <small>ONE DOES NOT STUFF THE CAMEL NOR CRAM IT BUT FEEDS IT FULLY (rt.: <i>L'T</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since this root never appeals in Sctipture apart from Gen. 25:30, its meaning is doubtful. The context in the Mishnah implies that the verb in question is something that one does to the camel. Thus “gulping down” must have been something that Jacob did to Esau. See Gen. R. 63:12; <i>PRK</i> 6:2.</i> He therefore said (in Gen. 25:30): <small>LET ME GULP DOWN (in the sense of POUR INTO ME</small>).
(Gen. 25:31:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID: SELL ME YOUR BIRTHRIGHT FOR TODAY</small>. He said to him: Are you requesting my birthright? Do you request my share in the world to come? He said to him: I do not know whether you have a share in the world to come, but sell me the birthright since it is public knowledge<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PRSM</i>; cf. Gk.: <i>parresia</i> (“boldness of speech”).</i> <small>FOR TODAY. SELL… FOR TODAY (<i>KYWM</i>):</small> R. Aha said: Whoever knows how to {reply} [calculate] properly, knows that Israel received &lt; the birthright &gt; in this world only for a thousand years, because a day (<i>YWM</i>) for the Holy One is a thousand years. It is so stated (in Ps. 90:4): <small>FOR A THOUSAND YEARS &lt; IN YOUR EYES ARE LIKE THE DAY (<i>KYWM</i>) WHICH IS YESTERDAY &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites knew only a millennium of true independence. See also Gen. R. 63:13.</i>
(Gen. 25:32:) <small>AND ESAU SAID: LOOK, I AM GOING TO DIE</small>. Abraham is dead; yet the Holy Spirit says (in Jer. 22:10): <small>DO NOT WEEP FOR ONE WHO IS DEAD</small> &lt; … &gt; <small>WEEP BITTERLY FOR ONE WHO IS GOING AWAY</small>. (Gen. 25:32, cont.:) <small>SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small> Now the Holy Spirit says (in Ps. 109:17): <small>SINCE HE LOVED A CURSE, IT HAS COME UPON HIM; SINCE HE DID NOT FIND PLEASURE IN BLESSING, IT IS FAR FROM HIM</small>. How did the first-born sacrifice? (<i>Zev</i>. 14:4:) <small>BEFORE THE TABERNACLE WAS ERECTED &lt; … &gt; THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE WAS &lt; PERFORMED &gt; BY THE FIRST-BORN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The complete sentence from the Mishnah is quoted in <i>Bekh</i>. 4b; below, 6:12; <i>PR</i> 5:9; Gen. R. 63:13; Numb. R. 4:8. See also <i>PRE</i> 8.</i> Moreover, everyone who offered sacrifice was worthy of being blessed, as stated (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>&lt; YOU SHALL MAKE ME &gt; AN ALTAR OF EARTH…. &lt; AND IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I HAVE MY NAME MENTIONED &gt; I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. Esau said: This man wants neither to sacrifice nor to be blessed. The prophet said to him (in Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD; SO BLOOD SHALL PURSUE YOU</small>. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hanina ben Hama: This is the blood of the sacrifices which he hated to sacrifice to the Holy One. But our masters say: This is the blood of circumcision, since he stretched his foreskin (to undo his circumcision). Thus it is stated (in Ps. 55:21 [20]): <small>HE HAS PUT FORTH HIS HAND AGAINST HIS WHOLENESS AND PROFANED HIS COVENANT</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD</small>. Now Esau hated blood. His father had blessed him through blood, and he had confidence in blood, as stated (in Gen. 27:40): <small>YET BY YOUR SWORD YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. Still it &lt; actually &gt; says to him (in Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD</small>! It is simply that he hated a person's life while it was placed in his body. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:32, end): <small>SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small>
(Gen. 25:34:) <small>SO ESAU DESPISED</small>. &lt; He was &gt; of the opinion that he was joking with Jacob, but the Holy One gave his concurrence from above.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 63:14.</i> It is so stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>.
(Gen. 25:34:) <small>SO ESAU DESPISED &lt; HIS BIRTHRIGHT &gt;</small>. (Prov. 18:3:) <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING</small>. This refers to Esau, about whom it is stated: <small>SO ESAU DESPISED</small>. (Prov. 18:3, cont.:) {<small>AND WHEN DISGRACE COMES</small>}, <small>[AND WITH DISGRACE, SHAME]</small>, since the famine came in his footsteps. Thus it is stated (immediately after the verse about Esau despising his birthright, in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.

Siman 5

[(Gen. 26:1:) <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 40:1.</i> It is speaking about Abraham, of whom it is read that he feared God. Thus it is stated (of Abraham in Gen. 22:12): <small>THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE</small>, since &lt; Abraham &gt; was waiting for the Holy One, for this reason: (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR LIFE FROM DEATH</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; from his execution by Nimrod. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, the one which came in his days, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &lt; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &gt;</small>. This &lt; refers to &gt; Jacob. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE</small>, since Jacob waited for the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Pss., 720, explains that Jacob’s patient waiting took place after he had been told that Joseph was dead.</i> (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; from his execution by Esau, who said (in Gen. 27:41): <small>LET THE DAYS OF [MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB]</small>. (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, the one which came in his days.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &lt; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &gt;</small>. This &lt; refers to &gt; the tribe of Levi, of whom it is stated (in Mal. 2:5): <small>AND I GAVE THEM</small> (i.e., life and peace) <small>TO HIM</small><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Buber’s reading, <small>TO ME</small>, is surely in error.</i> (i.e., Levi) <small>AS WELL AS FEAR, [AND HE FEARED ME]</small>. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT</small>, since they were always waiting for the Holy One. (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, when they enter &lt; the Sanctuary &gt; to offer sacrifice. (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, since he has given them a tithe, as stated (in Numb. 18:26): <small>NOW &lt; YOU SHALL SPEAK &gt; UNTO THE LEVITES &lt; AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE TITHES FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &lt; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &gt;</small>, because it says (in Cant. 8:14): <small>FLEE, MY BELOVED, AND BECOME LIKE A GAZELLE</small>. Just as this gazelle sleeps with one eye open and one closed, so also &lt; let it be with &gt; you: <small>AND BECOME LIKE A GAZELLE</small>. Therefore David has said (in Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD (like that of a gazelle) IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &lt; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &gt;</small>.] This is Isaac. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT</small>, since he was waiting for the Holy One. (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, when Ishmael sought to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 21:9): <small>THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN PLAYING</small>. Now <small>PLAYING</small> can only mean "killing." Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY BEFORE US</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The result of their “playing” was that they all killed each other. See below, Exod. 1:24.</i> (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, since the famine did come in his days, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.

Siman 6

(Gen. 26:1, cont.:) <small>AND ISAAC WENT TO ABIMELECH</small>…. He had wanted to go down to Egypt, &lt; but &gt; the Holy One immediately appeared to him. He said to him (in vs. 2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. Abraham went down &lt; there &gt;, but Isaac did not go down. Now why did he say, not to Abraham, but only to Isaac: <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>? R. Hosha'ya said: The Holy One said unto Isaac: Because your father came to the land from abroad, he went down to Egypt; but, since you were born in the land of Israel and &lt; represent &gt; a pure burnt offering, how could you be going down?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 64:3.</i> Ergo (in Gen. 26:2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.
(Gen. 26:3:) <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND</small>. R. Hanan said in the name of R. Samuel b. R. Isaac: Why &lt; was such a command necessary &gt;? He would not have wanted to become unclean outside the land. &lt; He wanted to leave &gt; because a decree had been issued, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE</small>. It therefore says (in vs. 3): <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: In this world the righteous have been rejected (rt.: <i>TRP</i>), as stated (in Ps. 111:5): <small>HE HAS GIVEN <i>teref</i> (rt.: <i>TRP</i>)</small><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In the context of Ps. 111:5, <i>teref</i> should be translated as <small>FOOD</small>, but here the context requires something with a negative meaning, such as <small>REJECTION</small>.</i> <small>TO THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>; but in the world to come, (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIS COVENANT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

Siman 7

Thus has R. Tanhuma interpreted (Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &lt; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &gt;</small>. You find that there are twenty generations from Adam to Abraham, and there is no &lt; mention of &gt; old age written about &lt; any of &gt; them except Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For parallel accounts, see above, 5:4.</i> Isaac arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD</small>. Jacob arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 48:10): <small>NOW ISRAEL'S EYES WERE DIM WITH AGE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 90:16): <small>LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN</small>. Now <small>GLORY</small> can only be old age and gray hair, as stated (in Prov. 20:29): <small>THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNG IS THEIR STRENGTH; BUT THE GLORY OF THE OLD IS GRAY HAIR</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 90:16): <small>AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN</small>. &lt; These words mean &gt; that Abraham endowed Isaac with five things. Thus have our masters taught (in <i>'Eduy</i>. 2:9): <small>A FATHER ENDOWS HIS SON WITH FIVE THINGS: WITH BEAUTY, WITH STRENGTH, WITH WEALTH, WITH WISDOM, AND WITH &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS</small>. How is it shown about <small>BEAUTY</small>? In that Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): <small>NOW JOSEPH WAS WELL BUILT</small>. Also, when he went to his brothers, they said (in Gen. 37:19): <small>HERE COMES THIS</small> (<i>hallazeh</i>) <small>DREAMER</small>. It is also said of Isaac (in Gen. 24:65): <small>WHO IS THIS</small> (<i>hallazeh</i>) <small>MAN &lt; WALKING IN THE FIELD TO MEET US &gt;</small>? Thus Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. How is it shown that Isaac was mighty in <small>STRENGTH</small>? Look at how many wells he dug! Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:18-22): <small>THEN ISAAC REDUG &lt; THE WELLS OF WATER &gt;…. AND ISAAC'S SERVANTS DUG…. AND THEY DUG ANOTHER WELL…. THEN HE MOVED FROM THERE AND DUG &lt; ANOTHER WELL &gt;</small>…. Look at the power which he had! Where is it shown about <small>WEALTH?</small> Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:13): <small>AND THE MAN GREW &lt; RICHER AND RICHER &gt;</small>…. It also says (in vs. 14): <small>AND HE POSSESSED FLOCKS &lt; AND HERDS &gt;</small>…. Where is it shown about <small>WISDOM?</small> Where he said to his father (in Gen. 22:7 at the time of his being bound): <small>HERE ARE THE FIRE AND THE WOOD</small>…. [How is it shown] about <small>&lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS</small>? In that he was one hundred and eighty years old &lt; when he died &gt;, while Abraham was &lt; only &gt; one hundred and seventy-five. On account of these five things {through which he had attained merit}, five years more than his father's were added to him. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 90:16): <small>LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS</small>…. Anyone who has merit is meritorious in these five things, and anyone who does not have merit is not meritorious and receives five retributions that correspond to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>yQid</i>. 1:7 (61a).</i> And who is this anyone? This is Joab, of whom it is stated (in II Sam. 3:29): <small>MAY IT (Abner's blood) FALL UPON THE HEAD OF JOB AND HIS SON;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Masoretic Text: <small>ALL HIS FATHER’S HOUSE</small>.</i> <small>[MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE, ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD]. ONE WITH A DISCHARGE</small> corresponds to <small>STRENGTH</small>. In the case of one who has a discharge, there is no one weaker than he. <small>A LEPER</small> corresponds to <small>BEAUTY</small>. In the case of one who is a leper, even a young &lt; leper &gt;, there is no one more ugly than he. <small>A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE</small> corresponds to <small>WEALTH</small>; for he [is one] {like a poor woman is one} who, if not spinning flax, has nothing of which to eat. <small>ONE LACKING BREAD</small> corresponds to <small>WISDOM</small>, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. And <small>ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD</small> corresponds to <small>&lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS</small>. The one who sins is afflicted by them, but the one who is meritorious receives, as did Isaac. David also gave praise (in Ps. 45:17 [16]): <small>INSTEAD OF YOUR PARENTS THERE WILL BE YOUR CHILDREN</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &lt; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 17:8): <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE OF GRACE (i.e., A PRECIOUS STONE) IN THE EYES OF THE ONE USING IT; WHEREVER HE TURNS, HE PROSPERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 6:8.</i> Do not say it this way (i.e., with the word <small>GRACE</small>), but <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE IN THE EYES OF THE ONE USING IT</small>. Come and see what the Holy One's burnt offering (i.e., Isaac at his binding) has said: It is not seemly for him to be weak in the eyes. Should one who would give his life for the name of the Holy One and was bound upon the altar have had his eyes weakened? Nevertheless, the Holy One said: I have written in my Torah (in Exod. 23:8): <small>AND DO NOT TAKE A BRIBE</small>. Why? (Deut. 16:19:) <small>BECAUSE A BRIBE BLINDS THE EYES OF THE WISE</small>. So, when he received a bribe from Esau, I weakened his eyes. Now surely, if Isaac the Righteous had his eyes weakened because he took a bribe, how much the worse is it for &lt; just &gt; anyone who receives a bribe from others! It is therefore stated (in Prov. 7:8): <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE OF GRACE</small>. Therefore (in Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD AND &lt; HIS EYES &gt; WERE TOO WEAK &lt; TO SEE &gt;</small>. The word "deception" was not mentioned here.
(Gen. 27:1, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM (Esau): MY SON; AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: HERE I AM</small>. The Holy Spirit also proclaims (in Prov. 26:25): <small>WHEN HIS (Esau's) VOICE IS GRACIOUS, DO NOT TRUST HIM; FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 65:11.</i> &lt; I.e., &gt; seven sanctuaries are going to be destroyed: the Tent of Meeting, Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, Gibeon, the first Temple, and the second Temple. Ergo: <small>FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART</small>.
Another interpretation: He will slay the ten tribes and the kings of Israel. Here are two. He will slay the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to make four. He will slay the priests, the Levites, and the dynasty of the house of David, for a total of seven.

Siman 9

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:1): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM (Esau): MY SON; AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: HERE I AM</small>. Solomon proclaimed (in Prov. 26:23): <small>SILVER DROSS LAID OVER EARTHENWARE ARE BURNING LIPS AND AN EVIL HEART</small>. To what was Esau comparable? To a caldron<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>miliarion</i>; Lat.: <i>miliarium</i>.</i> with an outside of gold inlaid with pearls but an inside of earthenware. [Thus did Esau say to his father: <small>HERE I AM</small>, while in his heart he was saying: When will he die?] Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:41): <small>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 26:23): <small>SILVER DROSS LAID OVER EARTHENWARE</small>…. And so you find that the seed of [Esau], Haman, said in his heart (in Esth. 6:6): <small>NOW HAMAN SAID IN HIS HEART</small>. (Is. 14:13f.:) <small>THE FOOL HAS SAID IN HIS HEART: &lt; THERE IS NO GOD &gt;</small>. (Is. 14:13:) <small>AND YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART: I WILL ASCEND TO THE HEAVENS…. &lt; I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH &gt;</small>. (Ezek. 38:10:) <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY THAT THOUGHTS SHALL COME UPON YOUR HEART, &lt; AND YOU WILL DEVISE AN EVIL DESIGN &gt;</small>. (Ps. 10:11:) <small>HE HAS SAID IN HIS HEART: GOD HAS FORGOTTEN</small>.

AND JACOB SAID UNTO HIS FATHER: &lt; I AM ESAU, YOUR FIRST-BORN &gt;</small>…. So he blessed him (in Gen. 27:27). Even though you may say Jacob lied, he did not lie.

(Gen. 27:23:) <small>SO HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE &lt; HAIRY LIKE THE HANDS OF HIS BROTHER ESAU &gt;</small>.

When he foresaw that he would repent, there immediately follows (in vs. 27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS CLOTHES AND BLESSED HIM</small>…. When Jacob entered, the Garden of Eden (i.e., Paradise) entered with him, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>LIKE THE ODOR OF A FIELD WHICH THE LORD HAS BLESSED</small>.

(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY THE GOD GIVE TO YOU &lt; FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN &gt;</small>. {His fulfillment is simply &lt; that of &gt; God.

When the God accomplishes his fulfillment], he will give you the blessings with which I have blessed you. Why? Because Jacob was collaborating with his Creator in every matter. R.

(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is it correct that one may fold his garments on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab</i>. 15:3): <small>ONE MAY FOLD GARMENTS EVEN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. ONE MAY ALSO MAKE BEDS ON THE NIGHT OF THE SABBATH (i.e., on Friday night) FOR THE SABBATH, BUT NOT ON THE SABBATH FOR THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SABBATH</small>. Now concerning these garments, they said that one may fold any garments that one is to wear on the Sabbath; but &lt; as for those &gt; to be worn after the Sabbath, it is forbidden to fold them on the Sabbath. Also with respect to garments which are folded by two people, it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yShab</i>. 15:3 (15a); <i>Shab</i>. 113a.</i> In the case of an individual, it is permitted to fold one. And he should not be apprehensive, because one should honor the Sabbath with his clothes, as stated (in Is. 68:13): <small>AND YOU SHALL CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yPe’ah</i> 8:8 (21b); <i>PR</i> 23:1.</i> And in what way does Israel honor the Sabbath? Through eating, through drinking, and through clean clothes, because the Holy One did so from the beginning, as stated (in Gen. 3:21): <small>THEN [THE LORD] GOD MADE TUNICS OF SKIN FOR ADAM AND HIS WIFE AND CLOTHED THEM</small>. What were <small>TUNICS OF SKIN?</small> [Garments] of high priesthood, which the Holy One put on them, since he (Adam) was the glory of the world.
Furthermore, our masters have also taught (in <i>Zev</i>. 14:4) <small>BEFORE THE TABERNACLE WAS SET UP, THE HIGH PLACES WERE PERMITTED AND THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED BY THE FIRST-BORN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 6:4, and the other references cited there.</i> Therefore, the Holy One clothed Adam in garments of high priesthood, since he was the first-born of the world. Noah came [and passed them on to Shem; Shem] passed them on to Abraham; Abraham passed them on to Isaac; and Isaac passed them on to Esau, who was his first-born. Esau, however, saw his wives serving idols and deposited them (the clothes) with his mother. When Jacob arose and took the birthright of Esau, Rebekah said: Inasmuch as Jacob has taken the birthright from the hand of Esau, he has the right to put on these garments. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>THEN REBEKAH TOOK THE BEST GARMENTS OF HER OLDER SON ESAU, &lt; WHICH WERE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE, AND HAD HER YOUNGER SON JACOB PUT THEM ON &gt;</small>. Jacob came in to his father Isaac and emitted an aroma on him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS AND BLESSED HIM</small>…. How did he bless him? According to what they read on the matter (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>….

[(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>.] It is written (in Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 66:1.</i> Who spoke this verse? Job spoke it about himself, about the Temple, and about Jacob. In what way did he say about himself: <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN</small> … ? The doors of his house were open to those passing by, especially to Torah scholars. What is the meaning of <small>UNTO (<i>ele</i>) WATER</small>? To the rams (<i>ele</i>) of Torah and its warriors. It is just as you say (in Dan. 8:4): <small>I SAW THE RAM CHARGING SEAWARD AND NORTHWARD</small>. ["To water"] is not written here (in Job 29:19), but <small>UNTO (<i>ele</i>) WATER</small>, because the house of Job was opened to &lt; such &gt; wayfarers. Therefore (in Job 29:19, cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES (<i>qatsir</i>)</small>. R. Hanina said: Everybody saw that when Job harvested his field, there were clouds gathered over his harvest (<i>qatsir</i>) because it would not have recovered its freshness from the burning heat.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. MS 1240 from the De Rossi library in Parma: “Because he would plant it away from the burning heat.”</i> Ergo (in Job 29:19): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES (<i>qatsir</i>)</small>.
Another interpretation (of Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>. This refers to the Temple because its gates were open to the Torah. Thus it is stated (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small> (of Torah). &lt; It is &gt; just as our masters have taught (in <i>Sanh</i>. 11 [10]:2):<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>THag</i>. 2:9; <i>TSanh</i>. 7:1; <i>ySanh</i>. 1:4 (19c); <i>Sanh</i>. 88b.</i> <small>THERE WERE THREE LAW COURTS THERE: ONE AT THE OPENING TO THE TEMPLE MOUNT, ONE AT THE OPENING TO THE TEMPLE COURT, AND ONE IN THE HALL OF HEWN STONES</small>. Ergo (in Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN &lt; UNTO WATER (of Torah)</small> &gt;…. What is the meaning (of ibid., cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES</small>. That the dew does not [move] from there, as stated (in Ps. 133:3): <small>LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON &lt; WHICH COMES DOWN UPON THE HILLS OF ZION</small> &gt;.
Another interpretation (of Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>. This was Jacob pursuing &lt; the water of Torah &gt; in the academies which were open to the Torah. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES</small>? For, when he comes to his father to receive ten blessings, he begins for <small>YOU</small> with dew (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE YOU FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN</small>….

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. May he give to you and give to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GOD</small>? &lt; That he acted &gt; in justice. If you were worthy, he will give to you; but if not, he will not give to you. To Esau, however, he did not say this; but (according to Gen. 27:39): <small>OF THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH &lt; SHALL BE YOUR DWELLING &gt;</small>…. Whether you are righteous or wicked, he will give to you. Why? Isaac simply said this: Esau is wicked, and Jacob is righteous. Even though he performs a commandment and is afflicted, he does not voice a complaint [against divine justice. However, if the wicked one performs one commandment or prays, and is not answered, he begins to say]: Just as I have prayed to idols and found nothing tangible, [so I have prayed to God and found nothing tangible]. Solomon also said so. When he built the Temple, he prayed to the Holy One, as stated (in I Kings 8, beginning with vs. 12): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAID: THE LORD SAID THAT HE WOULD DWELL IN THICK DARKNESS</small>. He began reciting his prayers and said: Sovereign of the World, when someone from Israel comes to pray in the future and asks for sons or for something else, if he is worthy, give to him; but if not, do not give to him. Thus it is stated (in vs. 39): <small>AND GIVE TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WAYS, SINCE YOU KNOW HIS HEART</small>. But if a foreigner should come to pray there, give to him whatever he asks. Thus it is stated (in vss. 41 &amp; 43): <small>AND ALSO UNTO THE FOREIGNER … YOU SHALL</small> {<small>ALSO</small>} <small>HEARKEN IN HEAVEN</small>…. For perhaps, if you do not do for him all that he asks, he will talk and say to himself: So it is with this house of Solomon. I have gone from one end of the world to the other and have been worn out from so many journeyings. Then I came and prayed in here and have found nothing tangible in here, just as I did not find it in idolatry. Ergo (in Gen. 27:39): <small>SEE, OF THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH &lt; SHALL BE YOUR DWELLING &gt;</small>…. Why? Because he is lacking faith. But to Jacob, since he possessed faith and was righteous, he said (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; injustice.

Immediately [Isaac] said to him (in Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>. Your power is stronger than his. If Esau captures anyone, see, he is in his hand; but if [that one] flees, he cannot do a thing to him. With you, however, even though someone flees from one end of the world to [the other], (in vs. 22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. You say something in the synagogue; and look, it comes to pass of its own accord.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>. The hands of Esau shall be shaken when the voice of Jacob comes. This (coming voice of Jacob) refers to the Messianic King, according to what is stated (in Is. 40:9): <small>GO UP UPON A HIGH MOUNTAIN, O HERALD OF GOOD TIDINGS TO ZION, RAISE YOUR VOICE WITH STRENGTH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, &lt; BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small> &gt;. He said to him: In respect to your brother Esau, if misfortune touches him, he begins reviling and cursing; but in your case, if afflictions touch you, practice self-restraint and do not show anger toward your Creator through your voice. And if you prattle with your voice, <small>THE HANDS OF ESAU</small> will be touching you; [but, if not, <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>?] That which you find at Rephidim. The Israelites prattled &lt; there &gt; with their voice and said (in Exod. 17:7): <small>IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US &lt; OR NOT &gt;</small>? Immediately Amalek came against them, as stated (in vs. 8): <small>THEN AMALEK CAME &lt; AND FOUGHT WITH ISRAEL AT REPHIDIM &gt;</small>.
Isaac said to him (in Gen. 27:24): <small>IS THIS YOU, MY SON ESAU?</small> He said to him: It is I. He said to him (in vs. 25): <small>SERVE ME, AND LET ME EAT…. &lt; SO HE SERVED HIM, AND HE ATE. HE ALSO BROUGHT HIM WINE, AND HE DRANK &gt;</small>. Where did he get wine from? Note, we find that his mother did not give him wine.

When Jacob came to bless Judah, he said to him (in Gen. 49:8): <small>AND MAY YOUR FATHER'S CHILDREN BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>, because he had a lot of wives.

Buber himself suggests this emendation of “gateway” (<i>pilon</i>, from the Gk.: <i>pylon</i>). So Gen. R. 66:5.</i> had two ends, a gate to the north and a gate to the south. Jacob left with the plate<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>diskos</i>; Lat.: <i>discus</i>.</i> in his hand. He saw Esau and hid behind the door. One who is in the light does not see {him.

But, while Jacob was detained [for so long] over all this business, where was Esau during this time? R.

Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:30): <small>AND &lt; JACOB &gt; HAD JUST GONE OUT, GONE OUT</small>…. Therefore, David has said (in Ps. 86:10): <small>FOR YOU ARE GREAT, AND YOU PERFORM WONDERS (rt.: <i>PL'</i>), YOU GOD BY YOURSELF</small>.

(Cant. 5:2:) <small>I SLEEP, BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 5:6; <i>PR</i> 15:6; Cant.

R. Hiyya bar Abba said: {How} [Where] do we find that the Holy One is called the Heart of Israel? In this scripture (Ps. 73:26): <small>GOD IS THE ROCK OF MY HEART AND MY PORTION FOREVER</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>THE SOUND OF MY BELOVED KNOCKING</small>. This refers to Moses, since it is stated (in Exod. 11:4): <small>THEN MOSES SAID: THUS SAYS THE LORD: ABOUT MIDNIGHT &lt; I SHALL GO FORTH INTO THE MIDST OF EGYPT &gt;</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>OPEN FOR ME</small>. R.

Thus it is stated (in vs. 12, cont.): <small>AND IN HIS EYES I SHALL BE LIKE ONE WHO MOCKS</small>. Now one who mocks is nothing but an idolater, since it is stated (in Jer. 10:15): <small>THEY (i.e., idols) ARE VANITY, A WORK OF MOCKERY</small>.
(Gen. 27:12, cont.:) <small>THEN I WILL BRING UPON MYSELF A CURSE INSTEAD OF A BLESSING</small>.

It is also written (in vs. 35): <small>THEN &lt; THE IRON, THE CLAY, THE BRASS, THE SILVER, AND THE GOLD &gt; WERE BROKEN IN PIECES (INTO ONE &lt; MASS &gt;) [TOGETHER]… [AND THE STONE WHICH SMOTE THE IMAGE BECAME A GREAT MOUNTAIN]</small>. Now what is <small>[A GREAT] MOUNTAIN</small>? (Zech. 4:7): <small>WHO ARE YOU, O GREAT MOUNTAIN</small>? And from where does it come? By way of the mountains, as stated (in Is. 52:7): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL UPON THE MOUNTAINS ARE THE FEET OF THE ONE BRINGING GOOD TIDINGS</small>. In that hour Israel shall look and say (with Ps. 121:1f.): <small>I WILL LIFT UP EYES MY UNTO THE MOUNTAINS. &lt; FROM WHERE WILL MY HELP COME? &gt; MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD</small>….

(Gen. 27:33:) <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED &lt; EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY &gt;</small>…. This text is related (to Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART, BUT THE ANSWER OF THE TONGUE COMES FROM THE LORD</small>. What are the considerations of the heart? [If] one [has] an account or any business with his associate, he may think in his heart and say: If we should stand [with him] (in court), he would say thus and so to me; and I would say thus and so to him. &lt; When &gt; he does stand against me, it turns out that after all the things that he was considering, he does not speak &lt; them &gt;, but forgets. Ergo: Solomon said it well (in Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART, BUT THE ANSWER OF THE TONGUE COMES FROM THE LORD</small>.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART</small>. R. Levi said: The Holy One created six members for a person, three under his control and three not under his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 67:3.</i> Now these are the three which are not under his control: The nose, the eye, and the ear. How so? In the case of someone passing unexpectedly through a market where they were burning incense before an idol, he did not wish to smell it. Even though he does not wish to smell it, what should he do? Thus it is that the nose is not under one's control. Likewise the eye is not under one's control. How so? &lt; If &gt; one passed through the market and saw a transgression, but did not want &lt; to see it &gt;, what should he do? Why? Because the eye is not under his control. Likewise the ear is not under one's control. How so? &lt; If &gt; he was walking along and heard a person reviling and blaspheming, he did not want to hear blasphemies. But nevertheless, he was under an obligation in regard to the rending of garments. Thus R. Simeon has said: One who hears and one who blasphemes are &lt; both &gt; under an obligation in regard to the rending of garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>yMQ</i> 3:7 (83b); <i>ySanh</i>. 7:10 (25b); <i>MQ</i> 26a; <i>Sanh.</i> 60a.</i> Since the blasphemies have multiplied, you have to stop. It is evident that no one can &lt; stand &gt; listening to blasphemies,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>blasphemia</i>.</i> but what can one do when his ears are not under his control? Now these are the three which are under his control: The mouth, the hand, and the foot. In the case of the hand, if someone wants to steal, he steals; and if not, he does not steal. Also, if he wants to kill with his hand, he kills; and if not, he does not kill. So much for the hand. In the case of the foot, if someone wants to go on foot to serve an idol, he goes; and if not, he does not go. Also, if he wants to carry out a commandment, he performs it; and if not, he does not perform it. Likewise, in the case of the mouth, if someone wants to speak, [whether good or evil], he speaks; and if not, he does not speak. Ergo (in Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART</small>.

Siman 22

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY</small>. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina:<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 6:13.</i> One does not say: <small>EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY</small> unless there was another &lt; event &gt; before it (for it to exceed). So what were the two tremblings that Isaac had? One was on Mount Moriah when his father bound him and took up the knife to slaughter him. The Holy One appeared above the angels and opened up the firmament. When Isaac raised his eyes and saw the chambers of the chariot, he trembled and shook. But here he trembled, and his trembling was greater than the first time! There he trembled when he saw the Holy One, the chambers of the chariot, and the angels. But here, because Jacob had entered and taken the blessings, his trembling was greater than that &lt; former &gt; trembling. But why did he tremble? Nathan the Haver said in the name of R. Aha and R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite &lt; who said &gt; in the name of R. Johanan: When Jacob entered, the Garden of Eden entered with him, as stated (in Gen. 27:27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 6:16; Gen. R. 65:22; Cant. R. 4:11:2.</i> And note that he did not put on anything but clothes of goat's hair, as stated (in vs. 16): <small>THEN SHE CLOTHED HIS ARMS &lt; AND THE HAIRLESS PART OF HIS NECK &gt; WITH THE SKINS OF GOAT KIDS</small>. And you do not have a worse odor in the &lt; whole &gt; world than goatskins washed smooth. But what is the meaning (of vs. 27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS?</small> Some interpret it to say: The Holy One blew on the clothes of Isaac the odor of the incense which was going to be used in the Temple. When Esau the Wicked entered, however, &lt; the result was as &gt; R. Aha and R. Johanan have said: Gehinnom entered with him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 18:3): <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING; AND WITH DISGRACE, SHAME</small>. When Esau arrived, Isaac perceived the house becoming hot and &lt; so &gt; perceived Gehinnom.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 6:1, 4.</i> He began to scream and tremble, as stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED &lt; EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY &gt;</small>.
[(Gen. 27:33, cont.:) <small>AND SAID: WHO THEN</small> (<i>mi 'efo'</i>)?] What is the meaning of MY 'EFO' (rt.: '<i>P</i>')? Mi <i>'efoh</i> (rt.: '<i>PH</i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 67:2; Cant. R. 4:11:2.</i> Isaac said: Sovereign of the Universe: Who is being baked (<i>mi ne'efah</i>, rt.: '<i>PH</i>) in this oven (i.e., of Gehinnom), I or my son Jacob? The Holy One said to him: Neither you nor your son Jacob. But who? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE THAT HAS HUNTED GAME</small>. This is Esau, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>ESAU BECAME A CUNNING HUNTER</small>.

Siman 23

Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:33): Why did he tremble? Because he had blessed the younger before the elder; for he had intended to bless both of them. So he called Esau in order to bless him first, since he was the elder. Then afterwards, &lt; he would call &gt; Jacob. So he intended. Why? Because before the Holy One it is difficult to supplant a genealogical chain, to replace primogeniture. So note that he only called Esau. On what basis do you say that he wished to bless Jacob? On the basis of what Jacob said, {and he said} [to his mother] (in Gen. 27:12): <small>THEN I WILL BRING UPON MYSELF A CURSE INSTEAD OF A BLESSING</small>. He said to her: Even the blessing which he was going to give me, in the end he will not give me. Isaac only trembled when he said: What sin is on my hands that the genealogical chain should be ruined at my hands, for me to bless the younger &lt; first &gt; and the elder afterwards? And so you find: In every place Moses comes before Aaron;<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha</i>, 1.</i> but when it comes to genealogy, Aaron is before Moses. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF AARON AND MOSES</small>. R. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan of the Bet Guvrin: In the case of Reuben also, when that event (the selling of Joseph) happened at his hands, his father gave his birthright to Joseph. Thus it is stated (in I Chron. 5:1): <small>AND THE SONS OF REUBEN, THE FIRST-BORN OF ISRAEL. NOW HE IS FIRST-BORN; BUT, WHEN HE HAD DEFILED HIS FATHER'S BED, HIS BIRTHRIGHT WAS GIVEN TO (JOSEPH) [THE SONS JOSEPH BEN ISRAEL]</small>. Hence the birthright belonged to Joseph. In the genealogy, however, he was not able to keep his birthright away from him, as stated (in Exod. 6:14): <small>THE SONS OF REUBEN THE FIRST-BORN OF ISRAEL</small>. "Now he was the first-born" is not written here (in I Chron. 5:1), but: <small>NOW HE IS THE FIRST-BORN</small>. So also in the case of the sons of Noah, Japheth was the oldest: but because Shem was more righteous, &lt; Scripture &gt; counts him first in every place.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 2:19.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH</small>. In regard to genealogy, however, &lt; Scripture &gt; mentions Japheth as being the eldest. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 10:21): <small>AND UNTO SHEM THERE WERE CHILDREN BORN. HE WAS ALSO FATHER TO ALL THE CHILDREN OF EBER &lt; AND &gt; THE BROTHER OF JAPHETH, WHO WAS THE OLDEST</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The last eight words can be, and commonly are, translated: <small>THE ELDER BROTHER OF JAPHETH</small>. See Gen. R. 37:7.</i> R. Tanhuma said: But you also have to learn &lt; through &gt; greater insight, that Shem was second to Japheth. Therefore, you find that Noah sired a son at &lt; an age of &gt; five hundred years. It is written (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; &lt; AND NOAH BEGOT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH</small> &gt;. Now the flood took place (according to Gen. 7:11): <small>IN THE SIX HUNDREDTH YEAR OF NOAH'S LIFE</small>…. {Since} it is also written of Shem that he sired a son at &lt; the age of &gt; a hundred years, {he was lacking two} [two years after the flood). It is so stated (in Gen. 11:10): <small>THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF SHEM: SHEM WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGOT ARPACHSHAD, TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD</small>. If he had been the eldest, it would have been necessary to say only: <small>HE BEGOT ARPACHSHAD, TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD</small>. You also learn from here that Japheth was two years older than Shem according to the reckoning of my calculation. Here also (in Gen. 27:33), Isaac only trembled when he said: What sin is there on my hands that I have blessed the younger before the elder and have changed the order? Jacob went out and Esau came in, as stated (in Gen. 27:30): <small>AND JACOB HAD JUST GONE OUT</small>…. He (Esau) said to his father (in vs. 32): <small>I AM [YOUR SON], YOUR FIRST-BORN, ESAU</small>. His father began saying: Who is this one who entered and received the blessings? The Holy Spirit said to him: It was Jacob. He said to him (in vs. 33): <small>AND I HAVE EATEN OF EVERYTHING</small>. R. Isaac said: In that dish Isaac had a taste <small>OF EVERYTHING</small> that the Holy One had created during the six days of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 6:11; Gen. R. 67:2.</i> Also R. Judah b. R. Shallum said in the name of R. Ayyevu: In that dish Isaac had a taste of whatever is stored up for the righteous in the days to come. [Isaac said to him: In that dish I tasted everything that the Holy One has created]. Esau said to him: Daddy, [tell me:] What is that dish? Isaac said to him: &lt; Whatever I ask for &gt;. I asked for pheasant;<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>phasianos</i>.</i> I tasted it. Esau said to him: Daddy, tell me the basic &lt; ingredient &gt;. He said to him: It was meat. R. Hananyah b. R. Isaac said: When Esau heard this, he began striking his face. He said: Woe to that man, as stated (in Gen. 27:34): <small>AND HE LET OUT A GREAT AND BITTER CRY</small>…. Esau said: He fed me pottage of lentils, and I gave him my birthright. Now he has fed Daddy meat. You must know with what blessings he blessed him! <small>HE BEGAN TO CRY AND SAY: IS HE NOT RIGHTLY NAMED JACOB (rt.: '<i>QB</i>)? [FOR HE HAS CHEATED (rt.: '<i>QB</i>) ME THESE TWO TIMES. HE TOOK MY BIRTHRIGHT; AND, SEE, NOW HE HAS TAKEN MY BLESSING</small>.] His father said to him: So what should I do for you? He said to him: He has already taken my birthright. Isaac said to him: Over this matter I was sorry. He also said: Perhaps I transgressed a commandment of the Law in blessing the younger before the elder. Now that I have already blessed him, (according to Gen. 27:33:) <small>HE SHALL ALSO BE BLESSED</small>.

(Gen. 27:35:) <small>BUT HE SAID: YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT &lt; AND TOOK YOUR BLESSING &gt;</small>. Was he talking about a righteous one being <small>WITH DECEIT</small>? Heaven forbid! Rather &lt; the verse means &gt;: "He came with cunning because of you."<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen.

The Holy One said to him: May your mouth be stopped up! Look, Jacob is blessing twelve tribes, and it is not a case of him blessing one as he blesses another. Even so he was filled with compassion for him. He came to bless him, but the Divine Presence departed from him. He began to pray and say (in the words of Is. 26:10): <small>LET THE WICKED BE SHOWN FAVOR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 67:5.</i> He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>HE WILL NOT LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. He said to him: Do you desire to bless this one? He is going to destroy my house and confuse lands<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>‘Aratsot</i>. Perhaps the text should read <i>‘otsarot</i> (“treasures”) here. See MS 1240 of the De Rossi library in Parma.</i> and riches. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>IN A LAND OF INTEGRITY HE WILL ACT UNJUSTLY</small>. Isaac said to him: Give to him in this world, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE SHALL NOT SEE THE MAJESTY OF THE LORD</small> in the world to come because he would compel<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>anangke</i>.</i> me to repay him the glory with which he honored me. Esau immediately raised his eyes upward and wept, as stated (in Gen. 27:38): <small>AND ESAU LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT</small>. The Holy One said: Although he is wicked, flatter him. R. Eleazar said: Esau shed three tears, one from his right &lt; eye &gt;, one from his left, and one disappeared in the midst of his eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">M.Pss. 80:4.</i> The Holy One said: Look, the wicked one is weeping over his life! How am I to turn him away empty! He immediately told his father to bless him. This text is related (to Ps. 80:6 [5]): <small>YOU HAVE FED THEM THE BREAD OF TEARS AND HAVE HAD THEM DRINK A SHALISH</small><sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The word <small><i>SHALISH</i></small> has the same spelling as <i>shelish</i>, which means “one-third,” and has the same root as the word for “three.” In the context of the psalm <i>shalish</i> denotes a dry measure, which is a third of an ephah.</i> <small>OF TEARS</small>. R. Abbin said in the name of R. Aha: Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, now if in the case of Esau the Wicked, because he had shed two tears, &lt; you were &gt; filled with compassion for him immediately; how much the more so in our case, when our tears &lt; flow &gt; constantly day and night like bread, as stated (in Ps. 42:4 [3]): <small>MY TEARS HAVE BEEN MY BREAD DAY AND NIGHT</small>. Up to now the proper time has not arrived for him to be filled with compassion over you. David has said (in Ps. 39:13 [12]): <small>HEAR MY PRAYER, O LORD, AND GIVE EAR TO MY CRY. DO NOT KEEP SILENCE AT MY TEARS</small>. The Holy One said to them: I will repay Esau the Wicked for the glory of his ancestors, and I will exalt him. Afterwards, I am coming to exalt you and repay {them} [you] for what you have achieved and for what your ancestors achieved. It is so stated (in Ps. 46:11 [ 10]): <small>I WILL BE EXALTED AMONG THE GENTILES; I WILL BE EXALTED IN THE EARTH</small>. It is simply that the Holy One said to Jacob (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>. It is also written (in Mal. 3:12): <small>FOR YOU WILL BE A DELIGHTFUL LAND</small>. Esau said to him (in Gen. 27:37): <small>BLESS ME ALSO, O MY FATHER</small>. Isaac said to him: With what shall I bless you? R. Berekhyah said: He said to him: I made him a lord over you. In anything whatever that I should bless you, I should be blessing him. Why? Because whatever the slave acquires, he acquires for his master. (Gen. 27:29:) <small>BE A MASTER TO YOUR BROTHER</small> is what Isaac said to Jacob. That was the seventh blessing (in Gen. 27:29). Now Isaac had set down ten blessings with which he had blessed him, but he said to him only (in vs. 27:37): "<small>BEHOLD, I HAVE MADE HIM A MASTER OVER YOU</small>." He did, however, say to him: With everything that you are thinking I should bless you, I should only be blessing him. Why? Because whatever the servant has belongs to the master. Thus in Egypt, even though they had been enslaved to them, when they left them they took all their property. So also in the case of thirty-one kings (in Josh. 12:7-24), Israel drove them from their land and took their wealth. So also now in respect to what the peoples of the world are plundering from Israel, Israel belongs to the LORD. Thus it is stated (in Is. 23:18): <small>HER (in reference to Tyre as a harlot) PROFITS AND HER HIRE SHALL BE DEDICATED TO THE LORD {OF HOSTS}. THEY SHALL NOT BE TREASURED OR STORED, FOR HER PROFITS SHALL BELONG TO THOSE WHO DWELL BEFORE THE LORD FOR EATING THEIR FILL AND FOR SPLENDID CLOTHING</small>.

(Gen. 28:10:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 12:15): <small>THE WAY OF A FOOL IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 6:22): <small>WHEN YOU WALK, IT</small> (your father's commandment and your mother's torah) <small>WILL GUIDE YOU</small>. This refers to Jacob, who had been occupied with Torah when he set out from his father's house, and he did not leave it behind. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>IN YOUR LYING DOWN, IT WILL WATCH OVER YOU</small>. When? (In Gen. 28:11:) <small>THEN HE TOOK ONE OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE, [SET IT UNDER HIS HEAD, AND LAY DOWN IN THAT PLACE]</small>. When he lay down, it guarded him.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. This refers to Abraham when he pursued the kings. Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:2): <small>WHO HAS AROUSED &lt; RIGHTEOUSNESS &gt;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word translated <small>RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> here (<i>tsedeq</i>) implies victory and success as well as righteousness.</i> <small>FROM THE EAST</small> … ? (I Sam. 2:9, cont.:) <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. These are the sixteen kings whom he killed in the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.
Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. This refers to Jacob, when he set out to go to Haran; for the Holy One said this to him (in Gen. 28:15): <small>SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. This refers to Esau, of whom it is stated (in Job 20:26): <small>UTTER DARKNESS AWAITS HIS TREASURES; &lt; AN UNFANNED FIRE SHALL CONSUME HIM &gt;</small>…. (Obad. 18:) <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE … AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW; &lt; THEY SHALL BURN IT AND CONSUME IT &gt;</small>. When Esau set out to pursue Jacob, it was for ten hours that the Holy One concealed the day and made it evening. Accordingly, it is stated (in Gen. 28:11): <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A CERTAIN PLACE, &lt; HE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET &gt;</small>. So Esau remained in the darkness and did not know where he was going. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 2:9): <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE ONE SHALL NOT PREVAIL BY STRENGTH</small>. The Holy One said to him: Perhaps you think you are mighty! And in the world to come he (the Holy One) is also acting for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 97:11): <small>LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. It also says (in Prov. 4:18f.): <small>BUT THE PATH<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Buber text has <i>or</i> (<small>LIGHT</small>) here instead <i>orah</i> (<small>PATH</small>). <small>PATH</small> not only fits better into the context, but also represents the traditional biblical text.</i> OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS LIKE LUMINOUS SPLENDOR…. &lt; BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED IS LIKE DEEP DARKNESS; THEY DO NOT KNOW ON WHAT THEY WILL STUMBLE &gt;</small>. And if you have some doubts (about such treatment of the wicked), it has already happened in this world (to the Egyptians), as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>NOR COULD ONE SEE HIS BROTHER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As most translations recognize, the passage simply means that the Egyptians could not see each other under the plague of darkness; however, the midrash understands the Hebrew more literally as a parallel to Esau not being able to see his brother Jacob.</i>
Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. When Jacob set out from his father's house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH &lt; ONLY &gt; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN</small>. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): <small>BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC</small>. &lt; There is &gt; also this (in Gen. 24:2): <small>SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD</small>. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of <small>THE ONE WHO RULED</small>? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &lt; must &gt; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) <small>THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER'S GOODS IN HIS HAND</small>. This refers to a <i>diatheke</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek words means “covenant.”</i> {gift certificate} which he carried in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 59:11 and some versions of <i>PRE</i> 16. Both use the word <i>diatheke</i> in this context. Cf. Gen. R. 61:6.</i> (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) <small>BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC</small>. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>catellae</i>.</i> to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): <small>THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES</small>. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): <small>ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT</small>. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): <small>&lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &gt; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD</small>. Jacob knew &lt; about it &gt; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put {his staff for him in his hand} [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN</small>. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 75:5.</i> Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &lt; Since &gt; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verb is related to the Greek noun <i>zeugos</i> (“yoke of beasts”).</i> against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>].

(Gen. 28:11:) <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <i>PG</i>') A CERTAIN PLACE</small>. There is no "coming across" (rt.: <i>PG</i>') except for prayer. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 7:16): <small>AS FOR YOU, DO NOT PRAY FOR THIS PEOPLE…. AND DO NOT INTERCEDE (rt.: <i>PG</i>') WITH ME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber.</i> 26b; <i>Sanh.</i> 95b; Gen. R. 68:9.</i> It was concerning him that David said (in Ps. 121:4-8): <small>SEE, &lt; THE GUARDIAN OF ISRAEL &gt; NEITHER SLUMBERS NOR SLEEPS. THE LORD IS YOUR GUARDIAN; THE LORD IS YOUR SHADE…. BY DAY THE SUN SHALL NOT SMITE YOU…. THE LORD SHALL KEEP YOU FROM ALL EVIL…. THE LORD SHALL GUARD YOUR GOING AND YOUR COMING FROM NOW ON AND FOREVER</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:11): <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <i>PG</i>') A CERTAIN PLACE</small> where the Holy Spirit rested upon him, &lt; i.e., &gt; upon Jacob. Then he prophesied that Israel was going to sin and that the Holy Spirit would depart from them. {Now this derives from (ibid., cont.): <small>BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET</small>. So also we find that it is written in the prophecy of Micah (3:6): <small>THE SUN SHALL SET &lt; UPON THE PROPHETS &gt;</small>, where it is a case of retribution and the passing away of prophecy.} Thus it is stated (in Jer. 27:18): <small>IF THEY ARE PROPHETS AND IF THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH THEM, PLEASE LET THEM INTERCEDE (rt.: <i>PG</i>') WITH THE LORD</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; teaches that this "coming across" (rt.: <i>PG</i>') is prophecy. (Gen. 28:11:) <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <i>PG</i>') A CERTAIN PLACE … BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET</small>. What is it that is written (in Micah 3:6)? <small>THE SUN SHALL SET UPON THE PROPHETS, AND THE DAY SHALL BE DARKENED</small>.
(Gen. 28:11, cont.:) <small>THEN HE TOOK SOME</small><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Traditional translations assume that Jacob <small>TOOK ONE OF THE STONES</small>, but the midrash assumes that there were more.</i> <small>OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE, &lt; SET THEM UNDER HIS HEAD, AND LAY DOWN IN THAT PLACE &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 68:11.</i> He thought in his heart: My grandfather Abraham sired a righteous &lt; son &gt; and a wicked &lt; son &gt; from two women. Isaac was righteous, and Ishmael was wicked. Then Daddy Isaac sired a righteous &lt; son &gt; and a wicked &lt; son &gt; from one woman. As for me, since I am to take four wives, how many wicked &lt; sons &gt; will there be from me? The Holy One said to him: Heaven forbid! (According to Cant. 4:7) <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED; THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>. When he arose in the morning, he found that all of the stones were one stone. He was glad that his bed was whole, as stated (in Gen. 28:18): <small>THEN JACOB AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, &lt;TOOK THE STONE WHICH HE HAD PUT UNDER HIS HEAD, SET IT UP AS A PILLAR &gt;</small>…. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as all these stones have become one, so shall all of your sons be righteous. Thus it is stated (in Job 5:23): <small>FOR YOU SHALL HAVE A COVENANT WITH THE STONES OF THE FIELD, AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD SHALL BE AT PEACE WITH YOU</small>.

Siman 5

Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. It is written (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS AND SHUT [YOUR DOORS] BEHIND ME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The MT reads <small>BEHIND YOU</small>.</i> <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>. When you see a fateful hour, do not stand against it but give way to it. Thus it is stated: <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>. Look at me, as it were, for I have perceived an hour &lt; made &gt; fateful through your sins. I did nothing. Instead I gave way to it, as stated (in Lam. 2:3): <small>HE HAS WITHDRAWN HIS RIGHT HAND</small>…. So also you, <small>GO MY PEOPLE</small>. Thus, the one who stands against the hour will fall into its hand; but whoever gives way to the hour will have the hour fall into his hand. Naboth stood against the hour {and stood against it} [and fell into its hand]. When Ahab said to him (in I Kings 21:2): <small>GIVE ME YOUR VINEYARD SO THAT I MAY HAVE IT FOR A VEGETABLE GARDEN</small>. What did he do? He said (in vs. 3): <small>THE LORD FORBID &lt; THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU MY ANCESTORS' INHERITANCE &gt;</small>. What happened to him? He fell into the hand of the hour, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>AND THE MEN OF BELIAL TESTIFIED AGAINST [NABOTH BEFORE THE PEOPLE…. AND THEY STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES]</small>. Abraham gave way to the hour and fled from Nimrod, the king of the Chaldeans. So the hour returned and fell into his hand when he killed sixteen kings. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>. Isaac also gave way to the hour when the Philistines said to him (in Gen. 26:16): <small>GO AWAY FROM US</small>. Immediately &lt; the passage continues &gt; (in vs. 17): <small>SO ISAAC WENT AWAY FROM THERE</small>. Then the hour returned and fell into his hand, as stated (in Gen. 26:26-28): <small>THEN ABIMELECH CAME UNTO HIM FROM GERAR…. SO ISAAC SAID UNTO THEM: WHY HAVE YOU COME UNTO ME …? AND THEY SAID: WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE LORD IS WITH YOU</small>…. Joseph also gave way to the hour. When his brothers sold him, was he not able to say: I am your brother? But he gave way to the hour, and the hour returned and fell before him, as stated (in Gen. 50:18): <small>THEN HIS BROTHERS ALSO WENT AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM</small>. Moses gave way to the hour, as stated (in Exod. 2:15): <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH</small>. So the hour returned and fell into his hand, as stated (in Exod. 11:3): <small>{AND} [ALSO] THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY GREAT IN THE EYES OF PHARAOH'S [SERVANTS] AND IN THE EYES OF HIS PEOPLE</small>. David also gave way to the hour, as stated (in I Sam. 20:1): <small>BUT DAVID FLED FROM NAIOTH</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 3:1): <small>WHEN HE FLED FROM HIS SON ABSALOM</small>. And it is written (in Ps. 57:1): <small>[WHEN HE FLED] FROM SAUL IN THE CAVE</small>. So the hour returned and fell into his hand when Saul said to him (in I Sam. 24:21 [20]): <small>[PLEASE] LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU SHALL SURELY REIGN AND IN YOUR HAND THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL SHALL ARISE</small>. So &lt; it was &gt; also &lt; with &gt; Jacob, who fled from the hour. (Hosea 12:13 [12]:) <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>. And the hour fell into his hand, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES &lt; … &gt; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB</small>. Ergo (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>.
Another interpretation (of Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>. Look into the chambers of your heart, and see that it was not in proportion to your sins that I brought sufferings upon you, for <small>YOUR CHAMBERS</small> are nothing but kidney chambers.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The kidneys have an emotional function similar to that of the heart.</i> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>SEARCHING ALL THE CHAMBERS OF THE BELLY</small>. But, if sufferings come upon you, do not open your mouth and complain against the measure of justice. Rather (according to Is. 26:20, cont.): <small>AND SHUT YOUR DOORS BEHIND YOU</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>. No sufferings ever come except they pass. Thus it is stated: <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>.

(Gen. 28:12:) <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER</small>…. Let our master instruct us: What is the difference between the death of the righteous and the death of the wicked? R. Justa bar Shunem said in the name of R. Joshua of Sikhnin: The death of the wicked is neither on the earth nor in the heavens. For it is so written of Ahithophel (in II Sam. 17:23): <small>THEN HE {GAVE INSTRUCTIONS UNTO HIS CHILDREN} [SET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER] AND HANGED HIMSELF</small>. And likewise in the case of Haman, &lt; his death was &gt; neither on the earth nor in the heavens. It is so stated (in Esth. 7:10): <small>THEN THEY HANGED HAMAN</small>; and his children as well (according to Esth. 9:25): <small>SO THAT HE AND HIS CHILDREN WOULD BE HANGED</small>. But the death of the righteous is &lt; both &gt; in the heavens and on the earth, as stated (in I Sam. 25:29): <small>YET THE LIFE OF MY LORD (David) SHALL BE FOUND IN THE BUNDLE OF THE LIVING &lt; WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD &gt;</small>. Where is it shown &lt; that the death of the righteous &gt; is on the earth? (II Chron. 32:33:) <small>SO THEY TOOK HIM (Hezekiah) UP AND BURIED HIM IN THE ASCENT OF THE TOMBS OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID. THUS &lt; ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM &gt; PAID HIM HONOR AT HIS DEATH</small>.
Let our master instruct us further: What is the difference between the dreams of the righteous and the dreams of the wicked? The dreams of the wicked are neither in the heavens nor on the earth. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 41:1): <small>PHARAOH DREAMED, AND THERE HE WAS STANDING ON THE NILE</small>. So also it is written of Nebuchadnezzar (in Dan. 4:2): <small>{IT WAS} [I SAW] A DREAM, AND IT MADE ME AFRAID</small>, for he was neither on the earth nor in the heavens (cf. vss. 7-8). However, the dreams of the righteous are &lt; both &gt; in the heavens and on the earth. You therefore find that Joseph said to his brothers (in Gen. 37:7): <small>HERE WE WERE BINDING SHEAVES</small>: Ergo, &lt; his dreams were &gt; on the earth. Where is it shown that they were also in heaven? Where it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>. So also it was in the case of our father Jacob (according to Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER [PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. Ergo, &lt; his dream was both &gt; in the heavens and on the earth].

Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER (rt. <i>SLM</i>)</small>. R.

He showed him Moses, as stated (in Exod 24:1): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO MOSES: GO UP UNTO THE LORD</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER PLACED ON EARTH</small>. R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: He showed him Jonah, as stated (in Jonah 2:7 [6]): <small>I WENT DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS</small>…. (Gen. 28:12, cont.:) <small>WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. He showed him Elijah, as stated (in II Kings 2:11): <small>AND ELIJAH WENT UP IN A WHIRLWIND INTO THE HEAVENS</small>. Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: He showed him Sinai (<i>SYNY</i>). This is a symbol. <i>S</i> = sixty, <i>Y</i> = ten, <i>N</i> = fifty, <i>Y</i> = ten. The sum is one hundred and thirty. <small>LADDER</small> also is a hundred and thirty.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In the MT <small>LADDER</small> is <i>SLM</i> (<i>S</i> = 60, <i>L</i> = 30, <i>M</i> = 40, for a total of 130); but the Buber text spells <small>LADDER <i>SWLM</i></small> for a total of 136.</i> It is stated here (in Gen. 21:12, cont.): <small>PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. It is also said of Sinai (in Deut. 4:11): <small>{AND BEHOLD, IT WAS} [AND THE MOUNTAIN WAS] BURNING WITH FIRE UP TO THE HEART OF THE HEAVENS</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD</small>.

It is also stated on Sinai (in Exod. 20:1): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>BUT JACOB SET OUT</small>. This is one of four children of Adam for whom the land (i.e., spatial distance) was contracted. They are the following: Abraham, Eleazer, Jacob, and Abishai.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh.</i> 95 (bar.), which omits Abraham from the list.</i> In the case of Abraham, where is it shown? &lt; It was &gt; when he went forth to pursue the kings &lt; that &gt; the land contracted before him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Abraham only needed to pursue the kings until midnight because God had shortened the pursuit. So Gen. R. 43:3; Exod. R. 18:1; cf. Gen. R. 43:3.</i> And in the case of Eleazer, where is it shown? &lt; It was &gt; when he went to bring a wife for Isaac &lt; that &gt; the land contracted before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh.</i> 95a; <i>PRE</i> 16.</i> What is written about him (in Gen. 24:42)? <small>AND I CAME TODAY (i.e., in one day) TO THE SPRING</small>.

When he fought with Ishbi-benob the brother of Goliath.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See also Gen. R. 59:11.</i> What did he do? He went after David with his shield at the ready. In that hour the Holy One put the fear of David upon him, since he said: How swift this man is! Where are David and his mighty men? And where is it shown? Where it is so written (in II Sam. 21:15): <small>AND DAVID WAS WEARY</small>. At that time David had said: Oh, that someone would put one of my sister's sons here for me. Now Joab and Abishai were far away from him where they were fighting with the children of Ammon and with Aram (cf. I Chron. 19:10f.) However, when David prayed, the Holy One contracted the land before Abishai, as stated (in II Sam. 21:17): <small>BUT ABISHAI BEN ZERUIAH CAME TO HIS AID</small>. And our father Jacob was also one before whom the Holy One caused the land to contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 95b; Gen.

Our masters have said: In the case of all the children of Adam, their feet carry them; but in Jacob's case, he keeps his feet up. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 29:1): <small>THEN JACOB RAISED HIS FEET</small>.

Siman 9

(Hosea 12:13 [12]:) <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>. From where did he flee? From Beersheba, as stated (in Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>. Was he in Beersheba? Was he not rather in Hebron, as stated (in Gen. 35:27): <small>I.E., HEBRON, WHERE ABRAHAM AND ISAAC SOJOURNED?</small> &lt; The situation was merely that he fled &gt; from a place set aside for oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>), since &lt; it was &gt; there &lt; that &gt; Abraham had sworn to Abimelech. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:23, 31): <small>SO NOW SWEAR TO ME BY GOD, BEHOLD…. THEREFORE THAT PLACE WAS NAMED BEERSHEBA, (i.e., The Well of the Oath) BECAUSE &lt; IT WAS &gt; THERE &lt; THAT &gt; BOTH OF THEM HAD SWORN</small>. Now where is it shown that Isaac had sworn? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:32f.): <small>THAT ISAAC'S SERVANTS CAME &lt; AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE WELL &gt;…. SO HE CALLED IT SHIBAH (i.e., oath); &lt; THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE CITY IS BEERSHEBA UNTO THIS DAY &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly Rashi and Nachmanides on Gen. 26:33. Cf. Malbim on this verse, according to whom Beersheba means “seventh well,” in that this well was the seventh dug by Isaac. Cf. also Ibn Ezra, who, because of what might be an alternative derivation from the number seven in Gen. 21:23-33, suggests that either Beersheba had two derivations or that there were two cities with this name.</i> And Esau also swore to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:33): <small>&lt; THEN JACOB SAID &gt; SWEAR TO ME FIRST</small>. &lt; Thus he swore an oath &gt; when he took his birthright. He thought in his heart and said: If he should come and say: Come, swear to me that you have not taken my blessing by deceit, what shall I be able to do to him? I shall simply go away from this place set aside for oaths. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small> (i.e., The Well of the Oath).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Beersheba seems to be, not a particular city, but any well where one might swear an oath. Thus, there is no contradiction between Jacob living in Hebron and setting out from Beersheba, i.e., the Hebron oath well.</i> Ergo (in Hosea 12:13 [12]): <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>.
Resh Laqish said: The Holy One performed miracles with him at the time that he saw the dream. What is written (in Gen. 28:13)? <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To protect him from the heat of the sun. Cf. <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34, which explains that the rest of the verse reads: <small>THE EARTH UPON WHICH YOU LIE &lt; I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR SEED &gt;</small> . Thus the Holy One folds it up (i.e., folds up the land of Israel) under his head. Similarly, <i>Hul.</i> 91b; Gen. R. 69:4; Rashi, s.v.</i>
(Gen. 28:17:) <small>SO HE WAS AFRAID AND SAID: HOW AWESOME IS THIS PLACE! THIS</small> is nothing but the Holy Temple, as stated (in Ps. 78:54): <small>THEN HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE BORDER OF HIS SANCTUARY, THIS MOUNTAIN THAT HIS RIGHT HAND HAD PROCURED</small>. Moreover, <small>AWESOME</small> can only refer to the Holy Temple. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 68:36 [35]): <small>O GOD, YOU ARE AWESOME IN YOUR SANCTUARIES</small>. He (Jacob) saw it destroyed, as stated (in Gen. 28:17): <small>THIS IS NOTHING. (Ibid., cont.:) BUT THE HOUSE OF GOD</small>, since he saw it &lt; re &gt;built. All the prophets also saw it built, destroyed, and &lt; re &gt; built. The Holy One simply said: You have seen it destroyed in this world, but in the world to come I am &lt; re &gt; building it myself. Then in my glory I am returning within it with you watching. Thus it is stated (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF THE LORD TO ZION</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash seems to picture Jacob’s dream ladder extending from the earthly Temple up eighteen miles to the heavenly temple.

(Gen. 29:31:) <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. {It is not said &lt; in the text &gt; "All who stand upright," but <small>ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. And does he also raise up the wicked?} R. Hiyya said: The behavior of the Holy One is not like the behavior of one who is flesh-and-blood. According to flesh-and-blood behavior, &lt; if &gt; one has a wealthy friend, he clings to him and pines for him; but, as soon as his power (literally: hand) declines and he becomes poor, he laughs at him. With the Holy One, however, things are not like that. As soon as he sees someone whose power is down, he gives him a hand and raises him up. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL</small>. It is not said &lt; in the text &gt; "All who stand," but <small>ALL WHO FALL</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. Would you say that he also raises up the wicked, if they come to a fall? No, for it is stated (in Ps. 36:13 [12]): <small>THERE THE EVILDOERS HAVE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN AND CANNOT RISE</small>. They have fallen; there is no standing for them. Why? Because it is stated (in Ps. 35:5): <small>&lt; THEY SHALL BE &gt; LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD OVERTHROWING THEM</small>. But those who are righteous (according to Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS</small>. As soon as the Holy One saw that Leah was hated, he said: How am I to make her dear to her husband? Just look, I am raising her up and giving her children first so that she will become loved by her husband. Therefore (according to Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. Now it also says (in I Chron. 2:18): <small>AND CALEB BEN HEZRON HAD CHILDREN BY AZUBAH, A WIFE, AND BY JERIOTH; AND THESE WERE HER SONS: JESHER, SHOBAB, AND ARDON</small>. R. Berekhyah said: She was his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical text actually states that Azubah and Jerioth were Caleb’s daughters, but Exod. R. 1:17 explains in the name of R. Johanan, “that in the case of anyone who takes a wife for the sake of heaven above (i.e., for no reason beyond producing children), he is recorded as having given birth to her.”</i> Then why was she called Azubah? Because she was abandoned (<i>azubah</i>) and ugly. The Holy One said: Look, I am giving her children so that she will become beautiful through them. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THESE WERE HER SONS: JESHER, SHOBAB, AND ARDON</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. &lt; She was hated &gt;, not because she was abhorrent to her husband, but because she had scolded him when Jacob had worked seven years for Rachel. Now his mother had said to him (in Gen. 27:44): <small>AND YOU ARE TO STAY WITH HIM (Laban) FOR A WHILE</small>, and he had stayed seven years. (Gen. 29:21, 23:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID UNTO LABAN: GIVE ME MY WIFE…. AND, WHEN IT WAS EVENING, HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER LEAH &lt; AND BROUGHT HER TO HIM &gt;. ALL NIGHT SHE PRETENDED TO BE RACHEL</small>. When he arose in the morning (according to Gen. 29:25), <small>THERE WAS LEAH</small>. He said to her: Daughter of a swindler, why did you trick me? She said to him: &lt; What about &gt; you! Why did you trick your father? When he said to you: Is this my son Esau, you said to him (in Gen. 27:19): <small>I AM ESAU YOUR FIRST-BORN</small>. Now you are saying: Why have you tricked me? And did your father not say &lt; to Esau &gt; (in Gen. 27:35): <small>YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT?</small> So because of these things with which she scolded him, he began to hate her. The Holy One said: There is no cure for this but sons. Then her husband will desire her. Thus (in Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED, HE OPENED HER WOMB</small>. David also gives praise (in Ps. 146:7): <small>THE ONE WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 71:2.</i>

Siman 12

Another interpretation: Why was Leah hated? Not because she was more ugly than Rachel. In fact she was as beautiful as Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:16). <small>LABAN HAD TWO (<i>ShTY</i>) DAUGHTERS</small>. They were equal (<i>ShWWT</i>) in beauty, in loveliness, and in stature. Why does &lt; Scripture &gt; say (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 7:20; <i>BB</i> 123a; Gen. R. 70:16; 71:2.</i> Simply &lt; this &gt; : When Rebekah bore Esau and Isaac, there were born to Laban two daughters, Leah and Rachel. They sent letters to each other and agreed among themselves that Esau would take Leah; and Jacob, Rachel. Now Leah would ask about the conduct of Esau and would hear that his conduct was bad. So she would cry all the time &lt; and &gt; say: Thus my lot has fallen to this wicked man. And for this reason her eyes became weak, as stated (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK</small>.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT RACHEL HAD A LOVELY FORM AND WAS LOVELY TO LOOK AT</small>. Why? Because it is stated (in Prov. 15:30): <small>GOOD NEWS PUTS FAT ON THE BONES</small>. He (Esau) took no action. Rather (in Gen. 28:9): <small>ESAU WENT TO ISHMAEL AND TOOK MAHALATH BAT ISHMAEL &lt; BEN ABRAHAM, THE SISTER OF NEBAIOTH, FOR A WIFE &gt;</small>. Jacob said: Because of the blessings he wanted to kill me; so when I take his wife Leah, who knows if he will leave Mahalath bat Ishmael, come against me, and say: Was it not enough for you to take my birthright and my blessing, that you have taken my betrothed as well! He therefore said to Laban (in Gen. 29:18): <small>I SHALL SERVE YOU SEVEN YEARS FOR &lt; YOUR YOUNGER DAUGHTER &gt; RACHEL</small>. Apart from such a situation, would a man taking a wife leave the older and take the younger?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since daughters inherit in the absence of sons (Numb. 27:8), the elder daughter would receive the double inheritance of the first-born. See Deut. 21:15-17.</i> Rather &lt; the story is &gt; to teach you that, since Leah was sitting around because of Esau, Jacob said to Laban (ibid.): <small>I SHALL SERVE YOU SEVEN YEARS FOR &lt; YOUR YOUNGER DAUGHTER &gt; RACHEL</small>. Now, when Laban saw that, he said: See here, I am giving away the elder immediately. (Gen. 29:23:) <small>AND, WHEN IT WAS EVENING, HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER LEAH &lt; AND BROUGHT HER TO HIM &gt;</small>. Jacob said to him: Now were these the terms?<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 70:17.</i> (Gen. 29:25, 26, 28:) <small>DID I NOT SERVE WITH YOU FOR RACHEL? THEN LABAN SAID: IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM IN OUR PLACE…. SO JACOB DID THUS, &lt; AND COMPLETED THE BRIDAL WEEK OF THIS DAUGHTER; THEN LABAN GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER RACHEL FOR A WIFE &gt;</small>. He began to love her more than Leah. The Holy One said: Look, I am giving Leah children so that she may be more beloved than Rachel. (Gen. 29:31:) <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED, HE OPENED HER WOMB</small>.

(Deut. 21:16:) <small>THEN, ON THE DAY THAT HE WILLS &lt; HIS PROPERTY &gt; TO HIS SONS AS AN INHERITANCE</small>.

When Moses would come, about whom it is written (in Exod. 19:3): <small>THEN MOSES WENT UP TO GOD</small>, he would redeem him. As Moses stood &lt; there &gt;, he sought mercy for him. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:6): <small>LET REUBEN LIVE</small>. The Holy One said (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LET HIM NOT DIE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 12:8): <small>MY HERITAGE HAS BECOME FOR ME LIKE A LION IN THE FOREST … [THEREFORE I HAVE HATED IT (literally: HER)]</small>. How so? The Holy One saw that wicked children were going to issue from her; so he called her <small>HATED</small>. Now the wicked ones are these: Jehoram, Jehoash, Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, Jehoiakim, &lt; and &gt; Zedekiah. About Jehoram, it is written (in II Kings 8:18): <small>AND HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE</small>. About Ahaz, it is written (in II Kings 16:2): <small>AND HE DID NOT DO WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD [HIS GOD] AS HIS ANCESTOR DAVID &lt; HAD DONE &gt;</small>. Isaiah had said to him (according to Is. 7:11): <small>ASK A SIGN FROM THE LORD YOUR GOD. MAKE IT AS DEEP AS SHEOL</small>, for the dead to live again or for Korah to rise from Sheol. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR AS HIGH AS ABOVE</small>. You may ask for Elijah to descend from the heavens. He said to him: I know that he has power to do &lt; such things &gt;, but I do not want the name of names to be sanctified at my hands. Thus it is stated (in vs. 12): <small>I WILL NOT ASK, NOR PUT THE LORD TO THE TEST</small>. About Jehoash, it is written (in II Kings 12:3 [3]): <small>AND JEHOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS AS THE PRIEST JEHOIADA INSTRUCTED HIM</small>. But when Jehoiada died, evil occurred, as stated (in II Chron. 24:17): <small>NOW {IT CAME TO PASS} AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA, &lt; THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING. THEN THE KING HEARKENED UNTO THEM &gt;</small>….

Hence Rachel is the chief (rt.: '<i>QR</i>) of the house, since it is stated (in Gen. 29:31): but <small>RACHEL WAS BARREN (rt.: '<i>QR</i>)</small>. R.

Now, &lt; what &gt; if the &lt; other &gt; tribes go to court with Esau and say to him: Why did you persecute your brother? Then he says to them: [Why] did you persecute your brother Joseph? So they have no more advantage than he. But when he comes to Joseph, &lt; Joseph &gt; says to him: Why did you persecute your brother; and he is unable to give him an answer. And, if you should say that he did evil to you, &lt; he can &gt; also &lt; say &gt;: My brothers awarded me evil, while I awarded them good.

This refers to Esau, of whom it is stated (in Obad. 18): <small>AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW</small>. (Is. 47:14, cont.:) <small>FIRE CONSUMES THEM</small>.

Now, if leather is not sewn to it, when one comes to wipe [on the Sabbath], the water enters. Then {it would absorb} [he would press down], the water would flow out, and he would be found squeezing on the Sabbath. Ergo (ibid.): <small>IF IT HAS A LEATHER HANDLE, ONE MAY WIPE WITH IT; [BUT, IF NOT, ONE MAY NOT WIPE WITH IT]</small>, lest he squeeze and the water flows out. Come and see the works of the Holy One, that they are unlike the work of flesh and blood. In the case of flesh and blood, when one squeezes (rt.: '<i>TsR</i>) on a sponge, the water flows down; &lt; if &gt; one opens his hand, the water does not flow down.

Even though they were with him, they would only pray for David. And what did they pray? May it be your will, O Lord God, that we fall by David's hand and not that David fall by our hand! It is therefore stated (by David in Ps. 55:19): <small>FOR THOSE WITH ME ARE MANY</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 55:19 [18]): <small>HE HAS DELIVERED MY LIFE IN SAFETY</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; speaks about Rachel.

R. 71:7.</i> Jacob said to Rachel: Am I the viceroy<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>antikaisar</i>.</i> of the Holy One? (Gen. 30:2, cont.:) <small>AM I TAKING GOD'S PLACE</small>? The Holy One said to him: By your life, in the words you have uttered, <small>AM I TAKING GOD'S PLACE</small>? In these very words her son is &lt; going to &gt; rise up and say to your children (in Gen. 50:19): <small>AM I TAKING GOD'S PLACE</small>? She said to him: Did your father, Isaac, do this to your mother, Rebekah? Did not the two of them stand and pray for each other? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:21): <small>THEN ISAAC ENTREATED THE LORD ON BEHALF OF HIS WIFE</small>. You also should pray unto the <small>LORD</small> for me! And did not your grandfather Abraham do so for Sarah? He said to her: Sarah brought a rival wife into her house. She said to him (in Gen. 30:3): If so, <small>HERE IS MY MAID BILHAH; GO IN TO HER</small>. He did not do so; but, when she had &lt; actually &gt; given him her bondmaid, she immediately (in vs. 5) conceived and gave birth. (Gen. 30:6:) <small>THEN RACHEL SAID: GOD HAS JUDGED ME</small>. He has judged me and found me guilty; he has judged me and found me innocent. He has judged me and found me guilty by not giving me a son; he has judged me and found me innocent by giving my bondmaid a son. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME DAN</small> (i.e., he has judged). Then she conceived and gave birth to Naphtali, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 8) <small>RACHEL SAID: WITH SUPERNATURAL WRESTLINGS (<i>naphtule</i>) I HAVE WRESTLED (<i>niphtalti</i>) &lt; WITH MY SISTER &gt;</small>. {&lt; Naphtali &gt; should be interpreted as &lt; the Greek word &gt; <i>nymphe</i>, since in the Mediterranean cities they call a bride a <i>nymphe</i>.} <i>Naphtulai</i> &lt; means in translation &gt; that the wedding canopy was mine. Now on each Wednesday<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Wednesdays were generally considered unlucky, especially for sick children. See <i>yTa‘an</i>. 4:4 (68b) (bar.); <i>Ta‘an</i>. 27b (bar.); <i>Soferim</i> 17:5.

(Gen. 30:8:) <small>&lt; AND RACHEL SAID: WITH SUPERNATURAL WRESTLINGS (<i>naphtule</i>) I HAVE WRESTLED (<i>niphtalti</i>) &gt; WITH MY SISTER; {AND} I HAVE ALSO PREVAILED. SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME NAPHTALI</small>. Why Naphtali (<i>NPTLY</i>)? Because from their border they put a crown on the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is to the fact that the borders of Naphtali contain Tiberias, a city which for hundreds of years represented the center of Jewish learning in Israel.</i> about which it is written (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS (<i>NPT</i>) OF THE COMB</small>. When Leah saw that she had borne six, she said: The Holy One has made this agreement with Jacob, to raise up twelve tribes. Now here I have borne six sons; and the two bondmaids, four. That makes ten. Then Leah conceived &lt; again &gt;. Our masters have said: She conceived a male.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber.</i> 60a; Gen.

She began to pray for mercy upon her sister Rachel. She said to let whatever should be within her<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Probably a misreading for “my” in accordance with the direct discourse of the Hebrew text, which reads literally, “She said: Let whatever is within her belly….”</i> belly become female, and let not my sister Rachel be prevented from giving birth to a son. The Holy One said to her: By your life, you have had mercy upon you sister. See, I am making that which is within your belly female, and &lt; I &gt; am remembering her in this regard. (Gen. 30:21:) <small>THEN AFTERWARDS SHE BORE A DAUGHTER AND CALLED HER NAME DINAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>DINAH (<i>DYNH</i>)</small>? That she argued (<i>DYNH</i>) against giving birth to a son on condition that Rachel bear a son; for thus it is written below (in Gen. 30:22-23): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL…. SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE &lt; A SON &gt;</small>? &lt; The verse &gt; likens her giving birth to her conception. Just as her conception was painless, so was her giving birth painless. (Gen. 30:23, cont.:) <small>THEN SHE SAID: GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HAS TAKEN AWAY</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 73:5.</i> Simply that before a wife gives birth there is shame found within her house. How? When she breaks a vessel in her house, whom does she have to blame? When she gives birth, she blames her child. She therefore said: <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>.

Siman 20

Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:23): <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY &lt; MY SHAME &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 7:12, and the note there.</i> In the hour that Rebekah gave birth to Jacob and Esau, two daughters were born to Laban. They sent letters to each other, saying: You have given birth to two daughters; and I, to two sons. Let us give them to each other. When Leah heard about Esau's conduct, she would cry; but, when Rachel heard about Jacob's conduct she would be happy. [Where is it shown that Leah cried? Where it is stated] (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK</small>. The interpreter of R. Jose interpreted &lt; the verse as follows &gt; :<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 70:16.</i> What is the meaning of <small>WEAK</small>? Bleary {i.e., circular}.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Leah had dark circles under her eyes.</i> R. Johanan said to him: You did not interpret well. Then what is the meaning of <small>WEAK</small> (<i>rakkot</i>)? Long (<i>arukkot</i>), because all that the Holy One gave her (through her children) was long &lt; -lasting &gt; : high priesthood, kingship, and anointing oil. Then, when Leah gave birth for Jacob, Rachel was depressed, saying: Perhaps Esau will take her,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The text should probably be emended from “her” to “me” in agreement with Rashi’s interpretation of Gen. 30:22. According to Rashi, Rachel feared that Esau might take her if Jacob divorced her for being childless.</i> since I have not given birth to a child. But when she had given birth to Joseph, she said (in Gen. 30:23): <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>. Now there is no shame but foreskin, as stated (concerning foreskin in Gen. 34:14): <small>FOR THAT IS SHAME TO US</small>. (Gen. 30:24:) <small>SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME JOSEPH (<i>Yosef</i>), SAYING: MAY THE LORD ADD (<i>yosef</i>) ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. The Holy Spirit foresaw &lt; here &gt; that she would only bear one other son.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (<i>yosef</i>) [ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. Resh Laqish said:] The addition of the Holy One is greater than the original &lt; gift &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 5:10; see Gen. R. 61:4.</i> From whom do you learn this? From Hezekiah, whose reign was fourteen years; but, when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. Thus it is stated (in II Kings 20:6): <small>AND I WILL ADD FIFTEEN YEARS TO YOUR LIFE</small>. Ergo, the addition is greater than the original. And so you find in the case of Benjamin, when his mother said to him (in Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (<i>yosef</i>) ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>, the Holy One also added for her ten tribes from him and two tribes from Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the addition (Benjamin) was five times greater than the original (Joseph). Gen. R. 61:4 cites the list of Benjamin’s ten sons in Gen. 46:21.</i> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One raised up twelve tribes from Rachel, ten from Benjamin and two from Joseph. And where is it shown that &lt; the ten &gt; were sons of Benjamin? Where it is written (in I Sam. 9:21): <small>THEN SAUL ANSWERED AND SAID: AM I NOT A BENJAMINITE, FROM THE SMALLEST OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, [AND MY CLAN THE SMALLEST OF THE CLANS OF THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN]</small>? And another verse says (in Jud. 20:12): <small>AND {SAUL} [THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL] SENT [PEOPLE] AMONG ALL THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN, SAYING</small>. When the prophets saw that the addition was greater than the original, they began to bless Israel with the addition (rt.: <i>YSP</i>). Moses our Master said (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS ADD (rt.: <i>YSP</i>) TO YOUR NUMBERS &lt; A THOUSAND TIMES &gt; MORE THAN YOU ARE</small>. David also said (in Ps. 115:14): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (rt.: <i>YSP</i>) TO YOUR NUMBERS, YOURS AND YOUR CHILDREN'S ALSO</small>. In the world to come as well the Holy One will gather the exiles of Israel by means of this word (with the Hebrew root <i>YSP</i>). Thus it is stated (in Is. 11:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: <i>YSP</i>) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE</small>.

Siman 21

(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>. Let our master instruct us: In the case of an Israelite courtyard with star-worshiping foreigners dwelling within it, is it right that its eruv is a &lt; legitimate &gt; eruv? Thus have our masters taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eruv.</i> 6:1; <i>Eruv.</i> 61b-62a.</i> In the case of an Israelite courtyard with star-worshipping foreigners dwelling within it, it is forbidden for an Israelite to use anything within it until he has acquired a right &lt; to the property &gt; from the star-worshipping foreigner.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi on <i>Eruv.</i> 6:1 (61b), one must rent the idolater’s property for the eruv to be valid.</i> Why? Because it is written (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED &lt; I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU &gt;</small>. The Holy One will not assign his name in the midst of those who serve idols. Rather (according to Lev. 20:32): <small>THAT I MAY BE SANCTIFIED IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Thus, you are not to associate with the wicked ones because the Holy One will not assign his name in their midst. You know yourself that it is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 7:10.</i> R. Eleazar ben Padat said in the name of R. Jose ben {Qisma} [Zimra]: During the whole time that Lot was attached to Abraham, you never find a divine oracle being conferred upon Abraham. As soon as Lot was separated from him (in Gen. 13:11-13), the divine word was conferred upon him, as stated (in Gen. 13:14). <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM AFTER LOT HAD DEPARTED FROM HIM</small>. And so you find that, when Jacob went away to Mesopotamia to go to Laban, he spent twenty years at his place; but all the time that Jacob was in Laban's house, the Holy One did not speak with him. Then Jacob did some pondering and said: So the Holy One has forsaken me! Not so. The Holy One said to me (in Gen. 28:15): <small>AND SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. The Holy One knew what he pondered in his heart. The Holy One said to him: Do you want me to be with you? Separate yourself from Laban the Wicked, and I will be with you. Where is it shown? Where they read on the matter (in Gen. 31:3): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: &lt; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU &gt;</small>.

[(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: &lt; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN &gt;, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>.] It is written (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>. [R. Tanhuma b. R. Jose said: Come and see what the Holy One is saying to Israel (in Lev. 19:28): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MAKE A GASH IN YOUR FLESH FOR THE DEAD</small> &lt; … &gt;. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I AM THE LORD</small>. He is sure to pay you a reward. Is there a palate (i.e., a saying) sweeter than this! Someone may say to his friend: If you deform (rt.: <i>NWL</i>) yourself, I will give you a reward; but the Holy One has said: If you do not degrade yourselves, <small>AND</small> (ibid.) <small>&lt; NOT MAKE &gt; A GASH &lt; IN YOUR FLESH &gt; FOR THE DEAD</small>…. I will give you a reward. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.]
Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>. R. Abbahu said: See what is written (in Lev. 20:26): <small>SO I HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE &lt; OTHER &gt; PEOPLES &lt; TO BE MINE &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 5:5.</i> See the attributes of the Holy One. If it had been written, "So I have set the &lt; other &gt; peoples apart from you," there would have been no hope for a star-worshipping gentile, and no proselyte would have become a Jew. How so? &lt; Consider the case of &gt; someone who has figs. If he picks out the bad from the good, in the end he will not return to the bad ones; but, if he picks out the good ones, if he wants to pick out some of the bad, he picks them out. Therefore, the Holy One has said (in Lev. 20:26): <small>SO I HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE &lt; OTHER &gt; PEOPLES</small>. He has given a hint to those gentiles who wish to become Jews. Is there a palate (i.e., a saying) more beautiful than this? Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.] R. Aha said:<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 10:9.</i> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, when he gives a <i>donativa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In classical Latin the word is <i>donativum</i> in the singular and refers to a gift by the emperor to each soldier.</i> {i.e., a valuable gift}, he does not give a <i>stativa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word means “stationary camp.”</i> {i.e., a good rest}; and, when he gives a <i>stativa</i>, he does not give a <i>donativa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that an emperor only bribes a soldier with a <i>donativa</i> before going into battle or at the start of a march.</i> But the Holy One gives a <i>stativa</i> and gives a <i>donativa</i>. He has given the Sabbath rest, and he has given a double portion of bread. What is written (in Exod. 16:29)? <small>OBSERVE THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH; [HE THEREFORE GIVES YOU BREAD FOR TWO DAYS ON THE SIXTH DAY]</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.
R. Johanan said: The Holy One said (in Lev. 19:3): <small>AND YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. I AM THE LORD &lt; YOUR GOD &gt;</small>. I am sure to give a reward. And with what do you keep it? With food, drink, and clean clothing. Then I give you a reward. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.
R. Levi said: Look at the word which the Holy One gave to the children of Adam. What is written (in Ezek. 18:21): <small>MOREOVER, WHEN THE WICKED ONE REPENTS &lt; OF ALL THE SINS THAT HE HAS COMMITTED, KEEPS ALL MY STATUTES, AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT, HE SHALL LIVE &gt;</small>. The Holy One said (in vs. 22): <small>ALL HIS TRANSGRESSIONS WHICH HE HAS COMMITTED SHALL NOT BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM. {ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUS ACTS} [BY HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS] WHICH HE HAS PRACTICED, {HE HAS LIVED} HE SHALL LIVE {AND NOT DIE</small>}. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.
Resh Laqish said: Could you hear of anything greater than this? What is written (in Ezek. 33:19)? <small>AND WHEN A WICKED PERSON TURNS BACK FROM HIS WICKEDNESS [AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT, ON ACCOUNT OF THESE THINGS HE SHALL LIVE]</small>. "And he shall live" is not written here, but <small>ON ACCOUNT OF THESE THINGS HE SHALL LIVE</small>. &lt; It is &gt; because the Holy One makes them &lt; to be &gt; merit for him &lt; that &gt; he shall live by means of them. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.
Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>: If a king of flesh and blood has a friend, he loves him. So, if that friend becomes ill,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>HLH</i>, a word that can also be pointed to mean “sweeten.”</i> he sends away to inquire after his health. Then, if he loves him even more, he goes to visit him. &lt; But &gt; if he went out into lodgings,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>xenia</i>.</i> is it thinkable that the king would go out with him? However, &lt; it was &gt; the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, &lt; who &gt; loved Jacob, as stated (in Mal. 1:2): <small>YET I HAVE LOVED JACOB</small>. When Deborah<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of <small>DEBORAH</small> (Rebekah’s nurse) <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Cant., 991, reads, “Rebekah” here.</i> died (in Gen. 35:8), &lt; the Holy One &gt; came to visit him; and, when he went out into lodgings, he was with him. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:15): <small>AND SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. When he returned, he was with him, as stated (in Gen. 31:3): <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB: &lt; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN &gt;, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>.

(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB….</small> This text is related (to Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD; I SAID: YOU ARE MY REFUGE, MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Who uttered this verse? David uttered it. <small>MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>: He calls the land of Israel <small>THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Why? Resh Laqish said in the name of R. Eleazar haQappar: Because the dead in the land of Israel are the first to come alive in the days of the Messiah. For this reason he calls it <small>THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 12:6; <i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 12:3; <i>yKil.</i> 9:4 (32c); <i>yKet</i>. 12:3 (12:4)(35b); <i>Ket.</i> 111a; Gen. R. 74:1; 96:5 (7); <i>PR</i> 1:4, 6; cf. also Zech. 14:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Revelation 20:4-5.</i> David said: I yearn to dwell within it, but Saul does not allow me.

Therefore (in Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD</small>; and, because I did so, I became king over Israel.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; speaks about Jacob. When he set out from his father's house, what does it say (in Gen. 28:20)? <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>…. He raised his eyes to the Holy One &lt; and &gt; said (in Ps. 142:6 [5], cont.): <small>YOU ARE MY REFUGE</small>. He said to him (in Gen. 28:15): <small>SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>…. (Ps. 124:6 [5], cont.:) <small>MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Now Jacob was hoping to return to the land of Israel. Jacob said: With permission I went out. If I do not get permission, I am not returning. The Holy One said: Do you want permission? Permission you have. (Gen. 31:3, cont.:) <small>RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR PARENTS</small>. Did you come for anything but the tribes? See, you have them.
Another interpretation: Did you only come for Rachel? See, you have {the right to} Rachel.
Another interpretation. Were you only waiting until Esau's adversary (<i>Satan</i>) was born?<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 73:7, which implies that the adversary was Joseph.</i> See, he has been born.

What is written above about the matter (in Gen. 30:25)? <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN RACHEL HAB BORNE JOSEPH, THAT JACOB SAID UNTO LABAN: SEND ME AWAY &lt; THAT I MAY GO TO MY OWN HOME AND MY LAND &gt;</small>. But, if you do not want to send me away, I am going without your permission. Laban said to him: With none of the sons that you sired except Joseph, have you said to me: <small>SEND ME AWAY</small>! He told him that he would bring Esau the Wicked to account. Ergo (in Gen. 30:25): <small>SEND ME AWAY THAT I MAY GO &lt; TO MY OWN HOME AND MY LAND &gt;</small>. (Gen. 30:27:) <small>BUT LABAN SAID UNTO HIM…. I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION &lt; THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE &gt;</small>. On that very day at Jacob's feet he had found a treasure<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr.</i> 34 adds: “i.e., a precious stone.”</i> which would bring luck. He therefore says (in Gen. 30:27): <small>I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION</small>. R. Berekhyah said: Laban had learned by divination, but Jacob did not know it. And what was he concerned about? (Gen. 30:27:) <small>THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE</small>. Laban said (in vs. 28): <small>NAME YOUR WAGES</small>. He said to him: You get the speckled &lt; of the flock &gt; and I get the mottled from whatever dams give birth. (Gen. 30:36:) <small>AND JACOB WAS PASTURING THE FLOCK OF LABAN THAT REMAINED</small>. What was it <small>THAT REMAINED (<i>HNWTRWT</i>)</small>? Resh Laqish said: The dams who were old, sterile, &lt; and &gt; sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This is the normal spelling of the Hebrew word, but the Masoretic Text spells it defectively as <i>HNWTRT</i>. Resh Laqish has deduced from the missing letter that the animals referred to were defective. See Gen. R. 73:9. By correcting the spelling, the Buber text has obscured the point.</i> What is written (in vs. 37)? <small>THEN JACOB TOOK A &lt; FRESH &gt; SHOOT OF WHITE POPLAR</small>. R. Hosha'ya said: He fashioned an image; and, just as he fashioned, so they gave birth. He only failed to give them breath. They gave birth and multiplied before him. Laban went back on his &lt; word &gt;. Where is it shown? Where Jacob said so (in Gen. 31:7): <small>AND HE CHANGED MY WAGES</small>…. What did Jacob do when he delayed over him?<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr.</i> 34 reads, “when he was obstinate with him.”</i> He sent after the children of his house, as stated (in Gen. 31:4): <small>SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH TO THE FIELD</small>. Why not within his house? R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said: For three things I like the children of the East:<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

<br>They do not bite off meat with their teeth but cut it with a knife.
<br>When one kisses his friend, he kisses him, not on his mouth, but on his hand.
<br>When one wants to get advice, he gets it, not in the house, but in the field (to prevent eavesdropping).

It is therefore stated (in Gen. 31:4): <small>SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH TO THE FIELD</small>, to an open place.
(Gen. 31:5-8:) <small>AND HE SAID TO THEM: I SEE THAT YOUR FATHER'S MANNER &lt; TOWARDS ME IS NOT AS IT WAS BEFORE &gt;…. MOREOVER, YOU KNOW &lt; THAT I HAVE SERVED YOUR FATHER WITH ALL MY STRENGTH &gt;. YET YOUR FATHER HAS CHEATED ME…. IF HE SHOULD SAY THIS: &lt; THE SPECKLED SHALL BE YOUR WAGES &gt;</small>…. R. Berekhyah said: "If he said this" is not written here but, <small>IF HE SHOULD SAY THIS</small>. Now the angel (of vs. 11) had said to Jacob: If Laban should say this, by your life, I will do for you just as you want.
(Gen. 31:1:) <small>NOW HE HEARD THE THINGS THAT LABAN'S CHILDREN WERE SAYING: JACOB HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER</small>. What is the meaning of <small>JACOB HAS TAKEN</small>? R. Hosha'ya said that the ministering angels were shoulders for Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr.</i> 34 reads, “porters, i.e., &lt; ones &gt; carrying on the shoulder.”</i> (Ibid.:) <small>JACOB HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER, AND FROM WHAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER HE HAS ACQUIRED ALL THIS WEALTH (<i>kavod</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kavod</i> generally means “glory” but can denote wealth (e.g., here and in Nahum 2:10).

He had nothing but &lt; animals of the &gt; flock. Concerning what does it say: silver and gold? It is simply that the flocks of our father Jacob were different from the flocks of Laban. "And he had a lot of cattle" is not written here (in this context, i.e., in Gen. 30:43) but, <small>AND HE HAD LARGE (<i>RBWT</i>) FLOCKS</small>, in that they were fruitful and multiplying (<i>RBWT</i>). Moreover, the nations of the world had been coming to give Jacob silver and gold in order to acquire some of his flock. R.

PLUNDER GOLD! &lt; THERE IS NO END TO TREASURE, WEALTH (<i>kavod</i>) OUT OF EVERY PRECIOUS VESSEL</small> &gt;. So how many &lt; animals of the &gt; flock did he have? R.

(Gen. 32:4:) <small>THEN JACOB SENT ANGELS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew the same word may be translated either as “angels” or as “messengers.”</i> This text is related (to Ps. 91:11): <small>FOR HE WILL CHARGE HIS ANGELS TO PROTECT YOU IN ALL YOUR WAYS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 4:6.</i> When? When one is in the land of Israel, angels who are in the land of Israel protect him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">So below, 9:2.</i> And from whom do you learn this? From Jacob; for, when he desired to go abroad, what is written (in Gen. 28:12)? <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER…. AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON IT</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; should not have said &lt; this &gt; but "descending and ascending." After one descends, he ascends. Yet &lt; here &gt; it says: <small>ASCENDING AND DESCENDING</small>! It said to him: Those angels who had been protecting him in the land of Israel had ascended while others descended to protect him while abroad. He did not stay. So, when he came from Paddan-aram, those angels who had protected him in the land of Israel descended. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:3 [2]): <small>WHEN JACOB SAW THEM (i.e., the angels), HE SAID: &lt; THIS IS THE CAMP (<i>mahaneh</i>) OF GOD &gt;, AND CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE MAHANAIM (i.e., two camps)</small>. "<i>Mahaneh</i>" (i.e., "camp" in the singular) is not written here but <small>MAHANAIM</small>, &lt; a dual form which means &gt; "two camps," the former &lt; which had kept him when abroad &gt; and the latter &lt; to protect him in the land of Israel &gt;. What did Jacob do? When he wanted to send &lt; messengers &gt; to Esau, he took &lt; them &gt; from the one &lt; camp &gt; and from the other, and sent &lt; them &gt;, as stated (in vs. 4 [3]): <small>THEN JACOB SENT ANGELS</small>. And do not be surprised; for behold, the youngest of his house spoke with the angel. Who was this? This was Joseph; for, when he said to him (in Gen. 37:14): <small>PLEASE GO AND SEE &lt; HOW YOUR BROTHERS ARE FARING &gt;</small>…. &lt; Then &gt; what is written (in vs. 15): <small>THEN A MAN FOUND HIM</small>…. <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

What is the meaning of <small>DOTHAN (<i>DTYNH</i>)</small>? That he was the same angel who protects the religion (<i>DT</i>) of the Lord (<i>YH</i>). So neither be surprised about Jacob sending angels nor about Joseph. Yes, even Hagar had the angels speak with her. What is written (in Gen. 21:17)? <small>AND AN ANGEL OF {THE LORD} [GOD] CALLED UNTO HAGAR</small>. How many angels spoke with her? R.

(Job 4:2-3:) <small>IF ONE TRIES YOU IN SOMETHING, DO YOU FIND IT TOO MUCH? &lt; … &gt; HERE YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED MANY</small>. You would comfort all who were suffering. When a blind person came to you, you would say to him: The Holy One already knows what he is going to do. After all, he &lt; was the one who &gt; made that person blind. You also used to console him and say to him: If you had built a house and did not want to open windows, who would have protested your right? So the Holy One is going to be glorified in you, as stated (in Is. 35:5): <small>THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED</small>. When a deaf person would come to you, [you would comfort him and say to him:] If you want to make a juglet,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kothon</i>.</i> &lt; but &gt; did not want to make ears for it, who would protest your right? So the Holy One is going to be glorified in you, as stated (in ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE EARS OF THE DEAF SHALL BE OPENED</small>. To a lame person you would say (in ibid., vs. 6): <small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A DEER</small>. So you would comfort him. (According to Job 4:4:) <small>YOUR WORDS HAVE UPHELD THE STUMBLING</small>. But now that it affects you, you are dismayed! (Job. 4:5:) <small>BUT NOW THAT &lt; TROUBLE &gt; HAS COME UNTO YOU, YOU FIND IT TOO MUCH</small>…. (Job 4:6:) <small>IS NOT YOUR GODLY FEAR YOUR CONFIDENCE</small>? After all, you have said: I am a righteous person; so why does he punish me? Have you ever seen a righteous person perishing? (Job 4:7:) <small>PLEASE RECALL, WHAT INNOCENT ONE HAS PERISHED</small> … ? Because Noah was righteous, he was saved from his generation. Abraham was saved from the furnace; Isaac was saved from the knife; Jacob was saved from the angel; Moses was saved from Pharaoh's sword. (Job 4:7:) <small>PLEASE RECALL, WHAT INNOCENT ONE HAS PERISHED</small> … ? He delivered Israel from Egypt, but he destroyed the Egyptians (according to Job 4:8): <small>AS [I HAVE SEEN], THOSE WHO PLOW EVIL AND SOW TROUBLE, REAP IT</small>. So what happened to them (according to vs. 9)? <small>BY THE BREATH (<i>NShMT</i>) OF GOD THEY PERISH</small>. It is so stated (in Exod. 15:10): <small>YOU BLEW (<i>NShMT</i>) WITH YOUR WIND, AND THE SEA COVERED THEM</small>. Also &lt; with reference to &gt; all the wicked who are going to arise, (according to Job 4:10) &lt; there is &gt; <small>A LION'S ROAR AND A FIERCE LION'S VOICE</small>. Job said to him (to Eliphaz): Please look at your father, Esau. He said to him: I am not concerned with him. (According to Ezek. 18:20): <small>{THE} [A] SON SHALL NOT BEAR THE FATHER'S GUILT</small>…. (Job 4:11:) <small>THE STRONG LION PERISHES FOR LACK OF PREY</small>. This &lt; strong lion &gt; is Esau in that he perishes for lack of &lt; good &gt; works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE OFFSPRING OF THE LIONESS ARE SCATTERED</small>. These &lt; offspring &gt; are his chieftains. Job said to him: Now in your case, what do you have for yourself? (Job 4:12:) <small>NOW A WORD WAS SECRETLY BROUGHT UNTO ME</small>. I am a prophet. My only concern with him is to rebuke you (according to vs. 13) <small>IN OPINIONS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word here is a homonym of the reading in Masoretic Text, which denotes <small>THOUGHTS</small>.</i> <small>FROM NIGHT VISIONS</small>. The Holy One said [to Eliphaz]: You have rebuked my servant Job through a vision. I am raising up a prophet from you who will exact punishment from your father's house (the Edomites) through a vision. [It is so stated (in Obad., vs. 1): <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH</small>.] So R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: What did Obadiah see, since he only prophesied against Edom? The Holy One said: Esau grew up between two righteous people<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob and Rebekah. So <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 27:1 (133).</i> without learning from their works; but Obadiah dwelt between two wicked people<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ahab and Jezebel. So <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 27:1 (133); Rashi on <i>Sanh</i>. 39b. See also Jerome’s introduction to his commentary on Obadiah.</i> without learning from their works. Obadiah would come and exact punishment from Esau. Ergo (in Obad., vs. 1) <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH</small>. And what is written in his prophecy (in vs. 18)? <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE, AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME, AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW; THEY SHALL BURN IT AND CONSUME IT, AND THERE SHALL BE NO SURVIVOR TO THE HOUSE OF ESAU; FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN</small>.

(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE &lt; TO THE CITY OF SHECHEM &gt;</small>. Let our master instruct us: What is meant by "saying something (<i>DBR</i>) superfluous on the Sabbath"? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab</i>. 24:5): <small>VOWS MAY BE QUESTIONED</small> (with a view to annulment) <small>WHEN NECESSARY FOR THE SABBATH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the wording differs somewhat from modern editions of the Mishnah.</i> Ergo: Something (<i>DBR</i>) which is not necessary for the Sabbath is not &lt; to be &gt; questioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shab</i>. 157a.</i> And needless to say, it is forbidden to multiply &lt; superfluous &gt; things (<i>DBR</i>) on the Sabbath. R. Huna said: If someone is corrupted by a transgression, angels of destruction immediately denounce him. It is so stated (in Job 33:22): <small>HIS SOUL DRAWS NEAR TO THE GRAVE</small>. What should one do? Let him be engaged in &lt; the study of &gt; the Torah and be preserved. And, if he does not know how to recite &lt; oral tradition &gt;, let him read &lt; Scripture &gt;. And if he does not know how to read &lt; Scripture &gt;, let him take hold of the Torah and live, as stated (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&lt; WISDOM &gt; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. Thus, if one is not a Torah scholar, let him be one who takes hold of a Bible teacher and a Mishnah teacher so that they may instruct him in Torah. Then he will merit living, as stated (ibid.): <small>&lt; WISDOM &gt; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. But, if he is a Torah scholar, the Torah will heal him from every evil and from all suffering. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 15:4): <small>A HEALING TONGUE IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>…. This is the Torah. There is no one who would labor at the Torah as our ancestor Jacob &lt; did &gt;. It is just as you say (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. "Dwelling in a tent" is not written here but <small>DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. He would go out from the academy (<i>bet midrash</i>) of Shem and enter the academy of Eber. Then &lt; he would go &gt; from the academy of Eber to the academy of Abraham. Therefore, when he had wrestled with the angel &lt; and when &gt; he was limping on his thigh, as stated (in Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE UPON HIM … AND HE WAS LIMPING ON HIS THIGH</small>, the Holy One immediately appeared to him, healed him, and brought him whole to the city of Shechem. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 33:18): <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE &lt; TO THE CITY OF SHECHEM &gt;</small>.

(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 121:8): <small>THE LORD WILL PRESERVE YOUR GOING FORTH AND YOUR COMING NOW AND FOREVER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 79:2.</i> <small>YOUR GOING FORTH</small>: (According to Gen. 28:10) <small>JACOB WENT FORTH. AND YOUR COMING</small>: (According to Gen. 33:18) <small>JACOB CAME</small>.
(Job 22:28:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. The Holy One has spoken to the righteous (<i>tsaddiq</i>) one: If you have done my will, I also will put your will ahead of my own. (Ibid.:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>…. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>? The Holy One has said to the righteous one: When I say something and you say something &lt; else &gt;, I abrogate mine, as it were, to make yours come to pass. Ergo: <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. When was the pronouncement? When &lt; Israel &gt; committed that act (i.e., of the golden calf). What did the Holy One do? He said to Moses (in Exod. 32:7): <small>GO AND GET DOWN, FOR YOUR PEOPLE &lt; WHOM YOU BROUGHT UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT &gt; HAVE ACTED BASELY</small>. What is written (in vs. 10)? <small>SO NOW LEAVE ME ALONE &lt; SO THAT MY ANGER MAY BURN AGAINST THEM &gt;</small>…. Moses immediately rose up in prayer and supplication, as stated (in vs. 11): <small>BUT MOSES IMPLORED &lt; THE LORD HIS GOD &gt;</small>…. (Deut. 9:26, 29:) <small>O LORD GOD, DO NOT DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE…. FOR THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE</small>…. The Holy One said to him: I cannot &lt; endure them &gt;. He said to him: Just as you have endured them from Egypt up to now, so endure them &lt; this time &gt;. (Numb. 14:19-20:) <small>PLEASE PARDON THE INIQUITY OF THIS PEOPLE &lt; ACCORDING TO YOUR GREAT STEADFAST LOVE, EVEN AS YOU HAVE PARDONED THIS PEOPLE FROM EGYPT UP TO NOW &gt;. THEN THE LORD SAID: I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>. Immediately (according to Exod. 32:14): <small>THE LORD REPENTED OF THE EVIL WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO DO TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. (Job 22:28:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. Jacob also vowed things before the Holy One. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 28:20-21): <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW, SAYING: &lt; IF GOD IS WITH ME, PROTECTS ME ON THIS WAY THAT I GO, AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON &gt;, AND IF I RETURN SAFELY UNTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE, &lt; THE LORD SHALL BE MY GOD &gt;</small>. He said to him: My father, Isaac, wanted to go abroad, but you did not permit him because he was a whole burnt offering. You appeared to him and said to him (in Gen. 26:2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. Now I am going away, not for my benefit, but &lt; from &gt; before my brother lest he kill me. I have received permission from you and from my father. Do not forsake me. (Gen. 28:20:) <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW, &lt; SAYING &gt;</small>:

<br>&lt; (Ibid.,cont.:) <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>. &gt; The Holy One said to him: You have testified concerning me that I have been with you, as stated (in Gen. 31:5): <small>BUT THE GOD OF MY FATHER HAS BEEN WITH ME</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>PROTECTS ME</small>. So I protected you from Laban.
<br>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT</small>. (Cf. Gen. 31:9:) <small>THUS GOD HAS SEIZED YOUR FATHER'S CATTLE AND GIVEN THEM TO ME</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small>. (Cf. Gen. 30:35:) <small>BUT ON THAT DAY HE REMOVED THE SPECKLED AND SPOTTED HE-GOATS</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND IF I RETURN SAFELY</small>…. (Cf. Gen. 33:18) <small>NOW JACOB CAME SAFELY</small>.

Ergo (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU; AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS</small>. &lt; The plural, <small>WAYS</small>, signifies &gt; two times. Thus the Holy One caused the sun to go down ahead of time when he wanted to go forth and when he wanted to speak with him. (Gen. 28:12:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>. What is written there (in vs. 13)? <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small> (on Jacob's ladder)….<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. R. 68:10, God caused the sun to set prematurely in order to speak with Jacob in privacy.</i> Also, when he came &lt; back &gt;, he made the sun rise for him ahead of time (according to Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE FOR HIM</small>. Now did the sun rise, not over the whole world, but over Jacob alone? &lt; It &gt; merely &lt; rose &gt; in order to heal him (from his lameness).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh.</i> 95b; Rashi on Gen. 32:32.</i> Thus it is stated (in Mal. 3:20 [4:2]): <small>BUT FOR YOU WHO FEAR MY NAME A SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL ARISE &lt; WITH HEALING IN ITS WINGS &gt;</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of (Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE FOR HIM</small>? That he made the sun rise for him [three hours] ahead of time just as it had set for him ahead of time. Jacob said: On five things did the Holy One make agreements with me (in Gen. 28:20-21) and carry them out. As for me, should I not on my part carry out what I said, now that I have returned &lt; safely unto my father's house &gt; (in accordance with Gen. 28:21)? Immediately (according to Gen. 33:20), <small>HE ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE AND CALLED IT EL, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>. When Israel endured (as a people), the Holy One said to Moses: Moses, the five things that I did with Jacob I have done for his children.

<br>(Gen. 28:20:) <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>. (Cf. Exod. 13:21:) <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>PROTECTS ME</small>. Thus I protected them from Pharaoh and his associates, and I overthrew Pharaoh and his whole army. So also with Amalek (in Exod. 17:13): <small>AND JOSHUA OVERTHREW AMALEK AND HIS PEOPLE</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT</small>. (Cf. Exod. 16:4:) <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small>. (Cf. Deut. 8:4:) <small>YOUR CLOTHING DID NOT WEAR OUT ON YOU</small>.
<br>(Gen. 28:21:) <small>AND IF I RETURN SAFELY</small>. (Cf. Exod. 18:23:) <small>ALL THIS PEOPLE SHALL ALSO COME TO ITS PLACE SAFELY</small>.

Then afterwards &lt; Jacob &gt; took his kingdom (i.e., the kingdom of the Holy One) upon himself, as stated (in Gen. 33:20): <small>HE ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE &lt; AND CALLED IT EL, THE GOD OF ISRAEL &gt;</small>. So also did &lt; the people &gt; take his kingdom upon themselves. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 20:2): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. What did they say &lt; in reply &gt; ? All of them answered with one accord; <small>AND</small> (according to Exod. 24:7) <small>THEY SAID: ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL DO AND OBEY</small>. Ergo (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>.

Siman 11

(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>. Did he lack something? Indeed, when they said to him (in Gen. 32:7 [6]): <small>MOREOVER HE (Esau) IS COMING TO MEET YOU, AND THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM</small>; he arose and prepared a gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron</i>.</i> (According to Gen. 32:15-16 [14-15]) he began by giving she-goats because they were tender. Afterwards &lt; according to the text, there were &gt; he-goats, ewes, rams, &lt; and &gt; <small>THIRTY MILCH CAMELS WITH THEIR COLTS</small>. [R. Levi said: If I went around among all the tents of Kedar (i.e., of the Ishmaelites) you would not have found <small>THIRTY MILCH CAMELS WITH THEIR COLTS</small>.] Look at Jacob's wealth! In addition (according to Gen. 32:16 [15]) he gave <small>FORTY COWS AND TEN BULLS</small>. R. Isaac said: &lt; These did &gt; not include precious stones and pearls. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:14 [13]): <small>THEN HE TOOK FROM WHAT WAS IN HAND</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; things taken up in the hand. These would be precious stones and pearls. R. Judah b. R. Shallum said: All twelve months that he spent with him, he would so honor him (with gifts) on each day. In this regard Jacob said (in Deut. 16:19): <small>FOR A GIFT BLINDS THE EYES OF THE (PRUDENT) [WISE]</small>. &lt; He reasoned &gt; a fortiori, how much the more &lt; would a gift blind &gt; the wicked! Just consider this: I am honoring him so that he will not touch me.
Another interpretation: He had thought and said: Possessions from outside the land have no blessing in them. He was therefore squandering them. R. Hosha'ya said: A certain old man said to me: &lt; I &gt; am telling you &lt; something in &gt; the form of midrash; so, whenever you expound it, tell it in my name.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 78:12.</i> Esau is going to restore to Jacob all that he received from Jacob. It is so stated (in Ps. 72:10): <small>THE KINGS OF TARSHISH AND OF THE ISLES SHALL RETURN TRIBUTE</small>. "Shall bring tribute" is not written here, but <small>SHALL RETURN TRIBUTE</small>. I told him: This is a good saying: I will expound it in your name. He said to him: Surely if, what he had knowingly given him and had pressed upon him, that which he did not wish to receive, even as stated (in Gen. 33:9): <small>THEN ESAU SAID: I HAVE ENOUGH</small>—&lt; Surely if &gt; he would return &lt; that &gt;, then how much the more would they (the children of Esau) do so in the case of things which they had taken from Israel by force. In that hour I thanked him.
Esau said: How long will I trouble my brother? He arose and went away, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES…. &lt; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB &gt;</small>. What did Jacob do? When his children and his flocks had crossed over into the land of Israel, he arose and sold all that he had brought with him from outside of the land. Then he made it into piles of gold. He said to Esau: You have a share with me in the cave of Machpelah. Now what do you want, to receive these piles of gold or to share &lt; the cave &gt; with me? Esau began by saying: What do I want with &lt; a share &gt; of this cave? This gold is what I want. Now where is it shown that Jacob sold all that he had brought from outside of the land and that Esau took it? Where Joseph said so (in Gen. 50:5): <small>MY FATHER HAD ME SWEAR, SAYING: SEE, I AM DYING. IN MY GRAVE WHICH I DUG &lt; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, THERE YOU SHALL BURY ME &gt;</small>. R. Huna b. R. Abbin the Priest said: When Jacob wanted to come to the land of Israel, what is written (in Gen. 31:18)? <small>AND HE DROVE ALL HIS LIVESTOCK &lt; AND ALL HIS GOODS THAT HE HAD ACQUIRED … IN PADDAN-ARAM &gt;</small>. Now, when he wanted to go down into Egypt, what is written (in Gen. 46:6)? <small>AND THEY TOOK ALONG THEIR LIVESTOCK AND ALL THEIR GOODS, WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>. Now, in regard to what he had brought from the land of Aram-Naharaim, where was that? You simply learn from here that Jacob had sold it and given it to Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">For an alternative explanation of the same tradition, see Gen. R. 100:5; Exod. R. 31:17; Rashi on Gen. 50:5.</i> Then would you say that something was lacking? The Holy One simply filled his loss and restored everything to him immediately, as stated (in Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>.

Siman 12

(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH'S DAUGHTER DINAH &lt; WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB &gt; WENT OUT</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is is legitimate for a woman to go out with her jewelry on the Sabbath into a public place?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 8:5.</i> Thus have our masters taught (according to <i>Shab</i>. 6:1): <small>A WOMAN SHALL NOT GO OUT</small> into a public place on the Sabbath with her jewelry, <small>NOR WITH A HAIR NET … NOR WITH A GOLDEN TIARA, NOR WITH A <i>CATELLA</i></small><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word denotes a small ornamental chain worn by women.</i> {i.e., a type of jewelry} &lt; … &gt; <small>NOR WITH A NEEDLE HAVING NO EYE. BUT, IF SHE SHOULD GO OUT, SHE IS NOT LIABLE FOR [A SIN OFFERING]</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; when she goes out &lt; of her rooms &gt; with them &lt; but remains &gt; within the house. Let her not, however, go out into a public place with a single piece of jewelry. Now, our masters say: Even on a weekday she must not go out into a public place. Why? Because people will stare at her. Thus the Holy One gave jewelry to a woman only for her to adorn herself with them inside of the house; for one does not give an opening<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., an occasion for transgression.</i> to the trustworthy person, let alone to the thief. And so Job has said (in Job 31:1): <small>I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH MY EYES. HOW THEN SHALL I GAZE ON A MAIDEN</small>? Come and see Job's righteousness. If in the case of a maiden, at whom any man has a right to look, perhaps to marry her or perhaps to marry her to his son or to one of his kin, Job did not look at her, how much the less in the case of someone's wife, at whom he has no right to look. It is therefore written (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING'S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>. So, if she acts to conceal herself and is worthy, (ibid., cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>. R. Levi said: She was worthy to raise up priests to put on the high priestly garments. Now there is no <small>BROCADE</small> except priestly garments. Thus it is stated (regarding Aaron's vestments in Exod. 28:13): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE GOLD BROCADE</small>. There is already an allusion in the Torah about this thing, that a woman should not go about a lot in a marketplace. Where? Where it is so written (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM, AND GOD SAID TO THEM: &lt; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY, FILL THE EARTH &gt; AND SUBDUE HER. [AND SUBDUE HER</small> is written &lt; here &gt;].<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 2:12; Gen. R. 8:12; cf. <i>Yev</i>. 65b.</i> The man subdues the woman, and the woman does not subdue the man. But, if she walks about a lot and goes out into the marketplace, she finally comes to a state of corruption, to a state of harlotry. And so you find in the case of Jacob's daughter Dinah. All the time that she was sitting at home, she was not corrupted by transgression; but, as soon as she went out into the marketplace, she caused herself to come to the point of corruption.

(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH'S DAUGHTER DINAH … WENT OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 11:12): <small>ONE WHO DESPISES HIS NEIGHBOR IS LACKING IN SENSE</small>. Whoever scorns his neighbor is called <small>LACKING IN SENSE</small>. But, if that same person who was despised was a person of knowledge and understanding, he would put his hand over his mouth and be silent. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>BUT A PERSON OF UNDERSTANDING WILL KEEP SILENT</small>. (Prov. 11:12:) <small>ONE WHO DESPISES HIS NEIGHBOR IS LACKING IN SENSE</small>. This is Hamor,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">A name which means “ass” in Hebrew.</i> the father of Shechem, who said (in Gen. 34:8): <small>THE SOUL OF MY SON, SHECHEM, LONGS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER</small>.

For what reason? On account of this corruption (in Gen. 34:1-2): <small>NOW LEAH'S DAUGHTER DINAH, &lt; WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB &gt; WENT OUT…. &lt; THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND, SAW HER.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW &lt; LEAH'S DAUGHTER &gt; DINAH … WENT OUT</small>. But &lt; had she gone out &gt; from sin? After all, Jacob had said (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>I AM UNWORTHY OF ALL THE KINDNESSES</small>. R. Aha said: &lt; The Holy One said &gt;: I have nourished your ancestors from their &lt; good &gt; deeds, but you say: <small>I AM UNWORTHY</small>! The Holy One said to him: Jacob, &lt; it is &gt; through your righteousness &lt; that &gt; I have done all these miracles of which you say that you are unworthy. But look, she is going out; yet your merit shall remain for you. (Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW &lt; LEAH'S DAUGHTER &gt; DINAH … WENT OUT</small>.

When he had escaped from Laban, Esau was incited against him. Immediately the angel appeared to him. He said to him: Are you not aware of all this trouble? Why has all the trouble come over you?

[(Gen. 35:9, 11:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN &lt; .. &gt; AND GOD SAID TO HIM:</small>] <small>&lt; I AM GOD ALMIGHTY &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Deut. 28:6): <small>BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN YOUR COMING; &lt; AND BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN YOUR GOING AWAY &gt;</small>. When Jacob went away from his father's house, he went away with a blessing, as stated (in Gen. 28:3): <small>MAY GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU</small>. Also, when he came from Paddan-Aram, he came with a blessing, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN &lt; … &gt; AND BLESSED HIM</small>. How did he bless him? R. Levi said: He blessed him with a benediction for mourners. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 35:8)? <small>THEN &lt; REBEKAH'S NURSE &gt; DEBORAH DIED &lt; AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE OAK BELOW BETHEL; AND ITS NAME WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK &gt;</small>. R.

[(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>.] This text is related (to Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. &lt; The passage &gt; speaks about Jacob. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>[AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS. UPON] two WAYS</small>. When he went away from his father's house, the Holy One revealed himself to him.

What is the meaning of AGAIN? R. Judah said: He said to him: Once <small>AGAIN</small> I am revealing myself to you. The Holy One revealed himself to him five times, which corresponds to the five blessings with which his father had blessed him; and they are as follows (according to Gen. 28:3f): <small>(1) &lt; MAY &gt; GOD ALMIGHTY &lt; BLESS YOU, (2) MAKE YOU FRUITFUL, AND (3) MULTIPLY YOU, (4) SO THAT YOU MAY BECOME A CONGREGATION OF PEOPLES &gt;; (5) AND MAY HE GRANT YOU THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</small>…. Here are five blessings. And &lt; God &gt; revealed himself to him:

<br>&lt; Once &gt; When he went away from his father's house, as stated (in Gen. 28:13): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small>.
<br>Once with Laban (in Gen. 31:3): <small>&lt; THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB &gt; : RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS</small>.

<br>And once (in Gen. 46:2,4): <small>THEN GOD SPOKE TO ISRAEL AND SAID…. I MYSELF WILL GO DOWN WITH YOU</small>….

Another interpretation (of Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AGAIN</small>? I am never <small>AGAIN</small> {causing my name to rest upon} [joining my name to] a human except &lt; to be called &gt; (as in Exod. 3:6) <small>THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB</small>.

(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>. What is written next (in vs. 11)? <small>AND GOD SAID TO HIM: I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</small>. You are an omen for your children. When I came to you, I came laden with blessings. So, when I come to your children, I will come laden with blessings, as stated (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED, I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN, &lt; WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDANARAM, AND BLESSED HIM &gt;</small>. And not to Jacob only &lt; did he do so &gt;, but also to our father Abraham. What is written (about Abraham in Gen. 18:1)? <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM … &lt; AS HE SAT &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 4:4; Gen.

Just as you sit while I stand; {according to what is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>} so also shall your children sit in synagogues and academies while I stand, as it were, according to what is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>. Here also (at Paddan-Aram in Gen. 35:9) the Holy One said to Jacob: You are an omen to your children. Just as in your case, when I came to you, I came laden with blessings; &lt; so &gt; also in the case of your children, when I reveal myself to them, I will be laden with blessings. As soon as the Tabernacle had been built, what is written (in Numb. 7:1, 4): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE, &lt; HAD ANOINTED IT AND SANCTIFIED IT…THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES &gt;</small>. Now, when work on it was finished, the Holy One said: I have made an agreement with them. When I reveal myself to them, I will be laden with blessings. What did the Holy One do? He blessed them and later revealed himself to them. What is written about the priestly blessing (in Numb. 6:24-26)? <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU; THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU; THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>. Then, later (in Numb. 7:1, 4): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE … &lt; THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES &gt;</small>.

(Gen. 35:11:) <small>AND GOD SAID &lt; TO HIM &gt;: I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY … [AND KINGS SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS]</small>. The sages have said: On the basis of this text Abner drew an interpretation, as a result of which he enthroned Saul's son Ishbosheth,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 82:4.</i> namely, that Benjamin was going to produce two kings, since &lt; God &gt; had said to him: <small>AND KINGS</small> (in the plural) <small>SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Abner’s argument was that, as a promise, the passage refers to the future and that the next event mentioned (in vss. 16-18) is the birth of Jacob’s last son, Benjamin.</i> Now until then only Saul had arisen (as a king out of Benjamin). He therefore enthroned Saul's son Ishbosheth. And not only that, but also in &lt; the incident of &gt; the concubine at Gibeah (Jud. 19-21), {&lt; the Israelites &gt; had readmitted him (i.e., Benjamin)}. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: &lt; They did so &gt; on the basis of this text. When they had opposed him, they had said (in Jud. 21:1): <small>NONE OF US SHALL GIVE HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE TO BENJAMIN</small>. Thus they had banished him, but they later repented and accepted him. They said: If he were not more exalted than the heavens, the Holy One would not have said to our father Jacob (in Gen. 35:11), when he came &lt; back &gt; to the land from abroad: <small>AND KINGS SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS</small>. Thus on the basis of this text they readmitted him.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 35:11): <small>I AM GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. Aquila translated (in his Greek version): <small>I AM TRUSTWORTHY TO REPAY TO EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Apart from this reference in the Buber <i>Tanhuma</i>, all other evidence indicates that Aquila regularly translated <small>GOD ALMIGHTY</small> (<i>El Shadday</i>) with the Greek words <i>ischyros</i> and <i>hikanos</i>, which mean “mighty” and “sufficient.” So Joseph Reider and Nigel Turner, <i>An Index to Aquila</i> (“Supplements to <i>Vetus Testamentum</i>,” 12; Leiden: Brill, 1966), s.v., <i>hikanos, ischyros, El</i>, and <i>Shadday</i>; so also Gen.

Just as the nations number seventy, so also shall your children be seventy &lt; like &gt; a Sanhedrin: It is so stated (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER FOR ME SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>.
Another interpretation: <small>A NATION EVEN AN ASSEMBLY OF NATIONS</small>. He brought him news that his children were going to be sacrificing to Asherah like the &lt; non-Jewish &gt; nations. When?

What is written (in I Kings 18:30)? <small>AND HE REPAIRED (<i>RP'</i>) THE BROKEN-DOWN ALTAR OF THE LORD</small>, in that he healed (<i>RP'</i>) them and brought them into the way of goodness when he did all those miracles for them. When they saw him, what did they say (according to I Kings 18:39)? <small>THE LORD ALONE IS GOD; THE LORD ALONE IS GOD</small>! In this world, because idolatry was common, they said: <small>THE LORD ALONE IS GOD; THE LORD ALONE IS GOD</small>; but in the world to come, when the Holy One reigns over us and over all Israel, they shall say (according to Zech. 14:9): <small>AND THE LORD SHALL BE A KING OVER ALL THE EARTH.

[(Gen. 37:1:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &lt; IN THE LAND &gt;</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 57:13): <small>WHEN YOU CRY OUT, LET YOUR ASSEMBLED ONES SAVE YOU</small>. What are they?

(Gen. 37:1-2:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &lt; IN THE LAND &gt;…. THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>. What is written on the matter above (in Gen. 36:15)? <small>THESE ARE THE LORDS OF THE CHILDREN OF ESAU</small>.

His master said to him: If a spark went out of this furnace, it would burn all of them.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>. &lt; The interpretation is &gt; that Jacob's face was like Joseph's.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">As Rashi informs us (ad loc.), the midrash needs to explain why Jacob’s generations are being ascribed to Joseph.

Where it says so (in Gen. 37:3): <small>NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH [MORE THAN ALL HIS SONS BECAUSE HE WAS THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE</small>. But look, Benjamin was younger than &lt; Joseph &gt;; yet it says: &lt; Joseph was &gt; <small>THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE</small>. It is simply that he had features<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eikonion</i>.</i> which resembled him. Ergo (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>]. Just as Jacob raised up tribes; so did Joseph raise up tribes. It is so stated (in Gen. 48:5): <small>EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH SHALL BE MINE LIKE REUBEN AND SIMEON</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>.
Another interpretation: Just as Jacob hid from his father for twenty-two years, so did Joseph hide from his father for twenty-two years. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">So Rashi with considerable explanation on Gen. 37:34.</i> R.

In the case of Moses, it is written (in Exod. 3:1): <small>HE WAS TENDING &lt; THE FLOCK OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHRO, THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN &gt;</small>…. He saw Israel before the bondage tightened its grip, he saw the bondage, and {they} [he] saw them when they had been redeemed. [Of Mordecai it is written] (in Esth. 2:5): <small>THERE WAS (literally: HE WAS) A CERTAIN JEW IN THE CITADEL OF SHUSHAN</small>. He saw them (Israel) before they were enslaved at the hand of Haman, he saw them under the edicts which had been decreed against them, and he saw them in their redemption. Of Job it is written (in Job 1:1): <small>THERE WAS (literally: HE WAS) A MAN IN THE LAND OF &lt; UZ &gt;</small>, and he saw three worlds. He was whole, he suffered afflictions, and he was healed.

All the things which happened to Jacob happened to Joseph. It is written in connection with Jacob (in Gen. 31:39): <small>SNATCHED BY DAY</small>. Also in the case of Joseph, it is written of him: <small>FOR I WAS SURELY SNATCHED</small>. Jacob had &lt; his brother &gt; Esau persecute him; and Joseph had his brothers persecute him.

(Gen. 37:2:) <small>AND JOSEPH BROUGHT BAD REPORTS OF THEM &lt; UNTO HIS FATHER &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BAD REPORTS</small>? That he had said something slanderous against his brothers. And what slanderous thing did he say against them? R. Judah said: He said against them that they would cut a limb from a living animal and eat it.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yPe’ah</i> 1:1 (15d-16a); Gen.

Then you shall invite them to eat with you, but they shall suspect you there in regard to the ritual slaughtering. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 43:32): <small>THEY SERVED HIM BY HIMSELF, &lt; AND THEM BY THEMSELVES &gt;</small>…. R. Me'ir says: He said to him: My brothers have set their eyes on Canaanite women. The Holy One said to him: You have said something slanderous against your brothers. Tomorrow, by your life, you are going down to Egypt. Then that woman (Potiphar's wife) shall say (in Gen. 39:17): <small>THE HEBREW SLAVE &lt; WHOM YOU BROUGHT TO US &gt; CAME UNTO ME &lt; TO FONDLE ME &gt;</small>.

(Gen. 37:4:) <small>BUT WHEN HIS BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER LOVED HIM MORE THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS, &lt; THEY HATED HIM SO THAT THEY COULD NOT SPEAK PEACEABLY (<i>shalom</i>) TO HIM &gt;</small>. When he came to ask how they were (<i>shalom</i>), they would not answer him. Why? Because it was his custom to ask how they were. You have the &lt; kind of &gt; person who, before coming to power, [asks people how they are. But, after coming to power], his spirit hardens over him, and he is no longer careful to ask the people of the city how they are. Joseph, however, was not like that. Although he had come to power (in Egypt), it was &lt; still &gt; his custom to ask his brothers how they were. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 43:27): <small>AND HE ASKED THEM HOW THEY WERE</small>. The Holy One said to him: Joseph, you began asking how your brothers were in this world; and they hated you. In the world to come, however, I am pardoning you, removing hate from between you, making you dwell in safety, and making peace between you. So also has David said (in Ps. 133:1): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS FOR BROTHERS TO DWELL TOGETHER</small>.

(Gen. 38:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH</small>. Let our master instruct us: If a ruin falls on the Sabbath, and it is not known whether Israelites are there or not, is it legitimate to clear away &lt; the rubble &gt; over them on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Yoma</i> 8:7): <small>IF A FALLING STRUCTURE FALLS ON SOMEONE [ON THE SABBATH], AND THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER HE IS THERE OR NOT THERE, DOUBT WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD, DOUBT WHETHER HE IS A FOREIGNER OR AN ISRAELITE, THEY SHALL CLEAR AWAY [THE RUBBLE] FOR HIS SAKE. IF THEY FIND HIM ALIVE, THEY SHALL CLEAR AWAY &lt; THE REST OF THE RUBBLE &gt; FOR HIS SAKE; BUT, IF HE IS DEAD, THEY SHALL LEAVE HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah text here (without Buber’s bracketed emendations) is that found in the <i>Yerushalmi</i>.</i> It is written concerning the Sabbath (in Exod. 31:14): <small>WHOEVER PROFANES IT (the Sabbath) SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>; yet our masters have taught: they shall clear away [the rubble] over one who is alive on the Sabbath. R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: If circumcision, which &lt; affects &gt; only one of two hundred and forty-eight &lt; human &gt; organs, overrides the Sabbath, how much the more would two hundred and forty-eight organs under stone override the Sabbath for someone?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shab</i>. 132a; <i>Yoma</i> 85b; <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Shabbata</i> 1.</i> R. Simeon ben Menasya says: Defile one Sabbath for him so that he may keep a lot of Sabbaths. So, if you clear away &lt; the rubble &gt; over someone to restore a single soul to life, I will also do for you what is written (in Ezek. 37:12): <small>&lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD &gt; BEHOLD, I WILL OPEN YOUR GRAVES &lt; AND RAISE YOU UP OUT FROM YOUR GRAVES, O MY PEOPLE, AND BRING YOU UNTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL &gt;</small>. A certain heretic (<i>min</i>) asked our Rabbi: Is it possible for the dead to live again? Your ancestors do not acknowledge &lt; the belief &gt;, yet you do acknowledge &lt; it &gt;! What is written about Jacob (in Gen. 37:35)? <small>THEN ALL HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS AROSE TO COMFORT HIM [BUT HE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED]</small>. If he had known that the dead would live &lt; again &gt;, would he have refused to be comforted and said (ibid., cont.): <small>NO I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING UNTO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>? Our Rabbi said to him: You are the biggest fool in the world. &lt; It was &gt; because our father Jacob knew through the Holy Spirit that Joseph was alive. For that reason he did not accept consolation over him. After all, one does not accept consolation over one who is alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 84:6; see <i>Soferim</i> 21 (43b).</i>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 37:35): <small>BUT HE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED</small>. It is simply that our father Jacob said: See, the tribal covenant has been broken! How I have toiled to raise up twelve tribes. Now I see that, since Joseph has gone, behold the very covenant has ceased. All the works of the Holy One correspond to twelve tribes: twelve constellations, twelve months, twelve hours in the day, twelve hours in the night, twelve stones which Aaron wore &lt; on his breastplate &gt;. But now Joseph has gone! Behold, the tribal covenant has been broken. But did Jacob not know how to take a wife and sire a son so that there would be twelve tribes? &lt; He did not do so &gt; simply because he had kept a vow to Laban, as stated (in Gen. 31:50): <small>IF YOU MISTREAT MY DAUGHTERS OR TAKE WIVES BESIDES MY DAUGHTERS</small>, even after their death &lt; …. &gt; What did Laban do? He brought him outside. He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>THOUGH NO ONE IS WITH US, SEE, GOD IS A WITNESS</small>…. Because of that vow, he was unable to take a wife. When his sons saw that he was complaining so and that he would not accept consolation, they went to Judah and said to him: You have made all this great misfortune for us! He said to them: I said to you (in Gen. 37:26): <small>WHAT PROFIT &lt; IS THERE IF WE KILL OUR BROTHER AND CONCEAL HIS BLOOD &gt;</small>? Now are you saying: What have you done? They said to him: But did we not hearken to you &lt; when &gt; you said (Gen. 37:27): <small>COME, AND LET US SELL HIM TO THE ISHMAELITES</small>? So we hearkened to you. If you had said: Come, and let us return him to his father, should we not have hearkened to you? In that hour, therefore, they arose and expelled him. How is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Gen. 38:1): <small>JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.

[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.] This text is related (to Mal. 2:11): <small>JUDAH HAS BEEN FAITHLESS, AND AN ABOMINATION HAS BEEN DONE IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

Judah had been deceitful. &lt; It is &gt; just as you say (in Mal. 2:14): <small>&lt; FOR THE LORD IS A WITNESS BETWEEN YOU (Judah) AND THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH &gt;, WITH WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHLESS</small>. Thus it says: Judah was deceitful. Over what was he deceitful? (Mal. 2:11, cont.:) <small>FOR JUDAH HAS PROFANED THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD</small>. See (ibid., cont.): <small>HE HAS MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A FOREIGN GOD</small>. Now it says elsewhere (in Ps. 114:2): <small>JUDAH WAS HIS SANCTUARY</small>, while it says here (in Mal. 2:11): <small>FOR JUDAH HAS PROFANED &lt; THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD &gt;</small>. See (ibid., cont.): <small>HE HAS MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A FOREIGN GOD</small>.

[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY &lt; FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE</small> &gt;.] This text is related (to Micah 1:15): <small>I WILL YET BRING TO YOU ONE WHO SHALL DISPOSSESS YOU, &lt; O INHABITANT OF MARESHAH; TO ADULLAM SHALL COME THE GLORY OF ISRAEL &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Gen. 37:35; see Gen.

Judah, the plural here shows that Jacob had more than one daughter.</i> <small>AROSE TO COMFORT HIM</small>. And how many daughters were there? They were simply their &lt; brothers' twelve &gt; twin sisters. &lt; A given brother's mother &gt; bore twins at his &lt; birth &gt;, and he would marry her.

Ergo (in Gen. 37:35): <small>THEN ALL HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS AROSE</small>…. Hence you learn that they married their sisters. But R. Nehemiah maintains: His daughters were his daughters-in-law. Since one's son-in-law is like his son, and his daughter-in-law, like a daughter, one does not refrain from calling his daughter-in-law his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

And the prophet proclaims (in Micah 1:15): <small>TO ADULLAM SHALL COME THE (HOLY ONE) [GLORY] OF ISRAEL</small>. Ergo (according to Gen. 38:1-2): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY &lt; FROM HIS BROTHERS &gt; AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE &lt; WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH.

Siman 11

[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS</small>. &lt; The matter &gt; is comparable to a king of flesh and blood when he sits down to judge someone. The judge says to him: Say whether you have killed or not killed. If he says to him: I killed, the judge kills him; but if he does not confess, he does not kill him. However, the Holy One is not like this. Over the one who confesses the Holy One has mercy, as stated (in Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &lt; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &gt; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. R. Simeon ben Halafta says: The Holy One said to Jerusalem: For what reason have I brought all these judgments upon you? Because you said: I have not sinned, as stated (in Jer. 2:35): <small>BEHOLD, I AM BRINGING YOU TO JUDGMENT FOR SAYING: I HAVE NOT SINNED</small>. However (according to Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &lt; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &gt; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. Ergo (in Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &lt; YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS &gt;</small>. R. Jose ben Qetsartah said: Flesh and blood makes a path on the mountain or in the valley. Could one possibly make &lt; a path &gt; in the waters? It is written of the Holy One, however, (in Ps. 77:20 [19]): <small>YOUR WAY WAS IN THE SEA, [AND YOUR PATH IN THE GREAT WATERS]</small>. He makes his way wherever he wants.
Another interpretation (of Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS</small>. When a king of flesh and blood is provoked with &lt; some &gt; humans, he expels them from the country. Could he possibly make a way in the sea to bring them down &lt; into it &gt; and drown them in its midst? [The Holy One, however, is not like that. Rather, when he was angry with the Egyptians, he did make a way in the sea, bring them down &lt; into it &gt;, and drown them in its midst.] Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 43:16): <small>&lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD &gt;, WHO SETS HIS WAY IN THE SEA AND A PATH IN THE MIGHTY WATERS</small>. And what one is greater than all of them? The one who (according to Exod. 15:1, 21) brings forth rider and horse, army and warrior. Ergo (in Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &lt; YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS &gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &lt; YOUR THOUGHTS &gt;</small>. In the case of Joseph, his brothers sold him to the Midianites, and the Midianites sold him unto the Egyptians. Before Joseph went away, Judah went away to prepare for the final redeemer, i.e., the Messianic King,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., through a marriage out of which would come the Messianic King. See Gen. R. 85:1.</i> [for out of him would the Messianic King come forth]. "That Judah went" is not written here, but <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. R. Johanan said: The one going away depends upon the other. The going away of Judah depends upon the going away of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 85:2.</i> (Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN AWAY TO EGYPT</small> &lt; corresponds to &gt; (Gen. 38:1) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. Similarly you say on the matter (in Dan. 5:30): <small>IN THAT VERY NIGHT WAS BELSHAZZAR THE CHALDEAN KING SLAIN</small>. What is written next (in Dan. 6:1 [5:31])? <small>AND DARIUS THE MEDE RECEIVED THE KINGDOM</small>. The one destroyer depends upon the other, the destroyer of a house upon the destroyer of a house, the cessation of a kingdom upon the cessation of a kingdom.

Siman 12

(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY (literally: WENT DOWN)</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WENT DOWN</small>? That they brought him down from his greatness. Why? Because they had appointed him king over themselves. When they had sold Joseph, they came to their father to comfort him, [but] he did [not] wish to be comforted. They said: Now the old man was upset with us. What did they do. They arose and banished him (i.e., Judah), as stated (in Gen. 38:1) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT DOWN</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. As soon as they had sold Joseph (in Gen. 37:28), what is written (in vs. 29)? <small>WHEN REUBEN RETURNED UNTO THE PIT</small> &lt; … &gt; when he did not find him, <small>HE RENT HIS CLOTHES</small>. In addition they all arose and dispersed, and Judah also dispersed with them. [Ergo] (in Gen. 38:1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.

Actually they had said (at the beginning of the verse): <small>COME, AND LET US KILL HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, on Gen. 37:20, explains that the brothers could not have said, <small>AND WE SHALL SEE WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIS DREAMS.</small> Since they were about to slay him, his dreams would have been meaningless.</i> So the Holy Spirit says: Let us observe them.

Now let us see whose &lt; sheaf &gt; stands up, yours or mine.
(Gen. 37:22:) <small>REUBEN ALSO SAID UNTO THEM: DO NOT SHED BLOOD</small>.

There is the one who killed and lost (in Numb. 35:16): <small>THE MURDERER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>.

(Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT, &lt; POTIPHAR, A EUNUCH OF PHARAOH AND CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, BOUGHT HIM &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 37:28): <small>FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. Why does the Holy One love justice? Because he is called the Lord of Justice where it is stated (in Is. 30:18): <small>FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE</small>. It also says (in Deut. 32:41): <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:28): <small>&lt; FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE &gt; AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. Do his saints need protection? R. Jeremiah said: See what is written (in I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. Do they need protection? It is simply as a popular<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes</i>, i.e., “commoner,” “one who is unskilled.”</i> adage says: They fence in what is fenced in, and they break through what is broken through. Ergo (in Ps. 37:28): <small>AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:28): <small>FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE &lt; AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS &gt;. [THEY ARE PROTECTED FOREVER]</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; speaks about Joseph. And how did he protect him?

It is simply that the Holy One said: Should this righteous man be set in the midst of a bad odor? Instead, I will order a good odor for him. Ergo (in Ps. 37:28) <small>AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE SEED OF THE WICKED ARE CUT OFF</small>.

Ergo (in Ps. 37:28): <small>BUT THE SEED OF THE WICKED ARE CUT OFF</small>. Now <small>CUT OFF</small> only denotes castration. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 22:24): <small>&lt; ANYTHING WITH ITS TESTICLES &gt; CRUSHED, SMASHED, TORN OUT, OR CUT OFF &lt; YOU SHALL NOT OFFER TO THE LORD &gt;</small>. And where is it shown that he was not a eunuch &lt; already &gt;, but that the Holy One had castrated him?

Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 10:7): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar, the one who destroyed the temple. When he did not enter it because he was afraid, what did Michael do? He came down, seized his horse, and brought him into the Holy of Holies. So the Holy Spirit says (ibid.): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>, &lt; and &gt; this refers to Nebuchadnezzar.

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 10:7): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>. &lt; The text &gt; speaks about Midianites (in Gen. 37:36): <small>THE MIDIANITES SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT</small>.

Although the Buber text has the singular “child” in both parts of this sentence, the plural verbs require a collective sense. “The child of the female slave” refers to the descendants of Ishmael, whose mother was Abraham’s female slave, Hagar (Gen. 16:1, 15). “The child of the male slave” denotes the descendants of Egypt (Mizraim), whose father was Ham (Gen. 10:6). According to <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Exod., 168 (citing <i>Divre haYamim</i>, edited by A. Jellinek, <i>Bet ha-Midrasch</i> [Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853—1877], vol. II, pp. 1 — 11), all Ham’s children were slaves (see Gen. 9:22-25).</i> Between the former and the latter Joseph was sold.
(Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. The tribe was brought down to Egypt. To what is the matter compared? To a cow.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 9:4; Gen. R. 86:2; M. Pss. 105:5.</i> When they wanted to bring her to the <i>makellon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Greek.</i> {i.e., the slaughterhouse}, she did not want to go in. What did they do? They took her offspring {to the slaughterhouse} and brought it to the <i>makellon</i>. When her offspring began to low, its mother unwillingly entered after it. So &lt; it was with &gt; our father Jacob and his children. They were the cow, as stated (in Hos. 4:16): <small>FOR &lt; ISRAEL HAS BALKED &gt; LIKE A BALKY COW</small>. Now Joseph went down to Egypt first in order to fulfill a decree which had been decreed about the patriarch, as stated (in Gen. 15:13): <small>WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM</small>. When Jacob was afraid to go down, what did the Holy One do? He brought Joseph down to Egypt, and drew his father unwillingly. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN &lt; TO EGYPT, POTIPHAR … BOUGHT HIM &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN</small>? That he moved the Egyptians from place to place. &lt; It is &gt; just as you say (in Gen. 47:21): <small>HE REMOVED THE PEOPLE BY CITIES &lt; FROM ONE END OF EGYPT'S BORDER TO THE OTHER &gt;</small>. Thus he was taking them up from here and putting them there so that they would not taunt the Israelites by calling them exiles &lt; and &gt; children of exiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hul</i>. 60b; Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 47:21; Frag. (Jerusalem) Targum, Gen. 47:21.</i>
(Gen. 39:1, cont.:) <small>POTIPHAR … BOUGHT HIM</small>. Why was he named Potiphar (rt.: <i>PTPR</i>). Because he fattened (rt.: <i>PTM</i>) bulls (rt.: <i>PR</i>) for idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 86:3.</i>
Another interpretation: Why was he named Potiphar? Because he entered Pharaoh's house and made his house potinos<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">From the Gk.: <i>photeinos</i>, which means “radiant.”</i> {i.e., wealthy}. Thus he made the Pharaoh's house shine.
(Gen. 39:1, cont.:) &lt; <small>POTIPHAR, A EUNUCH OF PHARAOH AND &gt; CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, &lt; BOUGHT HIM &gt;</small>; nevertheless (according to vs. 2): <small>THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH, &lt; AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN &gt;</small>. R. Abbahu said: Do I only have &lt; evidence that the Lord was with him &gt; in prosperity? Where is it shown &lt; that the Lord was with him &gt;, even in trouble? See, he wrote (in vs. 20): <small>SO JOSEPH'S MASTER TOOK HIM AND PUT HIM IN PRISON</small>. Nevertheless (according to vs. 21): <small>THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>. R. Abbahu said: You have someone who loves his friend in prosperity. When trouble came to him, he acted as though he did not know him. But the Holy One is not like that. Rather (according to Gen. 39:20-21): <small>WHILE HE WAS THERE IN PRISON, THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>. &lt; Both &gt; in trouble and in prosperity, he was with him.
(Gen. 39:2, cont.:) <small>AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN</small>. He used to gird up his loins; and, when his master would say to him: Pour me a glass of water, he would pour it. &lt; Then he would say &gt; : Give me cold &lt; water &gt;, and he would give it to him out of the same vessel. When his master would say to him: Give me wine, he would give it to him. &lt; Then he would say &gt;: Give it to me tripled (i.e., mixed with two parts of water).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">So Buber, p. 186, n. 66.</i> He would give it to him, and it would become sweet by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 9:8; Gen.

What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 38:13-14)? <small>AND IT WAS TOLD TO TAMAR, SAYING: &lt; HERE IS YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW COMING &gt;…. SO SHE PUT HER WIDOW'S CLOTHES OFF [FROM HER] AND COVERED HERSELF WITH A VEIL. &lt; THEN, HAVING WRAPPED HERSELF, SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM &gt;</small>. Two women covered themselves with a veil and bore twins. These are Rebekah and Tamar.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 60:15; 85:7.</i> Of Rebekah it is written (in Gen. 24:65): <small>SO SHE TOOK THE VEIL AND COVERED HERSELF</small>. Then she bore twins, Esau and Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:24): <small>BEHOLD, THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB</small>. As for Tamar, she covered herself with a veil and (according to Gen. 38:27-30) bore twins, Perez and Zerah.
(Gen. 38:14:) <small>SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> (a name which means "eyes"). R. Joshua ben Levi said: It was at the entrance to which all eyes would be raised in expectation of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sot</i>. 10a; <i>ySot</i>. 1:4 (16d); <i>yKet</i>. 13:1 (35c); Gen. R. 85:7; M. Sam. 7.</i>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:14:) <small>SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> ("eyes"), &lt; i.e., &gt; at the entrance on which the Holy One looks. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 4:10): <small>&lt; THESE ARE &gt; THE EYES (a form of <i>'enayim</i>) {OF THE LORD ROAMING} [OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM] AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:14): <small>AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> ("eyes"). When one goes out on the road, his eyes look here and there.
(Gen. 38:15:) <small>WHEN JUDAH SAW HER, HE THOUGHT HER TO BE A HARLOT BECAUSE SHE HAD COVERED HER FACE</small>. However, R. Johanan said: <small>SHE COVERED HER FACE</small> as long as she was in her father-in-law's house.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore Judah did not recognize her.</i> From here our masters have said: A man must be acquainted with his daughter-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 85:8.</i> Judah said: This is a harlot. What concern do I have about her? He went on. When he had gone on, she raised her eyes to the Holy One. She said to him: Sovereign of the World, am I to go away empty from the body of this righteous man? Immediately the Holy One sent Michael and brought him back. Where is it shown? Where it is written here (in vs. 16): <small>SO HE TURNED ASIDE UNTO HER</small>. And it is written (in Numb. 22:23): <small>THEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD…. SO THE SHE-ASS TURNED ASIDE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verb “turned aside” appears where an angel causes the turning aside in Numb. 22:23, an angel must be involved where the same verb appears in Gen. 38:16.</i> (Gen. 38:16, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HER: HEY THERE, PLEASE &lt; LET ME COME UNTO YOU &gt;</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW</small>. (Vs. 17:) <small>AND HE SAID: I WILL SEND YOU A GOAT KID</small>. He said to her (in vs. 18): <small>WHAT PLEDGE SHALL I GIVE YOU? AND SHE SAID: YOUR SEAL…. THEN HE CAME UNTO HER, AND SHE CONCEIVED &lt; FOR HIM &gt;</small>. Scripture lacks nothing; so what is the meaning of <small>SHE CONCEIVED FOR HIM</small>? It simply means that she gave birth to kings like him. (Vs. 24:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS ABOUT THREE MONTHS LATER</small>…. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: After three months it is discernible whether a woman is pregnant or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yev</i>. 4:1 (10a); <i>TNid</i>. 1:7; <i>Nid</i>. 8b; <i>yNid</i>. 1:4 (49a); Gen.

(Gen. 38:24, cont.:) <small>THAT IT WAS TOLD TO JUDAH, SAYING: YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TAMAR HAS PROSTITUTED HERSELF; AND SHE IS ALSO PREGNANT FOR LEWDNESS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR LEWDNESS</small>? That she would enter a bathhouse and say to her women friends: Go away from me because I am bearing kings. But Isaac, Jacob, and Judah were sitting there in judgment. They said (ibid., cont.): <small>BRING HER OUT AND LET HER BE BURNED</small>. R. Johanan said: In property cases one begins with the eldest, but in capital cases one begins with the youngest and finishes with the eldest.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 4:2; <i>Git</i>. 59a. Thus the younger judges would not be unduly influenced by their elders.</i> And why does one say: <small>WITH THE YOUNGEST</small>? Because one ascribes corruption to the youngest. Why did he say (in Gen. 34:24): <small>LET HER BE BURNED</small>, and not say: "Let her be killed"? Ephraim the Disputant said in the name of R. Me'ir: She was Shem's daughter, and Shem was a priest. For this reason he said: <small>BRING HER OUT, AND LET HER BE BURNED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 21:9.</i> Now they were dragging her and bringing her out against her will, as stated (in Gen. 38:25): <small>AS SHE WAS BEING BROUGHT OUT</small>. Now while she was being brought out, she sought &lt; the tokens of &gt; the pledge but did not find them. In that hour she raised her eyes to the heavens. Immediately the Holy One sent her others.
Another interpretation: Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: When she came out, the Holy One made her eyes light up and she found them after she had lost them because there is no finding except of what is <small>LOST</small>. Thus it is written (in Lev. 5:22): <small>OR HAS FOUND WHAT IS LOST</small>. Immediately she sent &lt; her tokens of the pledge &gt; to Judah, (according to Gen. 38:25) <small>THE ONE TO WHOM THESE BELONG</small>. She said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE</small> your Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R., 97, New Version, on Gen. 49:8 (= p. 1214 in the Theodor-Albeck edition) explains that for Judah to acknowledge the Creator meant for him not to be ashamed in confessing the matter before flesh and blood. Cf. <i>Sot</i>. 10b.</i> Immediately (in vs. 26): <small>JUDAH GAVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT</small>. In that hour a heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) came forth and said to him: You are to say: [She is pregnant from me; lest] she be burned. And afterwards he confessed: The affair stemmed from me. The Holy One said to Him: Judah, for me you have saved three lives from the fire and one (i.e., Joseph) from the pit. By your life, I will save &lt; four lives &gt; for you just as you have saved &lt; them &gt; for me. Who are they? Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the fiery furnace (in Dan. 3:20-27) and Daniel from the lions' pit (in Dan. 6:16-23). What is written about them (in Dan. 1:6)? <small>NOW AMONG THOSE FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH WERE DANIEL, HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH</small>. "From Hezekiah's children"<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PRE</i> 52 at the end; <i>Sanh</i>. 93b.</i> is not written here, but <small>FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH</small>. For what reason? For the reason that he had saved Tamar and her children &lt; from the fire &gt; and Joseph from the pit. When Reuben heard that Judah had confessed, he immediately arose also and said: I also have violated my father's beds (in Gen. 35:22). Eliphaz said to Job (in Job 15:17-18): <small>I WILL INFORM YOU; HEARKEN TO ME. NOW THIS HAVE I SEEN, AND I WILL DECLARE THAT WHICH SAGES HAVE TOLD</small>. These &lt; sages &gt; are Reuben and Judah. Therefore (in vs. 19): <small>TO THEM ALONE WAS THE LAND GIVEN</small>. When? (Ibid.:) <small>AND NO STRANGER PASSED AMONG THEM</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This text is related (to Hos. 11:4): <small>WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN, WITH BANDS OF LOVE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 86:1.</i> Israel would have deservedly gone down to Egypt in chains and <i>collaria</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word means “neck chains.”</i> just as they went down to Babylon, had not Joseph gone first. All that happened to Joseph happened to Zion.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See below, 11:11.</i> That which is written of Joseph is written of Zion. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): <small>BEAUTIFULLY BUILT WITH A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE</small>; and it is written of Zion (in Lam. 2:15): <small>A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY</small>. For this reason Jacob was afraid to go down to Egypt: Because it had been decreed over Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN IN A LAND &lt; NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM &gt;</small>. So he dwelt in the land of Canaan. They came and said to him: Joseph was sold when he resembled a bull. It is so stated (of Joseph in Deut. 33:17): <small>LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY</small>. And here he is ensconced in Egypt (Gen. 45:26)! When Jacob heard this, he said: See, I am going down to Egypt even though I am paying Abraham's bill (of indebtedness). Immediately (it says in Gen. 45:28): <small>THEN ISRAEL SAID: ENOUGH, MY SON JOSEPH IS ALIVE. &lt; I WILL GO AND SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE &gt;</small>. Immediately all the tribes went down with him.

[Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>. Love is what Jacob had for Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:18): <small>AND JACOB LOVED RACHEL</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.): <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL</small>. Thus Rachel was jealous of her sister. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)?
Another interpretation (of Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; the love of Jonathan and David. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 18:1): <small>JONATHAN'S SOUL WAS BOUND TO THE SOUL OF DAVID, AND JONATHAN LOVED HIM AS HIS OWN SOUL</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.:) <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL (<i>Sh'</i><i>WL</i>)</small>. Thus Saul (<i>Sh'WL</i>) was jealous of David. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)?
Another interpretation (of Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>. Love is what Jacob had for Joseph, as stated (in Gen. 37:3): <small>NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.:) <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL</small>. Thus his (Joseph's) brothers were jealous of him. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)?

Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. There were three natures within him. &lt; He was &gt; a Torah scholar, a prophet, and one who nourished his brothers. &lt; He was &gt; a Torah scholar, for it is so written (in Gen. 37:3): <small>BECAUSE HE WAS THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE (<i>ZEN</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ZQN</i> here is interpreted in the Talmud as an abbreviation (<i>notarikon</i>) for <i>Zeh Sheqanah Hokhmah</i>, which means, “This is the one who has acquired wisdom.” See <i>Qid</i>. 32b.

Where is it shown for mountains? Where it is stated (in Is. 40:12): <small>WHO WEIGHS MOUNTAINS WITH A BALANCE AND HILLS WITH SCALES</small>. Where is it shown for the wind? Where it is stated (in Job 28:25): <small>TO FIX A WEIGHT FOR THE WIND</small>. And where is it shown for the waters? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HE HAS FIXED THE WATERS BY MEASURE</small>. Where is it shown for darkness? (Job 28:3:) <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS</small>. Every single thing, when it comes to a person, even afflictions, has an end. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. So the Holy One sits and searches out whether afflictions are required for &lt; a person &gt; or not, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. Resh Laqish said: Who has been the cause of this person having afflictions {and deep darkness} come upon him? [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>A STONE OF DARKNESS AND SHADOWY DEATH</small>.] <small>A STONE</small>: This is the evil drive (<i>yetser hara</i>) because it is comparable to the stone of which it is stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Suk</i>. 32a.</i> Ergo (in Job 28:3): <small>A STONE OF DARKNESS AND SHADOWY DEATH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Job 28:3): <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS</small>.

[(Gen. 41:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 14:23): <small>IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT</small>.

Because he did not grasp &lt; them &gt; with his lips, he became sick and forgot his studies. What caused &lt; this &gt; for him? &lt; It was &gt; because he did not grasp &lt; his studies &gt; with his lips.

What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 40:23): <small>YET THE CHIEF CUPBEARER DID NOT REMEMBER JOSEPH</small>. R.

[(Genesis 41:1, cont.:) <small>THAT PHARAOH DREAMED</small>.] R. Hiyya bar Abba said: <small>&lt; THAT PHARAOH &gt; DREAMED</small>. Does a dead dog dream? &lt; In this case, he was granted prophetic dreams &gt; merely a short while for the sake of the righteous one.

(Gen. 41:8:) <small>&lt; AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING &gt; THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED (rt.: <i>P'M</i>)</small>, in that it was beating against him like a gong (rt.: <i>P'M</i>). Another interpretation (of Gen. 41:8): <small>THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED</small>. It is written of Nebuchadnezzar (in Dan. 2:1): <small>HIS SPIRIT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED</small>; and it is written of Pharaoh (in Gen. 41:8): <small>THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:2; Gen. R. 89:5.</i> Why? Pharaoh knew the dream but did not know its interpretation; therefore, he was confused by one confusion. But Nebuchadnezzar knew neither the dream nor its interpretation; therefore, &lt; he was confused &gt; by two confusions. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:1): <small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR DREAMED DREAMS</small>. R. Hiyya said: He dreamed one dream. Then why does it say: <small>DREAMS</small> (in the plural)? Because he had forgotten the dream. R. Jannay says: He dreamed two dreams, one of an image (in Dan. 2:31-35) and one of a tree (in Dan. 4:7-14).
(Dan. 2:1:) <small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR DREAMED DREAMS. ALSO HIS SPIRIT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED</small>, and his sleep was confused. Why? Because the dream was of himself in that it showed him his kingdom. For that reason (ibid.): <small>AND HE SUFFERED SLEEPLESSNESS</small>.
(Dan. 2:2:) <small>SO THE KING SAID TO SUMMON THE DIVINERS, THE ENCHANTERS, AND THE SORCERERS</small>. What were the diviners (<i>HRTWMYM</i>)? R. Simon said: (<i>HRTMYM</i>) is written &lt; here &gt; (defectively without the <i>W</i>). These are the ones who consult the bones (<i>TYMY</i>) of the dead. <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Gen. 41:8 has a more ingenuous etymology: “Those who are aroused (rt.: <i>HR[YM]</i>) through the bones (<i>TMY</i>) of the dead (<i>M[TYM]</i>).”</i> <small>THE ENCHANTERS</small>. What are the enchanters ('<i>ShPYM</i>)? These are the ones who push fortune. So this word is nothing but a word of duress. Thus it is stated (in Amos 8:4): <small>HEAR THIS, YOU WHO OPPRESS (<i>Sh'PYM</i>) THE NEEDY</small>. (Dan. 2:2:) <small>AND THE SORCERERS</small> are actually sorcerers.
(Dan. 2:2, cont.:) <small>TO TELL THE KING HIS DREAMS. SO THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING</small>. They all came lest one of them have an advantage. He began to speak with them, as stated (in Dan. 2:3-4): <small>AND THE KING SAID: I HAVE DREAMED A DREAM, AND MY SPIRIT IS DEEPLY TROUBLED TO KNOW THE DREAM. THEN THE CHALDEANS SPOKE TO THE KING IN ARAMAIC: O KING, LIVE FOR EVER! TELL YOUR SERVANTS THE DREAM, AND</small> {<small>ITS INTERPRETATION WILL BE DECLARED</small>} <small>[WE WILL DECLARE ITS INTERPRETATION]</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Buber’s Oxford MS for this section has many differences from the MT of Daniel. Where such differences occur, Buber as usual has added the Masoretic Text in square brackets. Most of these variants, however, are not noted in the translation because they are only orthographic and do not affect the translation.</i> Nebuchadnezzar said to them: I know the dream. If I tell it to you, you may tell me words of falsehood when you say: This is its interpretation. Instead, you tell the dream, and &lt; then &gt; I will know that you are telling me its &lt; true &gt; interpretation. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:6-7): <small>{THEREFORE, TELL ME THE DREAM AND I WILL KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DECLARE ITS INTERPRETATION.} [BUT IF YOU DECLARE THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION], &lt; THEN YOU SHALL RECEIVE GIFTS, PRESENTS, AND GREAT HONOR &gt;…. THEY ANSWERED HIM A SECOND TIME AND SAID {TO THE KING}: LET THE KING TELL THE DREAM TO HIS SERVANTS, AND WE WILL DECLARE {ITS} [THE] INTERPRETATION</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to them: Just as I tell you to tell me, and you tell me to tell [you]; so you think that you will converse with me until noon and go away. (Dan. 2:9:) <small>THAT, IF YOU DO NOT MAKE THE DREAM KNOWN TO ME, THERE IS BUT ONE VERDICT FOR YOU</small>. I am putting forth one <i>keleusis</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “command.”</i> {i.e., your decree} concerning you, that you shall be killed. (Dan. 2:9, cont.:) <small>FOR YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TELL ME SOMETHING FALSE AND CORRUPT</small>. You have come in to speak deceitful words before me <small>UNTIL</small> (according to Dan. 2:9, cont.) <small>CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE</small>. (Dan. 2:10-11:) <small>THE CHALDEANS ANSWERED THE KING AND SAID: THERE IS NOT A PERSON ON THE EARTH WHO CAN DECLARE THE KING'S MATTER BECAUSE NO GREAT AND POWERFUL KING HAS ASKED A THING LIKE THIS OF ANY DIVINER, ENCHANTER, OR CHALDEAN. ALSO THE THING THAT THE KING IS ASKING IS DIFFICULT, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL DECLARE IT BEFORE THE KING, EXCEPT THE GODS, WHOSE DWELLING IS NOT WITH HUMAN FLESH</small>. While the Sanctuary was standing, when someone wanted an oracle, he would ask through Urim and Thummim. While the eternal God dwelt with human flesh, when someone wanted an oracle, he would speak to him. &lt; The king said &gt; : Go and ask him. They said: His &lt; dwelling &gt; (according to vs. 11, end) <small>IS NOT WITH HUMAN FLESH</small>. (Vs. 11, beginning:) <small>ALSO THE THING THAT THE KING IS ASKING IS DIFFICULT (rt.: <i>YQR</i>)</small>. Prophecy is necessary, but nothing is so difficult (rt.: <i>YQR</i>) as prophecy, even as you say (in I Sam. 3:1): <small>AND THE WORD OF THE LORD WAS RARE (<i>YQR</i>)</small>…. (Vs. 11, cont.:) <small>AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL DECLARE IT BEFORE THE KING. ELSE ('<i>HRN</i>)</small> is &lt; actually &gt; Aaron ('<i>HRN</i>). They said to him: If you had had one of the children of the children of Aaron, he would have wrapped himself in Urim and Thummim and told you &lt; the dream &gt;. (Dan. 2:12:) <small>WHEREUPON THE KING BECAME ANGRY AND VERY FURIOUS</small>. He was filled with wrath over them. He said to them: And so the Sanctuary was beautiful; yet you gave me counsel to destroy it. Immediately (we read in vs. 12, cont.): <small>AND HE SAID TO DESTROY ALL THE SAGES OF BABYLON</small>. A command<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>keleusis</i>.</i> went out to this effect, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>THEN THE DECREE WENT OUT THAT THE SAGES WERE TO BE KILLED. ALSO DANIEL AND HIS FRIENDS WERE ABOUT (rt.: <i>B</i>'') TO BE KILLED</small>. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: &lt; The text really means &gt;: It was required (rt.: <i>B</i>'') for Daniel and his friends to be killed. Daniel began saying to Arioch (in vs. 15): <small>WHY IS THE DECREE FROM THE KING SO URGENT? THEN ARIOCH INFORMED DANIEL OF THE MATTER</small>. Daniel said to him: I will reveal the matter to him. <small>THEN</small> (in Dan. 2:25) <small>ARIOCH HASTILY BROUGHT DANIEL IN BEFORE THE KING</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to him (in vs. 26): <small>ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE DREAM WHICH I SAW AND ITS INTERPRETATION</small>? Daniel answered him immediately and explained to him. But his son Belshazzar said to Daniel, (on a later occasion) when he came before him to explain to him what the hand had written (in Dan. 5:5)—At that time he said to him (in Dan. 5:13): <small>ARE YOU DANIEL, THE ONE WHO COMES FROM THE CHILDREN OF THE CAPTIVITY OF JUDAH &lt; WHOM MY FATHER THE KING BROUGHT FROM JUDAH &gt;</small>? R. Jose therefore explains that Nebuchadnezzar also had said this to him: <small>ARE YOU DANIEL</small>? Did he not recognize him when he said to him: <small>ARE YOU DANIEL</small>? It is simply that he said to him: Do you have power to tell me this thing? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: When? he said to him: Not &lt; after &gt; thirty days nor &lt; after &gt; twenty days. Just wait one night for me. (Dan. 2:17:) <small>THEN DANIEL WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND MADE THE MATTER KNOWN TO HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH</small>, so that they would pray with him, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>IN ORDER TO SEEK MERCY FROM BEFORE THE GOD &lt; OF HEAVEN &gt;</small>…. (Vs. 19:) <small>THEN THE MYSTERY WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL IN A NIGHT VISION. THEN DANIEL BLESSED THE GOD OF HEAVEN</small>. In this world prophecy belongs to one in a thousand, but in the world to come prophecy will belong to everyone. It is so stated (in Joel 3:1 [2:28]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS AFTERWARD THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH SO THAT YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Acts 2:17.</i>

(Gen. 42:1:) <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>. This verse is related (to Prov. 20:12): <small>{A SEEING EYE AND A HEARING EAR} [A HEARING EAR AND A SEEING EYE], THE LORD HAS MADE THEM BOTH</small>. What did Solomon see to &lt; make him &gt; say this? Did the Holy One not make the whole body? &lt; We might infer that he did not do so &gt; because &lt; Solomon &gt; spoke &lt; only &gt; about the ear and the eye. Rather, all of one's members are going to render account except the ear and the eye. Why? It is simply that the eye sees involuntarily, and the ear hears involuntarily. In the case of the hands, however, if one is unwilling, one does not steal. So also with the feet. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 20:12): <small>A SEEING EYE AND A HEARING EAR</small>…. Come and see. All that time when Joseph had been sold, Jacob and his children did not know that Joseph was alive. But, when the proper time arrived, the Holy One gave authorization to the eyes and the ears. It is so stated (in Gen. 42:1-2): <small>THEN JACOB <i>SAW</i> THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT…. NOW I <i>HEAR</i> THAT THERE IS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>….

[(Gen. 42:1:) <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>.] This text is related (to Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE &lt; AND SEALS UP THE STARS &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 91:1.</i> {It simply tells about Jacob and his children, since they were likened to them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>.} Look at all Job's wisdom! Now who does not know that, if the Holy One tells the sun or the stars not to shine, they do not shine, as stated (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small> … ? It simply tells about Jacob and his children, [since they were likened to them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>]. (Job 9:7:) <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>. For the twenty-two years that Joseph stayed away from his brothers in Egypt, the Holy Spirit was hidden from Jacob and his children. He was no farther from them than a journey of four or five days; but they did not know that he was in Egypt. Now Jacob and his children had previously been great prophets. Do you want to understand? When Joseph had told them his dream, what did he say (in Gen. 37:10)? <small>ARE WE TO COME, I AND YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHERS, AND BOW DOWN &lt; TO THE GROUND FOR YOU &gt;</small> ? Then, when he had been sold, they did not know where he was. Ergo (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>. Why so? So that the prophets would not be boastful. The Holy One therefore made his power known to them to show them that they were nothing. And so you find with the greatest of the prophets (i.e., Moses). Because he had said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &lt; YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 1:17 (17); <i>Sanh</i>. 8a.</i> The Holy One said to him: Are you able to interpret a difficult case? By your life, I am showing you! So, when the affair of the daughters of Zelophehad arrived, he began to have difficulties with it. When he did not know what to say, he brought their cause before the <small>LORD</small>, as stated (in Numb. 27:5): <small>THEN MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to him: Was it not you who said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &lt; YOU ARE TO BRING UNTO ME &gt;</small> … ? See, you do not know what the women know. (Numb. 27:7:) <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>. These women have judged better than you. And so also in the case of Samuel, when he was measured against Moses and Aaron. Because he had said (in I Sam. 9:19): <small>I AM THE SEER</small>, the Holy One said to him: You have said: <small>I AM THE SEER</small>! By your life, tomorrow I am showing you whether you are a seer. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 16:1): <small>FILL YOUR HORN WITH OIL AND GO; {COME} [I AM SENDING YOU] UNTO JESSE THE BETHLEHEMITE BECAUSE I HAVE CHOSEN A KING FOR MYSELF AMONG HIS SONS</small>. When he had gone, what is written (in I Sam. 16:6)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN HE HAD COME, THAT HE SAW ELIAB AND SAID: SURELY THE LORD'S ANOINTED IS STANDING BEFORE HIM</small>. The Holy One said to him: Are you the one who said (in I Sam. 9:19): <small>I AM THE SEER</small>? (I Sam. 16:7:) <small>DO NOT LOOK UPON HIS APPEARANCE</small>…. And so also in the case of Jacob [and his children], they were prophets and sages, and nothing was hidden from them. When Joseph was sold, they did not know about him until the Holy One [wanted] &lt; them to know &gt;. Ergo (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>….

Siman 7

Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>…. R. Joshua said: &lt; He was &gt; a grand old man sitting in his house and seeing what there was in Egypt. The Scripture says (in Eccl. 7:19): <small>{AND} WISDOM WILL STRENGTHEN A SAGE MORE THAN TEN RULERS</small>…. This refers to Jacob, who was sitting and seeing what there was in Egypt, while his ten sons were coming in [and out] without knowing &lt; about it &gt;.

Siman 8

Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN (<i>ShBR</i>)</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 146:5): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOSE HELP IS THE GOD OF JACOB, WHOSE HOPE (<i>SBR</i>) IS IN THE LORD HIS GOD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 91:1, 6; cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:5.</i> The Holy One showed him that Joseph was alive.
(Gen. 42:1, cont.:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID TO HIS CHILDREN: WHY ARE YOU MAKING YOURSELVES CONSPICUOUS</small>? Jacob said to them: Will you please hide yourselves, for there is nothing more harmful than the evil eye?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 91:2, 6; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:8.</i> And so you find in the case of the former tables (of the Torah), because they had been given in grandeur (before all eyes), they had been shattered. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small>. But when the second tables were given, no one saw them but Moses, since it is stated (in Exod. 34:3): <small>BUT LET NO ONE COME UP WITH YOU</small>…. So also Jerusalem would not have been destroyed except for the evil eye. Thus it is stated (in Lam. 2:15-16): <small>IS THIS THE CITY WHICH THEY CALLED A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, A JOY TO THE WHOLE EARTH? &lt; ALL YOUR ENEMIES JEER OVER YOU; THEY HISS AND GNASH THEIR TEETH; THEY SAY: WE HAVE DESTROYED HER! INDEED, THIS IS THE DAY WE HAD HOPED FOR. WE HAVE FOUND IT; WE HAVE SEEN IT &gt;</small>. It also says (in Lam. 3:51): <small>MY EYE DOES EVIL TO MY SOUL BECAUSE OF ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF MY CITY</small>. Jacob therefore said: Do not look at yourselves. It is so stated (in Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAID TO HIS CHILDREN: WHY ARE YOU MAKING YOURSELVES CONSPICUOUS</small>? Rather walk privately (rt.: <i>TsN</i>'), as stated (in Micah 6:8): <small>HE HAS TOLD YOU, O HUMAN, WHAT IS GOOD…. AND TO WALK HUMBLY (rt.: <i>TsN</i>') WITH YOUR GOD</small>.

Siman 9

Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>…. This text is related (to Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE, THE ELDERS WHO UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>. Not everyone who is engaged in the Torah becomes wise, but (according to Job 32:8) <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. Who stated this verse? Elihu stated it. When? In the hour that Job's friends were rebuking him and he was answering them. When Job had dismissed them, Elihu saw that they were unable to answer him, as stated (in Job 32:5): <small>BUT WHEN ELIHU SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ANSWER</small>…. At that time he said to them (in vs. 9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>, nor does everyone who is engaged in the Torah become wise; but (according to Job 32:8) <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. &lt; There is no wisdom &gt; unless the Holy One has put a spirit within him for him to be habitual in his study, as stated (in Job 32:8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. A matron<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>matrona</i>.</i> queried R. Jose ben Halafta.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl.R. 1:7:5.</i> She said to him: Is it not true that all the glory of the Holy One consists in his giving wisdom to the wise? It is so stated (in Dan. 2:20-21): <small>&lt; LET THE NAME OF THE LORD BE BLESSED FOR EVER AND EVER, FOR WISDOM AND MIGHT ARE HIS &gt;…. HE GIVES WISDOM TO THE WISE</small>. Should it not rather have said: "He gives wisdom to the foolish"? He said to her: Do you have jewels?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kosmion</i> (“ornament” in Patristic Greek).</i> She said to him: Yes. He said to her: If someone comes to borrow your jewels, would you lend them to him? She said to him: If he were someone <i>hikanos</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “sufficient” or “competent.”</i> {i.e., someone wise}, I would lend him my jewels. He said to her. You would only lend your jewels to someone <i>hikanos</i>; should the Holy One give wisdom to the foolish? &lt; Daniel &gt; therefore said (in Dan. 2:21): <small>HE GIVES WISDOM TO THE WISE</small>. Elihu said: &lt; The Holy One &gt; does not give to everyone who asks. Ergo (in Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>. [But (in vs. 8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON.</small>
Another interpretation (of Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>.] &lt; The verse &gt; speaks about Jacob. Jacob said to his children: It is not because you are many that you are wise, since you are ten and I am &lt; only &gt; one. Now I say to you: Go down to Egypt, but you do not want to go down. I have a vision in the Holy Spirit that there is grain there. Thus it is stated (in Job 32:8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. I have seen that Joseph is there. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>.
(Gen. 42:2:) <small>GO DOWN THERE</small>. There is a going down for them. Go down and subdue the land before your children. {(Ibid., cont.:) <small>GO DOWN THERE AND BUY FOR US FROM THERE</small>} [(Gen. 44:25:) <small>RETURN AND BUY US</small>] <small>A LITTLE FOOD</small>. &lt; Go down and subdue the land &gt; before those about whom it is written (in Deut. 7:7:) <small>INDEED YOU ARE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES</small>.

(Gen. 42:3:) <small>SO JOSEPH'S TEN BROTHERS WENT DOWN &lt; TO BUY GRAIN IN EGYPT &gt;</small>.

R. 91:6; cf. 91:2; cf. also above, 10:8; below, 10:17.</i> And so they did. When they entered, they did not all enter as a unit, but each and every one all by himself. What did Joseph do? He posted guards over the entrance gates of Egypt. He said: Let each and every one who enters have his name and the name of his father written under your supervision. Then you are to bring their names to me. So, when the children of Jacob entered, each and every one all by himself, he (a guard) said: What is your name? So he told him: Reuben ben Jacob. And so it was with each and every one of them. &lt; A guard &gt; would write down his name and the name of his father. Then they brought &lt; the names &gt; to Joseph. Joseph immediately recognized them, as stated (in Gen. 42:8): <small>SO JOSEPH RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHERS</small>. He began to recall the dreams, as stated (in Gen. 42:9): <small>NOW JOSEPH REMEMBERED THE DREAMS THAT HE HAD DREAMED ABOUT THEM</small>. (Vs. 7:) <small>BUT HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM, AND HE SPOKE HARSHLY WITH THEM</small>. He began to treat them harshly, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE SAID TO THEM: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM</small>? When they said: From the land of Canaan, he said to Simeon and Levi: Are you accustomed to pillaging people just as you did at Shechem (in Gen. 34:25-26)? Ergo (in Gen. 42:7): <small>AND HE SPOKE HARSHLY WITH THEM</small>.
(Gen. 42:8:) <small>SO JOSEPH RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHERS</small>, when they fell into his hands.

"The children of Israel" is not written here but <small>JOSEPH'S &lt; TEN &gt; BROTHERS</small>. &lt; It is so written &gt; because at the beginning they had not treated him with brotherhood, in that they had sold him. Then they had finally repented and said: When shall we go down to Egypt and return Joseph to our father? So, when their father told them to go down to Egypt, they all went with one mind to return him. It is therefore written (in Gen. 42:3): <small>SO JOSEPH'S &lt; TEN &gt; BROTHERS WENT DOWN</small>. And why ten? Because it was up to them to end the divine punishment and annul the decree (of Gen. 15:13). You therefore find in the case of Sodom that Abraham went down from fifty &lt; righteous &gt; to ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is alluding to Abraham bargaining with the Holy One over the fate of Sodom in Gen. 18:22-33.</i> When he did not find ten, Abraham the Righteous was silent.

Therefore, one is not authorized to pray more than three <i>Tefillot</i> in a day.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>TBer</i>. 3:8; <i>Ber</i>. 31a; see <i>yBer</i>. 4:1 (7a).</i> But R.

Sam. 2, which argue against reciting the three services at one time.</i> Antoninus asked Our Holy Rabbi: Is it permitted to pray at every hour? He said to him: It is forbidden. He said to him: Why? He said to him: Lest you treat the Most High with frivolity. He did not accept &lt; this answer &gt; from him. What did he do? He went to him early in the morning. He said to him: Greetings, Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Kyrie chaire</i>.</i> An hour later he came in to him. He said to him: {'<i>MNH RTWQ</i>} [Imperator]!<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word originally designated a general, but in imperial times <i>imperator</i> became the title of Roman emperors. Buber has taken this reading from the traditional <i>Tanhuma</i> because he can make no sense of his manuscript, which reads: ’<i>MNH RTWQ</i>.</i> An hour later he &lt; again &gt; said to him: <i>Shalom</i> to you, O King. He said to him: Why are you being disrespectful to the monarchy? He said to him: Let your ears hear what you are putting forth from your mouth. If you, who are flesh and blood, say this in the case of someone who asks after you every hour, how much the more so in the case of one who is disrespectful to the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. Thus one should not bother him all the time.
R. Jose ben Halafta says: There are times for the <i>Tefillah</i>, as stated (in Ps. 69:14 [13]): <small>BUT AS FOR ME, LET MY <i>TEFILLAH</i> COME TO YOU LORD AT AN ACCEPTABLE TIME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yMak</i>. 2:7 (31d); Lam. R. 3:43 (9); M. Pss. 65:4; <i>PRK</i> 24 (or 25):2.</i> When is an acceptable time? When the community prays. One must therefore arise early for the <i>Tefillah</i> since you have nothing greater than the <i>Tefillah</i>. So look at Moses. It was decreed against him that he not enter the land and that &lt; he was &gt; not to see it. But, because he was frequent in prayer (<i>tefillah</i>), (according Deut. 34:1): <small>THE LORD SHOWED HIM THE WHOLE LAND</small>…. And thus did Hezekiah pray and annul the decree &lt; of death against himself &gt; (in I Kings 20:1-11). So also Jacob, when he sent his sons to Egypt, prayed over them (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.

[(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<i>ShDY</i>) GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.] What was the reason for Jacob to bless them with &lt; the formula &gt; <small>GOD <i>ShDY</i></small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10; below, 10:16.</i> To teach you that a lot of afflictions had come upon him. While he was in his mother's womb, Esau had contended with him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED TOGETHER WITHIN HER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 3:1.</i> And so it says (in Amos 1:11): <small>BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD AND DESTROYED HIS WOMB</small>. "His womb" is &lt; what is &gt; written.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><small>DESTROYED HIS WOMB</small> would normally be read as a metaphor and translated by an expression such as “cast off all pity.”</i> Because of Esau he fled to Laban. See how many troubles there were! (Gen. 31:40:) <small>THUS I WAS: BY DAY SCORCHING HEAT CONSUMED ME</small>…. &lt; Look at &gt; how, when he left, &lt; Laban &gt; pursued after him to kill him, [as stated (in Gen. 31:23)]: <small>AND PURSUED AFTER HIM FOR A JOURNEY OF {THREE} [SEVEN] DAYS</small>. He escaped from him; Esau came with the intention of killing him. On account of him he lost all that gift<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron</i>.</i> (according to Gen. 32:15 [14]): <small>TWO HUNDRED SHE-GOATS</small>…. He went away from Esau; the trouble about Dinah came (in Gen. 34). Then after that, the trouble with Rachel &lt; dying &gt; (in Gen. 35:19). Then, after these troubles, he was intending to rest a bit, until there came the trouble about Joseph (in Gen. 37); and after that, the trouble with his father, Isaac, who died (in Gen. 35:29) ten years after the sale of Joseph. So the Scripture has cried out (in Job 3:26): <small>I WAS NOT TRANQUIL, NOT QUIET, HAD NO REST; AND TROUBLE CAME</small>. After that there came upon him the trouble with Simeon (in Gen. 42:24); and after that, the trouble with Benjamin (in Gen. 42:36; 43:3-15). He therefore prayed (in Genesis 43:14) <small>AND MAY GOD <i>ShDY</i></small>. Now he says: The one who said: Enough (<i>DY</i>), to the heavens and to the earth should say: Enough (<i>DY</i>), to my afflictions. For, when the Holy One created the heavens and the earth, they continued expanding until the Holy One said to them: Enough (<i>DY</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 1:11; 3:25. below, 10:16.</i> It is therefore written (in Gen. 43:14): <small>GOD WHO IS ENOUGH (<i>ShDY</i>)</small>.

Siman 13

(Gen. 43:29:) <small>THEN HE (Joseph) RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>. He was happy that he was like his mother, for it is so written: <small>THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>. Immediately (in Gen. 44:1): <small>THEN HE COMMANDED THE ONE WHO WAS OVER HIS HOUSE, SAYING: FILL THE MEN'S SACKS WITH FOOD</small>…. He said to Manasseh<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his son. So below, 10:17; see also Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 44:1, which names Manasseh as Joseph’s steward.</i> (in Gen. 44:1-3): <small>FILL THE SACKS &lt; …. &gt; AND &lt; YOU SHALL PUT &gt; MY GOBLET, THE GOBLET OF SILVER, &lt; IN THE MOUTH OF THE SACK OF THE YOUNGEST &gt;…. AT MORNING LIGHT THE MEN WERE SENT OFF</small>. Why did he not send them away at night? Joseph said: If I send them away at night, there is no creature who could cope with them because they are like wild beasts. (In Gen. 49:9:) <small>JUDAH IS A LION'S WHELP</small>, (in Deut. 33:22): <small>DAN IS A LION'S WHELP</small>, (in Gen. 49:17): <small>DAN SHALL BE A SERPENT</small>, (in Gen. 49:21): <small>NAPHTALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE</small>, (and in Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>.
(Gen. 44:4:) <small>THEY HAD LEFT THE CITY AND HAD NOT GONE FAR</small>. Joseph said: If they go far, there is no creature able to return them.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>ARISE, GO AFTER THE MEN</small>; for as long as the fear of a {knee} [city]<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In the square Hebrew print, the difference between the two readings is slight. Buber is certainly correct in reading “city.” “Knee” must represent a scribal error.</i> is over them.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND, WHEN YOU OVERTAKE THEM</small>. See, he is confounding them with words, now harshly and now gently.
(Gen. 44:5, 13:) <small>IS NOT THIS THE ONE FROM WHICH MY LORD DRINKS … ? SO THEY RENT THEIR CLOTHES</small>…. The Holy One said to them: You caused your father's clothes to be rent for nothing (in Gen. 37:34); so you are rending &lt; your clothes &gt; for nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 84:20; 92:8.</i> (Gen. 44:5, cont.:) <small>THEN EACH ONE LOADED HIS ASS</small>. Not one of them was required for his ass.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10, probably has the correct reading: “Not one of them was required to assist his companion.”</i> So they arose and, striking Benjamin on his shoulder, said to him: Oh you thief, you son of a thief, you have shamed me! You are your mother's son. Thus did she {your mother} shame our father (according to Gen. 31:19): <small>AND RACHEL STOLE THE HOUSEHOLD GODS &lt; OF HER FATHER &gt;</small>. By virtue of these blows with which they smote him on his shoulders, he was worthy of having the Divine Presence rest on his shoulders. It is so stated (of Benjamin in Deut. 33:12): <small>AND HE (the Lord) DWELLS BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS</small>.
(Gen. 44:14:) <small>WHEN JUDAH AND HIS BROTHERS CAME TO JOSEPH'S HOUSE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO JOSEPH'S HOUSE</small>? Did not he not leave &lt; his house &gt; daily to hold court at the seat of judgment?<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>bema</i> (“rostrum”).</i> It is simply that on this day he did not leave &lt; home &gt; so as not to shame his brothers before the Egyptians.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY FELL TO THE GROUND BEFORE HIM</small> to fulfill that which was stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>.
(Gen. 44:15:) <small>THEN JOSEPH SAID TO THEM: WHAT IS THIS DEED THAT YOU HAVE DONE</small>? Joseph said to them: I am telling you for what reason this lad stole it. &lt; He did so &gt; to divine with it and to know where his brother was.
(Gen. 44:16:) <small>BUT JUDAH SAID: WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO MY LORD</small>? What shall we say about the former money? And what shall we speak about the second money? How shall we justify ourselves over the goblet?
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>GOD HAS FOUND OUT THE CRIME OF YOUR SERVANTS</small>. Do not read: "He has found out" but: "He has caused &lt; others &gt; to find out." Two &lt; of us &gt; brothers never enter a banquet hall together because of the &lt; evil &gt; eye. Now all of us find ourselves in a single garden bed through a single offense which took place at our hands. He said to them: This brother of yours was not with you at that time. They said to him: Everything found with the thief is seized with him. He said to them: But, if in the case of your former brother, who neither stole nor caused you grief, you said (in Gen. 37:33 // 44:28): <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>; how much the more &lt; are these words applicable &gt; in the case of this one who has stolen and caused you grief! Go, say to his father: <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>. Now are not &lt; these &gt; words an argument a fortiori? And, if an unfortunate incident which came about through righteous ones (like Joseph) has been sustaining the whole world,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel version in <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10: “So if, in the case of an unfortunate incident which comes about through this righteous person, he has been sustaining all who come into the world…. ” In this version the reference is more clearly to Joseph’s misfortune which resulted in his feeding the world during the famine.</i> how much the more so in the case of merit which the Holy One brings about through them!<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See above, note 35.</i>

[Another interpretation] (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>. Let our master instruct us: Where have they ordained that one says a blessing over the food? Where it is stated (in Deut. 8:10): <small>THEN YOU SHALL EAT, BE FULL, AND BLESS</small>. So much for after &lt; the meal &gt;. Where &lt; is it ordained for &gt; before the meal? R. Hiyya taught in the name of R. Aqiva:<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber</i>. 35a.</i> (according to Lev. 19:24:) <small>&lt; ALL ITS FRUIT SHALL BE &gt; SET ASIDE FOR PRAISES TO THE LORD</small>. &lt; These words &gt; teach that one needs a blessing before &lt; a meal &gt; and after it (since <small>PRAISES</small> is plural). The Holy One said: Just as I need to bring down rain, cause winds to blow, and bring down dews; so you need to bless me and be strictly observant in praying to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10.</i> Do not see yourself in the time of prosperity despising prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel in <i>Tanh</i>. reads: “Do not be scornful in the time of prosperity so as not to pray.”</i> Then, when trouble arrives, you would stand up and pray! No, my child, do not do this; but, before trouble comes, you should pray ahead of time, as stated (in Job 36:19): <small>WILL YOUR CRY FOR HELP BE MAKE READY WHEN THERE IS NO TROUBLE, AND ALL YOUR POWERFUL FORCES</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Biblical translations generally emend the text. The present translation is required by the context of the midrash. So also in <i>Sanh</i>. 44b.</i> You know that in the case of our father Jacob, when Benjamin was with him and he did not know what was going to happen to him, he began to pray ahead of time. It is so stated (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN THAT HE MAY RELEASE TO YOU YOUR OTHER BROTHER AND BENJAMIN</small>. And so the proverb says (in Ecclesiasticus 38:1): <small>HONOR THE PHYSICIAN BEFORE YOU HAVE NEED OF HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The proverb is cited in Aramaic and probably circulated separately. The parallel account in the traditional <i>Tanhuma</i>, however, cites R. Eleazar (ben Pedat) as attributing the Aramaic saying to Ben Sira’s book, where it appears in 38:1. <i>yTa‘an</i>. 3:6 (66d) also gives the saying in Aramaic but simply attributes it to R. Laezar (= Eleazar ben Pedat). Exod. R. 21:7 and <i>PR</i> 25:2 attribute the saying to Eleazar (ben Pedat) but cite it in Hebrew.</i> What is the meaning of (Job 36:19): <small>ALONG WITH ALL YOUR POWERFUL FORCES</small>? That &lt; those who pray ahead of time &gt; in this way have made <small>POWERFUL FORCES</small>.

[(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 32:6): <small>THEREFORE LET EVERY SAINT PRAY UNTO YOU IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small>…. Zavday ben Levi, R. Jose ben Petros, and R. Joshua ben Levi &lt; differed &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">They differed over what verses they cited when they were dying. See <i>yAZ</i> 3:1 (42c). For variations in the verses cited, see Gen. R. 62:2; 92:2; Exod. R. 52:3; M. Pss. 5:11; cf. also Lev. R. 7:2; <i>PRK</i> 24:5.</i> One cited (from Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>; one cited (from Ps. 5:12 [11]): <small>BUT LET ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU REJOICE, LET THEM EVER SING FOR JOY, AND YOU SHALL SHELTER THEM</small>; and one cited (from Ps. 32:6): <small>THEREFORE LET EVERY SAINT PRAY UNTO YOU [IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY (<i>MTs</i>')</small>? In anticipation of the time of the exhaustion (rt.: <i>MTsH</i>) of the day (i.e., in anticipation of the sunset of one's life, at death).
Another interpretation (of Ps. 32:6): <small>IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY (<i>MTs</i>'</small>). In anticipation of the departure (rt.: <i>MTsH</i>) of the soul. {R. Joshua} [R. Ishmael] said: One should pray in anticipation of the departure of the soul, for there is nothing harder than the departure of the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10.</i> How does it pass away? R. Johanan said: It is like the <i>pittore</i> which passes out through the opening of a <i>weshet</i> {i.e., the rope when one is drawing it through a &lt; hawse &gt; hole in a ship to tie it up with it}.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This scribal addition in Buber’s MS is essentially the interpretation of Rashi on <i>Ber</i>. 8a and of the pseudo-Rashi on <i>MQ</i> 28b-29a; but cf. Jastrow, p. 1161, s.v. <i>pittore</i> for an alternative interpretation. See also Eccl. R. 6:6:1; Lev. R. 4:2.</i> So is the soul when it leaves (<i>yots'ah</i>) a person. Thus a person must not trust in himself until the day of his death; and so have our masters taught (in <i>Avot</i> 2:4): <small>DO NOT TRUST [IN YOURSELF] UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. a shorter version of the following story in <i>yShab</i>. 1:3 (3b); above, 1:27.</i> Once upon a time there was a certain man, a sectarian (<i>min</i>) whose master would teach him and say: <small>DO NOT TRUST IN YOURSELF UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>. But he took issue with the words of his master. The Holy One said: This one has come to take issue with the Torah. What did he do to him? He tempted him. Now he went out on the Day of Atonement into a certain garden and saw a certain young woman, who was beautifully and tastefully adorned. There she stood before him, and he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. He talked with her. She said to him: I am someone's wife. He said to her: That's all right. She said to him: I am the wife of a priest. He said to her: That's all right. She said to him: I am menstruating. He said to her: That's all right. And he did not move until he had had sexual intercourse with her. He went home and sat <i>olophyzon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">A variant of the Greek <i>olophyromenos</i>, which means “lamenting.”</i> {i.e., distressed}, thinking about what had come over him. Then his masters came up to visit him, and month after month they found him like someone who was sick, saying: What have I done? Yet he was not sick. What did the Holy One do? He said: How long will he grieve? The Holy One nodded to the same female demon (<i>shedah</i>). So she came and stood before him. She said to him: How long will you grieve? I am that woman with whom you had sexual intercourse. I am a spirit. &lt; It happened &gt; simply because you differed with the words of the sages who have said (in <i>Avot</i> 2:4): <small>DO NOT TRUST IN YOURSELF UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>. David also has agreed, saying: One must pray concerning the departure of his soul. He therefore said (in Ps. 32:6): <small>&lt; THEREFORE LET EVERY SAINT PRAY UNTO YOU &gt; IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small> (i.e., in anticipation of the time of departure).
[Another interpretation: <small>IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small>.] &lt; It means &gt; that someone had to be hoping for something until he knew his end. Who was this? This was Jacob. Although he said (in Gen. 37:33 // 44:28): <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>, he was waiting for the Holy One. In the end he informed him that Joseph was alive. And not only that, but he &lt; himself &gt; brought him the good news that he was alive. (Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34: “And not only that, but his mouth proclaimed the good news that he was alive. Where is it shown? Where it says (in Gen. 43:14, cont.): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN THAT HE MAY RELEASE TO YOU YOUR BROTHER, i.e.. Simeon. THE OTHER ONE, i e., Joseph. AND BENJAMIN, i.e., Benjamin</small>.”</i>

[(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 94:12): <small>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU CHASTISE, O LORD</small>. How is the man blessed? R. Joshua said: If chastisements come upon you, you shall &lt; still &gt; be able to labor in the Torah. These are chastisements of love. But, if you are not able to labor in the Torah, they are chastisements of punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 92:1; see <i>Ber</i>. 5a.</i> (Ibid.:) <small>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU CHASTISE, O LORD; HIM YOU INSTRUCT FROM YOUR TORAH</small>. R. Bisna said: There is no one in the world who does not come into the hands of chastisements. Here is a person who feels pain in his eyes &lt; and &gt; cannot sleep. &lt; Or he feels pain &gt; in his teeth and cannot sleep. Instead he is awake the whole night. But someone &lt; else &gt; is awake the whole night to labor in the Torah. The one is awake, and the other is awake. Ergo: Blessed is a person when his chastisements are in the Torah.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<i>ShDY</i>)</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:10; above, 10:12.</i> R. Alexandri said: Blessed is the man upon whom chastisements come.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 92:1.</i> Then the Holy One says to them: Enough (<i>DY</i>) for you, because (<i>Sh</i>) there is an end to them. Who was this man? This was Jacob when he said to his children: <small>GOD <i>ShDY</i></small>. May God say to my chastisements: Enough (<i>DY</i>) for you. Ergo: <small>GOD ALMIGHTY (<i>ShDY</i>)</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<i>ShDY</i>)</small>. R. Aha said: These heavens were created from a curtain material, and the earth was created from snow.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 1:11; 3:27; 10:12.</i> Thus it is stated (in Is. 40:22): <small>WHO HAS STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN</small>. And the earth &lt; comes &gt; from snow, as stated (in Job 37:6): <small>FOR TO THE SNOW HE SAYS: BECOME EARTH</small>. When the Holy One told them to be created, they continued to expand. R. Aha said: If the Holy One had not told them: Enough (<i>DY</i>), they would have continued to expand until they were raised along with the dead. Jacob said: The one who said to the heavens and earth: Enough (<i>DY</i>) for you, should say to my afflictions: Enough (<i>DY</i>) for you. (Gen. 43:14:) <small>GOD WHO IS ENOUGH (<i>ShDY</i>)</small>.
Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. What is the meaning of this word (<small>ALMIGHTY</small>)? That <small>GOD ALMIGHTY</small> is strong (<i>qasheh</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word also means “hard,” “severe,” “cruel,” and “incomprehensible.”</i> and, if you do his will, behold, he becomes fulfilled for you. Why? Because he is strong (<i>qasheh</i>) in his mercy. Therefore (ibid.): <small>&lt; AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY &gt; GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.

What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 42:3)? <small>SO JOSEPH'S TEN BROTHERS WENT DOWN</small>. When they went down to Egypt, Joseph cunningly issued three <i>prostagmata</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “commands.”</i> {i.e., writs}:

<br>That no slave should enter Egypt to buy grain,
<br>That no one person should walk behind two donkeys, and
<br>That no one should enter until he had written down his name, his father's name, and his grandfather's name.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 10:8; Gen. R. 91:10; above, 10:8, 10.</i>

What did Joseph do? He commanded them to bring to him the names of the people which were written down on each and every day. They came in on the first day and brought him the names of those who had entered &lt; the country &gt;, and so they informed him on each and every day. When Joseph's brothers came down, they all did not enter through one gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pyle</i>.</i> The gatekeeper said to &lt; one of the brothers &gt;: What is your name? He told him: Reuben ben Jacob ben Isaac. So it was also with Simeon, and so with all of them. They brought &lt; the names &gt; that had been written down to Joseph. When he read them, he knew that his brothers were there. He sent for his son, Manasseh. He said: See where they are going. Manasseh went and saw them going about in the marketplace. They went from this marketplace to that marketplace, from this alley to that alley. &lt; Then Joseph &gt; sent after them, and they came to him. When he saw them, he certainly recognized them, <small>BUT</small> (according to Gen. 42:7) <small>HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUT HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM</small>. R. Johanan said: He became a foreigner to them. (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM</small>? He said to them (in vs. 9): <small>YOU ARE SPIES</small>. They said to him (in vs. 10, 13): <small>NO, MY LORD, BUT YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME TO BUY FOOD &lt; … &gt;. WE, YOUR SERVANTS ARE TWELVE BROTHERS</small>. R. Johanan &lt; drew on an Aramaic metaphor and &gt; said: &lt; The matter &gt; is comparable to a raven who brought fire into its nest {i.e., a raven who brought fire into its nest}.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The scribe who copied Buber’s MS felt that this Hebrew rendering was necessary because the midrash renders the metaphor in Aramaic. Gen. R. 91:7 explains that the Holy Spirit lit up within them and made them blurt out that they were brothers.</i> He said to them: Are you brothers? They told him: Yes. Then why did you not all enter by one gate? Because our father ordered us &lt; not to do &gt; so because of the &lt; evil &gt; eye. He said to them (in vs. 16): <small>BY PHARAOH'S LIFE YOU ARE SURELY SPIES</small>. When &lt; Joseph &gt; swore falsely, he swore by Pharaoh's head.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 91:7.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a woman who stole a lamb from the flock and fled. When the shepherd ran after her, she went home and covered it with a garment. The shepherd said to her: Have you seen a lamb? She said to him: May I eat of the flesh of this one lying on the bed, if I know anything &lt; about it &gt; ! So &lt; it was with &gt; Joseph. When he wanted to swear falsely, he swore by Pharaoh's life. (Gen. 42:10:) <small>THEY SAID UNTO HIM: NO, MY LORD, BUT YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME TO BUY FOOD</small>. He said to them: You know that you are spies. Why have you gone and made the rounds of the whole country? They said to him: We had a brother, but we sold him as a slave. And from the hour that we sold him our father has sat around mourning over him. So we have come down &lt; here &gt; with money in our hands, saying: Wherever we find him, we will redeem him. He said to them: Can a person who sells something go back on it? They said to him: For this reason we came down with double &lt; the money &gt; on hand to redeem him. He said to them: What if &lt; his owner &gt; does not want to sell him? They said to him: Even though we are burned &lt; alive &gt; on his account, we will not move until we have redeemed him. He said to them (in Gen. 42:14): <small>IT IS AS I SAID UNTO YOU: YOU ARE SPIES</small>. What did he do (according to vs. 24)? <small>THEN HE TOOK SIMEON FROM THEM &lt; AND BOUND HIM BEFORE THEIR EYES &gt;</small>. He (Joseph) said &lt; to himself &gt;: He bound me and cast me into the pit; I also am binding him. What did they do? They loaded up, went to their father, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 29) <small>RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM</small>. He said to them (in Gen. 43:2): <small>GO AND BUY US A LITTLE FOOD</small>. Judah said to him (in vs. 3): <small>THE MAN SOLEMNLY WARNED US, SAYING: YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE &lt; UNLESS YOUR BROTHER IS WITH YOU &gt;</small>. He said to them: I will not send Benjamin even though I am killed. They said to him: It is better for you to lose one life and not seventy. What did he do? He gave them Benjamin and began to pray for them (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN</small>, seeing that (according to Gen. 42:30): <small>THE MAN &lt; THE LORD OF THE LAND &gt; SPOKE &lt; …HARSHLY &gt;</small>. He therefore said (in Gen. 43:14): <small>BEFORE THE MAN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Jacob prayed that the same man who had previously spoken harshly now would grant them mercy.</i>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. &lt; These words &gt; speak about Israel and about their captivity. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>GRANT YOU MERCY</small>. (Ps. 106:46:) <small>AND HE DID GRANT THEM MERCY BEFORE ALL THEIR CAPTORS</small>.
(Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>THAT HE MAY RELEASE (<i>ShLH</i>) TO YOU</small>. (Mal. 3:23 [4:5]:) <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING (<i>ShLH</i>) YOU &lt; THE PROPHET ELIJAH BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD &gt;</small>.
(Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>YOUR BROTHERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The plural, which is possible in an unpointed text, is necessary here in order to fit the interpretation.</i> &lt; These are the brothers &gt; who are beyond the Sambatyon River.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">A legendary river where the ten tribes were exiled. So Gen. R. 73:6; <i>PR</i> 31:10; Numb. R. 16:25; below, Numb. 4 (suppl.):6; cf. <i>ySanh</i>. 10:6 or 5 (29c). According to Gen. R. 11:5, the river would cease to flow on the Sabbath. Similarly <i>PR</i> 23:8. See also <i>Sanh</i>. 65b. Pliny the Elder, <i>HN</i> 31:18 (24), knows of the legend but places the stream in Judaea. Cf. Josephus, <i>BJ</i> 7:96-99, who locates the river, which he calls <i>Sabbatikon</i>, in Lebanon and says that the Sabbath was the only day on which it did flow.</i>
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE OTHER ONE AND BENJAMIN</small>. These are the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In that hour we shall sing a song, [as stated (in Jer. 31:12):] <small>THEN THEY SHALL COME AND SING ON THE HEIGHT OF ZION, WHERE THEY SHALL BE RADIANT AT THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD: OVER NEW GRAIN, WINE, AND OIL, OVER THE YOUNG OF THE FLOCK AND THE HERD.

Now the evil drive says: Let us eat, drink, and fulfill all our desires; but the good drive says: Let us not eat and drink, but be occupied with Torah. Then we heed the evil drive. Why? Because it is bigger than all of them. (Eccl. 9:14, cont.:) <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>, i.e., sins and transgressions.

[Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 20:5): <small>THE COUNSEL IN ONE'S HEART IS DEEP WATER, BUT ONE WITH UNDERSTANDING SHALL DRAW IT OUT. THE COUNSEL IN ONE'S HEART IS DEEP WATER</small>: This refers to Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

The traditional pointing has the meaning, <small>DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. For another possibility, see below, 11:8.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a cistern which was so deep that no one was able to go down in it. There came one who was astute &lt; enough &gt; to bring a long rope. So he reached his water and drew &lt; some &gt; out of it. Thus Joseph was deep, but Judah came and drew out of him.

Siman 3

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. This text is related (to Job 41:8 [16]): <small>ONE IS SO NEAR TO THE OTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM</small>. This refers to Judah and Joseph, for in whatever Joseph prided himself, Judah came and vanquished, as stated (in Gen. 45:1): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF</small>. To what were they comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 11:3.</i> To a bull that went out; and, when all the beasts fled from him, he kicked (rt.: <i>B'T</i>) at one and gored at another. Then came the lion, but he did not stand up to him. Rather, when the lion appeared and sought out the bull, he was not to be found. So Joseph is likened to the bull, as stated (in Deut. 33:17): <small>LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY</small>. The tribes also have been likened to beasts, and Joseph was priding himself as being over them and despising (rt.: <i>B'T</i>) them. (According to Gen. 42:7) <small>HE BECAME A STRANGER TO THEM</small>. Then goring at a particular one, (according to Gen. 42:24) <small>HE TOOK SIMON FROM THEM</small>. He acted so only until the lion came, &lt; for &gt; (according to Gen. 49:24) <small>JUDAH IS A LION'S WHELP</small>. He sought him out as the bull, but he was not to be found. Rather (according to Gen. 45:1): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF</small>. Why? (Prov. 30:30:) <small>THE LION IS THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THE BEASTS, AND RETREATS BEFORE NONE</small>, even because it is written of him (in Gen. 47:12): <small>AND &lt; JOSEPH &gt; SUSTAINED &lt; HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">One would expect some saying about Judah. Buber’s note here suggests that <small>SUSTAINED</small> be read as two words, apart from the biblical context, and interpreted as “All in all,” i.e., the lion is “all in all” in the world of beasts. Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 11:3: “Who has stood facing a bull? The lion, as stated (Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>.”</i> Also in the world to come a fighting Messiah is going to arise from Joseph, but a Messiah who is to arise from Judah will be stronger than he, as stated (in Zech. 10:6): <small>I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH, &lt; BUT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH I WILL SAVE &gt;</small>.

Siman 4

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 6:1-3): <small>MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR…. YOU ARE ENSNARED IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH…. DO THIS, THEN, MY SON, AND SAVE YOURSELF, &lt; FOR YOU HAVE COME INTO THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR. GO HUMBLE YOURSELF, AND URGE YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;</small>. Joseph said to &lt; Judah &gt;: Why are you multiplying words? I see that people older than you are standing here without speaking. And is not Reuben older than you? Is not Simeon also older than you? Yet none of them are speaking. But in your case, why are you multiplying words? &lt; Judah &gt; said to him: Of all these people, not one of them is anxious about &lt; Benjamin &gt; except me alone because I stood surety &lt; for him &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): <small>I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM</small>. Now I said this to my father, that, if I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I am sinning before you in two worlds, in this world and in the world to come, as stated (in Gen. 44:32): <small>I AM GUILTY BEFORE MY FATHER FOREVER</small>. I therefore give my life for him. Why? (Prov. 6:1, 3:) <small>MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR … &lt; SAVE YOURSELF, FOR YOU HAVE COME UNDER THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;</small>.

Siman 5

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM AND SAID: PRAY (<i>bi</i>), MY LORD, PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK</small>. He said to him: You are bringing injustice (<i>biyah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>bia</i>, i.e., “force” or “an act of violence.”</i> upon us.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 93:6; below, 11:8.</i> Why? Because you said to us (in Gen. 42:18): <small>DO THIS AND LIVE; FOR I FEAR GOD</small>. You are not fearful of the Holy One. Rather you are like Pharaoh, as stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>FOR YOU ARE LIKE PHARAOH</small>. Ergo: You are bringing injustice upon us. He said to him: You are judging neither by the royal law nor by divine law. Under divine law one who is found stealing pays twofold, as stated (in Exod. 22:6 [7]): <small>IF THE THIEF IS FOUND HE SHALL PAY DOUBLE</small>. If he does not have the wherewithal to pay, he shall be sold for his theft. Under royal law one takes everything he has. If you are seizing us under royal law, take for yourself whatever we have on hand; but, if under divine law, if we cannot pay his price, here we are for you as slaves. (Gen. 44:18:) <small>PRAY (<i>bi</i>), MY LORD</small>, you are bringing injustice (<i>biyah</i>) upon us.

Siman 6

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY (<i>bi</i>), MY LORD</small>. By universal custom one who buys a slave and finds him to be a thief returns him. But, in the case of this person (Benjamin) who was found to be a thief, you want to acquire him as a slave! You are suspected of evil things. If you want him to serve you, I know how to serve better than he. If you want him for war, I know how to fight better than he. (Gen. 44:33:) <small>PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD</small>. (Gen. 44:18:) <small>PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK SOMETHING</small>. R. Jeremiah ben Shema'yah has said: He told him: If I make my voice heard, a plague will come over Egypt. <small>PLEASE LET &lt; YOUR SERVANT &gt; SPEAK. PLEASE (<i>N</i>')</small> denotes nothing but Egypt. Thus it is stated (in Nahum 3:8): <small>WERE YOU (Nineveh) ANY BETTER THAN NO-AMON (<i>N'-'MWN</i>)</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Amon was the tutelary god of No, i.e., Thebes.</i> <small>&lt; WHICH SITS BY THE NILE &gt;</small>.
(Gen. 44:18, cont.:) <small>IN THE EARS OF MY LORD</small>. He said to him: Let my words enter your ears. Two of us younger ones entered a great city and destroyed it, as stated (in Gen. 34:25): <small>THAT TWO OF JACOB'S SONS &lt; EACH TOOK HIS SWORD … AND KILLED EVERY MALE &gt;</small>. Now we are all here. If we want, we shall not leave a soul here.
(Gen. 44:18, cont.:) <small>FOR YOU ARE LIKE PHARAOH</small>. He said to him: Just as Pharaoh is the greatest here, and you are second to him; so Daddy is the greatest in the land of Canaan, and I am second to him. He said: I swear: If I should draw my sword from its scabbard, I am beginning with you, and I am winding up with Pharaoh. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 27:17): <small>IRON SHARPENS IRON</small>. It is fitting for the both of them to stand facing each other; it is fitting for a king to boast facing a king. Judah is a king, about whom it is written (in I Chron. 5:2): <small>JUDAH PREVAILED AMONG HIS BROTHERS</small>. Joseph is a king, about whom it is written (in Gen. 41:43): <small>HE LET HIM RIDE IN THE CHARIOT OF HIS DEPUTY</small>. Therefore, both of them were goring each other. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY (<i>bi</i>)</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi</i> can also mean <small>AT ME</small>, and the midrash may have this meaning in mind.</i> <small>MY LORD</small>.

Siman 7

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh! Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): <small>NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD</small>. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &lt; it was that &gt; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This clause may also be translated as follows: “By the scriptural section on the separation of my brother Joseph from me (in Gen. 37:18-36).”</i> I did not touch it. Now &lt; I swear &gt; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): <small>ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph)</small>; nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): <small>THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC</small>; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): <small>AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT</small>; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &lt; By none of these do I swear &gt; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &lt; each one &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sot</i>. 36b (bar); Gen. R. 93:7; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 11:40.</i> He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): <small>BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD</small>. He said to him: Why Bela (<i>BL</i>')? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: <i>BL</i>') from me. Becher (<i>BKR</i>)? Because he was my mother's first-born (rt.: <i>BKR</i>). Ashbel ('<i>ShBL</i>)? Because my brother was captured (<i>NShBH</i>). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (<i>ger</i>) with &lt; merely &gt; the privileges of a transient.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>xenia</i>, i.e., “rights of a foreigner” or “guest privileges.”</i> Naaman (<i>N'M</i>)? Because his words were pleasing (<i>N'M</i>). Ehi ('<i>HY</i>)? Because he was my brother ('<i>HY</i>) from &lt; the same &gt; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means "head")? Because he was older than I. Muppim (<i>MPYM</i>)? Because he learned Torah from our father's mouth (<i>MPY</i>) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: <i>HPP</i>)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: <i>HPP</i>) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (<i>huppah</i>) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: <i>HPP</i>): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: <i>YHP</i>). And Ard ('<i>RD</i>)? Because he brought (rt.: <i>YRD</i>) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): <small>NO, I WILL GO DOWN ('<i>RD</i>) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>. Will you please not bring down ('<i>RD</i>) Daddy to Sheol through grief! And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): <small>FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &lt; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &gt;</small>? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF…. AND HE WEPT ALOUD…. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH</small>. When he said to them: <small>I AM {YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH}</small> … (in vs. 3, cont.): <small>HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM</small>. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 93:11.</i> Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &lt; his &gt; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): <small>FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &lt; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &gt;</small> … !

Siman 8

Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. He drew near to fight with him. Now this language is nothing but the language of warfare. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 10:13): <small>SO JOAB AND {ALL} THE PEOPLE &lt; WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR TO THE BATTLE &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 93:6.</i> Our masters have said: When Judah was filled with wrath, his hairs<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 11:3, specifies: “Two hairs growing out from his heart.”</i> would stand up and break through his garments. There are also those who say that he would take iron beans, put them in his mouth, and crunch them in it when his wrath would arise. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN &lt; JUDAH &gt; DREW NEAR {AND SAID: PRAY (<i>bi</i>), MY LORD</small>, you are bringing injustice (<i>biyah</i>) upon us.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 11:5.</i> Yesterday you told us: You shall bring your younger brother unto me; so we have brought him. Now you have taken him. Is this not injustice?}
(Gen. 44:18:) <small>AND &lt; JUDAH &gt; SAID: PRAY, MY LORD…. FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD</small>. When did Judah discharge his surety? In the days of Goliath. At that time, when Israel was in trouble, what is written (in I Sam. 17:16)? <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING</small>. &lt; He was &gt; cursing and reviling. Saul began sending out a herald &lt; to proclaim &gt; (as implied in I Sam. 17:25): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM THAT THE KING SHALL ENRICH HIM &lt; WITH GREAT RICHES &gt;</small>…. Now you find that anyone who curses is liable for death, as stated (in Lev. 24:16): <small>AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small> … but that wicked man had been cursing (according to I Sam. 17:16): <small>FOR FORTY DAYS</small>. Moses said (in Deut. 7:10): <small>AND &lt; GOD &gt; INSTANTLY REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM WITH DESTRUCTION</small>. In the case of someone wicked who performs a righteous act, the Holy One renders it unfit &lt; by giving him his reward &gt; during his life in this world in order to destroy him in the world to come; but for the righteous, he sets aside their righteous acts for the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">M.

Ruth 1:7, 14), [the Holy One repaid her for it]. So from her the Holy One raised four heroes.

Jesse said to his son David: Now is the time to make good on the surety of your ancestor who became surety for Benjamin under the hand of his father, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): <small>I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM</small>. Now go and discharge him from his surety. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 17:18): <small>SEE ALSO TO THE WELFARE OF YOUR BROTHERS, AND TAKE THEIR TOKEN</small>. Now <small>THEIR TOKEN ('<i>RBH</i>)</small> is nothing but a surety (<i>'RBWT</i>). What did David do? He went and made good on the surety by killing Goliath. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as you have risked your life for Saul, since he is from the tribe of Benjamin, even as your ancestor Judah did for Benjamin &lt; himself &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 44:33): <small>AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD</small> … so I am placing the Sanctuary &lt; both &gt; within your territory and within the territory of Benjamin. And where is it shown that the Sanctuary is &lt; both &gt; within the inheritance of Benjamin and within the inheritance of Judah? Where one text (Gen. 49:27) says: <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF; IN THE MORNING HE CONSUMES PREY</small>, i.e., the dawn <i>tamid</i> (sacrifice), <small>AND IN THE EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL</small>, i.e., the twilight <i>tamid</i>; while another text (Ps. 48:3 [2]) says: <small>BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &lt; EVEN MOUNT ZION &gt;</small>. By your life, moreover, when all the tribes are going into exile, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are not going into exile along with them. Why? Because these two tribes believed in me and sanctified my name in the sea with Moses. R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Levi: When the sea was split open for Israel, there was mire in it. Now the tribe of Reuben said to the tribe of Simeon: From mud you have come and to mud you are going. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 12:1): <small>EPHRAIM SURROUNDS ME WITH DECEIT, THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH FALSE-HOOD</small>…. What did the tribes of Judah and Benjamin do? They sanctified the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 68:28 [27]): <small>LITTLE BENJAMIN IS THERE RULING OVER THEM, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH IN THEIR GLORY</small>….
Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY, MY LORD</small>. (Vs. 19:) <small>MY LORD ASKED</small>. It is also stated (in vs. 20): <small>UNTO MY LORD</small>. (Vs. 33:) <small>AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN &lt; AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The point of all these citations is to demonstrate that Judah has now humbled himself.</i> The Holy One said to him: Behold, you have now let go of your former power, and spoken supplications. By your life, in spite of what I said (in Hos. 12:3 [2]): <small>THE LORD HAS A LAWSUIT WITH JUDAH</small>, I will instead be gracious and have compassion on you. It is so stated (in Is. 57:16): <small>FOR I WILL NOT CARRY ON A LAWSUIT FOREVER</small>. And the <small>EVER (in FOREVER)</small> is nothing but a reference to Judah, since it is stated (in Joel 4:20 [3:20]): <small>BUT JUDAH SHALL BE INHABITED FOREVER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <small>FOR</small> in <small>FOREVER</small> can mean <small>AGAINST</small>, Is. 57:16 is therefore understood to mean: <small>FOR I WILL NOT CARRY ON A LAWSUIT AGAINST JUDAH</small>.</i>

Just as one goes clothed, so one comes clothed. Thus it is written (in Job 38:14): <small>IT IS CHANGED LIKE CLAY UNDER A SEAL; THEY STAND FORTH AS &lt; IN &gt; A GARMENT</small>. From whom do you learn this? From Samuel. When Saul raised him, what did he say to the woman (of Endor)? He said to her: What do you see, <small>AND</small> (according to I Sam. 28:14) <small>SHE SAID: IT IS AN OLD MAN RISING, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>; for he had been so clothed, as stated (in I Sam. 2:19): <small>HIS MOTHER WOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROBE FOR HIM</small>. So why is it that, just as one goes (to the grave), so one comes &lt; back &gt; ? So that the wicked of the world will not say: After they died, would the Holy One have healed them and later brought them &lt; back &gt;? It would seem that these are not the same ones (who died), but others. The Holy One said: If so, let them rise just as they went (to the grave), and afterwards I will heal them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 43:10): <small>&lt; SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT &gt; … BEFORE ME NO GOD WAS FORMED</small>. Then later the beasts are healed, as stated (in Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER</small>…. And why? Because it (the serpent)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For this interpretation, see Gen. R. 95:1 and also 20:5.</i> has brought everything to dust.
Another interpretation (of Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER, &lt; AND THE LION LIKE THE OX SHALL EAT STRAW &gt;</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>THE WOLF</small>: This is Benjamin, as stated (in Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>.

When the hour arrived for him to go down with them, they placed him in their midst and watched over him. And so Joseph (in Gen. 43:29): <small>LIFTED HIS EYES AND SAW HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>….

When Joseph's brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): <small>JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &lt; … &gt; HIS HEART GREW FAINT</small>, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): <small>FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM</small>. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion</i>.</i> &lt; indicating &gt; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer ('<i>GLH</i>, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons ('<i>GLH</i> in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): <small>SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS</small>. &lt; This verse is &gt; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): <small>AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS</small>. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &lt; His &gt; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): <small>EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R.

Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): '<i>QB</i> (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;</small>…. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): <small>AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN'S PROSPERITY</small>.

Levi: In regard to the trumpets which Moses made in the desert (according to Numb. 10:1-10) when he was at the point of death, the Holy One hid them lest he blow on them (the trumpets) for them (the Israelites) to come to him. &lt; This act was &gt; to fulfill what is stated (in Eccl. 8:8): <small>&lt; NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND TO CONTAIN THE WIND &gt;, NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 12:2; Gen. R. 96:3; Numb. R. 15:15; Eccl. R. 8:8:1.</i>
And when Zimri committed that act (of whoredom), what is written (in Numb. 25:8): <small>THEN HE (Phinehas) WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE CHAMBER &lt; AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM &gt;</small>. But how did Phinehas come to speak before Moses? In order to fulfill what is stated (in Eccl. 8:8) <small>NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 12:2: “So where was Moses? And was not Phinehas speaking before Moses? It was simply in order to fulfill….” So also Gen. R. 96:3. I.e., since Moses’ death was drawing near, another was already assuming his authority.</i> [Now "death" is nothing] but a word of humiliation. The saving act was given to Phinehas, and he humiliated Moses.
And also in the case of David, it is written of him (in I Kings 1:1): <small>NOW KING DAVID WAS OLD</small>. Then, when he was about to die, what is written (in I Kings 2:1)? <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>. "King David" is not written here but <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID &lt; TO DIE &gt; DREW NEAR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., David lost the royal title shortly before his death. Deut.

When? When he was approaching death (according to the beginning of the verse): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 47:29). What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>? Resh Laqish said: The Holy One said to him (Jacob): By your life, you are being hidden (from the world), but you are not dying.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 96:4.</i> (Gen. 47:29:) <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., since the time only <small>DREW NEAR</small> but never fully arrived, Jacob did not quite die. Thus, in the description of his so-called death (in vs. 31), Jacob merely <small>BOWED DOWN UPON THE HEAD OF THE BED</small>. Cf. <i>Ta‘an</i>. 5b, according to which Jacob lived on through his offspring.</i>
Another interpretation (of Gen. 47:29). What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>? The day (of your death) cries out against you for saying that it should stand still. &lt; The situation &gt; is like someone who says: So-and-so has drawn near &lt; to fight &gt; against his friend. Ergo (in Gen. 47:29): <small>DREW NEAR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">“Draw near” can be used in the sense of “attack” in Hebrew. The midrash here is picturing a person’s last day crying out against any attempt to extend life by trying to keep the day from ending.</i>
Our masters have said: Everyone about whom a drawing near was stated never attained the age of his ancestors. It is written (in I Kings 2:1): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR;</small> so he did not attain the age of his ancestors Boaz, Obed, and Jesse. Our masters have said: They lived more than four hundred years &lt; in all &gt; ; David only lived seventy years. He did not reach the age of his ancestors; therefore, a drawing near was written about him. Amram was alive a hundred and thirty {-three} [-seven] years, but Moses (his son) only lived to a hundred and twenty. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD, THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>. And in the case of Jacob, a drawing near is written about him because he did not attain the age of his ancestors. Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years; Isaac, a hundred and eighty; but Jacob, a hundred and forty-seven. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Gen. 47:29): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.

(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>HE SUMMONED HIS SON JOSEPH</small>. Why did he not call Reuben and Judah?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Gen. 12:3; Gen. R. 96:5.</i> Reuben was the first-born, and Judah was a king; yet he left them alone and called Joseph. &lt; It is &gt; simply because the power to act was in his hand. Therefore: <small>HE SUMMONED HIS SON JOSEPH</small>.
(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>AND SAID [TO HIM]: PLEASE, IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES, &lt; PLEASE PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH &gt; AND ACT TOWARD ME WITH FIDELITY AND TRUTH</small>. But is there a false fidelity for him to say <small>WITH FIDELITY AND TRUTH</small>? Why &lt; then did he speak &gt; so? A common<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes</i>, which means “amateur.”</i> &lt; Aramaic &gt; proverb says: When your friend's son dies, suffer &lt; with him &gt;; when your friend dies, cut loose &lt; from sorrow &gt;. &lt; Jacob &gt; said to him: If you act towards me with fidelity after my death, that is true fidelity.
(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>. Why? Because the end of Egypt is to be smitten with lice, and they would be swarming under my body.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 96:5(6).</i> Therefore: <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>.
Another reason why Jacob did not want to be buried in Egypt was lest they produce idolatry through him; for, just as punishment is exacted from the worshipers of idolatry, so is punishment exacted from the idolatry itself, as stated (in Exod. 12:12): <small>AND ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS; I AM THE LORD</small>. And so you find with Daniel when he interpreted the dream for Nebuchadnezzar. What is written (in Dan. 2:46)? <small>THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR FELL ON HIS FACE, PAID HOMAGE TO DANIEL, AND SAID TO OFFER HIM GRAIN AND INCENSE</small>. But Daniel did not want it. He said: Just as punishment is exacted from the worshipers of idolatry, so is punishment exacted from it (the idolatry). And so you find in the case of Hiram, when he made himself a god, what is written of him (in Ezek. 28:2)? <small>BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS PROUD, YOU HAVE SAID: I AM A GOD</small>. The Holy One said to him (in vs. 3): <small>SEE, YOU ARE WISER THAN DANIEL</small>. When Nebuchadnezzar wanted to sacrifice to him, he did not want it; but you have made yourself a god. What is your end (according to Ezek. 28:17)? <small>I HAVE CAST YOU {UNTO} [UPON] THE GROUND</small>….
Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:29, cont.): Jacob said: So that the Egyptians would not be redeemed through me, since they are likened to the ass. It is so stated (in Ezek. 23:20): <small>WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>. And I have been likened to the flock, where it is stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED FLOCK</small>. It is also written (in Exod. 34:20): <small>BUT THE FIRSTLING OF AN ASS YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB</small>. Lest they be redeemed through me, for that reason (according to Gen. 47:29), <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>.

(Gen. 47:30:) <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS</small>…. Why do all the ancestors search for and cherish burial in the land of Israel?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 96:5(7).</i> R. Hananiah said: R. Joshua ben Levi said: There is a reason for this (in Ps. 116:9): <small>I WILL WALK BEFORE THE LORD IN THE LANDS OF THE LIVING</small>. Our masters have said two things in the name of R.

Because the dead in the land of Israel shall be the first to revive in the days of the Messiah and enjoy the messianic years.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 7:23, and the references noted there.</i> R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: The one who dies outside of the land and is buried there has two deaths. Where is it shown?

Then afterwards (in vs. 14): <small>AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. Resh Laqish said: Scripture clearly states that, when they arrive in the land of Israel, the Holy One puts breath in them, as stated (in Is. 42:5): <small>WHO GIVES BREATH TO THE PEOPLE UPON IT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The antecedent of <small>IT</small> is <i>ha’arets</i>, which is usually translated here as <small>THE EARTH</small> but can also mean <small>THE LAND</small>.</i> <small>AND SPIRIT TO THOSE WHO WALK THEREON</small>.

(Gen. 47:30:) <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS</small>. Jacob said to Joseph: If you do for me as I tell you, well and good; but, if not, my soul shall depart from me. He said to him: I am doing so for you! He said to him (in vs. 31): <small>SWEAR &lt; … &gt;! AND HE SWORE TO HIM</small>. When he had departed, what is written (in Gen. 50:12)? <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM [JUST] AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>.

<br>One was in the days of Ezra. When they came back from Babylon, the Holy One wanted to absolve them of the tithes. What did they do? They arose and decreed on their own that they would tithe, as stated (in Neh. 10:38 [37]): <small>&lt; AND THAT WE SHOULD BRING TO THE PRIESTS, UNTO THE STOREROOMS IN THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD &gt;, THE FIRST OF OUR DOUGH, THE GRAIN OFFERINGS, THE FRUIT OF &lt; EVERY TREE, WINE AND OIL &gt;</small>…. What did they do? They wrote it in a book and placed it in the Temple. The next day they entered and found it sealed because the Holy One had concurred with them. Thus it is stated (in Neh. 10:1 [9:38]): <small>BECAUSE OF ALL THIS, WE ARE MAKING A FIRM COVENANT {SEALING IT OVER} AND [PUTTING IT IN WRITING, AND UPON] THE SEALED COPY</small>….
<br>And one was in the days of Mordecai and Esther, as stated (in Esth. 9:27): <small>&lt; THE JEWS &gt; INSTITUTED AND TOOK &lt; UPON THEMSELVES, THEIR DESCENDANTS, AND UPON ALL WHO WOULD JOIN THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT FAIL TO KEEP THESE TWO DAYS &gt;</small>….

Ergo (in Ps. 57: [2]): <small>I SHALL CALL TO GOD MOST HIGH, TO THE GOD WHO BRINGS THINGS TO COMPLETION FOR MY BENEFIT</small>.

(Gen. 49:4:) <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER, YOU SHALL NO LONGER EXCEL</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AS WATER?</small> R. Jeremiah and R. Nathan differ. One said &lt; it was &gt; to his discredit, and the other said &lt; it was &gt; to his credit. What does it mean &lt; when interpreted &gt; to his discredit? <small>AS WATER</small>. You have left yourself nothing. Instead &lt; you became &gt; <small>AS WATER</small>. How so? When one empties a cask of honey, he leaves a little in it. When one pours with water in it, he leaves nothing in it. So you have left yourself nothing of merit; instead &lt; you are as &gt; <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>. But the other said &lt; it was &gt; to his credit. What is the meaning of <small>AS WATER</small>? Anyone who empties honey or oil leaves a little.

They praise him for being handsome; and he is handsome, as stated (in Cant. 5:10): <small>MY BELOVED IS BRIGHT AND RUDDY</small>. They praise him for being merciful; and he is merciful, as stated (in Deut. 4:31): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A MERCIFUL GOD</small> …. Ergo (in Ps. 48:11 [10]): <small>LIKE YOUR NAME, O GOD, SO DOES YOUR PRAISE &lt; REACH &gt; TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: See what is written (in Exod. 15:11): <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES &lt; AND &gt; DOING WONDERS</small>. Huna bar Abbin the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES</small>? God is awesome over &lt;and above &gt; all your praises. Ergo (in Exod. 15:11): <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES</small>. R. Simon said: See what David said (in I Chron. 29:11) <small>TO YOU, O LORD, BELONG THE GREATNESS, THE MIGHT…; YOUR NAME IS EXALTED AS HEAD OVER ALL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text here reads somewhat differently.</i> &lt;Here is&gt; the greatness for which we praise you.
R. Abbin the Levite said: See how the men of the Great Synagogue praised the Holy One!

Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 147:3–4): <small>WHO HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED….

What did they see? They saw that, as long as Jacob was alive, Joseph dined with them, and they would eat at his table. Then, when Jacob was dead, they did not eat at his table. Thus it is stated: <small>WHEN JOSEPH'S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD</small>, they said: There is evil hidden in Joseph's heart; (ibid., end:) <small>AND HE WILL SURELY REPAY US FOR ALL THE EVIL WHICH WE RENDERED HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

"The transgression of your servants" is not written here but <small>THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE SERVANTS OF THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER</small>. Although your father is dead, know that his God is alive.

Another interpretation (of Gen. 50:21): He said to them: You are ten and have not overcome me. Now, since I am one, shall I overcome ten? Ergo (in Gen. 50:21): <small>SO HE COMFORTED THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meg</i>. 16b.</i>
Another interpretation: David said (in Ps. 147:3): <small>WHO HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED</small>…. These are the tribes since they had a broken heart, saying &lt;that&gt; Joseph might kill them.

It is simply that as long as Joseph was alive, the burden of the Egyptians did not come upon them; but, as soon as Joseph was dead, the burden of the Egyptians was set upon them.

(Exod. 1:6:) <small>THEN JOSEPH DIED, AND ALL HIS BROTHERS</small>. Although they had died, (according to vs. 7) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE FRUITFUL AND PROLIFIC</small>. R.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:7): <small>AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM</small>.

(Exod. 1:8:) <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE OVER EGYPT</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: Was he &lt;really&gt; a new king?

Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE OVER EGYPT</small>. He was &lt; actually &gt; the former Pharaoh. It is simply that they said to him: Come and let us team up<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nizdawweg</i>. Cf. the Gk.: <i>zeugnumi</i>. Cf. also the Greek words, <i>zugon</i> and <i>zeugos</i>.</i> against this people. He said to them: Up to now we have existed on what belongs to them. So are we to unite against them?

Since he did not hearken to them, they immediately dethroned him for three months. When he saw that they had brought him down, he said to them: I will hearken to you in whatever you say. Ergo (in Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE</small> (after having been deposed for three months).
The prophet said (in Hos. 5:7): <small>THEY HAVE BETRAYED THE LORD BECAUSE THEY HAVE BORNE ALIEN CHILDREN</small>, in that they begot &lt;them&gt; without circumcising &lt;them&gt;.

NEW</small> (<i><small>HDSh</small></i> voweled as <i>hadash</i>) is &lt;how the&gt; written text &lt;should be read&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Thus voweled Hos. 5:7 would read: “A new man (i.e., a new pharaoh) shall devour them.”</i> Ergo (in Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE &lt;OVER EGYPT</small> &gt;, <small>WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH</small>. Nor was he acquainted with Joseph, since it says: <small>WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH</small>. R. Abbin b. R., the Levite said: To what is the matter comparable?

Now he is doing such &lt;a thing&gt; to this &lt;governor&gt;; tomorrow he will do it me. So &lt;it was with&gt; Pharaoh.

Cf. the Gk.: <i>paradeisos</i>, i.e., “paradise.”</i> and brought in the workers. Now by the orchard gate there was a certain storehouse full of everything good. The king said: Whoever does his work wholeheartedly will receive his reward from here, but whoever does not do his work wholeheartedly, him I shall return to my palace<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>palatium</i>.</i> and judge. Who is this king? This is the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. And what is the garden? It is this world. Within it the Holy One has put the children of Adam so that they may observe the Torah. But he has made a stipulation with them and said to them: For everyone who truly observes the Torah, here is paradise &lt; lying &gt; before him; but for everyone who does not truly observe the Torah, here is Gehinnom &lt; lying &gt; before him. The Holy One said: Although I seemed to have removed my Divine Presence from the Sanctuary, still (in Ps. 11:4): <small>MY EYES BEHOLD, &lt;MY EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small> &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text of this verse reads “his” for <small>MY</small> in both places.</i> Whom does he test? (According to vs. 5:) <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. And why does he not test the wicked? R. Jannay said: When the flax worker is pounding away and sees that the flax is good, he pounds it a lot; but, when he sees that it is not good, he does not pound on it, lest it be spoiled.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 32:3; 34:2; 55:2; Cant. R. 2:16:2.</i> Ergo (in Ps. 11:4:) <small>HIS EYES BEHOLD, HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. [And whom does he test? The righteous, as stated (in vs. 5):] <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. R. Isaac said: In what does he test the righteous? In the pasture. David was tested in the pasture, as stated (in Ps. 78:71): <small>HE BROUGHT HIM FROM FOLLOWING THE NURSING EWES TO SHEPHERD &lt;HIS PEOPLE JACOB, EVEN ISRAEL HIS INHERITANCE&gt;</small>. Amos was tested in the pasture, [as stated (in Amos 7:15):] <small>BUT THE LORD TOOK ME FROM FOLLOWING THE FLOCK</small>. Moses also was tested in the pasture. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 3:1:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &lt;THE FLOCK&gt;</small>….

What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 2:16)? <small>NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS</small>.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN MOSES ROSE UP AND SAVED</small> (a form of <i>hoshia'</i>) <small>THEM</small>. Now this word (<i>hoshia</i>') is only &lt;used of&gt; a deliverance (rt.: <i><small>NTsL</small></i>) from water.

Thus <small>CONSENTED</small> (<i>wayyo'el</i>, rt.: <small>Y'L</small>) is actually a word of lodging, &lt;in accord with&gt; what is stated (in Jud. 19:6): <small>SO NOW PLEASE CONSENT</small> (rt.: <i><small>Y'L</small></i>) <small>TO STAY THE NIGHT</small>. (Exod. 2:21, cont.:) <small>AND HE GAVE MOSES HIS DAUGHTER ZIPPORAH</small>.

What is the meaning of <small>HE WAS TENDING &lt;THE FLOCK&gt;</small>? R.

(Exod. 3:1, cont.:) <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. Why was he seeking <small>THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>? In order to keep himself far away from despoiling (the pasturage of others).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 2:3.</i> Another interpretation: He sought the desert because he saw that he would receive greatness from the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Tanh. Exod. 1:14; Exod. R. 2:4.</i> Torah came from the desert; commandments came from the desert; a tabernacle came from the desert; the Divine Presence came from the desert; kingdoms and priesthood came from the desert; the well came from the desert; the manna came from the desert; clouds of glory came from the desert. For that reason he sought <small>THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>.
(Exod. 3:1, cont.:) <small>AND HE CAME TO HOREB, THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD</small>. R. Simeon ben Jose ben Leqonya said: Moses' flock went forty days without eating and without tasting anything, just as Elijah, of blessed memory, did. [It is so stated (in I Kings 19:8): <small>ARISING, HE ATE AND DRANK. THEN ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT FOOD HE WENT FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS UNTO HOREB, THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD</small>.]
Another interpretation (of Exod. 3:1): <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. R. Joshua ben Qorhah said: &lt;The Holy One&gt; portended to him that his flock (the Israelites) would perish in the desert and that he would be removed (i.e., die) along with them. (Exod. 3:1:) <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK</small>. &lt;Thereby the Holy One&gt; was hinting to him that he would drive the children of Israel forty years. Then after that he would be removed. So also in the case of Moses, when he sought the needs of Israel. When the Holy One, blessed be he, said to him: Go on my mission, Moses said to him (in Cant. 1:7): <small>TELL ME, YOU WHOM MY SOUL LOVES, WHERE DO YOU TEND &lt;YOUR FLOCK</small> &gt;…? How many midwives are there among them? How many are pregnant among them? How many ointments have you prepared for the pregnant ones who are among them? <small>TELL ME, YOU WHOM MY SOUL LOVES</small>. The Holy One answered and said to him (in Cant. 1:8): <small>IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, O FAIREST AMONG WOMEN, COME OUT IN THE TRACKS OF THE FLOCK</small>…. Ergo (in Exod. 3:1): <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. When he reached Horeb, what is immediately written (in vs. 2)? <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>. Why <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>? In order to attract him. When he came to Sinai and saw that fire, he would be awe-struck.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The verb here normally means “be afraid.” If it is so understood, there should probably be a negative here, i.e., “he would not be afraid,” in agreement with <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34 and <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:14.</i> Ergo: <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>. Another interpretation: Why <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>? Because a flame is given from two thirds.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:14 (as interpreted by Enoch Zundel’s commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef</i>), elaborates further: “Why <small>IN A FLAME</small> (<i><small>LBH</small></i>) <small>OF FIRE</small>? &lt;Because it&gt; is from the upper two thirds of a bush, as the heart (<small>LB</small>) is placed in the upper two thirds of a human.” So also <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr</i>. 34 and Exod. R. 2:5.</i> Why <small>FROM THE MIDST OF A THORN BUSH</small> and not from the midst of another tree? The Holy One said (in Ps. 91:15): <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small>. Now they (the Israelites) were placed in the &lt; thorns of&gt; slavery; so shall I be revealed from the midst of another tree? Therefore, &lt;I was revealed&gt; (in Exod. 3:2): <small>FROM THE MIDST OF A THORN BUSH</small>, because it is all thorns.

(Exod. 3:3:) <small>SO MOSES SAID: I MUST TURN ASIDE TO LOOK</small>. R. Johanan said: Moses walked three steps.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:15; cf. Exod. R. 2:6.</i> Resh Laqish said: he did not walk but merely twisted his neck (to look). The Holy One said to him: You took the trouble to look. By your life I will appear to you. Immediately (in Exod. 3:4): <small>GOD CALLED UNTO HIM FROM THE MIDST OF THE THORN BUSH AND SAID: MOSES, MOSES! AND HE SAID: HERE I AM</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have said: <small>HERE I AM</small>. By your life, the hour will come when you will say a prayer over Israel, and I will immediately answer you &lt;with these words&gt;. It is so stated (in Is. 58:9): <small>THEN, WHEN YOU CALL, THE LORD SHALL ANSWER; WHEN YOU CRY FOR HELP, HE SHALL SAY: HERE I AM</small>.

(Exod. 4:18:) <small>THEN MOSES WENT AND RETURNED UNTO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHER</small> (i.e., Jethro). This text is related (to Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. R. Papias interpreted &lt;the verse as follows &gt;: Because he stands alone in his world, there is no one to interfere with him. Whatever he wants to do, he does, as stated (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:18; <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 4:21; B <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Beshallah</i>, 7; Cant. R. 1:9:1; cf. Exod. R. 4:3; cf. also Gen. R. 21:5.</i> R. Aqiva said to him: Enough from you, Papias! One does not so interpret. What is the meaning of (Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM</small>? Just like the one who petitions &lt;here&gt; below, so is one who petitions above. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Dan. 4:14 [17]): <small>THE RULING IS BY THE DECREE OF THE WATCHERS, AND THE PETITION</small> {<small>BY</small>} <small>THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONES &lt; SO THAT THE LIVING MAY KNOW THAT THE MOST HIGH IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE HUMAN REALM</small> &gt;…. Just as one argues <i>halakhah</i> &lt;here&gt; below, so it is above. So everything &lt;proceeds&gt; with justice. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 10:21): <small>BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH; &lt;FOR NO ONE IS STANDING BY ME AGAINST THESE</small> (i.e., against Persia and Greece) <small>EXCEPT YOUR PRINCE MICHAEL&gt;</small>. When the Holy One argues a case, he says: how did the judgment of such a person come out? And they say: It came out this way. Then the Holy One agrees with them. From whom have you learned &lt;this custom &gt;? From Micaiah. See what is written (in I Kings 22:19): <small>BUT</small> {<small>MICAIAH</small>} <small>SAID: HEAR, THEREFORE, THE WORD OF THE LORD: I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left above, as it says: <small>TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>? It is simply that the ones on the right tip the balance toward the side of merit, and the ones on the left tip the balance toward the side of guilt. Ergo, everything &lt;proceeds&gt; with justice. So why is it that (in Job 23:13) <small>HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM</small>? Because he alone in his world has knowledge of his creatures.
Another interpretation (of Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? &lt;AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES&gt;</small>. Because he stands alone in his world, no one refutes his words. Look at how much Jonah resisted going on his mission; yet it is stated (in Jonah 3:3): <small>THEN JONAH AROSE AND WENT UNTO NINEVEH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LORD'S COMMAND</small>…. &lt;When&gt; Jeremiah said to the Holy One (in Jer. 1:6): <small>I AM &lt;BUT&gt; A LAD</small>, the Holy One said to him (in vs. 7): <small>DO NOT SAY: I AM &lt;BUT&gt; A LAD; FOR, WHEREVER I SEND YOU, YOU SHALL GO</small>…. He did not budge until he went on the mission of the Holy One. Ergo (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. In the case of Moses also: When the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): <small>COME, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>, Moses said (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. The Holy One had said to him: I am saying to you: <small>COME, I WILL SEND YOU</small>; but you say: <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. Let us see whose &lt;will&gt; prevails. He did not budge until he <i>went</i> (on his mission), as stated (in Exod. 4:18): <small>THEN MOSES WENT</small> (on his mission) <small>AND</small> (afterwards) <small>RETURNED UNTO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHER</small> (i.e., Jethro).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse as referring to two separate acts, the fulfilling of the divine mission as represented by the verb <i><small>WENT</small></i> and the return to Jether. Exod. R. 4:4 explains further that apart from this interpretation the word <i><small>WENT</small></i> would be superfluous.</i>

What is written above of the matter (in Exod. 3:4)? <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT HE HAD TURNED ASIDE TO LOOK, GOD CALLED UNTO HIM FROM THE MIDST OF THE THORN BUSH AND SAID: MOSES, MOSES</small>! R. Abba bar Kahana said: Everyone whose name is doubled has a share in both worlds (i.e., this world and the world to come):<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:18; <i>Tanh</i>.

He said to them: Terah also is to have a share in both worlds, for our father Abraham did not die until he had received the good news about the fact that his father Terah had repented, as stated (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE</small>. &lt; Abraham &gt; said to him: Should I go to my ancestors with whatever good works you have saved up for him?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:18, which reads: “With whatever good works2have saved up?”</i> At that time the Holy One brought the good news and said to him: By your life, your father Terah has repented.

(Exod. 4:20:) <small>SO MOSES TOOK HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND MOUNTED THEM ON AN ASS</small>. This is one of the passages which our masters changed for King Ptolemy (II Philadelphus) when they wrote the Torah for him in Greek.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:22; <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha</i>, 14; <i>Meg</i>. 9ab; similarly Gen. R. 8:11; Exod. R. 5:5; <i>ARN</i>, B, 37; cf. <i>Soferim</i> 1:7.</i> These &lt; passages &gt; are the following:
(Gen. 1:1) "God created in the beginning" (with this word order).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This wording, which puts “God” first in the sentence, does not agree with the Septuagint, which follows the Masoretic Text.</i>
(Gen. 1:27) "Male and his female he created them."<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The only difference from the Masoretic Text is that “them” is expressed as a verbal suffix instead of as a separate word, nor does the Septuagint make any change. The <i>Tanhuma</i> parallel has “created him.” Other parallels (e.g., the <i>Mekhilta</i>) read: “A male and his female parts he created him.”</i>
(Gen. 2:2) "So he finished on the sixth day and rested on the seventh."<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The emendation agrees with the Septuagint and avoids the suggestion that, by finishing on the seventh day, the Holy One worked on the Sabbath.</i>
(Gen. 1:27) "Then God created the human in an image and in a likeness."<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text here reads: “<small>THEN GOD CREATED THE HUMAN IN HIS IMAGE, IN THE IMAGE OF GOD HE CREATED HIM</small>.” The Septuagint follows the Masoretic Text in affirming the divine nature of the human image but alters the text to read: “God made the human, according to the image of God he made him.”</i>
(Gen. 11:7) "Come, let me go down and confound."<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Again unlike the Septuagint as well as the Masoretic Text, this passage stresses the oneness of the Holy One by changing “us” to “me.”</i>
(Gen. 49:6) "For in their anger they slew a bull, and in their delight they uprooted a manger."<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Against both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, the emendation clears Simeon and Levi of homicide.</i>
(Exod. 4:20) "So Moses took his wife and children and had them ride on a carrier of human beings."<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the emendation avoids the indignity of having Moses’ family ride on an ass.</i>
(Exod. 12:40) "Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt and in other lands &lt;was four hundred and thirty years&gt;."<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The emendation tends to agree with the Septuagint, which reads: “in Egypt and in the land of Canaan,” over against the Masoretic Text, which simply reads: “<small>IN EGYPT</small>.” Cf. the parallels in <i>Tanhuma</i> and in <i>Mekhilta</i>, which add “the land of Goshen” to Egypt and Canaan. The reason for the additions is that the Biblical record indicates elsewhere that Israel must have spent far less than four hundred years in Egypt. See Rashi on Exod. 12:40.</i>
(Deut. 4:19) "Which the <small>LORD</small> has allotted to give light &lt;to all peoples &gt;."<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint omit “to give light.” Without these words, one might understand the verse to mean that, while Israel was forbidden to bow down to the heavenly host, they were allotted to other peoples as lesser deities.</i>
(Deut. 17:3) "Which I have not commanded those who serve them."<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint omit “those who serve them.”</i>
They also wrote (in Lev. 11:6): "The slender footed." They did not write: <small>THE HARE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The Septuagint has “hare” here, but the Greek word used (<i>dasupous</i>) has the literal meaning, “hairy footed.” According to <i>Meg</i>. 9b, The Greek translators avoided the more common word for “hare” (i.e., <i>Lagos</i>) because it was the name of Ptolemy’s wife. In actual fact, however, it was Ptolemy’s father who was named <i>Lagos</i>.</i> Thus (in Exod. 4:20): <small>SO MOSES TOOK HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN</small>….

(Exod. 4:20, end:) <small>AND MOSES TOOK THE ROD OF GOD IN HIS HAND</small>. The Holy One said to him: Take this rod in your hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:23.</i>
And do with it whatever miracles you want to do with it.
(Exod. 4:21:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WHEN YOU GO TO RETURN TO EGYPT</small>. The Holy One showed him the miracles that he was going to do for him. Now he had said to him (Exod. 3:16:): <small>GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>,… and afterwards you are going to Pharaoh. Moses said: If they should say <small>TO ME</small> (in Exod. 3:13), <small>WHAT IS HIS NAME, WHAT DO I SAY TO THEM</small>? He said to him: Say to them (in vs. 14): <small>I AM THAT I AM</small>.

The Holy One said to him: You say of my children that they will not believe; yet they are believing children of believers. (Exod. 4:9:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF THEY DO NOT EVEN BELIEVE THESE TWO SIGNS</small>: The Holy One gave him a hint. He said to him: From where do you get yours (i.e., your sentence for your unbelief in vs. 1)? From the water, as stated (in vs. 9, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL TAKE SOME WATER FROM THE NILE</small>.
R. Samuel bar Nehemiah said: He hinted to you that you would get yours from water. It is so stated (in Numb. 20:10): <small>SHALL WE BRING FORTH WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Because Moses was not following the Holy One’s instructions (in vs. 8) to <small>SPEAK UNTO THE ROCK</small> but (in vs. 11) <small>STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE WITH HIS ROD</small>, he was condemned (in vs. 12) not to enter the promised land.</i>

(Exod. 4:29): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED &lt;ALL THE ELDERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> &gt;.

The Holy One said to them: What do you think? That I am not going to repay you? By your life, when Moses and Aaron go to receive the Torah, you are going up with them, but I am turning you back.

Siman 22

(Exod. 4:27:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO AARON: GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>….
This text is related (to Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE; &lt;HE DOES GREAT THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THUNDERS</small>? It is simply that, when the Holy One gave the Torah on Sinai, the Holy One through his voice showed Israel miracle after miracle. How? When the Holy One spoke, his voice went back and forth throughout all the world. When Israel heard the voice, it came from the south; so they ran {from the south} [southward] to receive the voice &lt;coming&gt; from there. And so it was for &lt;all&gt; the four winds.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel accounts (<i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:25; Exod. R. 5:9) explain that the voice shifted successively to the north, the east, and the west, with Israel running after it in each case.</i> After that it shifted &lt;so that it came&gt; to them from the heavens; so they were raising their eyes to the heavens. Then the voice shifted &lt;so that it came&gt; to them from the ground. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Deut. 4:36): <small>FROM THE HEAVENS HE HAD YOU HEAR HIS VOICE ADMONISH YOU. ON EARTH HE SHOWED YOU HIS GREAT FIRE, &lt;AND FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE YOU HEARD HIS WORDS&gt;</small>.
Now the Israelites were saying to each other (in Job 28:20): <small>BUT WHERE IS WISDOM FOUND</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Masoretic Text: <small>DOES WISDOM COME FROM</small>.</i> <small>AND WHERE IS THE PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING</small>?
(Exod. 20:15 [18]:) <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS</small> (literally: <small>VOICES</small>). What is the meaning of <small>THE VOICES</small> (in the plural)? It was simply that the &lt;one divine &gt; voice was transformed into seven voices and &lt;then&gt; from seven into seventy tongues.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 5:9; 28:6; M. Pss. 92:3; cf. <i>Shab</i>. 88b.</i> And why into seventy tongues? So that all the nations would hear. But, when the voice went forth, each and every nation heard the voice of the Holy One, and each one's soul departed; but Israel was not harmed. How [did the voice go forth. R. Tanhuma said:] The voice went forth and killed nations {so that they would accept} [because they did not accept] the Torah, but &lt;the voice &gt; gave life to Israel {so that they would accept} [because they accepted] the Torah. That is what Moses said to them at the end of forty years (in Deut. 5:23 [26]): <small>FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH THAT HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD SPEAKING FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED</small>? He also says (in Deut. 4:33): <small>HAS ANY PEOPLE HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD &lt;SPEAKING FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, AND LIVED</small> &gt;? You have heard it and &lt; still &gt; live, but the nations heard it and died. Come and see how the voice went forth to Israel. Each and every person heard according to his ability (<i>koah):</i> the old ones according to their ability, the youths according to their ability, the lads, the small ones, the babies, the infants according to their ability, and even Moses according to his ability. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:19): <small>MOSES SPOKE, AND GOD ANSWERED HIM OUT LOUD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>OUT LOUD</small> (literally: <small>IN A VOICE</small>)? Merely <small>IN A VOICE</small> which Moses was able to endure. And so it says (in Ps. 29:4): <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS IN POWER</small> (<i>koah</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; within the ability (<i>koah</i>) of each and everyone, the pregnant women according to their ability and all &lt; others &gt; according to their ability. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: If you are surprised about it, learn from the manna.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 5:17; <i>PRK</i> 12:25.</i>
For it came down for each and every one only according to his need. The youths ate it as bread, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. The old ones ate it as honey, as stated (in Exod. 16:31): <small>AND ITS TASTE WAS LIKE WAFERS IN HONEY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. below, 4:22; <i>Yoma</i> 75b; also <i>Yoma</i> 75a, <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Amaleq</i> 3; <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 11:6 (87); 11:21 (89); Exod. R. 25:3; Numb. R. 7:4; M. Pss. 23:3.</i>
For the small ones it was like milk from their mother's breast, as stated (in Numb. 11:8): <small>AND ITS TASTE WAS LIKE THE TASTE OF FAT CREAM</small>. And the sick savored it as the taste of fine flour mixed with oil and honey like barley grits<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ptisane</i>; Lat.: <i>ptisana</i>.</i> as one prepares it for the sick {<i>fankokha</i>' in the Arabic language}. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>BOILED IT IN A POT</small>. It also says (in Ezek. 16:19): <small>ALSO MY BREAD, WHICH I GAVE YOU, FINE FLOUR</small>, [<small>OIL</small>], <small>AND HONEY, WHICH I HAD YOU EAT</small>. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: If the manna, which was one species, was changed into several varieties and into many species because of Israel's need, how much the more so in the case of the voice in which was &lt; uttered &gt; with power (<i>koah</i>). Ergo (in Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>….

Another interpretation (of Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>; <small>&lt;HE DOES GREAT THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND&gt;</small>.

When the oracle was revealed to him in Midian and told him to return to Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 4:19): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES IN MIDIAN: GO BACK TO EGYPT</small>, the oracle was divided into two voices and became two faces.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>duo prosopa</i>.</i> In Midian Moses heard (according to Exod. 4:19): <small>GO BACK TO EGYPT</small>, while in Egypt Aaron heard (according to Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. But whoever was in the middle did not hear anything. Ergo (in Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 8:1): <small>IF ONLY YOU COULD BE TO ME LIKE A BROTHER</small>.

Like which brother?<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:27; Exod. R. 5:1; <i>PRK</i> 16:5; <i>PR</i> 29/30A:6; 29/30B:1.</i> You find that from the beginning of the creation of the world until now brothers have hated each other. Cain hated Abel and killed him, as stated (in Gen. 4:8): <small>CAIN AROSE AGAINST HIS BROTHER ABEL AND MURDERED HIM</small>. Ishmael hated Isaac (rt.: <small><i>Ts</i>HQ</small>), as stated (in Gen. 21:9): <small>WHEN SARAH SAW THE SON WHOM HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN HAD BORNE TO ABRAHAM PLAYING</small> (rt.: <small><i>Ts</i>HQ</small>). Now <small>PLAYING</small> can only mean that he desired to kill him, as stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY BEFORE US</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The result of their “playing” was that they all killed each other. See above, Gen. 6:5; below, Numb. 6:8; 10:9.</i> Esau also hated Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:41): <small>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART</small>: <small>&lt;LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&gt;</small>. Moreover, the tribes hated Joseph, as stated (in Gen. 37:4): <small>THEY HATED HIM</small>. So like which brother? Israel said: Like Moses and Aaron, as stated (in Ps. 133:1): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS &lt;FOR KINDRED TO DWELL TOGETHER&gt;</small>, since they loved each other and cherished each other. Thus when Moses received the kingship and Aaron &lt; received &gt; the high priesthood, they were not jealous of each other. Rather they were happy in each other's greatness.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">See below, Lev. 3:5.</i> You know yourself it to be so. You find that, when the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 3:10): <small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>…, Moses said to him (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE &lt; SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT&gt;</small>. Do you imagine that Moses may have delayed in order not to go? He only acted out of respect for Aaron. Moses said: Before I arose, Aaron had been prophesying to them for eighty years. He &lt;is the one&gt; of whom it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5): <small>I MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO THEM IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. And where is it shown that Aaron prophesied to them? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 2:27–28): <small>NOW A MAN OF GOD CAME UNTO ELI AND SAID UNTO HIM: THUS SAYS THE LORD: I SURELY REVEALED MYSELF</small> {<small>TO</small>} [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE IN EGYPT, WHEN THEY BELONGED TO PHARAOH'S HOUSE; AND I CHOSE HIM FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash seems to ignore the fact that what the Holy One says here is introduced by an interrogative particle.</i> He said to him: All these years Aaron has prophesied to them. So am I now to go to them in my brother's domain so that he will be upset? For that reason Moses did not desire to go. The Holy One said to him: Your brother Aaron will not be upset over this matter. Rather he will be happy. You yourself know that he is going out for a meeting<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apante, apantesis</i>.</i> with you. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:14): <small>SEE, HE IS SETTING OUT TO MEET YOU; AND WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>: not in his mouth alone but in his heart, his heart more than his mouth. <small>WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: The heart that was happy at his brother's greatness shall put on Urim and Thummim, as stated (in Exod. 28:30): <small>AND INSIDE THE BREAST PLATE OF JUDGMENT YOU SHALL PUT THE URIM AND THUMMIM SO THAT THEY SHALL BE UPON AARON'S HEART</small>. Ergo (In Exod. 4:14): <small>AND ALSO SEE, HE IS SETTING OUT TO MEET YOU; AND WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>. When &lt;the Holy One&gt; had said this to him, &lt;Moses&gt; took it upon himself to go. Immediately the Holy One revealed himself to Aaron.

You yourself know that, when Ben-hadad sent to the king of Israel and said to him (in I Kings 20:3): <small>THUS SAYS BEN-HADAD: YOUR SILVER AND GOLD ARE MINE</small>; <small>&lt;YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIVES AND CHILDREN ARE MINE&gt;</small>, the king of Israel sent to him &lt;and said&gt; (in vs. 4): <small>AS YOU SAY, MY LORD KING, I AND ALL THAT I HAVE ARE YOURS</small>. He sent to him a second time (in vs. 6): <small>NEVERTHELESS TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME I WILL SEND MY SERVANTS TO YOU; AND THEY WILL SEARCH &lt;YOUR HOUSE AND THE HOUSES OF YOUR SERVANTS</small> &gt;, <small>LAY THEIR HANDS UPON EVERYTHING YOUR EYES DELIGHT IN, AND TAKE IT AWAY</small>. [Was not] whatever he originally demanded {was not} a delight[?] He sought silver and gold, and they are a delight, as stated (in Hag. 2:7–8): <small>AND THE DELIGHT OF ALL THE NATIONS SHALL COME, &lt;AND I WILL FILL THIS HOUSE WITH GLORY, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS. &gt; THE SILVER IS MINE, AND THE GOLD IS MINE</small>. He sought women, and they are a delight, as stated (in Ezek. 24:16): <small>SON OF ADAM, SEE, I AM TAKING AWAY</small> [<small>FROM YOU</small>] <small>THE DELIGHT OF YOUR EYES</small> (i.e., your wife) <small>THROUGH PESTILENCE</small>. [He sought] children, and they are a delight, as stated (in Hos. 9:16): <small>AND I WILL PUT TO DEATH THE DELIGHTS OF THEIR WOMB</small>. Ergo: Whatever he originally demanded was a delight. Then what is the meaning (in I Kings 20:4) of <small>EVERYTHING YOUR EYES DELIGHT IN</small>? Something more delightful than &lt;any&gt; delight, i.e., the Torah, as stated (concerning the judgments of the Holy One in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small>. When the king of Israel heard this, he said: This is not a matter for me but for the elders. Immediately (in I Kings 20:7–8): <small>THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL CALLED</small> {<small>UNTO</small>} [<small>FOR</small>] <small>ALL THE ELDERS OF THE LAND AND SAID</small> {<small>TO THEM</small>}: <small>PLEASE COMPREHEND AND SEE HOW THIS MAN IS SEEKING EVIL; &lt;FOR, WHEN HE SENT UNTO ME FOR MY WIVES, MY CHILDREN, MY SILVER, AND MY GOLD, I DID NOT REFUSE HIM. SO</small> [<small>ALL</small>] <small>THE ELDERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID UNTO HIM</small>: {<small>NEVER</small>} [<small>DO NOT</small>] <small>HEED AND NEVER CONSENT</small>. When he heard the advice of the elders, he arose. <small>THEN</small> (according to I Kings 20:21), <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL WENT OUT AND SMOTE THE HORSES</small>…. Ergo: They always consulted with the elders. So also Moses (in Exod. 19:7) <small>SUMMONED THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>, and afterwards, the leaders and the judges. When did Israel have leaders? When they had elders. So here also (in Exod. 4:29): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED ALL THE ELDERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GATHERED</small>? That they appointed them as elders, just as the Holy One had told him (in Exod. 3:16): <small>GO AND GATHER</small> (i.e., appoint) <small>THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 11:8.</i> The Holy One has said: In this world I have distributed glory to the elders; and in the age to come I am also sharing glory with them, as stated (in Is. 24:23): <small>THEN &lt;THE DIVINE&gt; GLORY &lt;SHALL STAND&gt; IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ELDERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 1:21.</i>

(Exod. 7:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. It is written (in Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>…. Who said this verse?

When he reached the Sanctuary, the entrance was ten cubits. Now the ark (<i>aron</i>) was ten cubits, and ten cubits cannot get inside of ten &lt;cubits&gt;. Moreover, those who were bearing it &lt;needed space&gt;. When he saw that he was unable to bring it in, he felt ashamed and did not know what to do. He began to pray to the Holy One. What did Solomon do? He went and brought in the coffin (<i>aron</i>) of his father David. Then he prayed and said (in II Chron. 6:42): <small>MY LORD GOD, DO NOT TURN AWAY THE FACE OF YOUR ANOINTED; REMEMBER THE GOOD DEEDS OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID</small>. As soon as he mentioned the merit of his father David, he was answered immediately. What is written next (in II Chron. 7:1)? <small>WHEN SOLOMON FINISHED PRAYING, FIRE CAME DOWN</small> [<small>FROM HEAVEN…, AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE HOUSE</small>.] Also the Holy Spirit cried out (in Eccl. 4:2): <small>THEN I PRAISED THE DEAD</small>. Solomon began saying (in Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>. At that time the gates were seeking to crush his skull, because they were of the opinion that perhaps he was speaking on his own authority. (Ibid., cont.): <small>SO THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN</small>. They said to him (in Ps. 24:8 &amp; 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>?

Another interpretation (of Ps. 24:8 &amp; 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? Who is he?

In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one puts on his crown; yet the Holy One has given crowns to the Messianic King. It is so stated (in Ps. 21:4): <small>YOU HAVE SET ON HIS HEAD A CROWN OF FINE GOLD</small>. In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one puts on his robes; yet Israel has put on the Holy One's robes, &lt;i.e.,&gt; strength. It is so stated (in Is. 51:9): <small>AWAKE, AWAKE, PUT ON STRENGTH, O ARM OF THE LORD</small>; and he has given it to Israel, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>.

I am called God; and in that name I created the world, as stated (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>. And here I have made you like me, a god to Pharaoh. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 7:1) <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:1) <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. The Holy One said: Because he made himself into a god, they informed him that he was nothing in the world. See, I have made you a god over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 2:9.</i> And where is it shown that Pharaoh made himself into a god?

He gives and she receives. Therefore, “they had sexual relations like women” to show that they were bestowed upon and did not do the bestowing.</i> Three were from the nations of the world, and one was from Israel. They were the following: Hiram, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, and Joash. Where is it shown of Hiram? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 28:2): <small>SAY TO THE PRINCE OF TYRE: THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD: BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS PROUD, YOU HAVE SAID: I AM A GOD</small>. Because he had made himself into a god, he had sexual relations like women, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>YOU HAVE DEBASED YOUR WISDOM…; &lt;I HAVE CAST YOU UPON THE GROUND; I HAVE GIVEN YOU OVER BEFORE KINGS &gt; TO STARE AT YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO STARE</small> (<i><small>R'WH</small></i>) <small>AT YOU</small>? &lt;That&gt; they would work their "friendship" (as if from <i><small>R'WT</small></i>) on you.

Where it is stated &lt;of the king of Babylon that he said&gt; (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life, (in vs. 15) <small>YOU SHALL ALSO BE BROUGHT DOWN UNTO SHEOL, UNTO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE PIT</small>. What did the Holy one do? He banished him while he was in his kingship and had him eat grass like the cattle. It is so stated (in Dan. 4:22 [25]): <small>AND THEY SHALL FEED YOU GRASS LIKE OXEN</small>…. So, when the cattle and the wild beasts saw him in the likeness of a &lt;female&gt; animal, they had sexual relations with him, as stated (in Hab. 2:17): <small>AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE BEASTS WILL TERRIFY THOSE FEMALES</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TERRIFY THOSE FEMALES</small> (rt.: <small><i>HTT</i>+<i>N</i></small>)? &lt;Its meaning &gt; is like what is stated (in Deut. 7:3): <small>YOU SHALL NOT INTERMARRY</small> (rt.: <i><small>HTN</small></i>) <small>WITH THEM</small>. So he became a bridegroom (<i><small>HTN</small></i>) to all cattle and wild beasts. Where is it shown of Joash? Where it is stated (in II Chron. 24:17): <small>NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BOWED LOW TO THE KING</small>? That they made him &lt; their &gt; god. Moreover, since he was in agreement, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEN THE KING HEARKENED TO THEM</small>, he had sexual relations like a woman. Thus it is stated (vs. 24): <small>&lt;FOR THE ARMY OF ARAM CAME WITH A FEW MEN</small>….&gt; <small>SO THEY INFLICTED JUDGMENTS ON JOASH</small>. It is just as it says (in Lev. 20:13): <small>IF A MAN LIES WITH A MALE AS ONE LIES WITH A WOMAN, BOTH OF THEM HAVE COMMITTED AN ABOMINATION</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is arguing that the <small>JUDGMENT</small> inflicted on Joash is this <small>ABOMINATION</small>. Cf. <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, ‘Amaleq</i> 1, which would revowel <small>JUDGMENTS</small> (<i>shefatim</i>) to read “sports” (<i>shipputim</i>). For a similar solution, see Exod. R. 8:2.</i> Pharaoh also made himself into a god and had sexual relations like a woman. It is so stated (in Jer. 44:30): <small>BEHOLD, I AM GIVING PHARAOH HOPHRA, KING OF EGYPT, &lt;INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES&gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HOPHRA</small> (rt.: <i><small>PR</small></i>')?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Masoretic Text spells <i><small>HOPHRA</small></i> with a gutturalized initial <i><small>H</small></i> (<i>het</i>), the midrash text spells the name with a simple <i><small>H</small></i> (<i>he</i>), which need not be part of the root.</i> That they uncovered (<i><small>PR</small></i>') his posterior. He was a pharaoh who had been a male and became a female. Another interpretation of <small>HOPHRA</small>. &lt;Its meaning is&gt; like that used (in the context of Numb. 5:18): <small>AND HE</small> (the priest) <small>SHALL UNCOVER</small> (<i><small>PR</small>'</i>) <small>THE WOMAN'S HEAD</small>. And to which father's house did he belong? (Is. 19:16:) <small>IN THAT DAY</small> {<small>THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL BE A FESTIVAL</small>….} [<small>EGYPT SHALL BE LIKE WOMEN</small>.] And what was the cause? &lt;It was&gt; because he made himself into a god. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 29:3): {<small>BECAUSE HE</small>} [<small>WHO</small>] <small>SAID</small> {<small>THE</small>} [<small>MY</small>] <small>NILE IS MY OWN, AND I MADE MYSELF</small>. For that reason the Holy One said to Moses: Because he has made himself into a god, go and become a god over him. It is so stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. Why? (Eccl. 5:7 [8]:) <small>FOR ONE EXALTED PERSON WATCHES ANOTHER FROM ABOVE, AND THERE ARE MORE EXALTED ONES OVER THEM</small>. Ergo, you are a god over him; so make him an arrogant abomination (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>) in the world because he became exalted by himself. And this is what is written (in Job 41:26 [34]): <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>, {<small>AND</small>} <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>). Does the Holy One not see the lowly? It is also written (in Zech. 4:10): <small>&lt;THESE SEVEN ARE&gt; THE EYES OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. And (in Job 41:26 [34]) what is the meaning of <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>? R. Berekhyah said: These are the proud, whose spirit becomes &lt;too&gt; haughty for them, so that they exalt themselves and make themselves into gods. What does the Holy One do to them? He exhibits them to mortals and makes them arrogant abominations (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>) in the world, as stated (in Job 41:26 [34]): <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>). &lt;There is&gt; Nebuchadnezzar, for example, in that he made him an arrogant abomination (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>), as stated (in Dan. 5:21): <small>HE WAS DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANS</small>…. So also was Sennacherib made an arrogant abomination (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>), as stated (II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THAT NIGHT THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &lt;ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND &gt; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>…. Thus the Holy One shows the abominable arrogance (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>) of the proud to every creature. The Holy One has said (in Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE</small> (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) <small>HIM</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD</small>. R. Benjamin bar Levi said: If someone goes to handle the Torah and sits by himself, I will exhibit (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) his deed in the world. And so, if someone conceals himself to commit a transgression, I will exhibit (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>)his deed to the world. It is so stated (in Jer. 23:24): <small>SHALL I NOT SEE</small> (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) <small>HIM</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD. DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? SAYS THE LORD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>I FILL</small>? R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: The Holy One said: From him (i.e., from his evil works) I will fill the upper and lower worlds. Then I will exhibit (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) him to humankind as an arrogant abomination (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>). Why? Because they (sic) are proud and make themselves into gods. (Job 41:26 [34]:) <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>, {<small>AND</small>} <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>). Thus he reigns over all those who are proud and makes them arrogant abominations (<i><small>ShHTs</small></i>). For that reason, the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>.

Thus the Holy One desires (<i><small>HPTs</small></i>) to declare all his creatures righteous, as stated (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED</small> (<i><small>HPTs</small></i>) <small>BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">On this interpretation of Is. 42:21, see also <i>Mak</i>. 3:16; <i>ARN</i>, A, 41:21; Targum to Is. 42:21.</i> Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>.
Another interpretation (of Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. The Holy One made known to Moses, while he was at the bush, what Pharaoh was going to do. He said to him (in Exod. 4:2–4): <small>MOSES, WHAT IS THIS IN YOUR HAND? AND HE SAID: A ROD. THEN HE SAID: CAST IT TO THE GROUND, SO HE CAST IT TO THE GROUND AND IT BECAME A SNAKE…. THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: PUT OUT YOUR HAND AND GRASP IT BY THE TAIL</small>…. So it reverted and became a rod. The Holy One said to him: Moses, just as the snake bends itself, so Pharaoh is going to bend himself because of you. Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. When he comes and says (in Exod. 7:9): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>, simply do for him just as I have done.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:9): <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU, &lt;SAYING PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE, YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH. IT SHALL BECOME A SERPENT</small>. &gt; This text is related (to Prov. 29:11): <small>A FOOL VENTS HIS WHOLE SPIRIT; BUT A WISE PERSON STILLS HIM IN THE END</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Such a translation is required by the midrashic interpretation.

(Exod. 7:9:) <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU</small>, simply be careful. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD &lt;AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH&gt;</small>. When they went to Pharaoh, he said (ibid., cont): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>. Immediately (in vs. 10): <small>AARON CAST DOWN HIS ROD</small>. Then Pharaoh laughed at them. He said to them: Moses and Aaron, what are you thinking? That you have come to mock me? But I am not afraid of these things. All Egypt is full of magicians.

Siman 13

Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:9): <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU</small>, … The Holy One said: Tomorrow I am leading my children out of Egypt and giving them the Torah. Now in it there is written (in Deut. 13:2 [1]): <small>IF THERE ARISES AMONG YOU A PROPHET &lt;OR ONE WHO DIVINES BY A DREAM AND HE GIVES YOU A SIGN OR A PORTENT</small> &gt;…. It is only right for him to summon you and say to you (in Exod. 7:8): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>…. At first he will speak to you harshly, since the word <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: <i><small>DBR</small></i> in Exod. 7:9) is nothing but a word implying harshness. &lt;It is&gt; just as you say (in Gen. 42:30): <small>THE MAN, THE LORD OF THE LAND, SPOKE</small> (rt.: <i><small>DBR</small></i>) <small>WITH US HARSHLY</small>. He said to him: Aaron will do these things, but you shall stand like a prince giving decrees to the elders while they carry them out. (According to Exod. 7:9, cont.,) <small>YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH</small>….
(Exod. 7:10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON CAME</small>… It was proper for Aaron to enter first because he was three years older than &lt; Moses &gt;, but in the eyes of the Egyptians Moses was greater, as stated (in Exod. 11:3): {<small>AND</small>} <small>ALSO THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY GREAT IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>….
(Exod. 7:10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON CAME UNTO PHARAOH AND DID JUST AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED: AARON CAST DOWN HIS ROD</small>. &lt;This was the&gt; beginning. Then after that they brought on this plague and after that, a second plague. They performed all the deeds before him. Nevertheless, he paid no attention.

Then he would say to him: Come, you and I, and let us drink from the &lt;same&gt; bowl. But the Israelite was &lt; still &gt; drinking water; and the Egyptian, blood. When, however, an Egyptian took water from an Israelite for a price, he would drink water. For that reason Israel became rich from the plague of blood. And how long did the plague stay with them? R.

Nebuchadnezzar made himself into a deity, as stated (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; &lt;I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small> &gt;.

Zedekiah looked at him in astonishment and said: Is it to this one that the whole world is subjugated? He ate with him. What did he do? After he had dined, he took Zedekiah and made him take an oath.

The kings who were reclining with him heard him. They sent and said to him (to Nebuchadnezzar): Zedekiah is sitting &lt;here&gt; laughing at you. Where is it shown that they sent to him and said &lt; this &gt; to him? R. Samuel said: It is written (in Is. 16:1): <small>SEND A LAMB</small> (<i><small>KR</small></i>) <small>TO THE RULER OF THE LAND</small>. What is the meaning of <i><small>KR</small></i>?

Where it is stated (in II Chron. 36:13): <small>AND HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO HAD MADE HIM TAKE AN OATH BY GOD</small>. What did he do? He immediately sent and had him come. Then he fed him barley, stood him up, and scorned (rt.: <i><small>BZH</small></i>) him shamefully. The Holy One said (to Nebuchadnezzar): So you have shamed (rt.: <i><small>BZH</small></i>) him.

Abba bar Kahana said that he became a bridegroom (<i><small>HTN</small></i>) to all cattle and wild beasts. And what caused him this shame (rt.: <i><small>BZH</small></i>)? It was simply because he had shamed (<i><small>BZH</small></i>) Zedekiah.
And also in the case of Pharaoh, he was gnashing his teeth against Moses. Now he had said to them (the Israelites, in Exod. 5:17): <small>YOU ARE LAZY, LAZY</small>! R. Judah b. R. Simon said: What is the meaning of <small>LAZY</small>? He said to them: You are holy. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THAT IS WHY YOU SAY: LET US GO AND SACRIFICE TO THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said (in Exod. 9:13): <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING</small> and make known to Pharaoh that he is nothing. {See, he is going out to the water.} (Exod. 9:13, cont., &amp; 14:) <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [<small>THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS</small>]: <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO TO WORSHIP ME. FOR THIS TIME &lt;I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES UPON YOUR HEART</small> &gt;…. He said to them: <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO TO WORSHIP ME</small>. Then it will be good for you; but if not, &lt;then&gt; <small>FOR THIS TIME &lt;I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES UPON YOUR HEART&gt;</small>…. It is written (in Job 36:22): <small>WHO IS A TEACHER LIKE HIM</small> (i.e., like the Holy One), who teaches the wicked to repent? He said to Pharaoh (in Exod. 9:19): <small>NOW SEND &lt;AND&gt; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &lt;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&gt;</small>…. And what is written (in vs. 18)? <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &lt;VERY HEAVY HAIL&gt;</small>,…. Then after that I will bring the locust, as stated (in Exod. 10:4–5): <small>BEHOLD, TOMORROW I WILL BRING LOCUSTS ON YOUR TERRITORY, AND THEY SHALL COVER THE EYE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">A more common translation would be <small>SURFACE</small>, but the midrash understands the Hebrew literally here to mean <small>EYE</small>.</i> <small>OF THE EARTH</small>. Our masters have said: Just as a woman has a head, so does the earth have a head. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 8:26): &lt;…&gt; <small>NOR THE HEAD OF THE DUST OF THE WORLD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">In the context of Proverbs these words mean that the Holy One had not yet made <small>A BEGINNING</small> in creating <small>THE DUST OF THE WORLD</small>. Similarly other verses in this paragraph are understood more literally than in some translations.</i> And just as a woman has ears, so does the earth have ears. Thus it is stated (in Is. 1:2): <small>&lt;HEAR, O HEAVENS, &gt; AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>. And just as a woman has eyes, so does the earth have eyes. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 10:5): <small>AND THEY SHALL COVER THE EYE OF THE EARTH</small>. And just as a woman has a mouth, so does the earth have a mouth. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH &lt;AND SWALLOWED THEM</small>…&gt;. And just as a woman has arms, so does the earth have arms. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 34:21): <small>FOR BEHOLD, THE LAND HAS BROAD ARMS</small>. And just as a woman has a navel, so does the land have a navel. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 38:12): <small>WHO DWELL ON THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH</small>. Just as a woman conceives and gives birth, so does the earth. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:8): <small>CAN A LAND PASS THROUGH LABOR IN A SINGLE DAY? IS A NATION BORN ALL AT ONCE? &lt;YET WHEN ZION WAS IN LABOR, SHE ALSO BORE HER CHILDREN. &gt;</small> This refers to Israel, because the Holy One brought them and had them enter Jerusalem <small>ALL AT ONCE</small>. And Jerusalem was astounded, as stated (in Is. 49:21): <small>AND YOU WILL SAY IN YOUR HEART: WHO HAS BORNE ME</small> {<small>ALL</small>} <small>THESE</small>? The Holy One said to them: By your life, in short while I am gathering your Dispersion, for so has Isaiah said (while addressing Zion in Is. 49:18): <small>LIFT UP YOUR EYES ROUND ABOUT AND SEE. THEY ARE ALL ASSEMBLED, ARE COME TO YOU</small>.

(Exod. 9:22:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOLD OUT YOUR ARM TOWARD THE HEAVENS &lt;THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>,&gt;…. This text is related (to Ps. 115:3): <small>&lt;OUR GOD IS IN THE HEAVENS</small>;&gt; {<small>THE LORD</small>} [<small>HE</small>] <small>HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 2:15; Exod. R. 12:3.</i> The Holy One said (in vs. 16): <small>THE HEAVENS ARE HEAVENS BELONGING TO THE LORD, &lt;BUT THE EARTH HE GAVE OVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM&gt;</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who uttered a decree for the children of Rome not to go down to Syria and for the children of Syria not to go up to Rome. So it is with the Holy One. When he created [the beings on high, he said] (in Ps. 115:16): <small>THE HEAVENS ARE HEAVENS BELONGING TO THE LORD</small>, [<small>BUT THE EARTH HE GAVE OVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>]. When the Holy One wished to give Torah to Israel, he repealed the first decree and said: let those below ascend to those on high and those on high descend to those below. And I will be the one who begins. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:20): <small>AND THE LORD CAME DOWN UPON MOUNT SINAI</small>. It is also written (in Exod. 24:1): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO MOSES: GO UP UNTO THE LORD</small>…. Ergo (in Ps. 115:3) <small>THE LORD HE HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small> [in the heavens and on earth]. &lt;It was&gt; when he wanted &lt;that&gt; he said (in Gen. 1:9): <small>LET THE WATERS &lt;UNDER THE HEAVENS&gt; BE GATHERED &lt;UNTO ONE PLACE&gt;</small>. And &lt;it was&gt; when he wanted &lt;that&gt; he spoke and made the sea into dry ground, as stated (in Exod. 14:29): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT THROUGH THE SEA</small> [<small>ON DRY GROUND</small>],…
Another interpretation (of Ps. 115:3): <small>THE LORD HE HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small>. Thus the Holy One was not pleased to declare all creation guilty, as stated (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>&lt;FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO&gt; DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>….
(Exod. 9:22:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOLD OUT YOUR ARM &lt;TOWARD THE HEAVENS</small> &gt; [<small>THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>]. Why did he smite them with hail? Because the Egyptians thought that the Israelites were their vinedressers.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Since the vines of the Israelites would also have been subject to hail damage, the Egyptians believed that the Holy One would not send hail; but the Holy One did send hail and further demonstrated his power by sparing Israel’s vines in the land of Goshen. See Exod. 9:25.</i> David said (in Ps. 78:47): <small>HE KILLED THEIR VINES WITH HAIL, AND THEIR SYCAMORES WITH <i>HANAMAL</i></small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Several English versions translate <i>hanamal</i> as “frost”; but since the word appears nowhere else in Scripture, it is well suited to speculation concerning its meaning.</i> And how did it come down? R. Pinhas and R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 12:4, 6; cf. Cant. R. 3:11:1; M.

(Ps. 78:47:) <small>HE KILLS THEIR VINES WITH HAIL</small>,… And the other said: It came down like the <i>hanamal</i>. (Ps. 78:47:) <small>AND THEIR SYCAMORES WITH <i>HANAMAL</i></small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">According to Exod. R. 12:4, R. Judah bar Shallum derived the meaning from the phrase <small>WITH <i>HANAMAL</i></small> (<i>bahanamal</i>), which he interprets to mean, “It came (<i>ba</i>), it came to rest (<i>nah</i>), it cut off (<i>mal</i>)”; but R. Pinhas believed that the hail came down like an axe (<i>pilqin</i>, from the Gk.: <i>pelekus</i>) and cut down the trees. Similarly <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 2:14. Cf. <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Pss. 820, where these two views are attributed to other authorities.</i> It is written (in Exod. 9:32): <small>BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See Exod.

What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 9:16)? <small>BUT NEVERTHELESS, FOR THIS REASON I HAVE PRESERVED YOU</small>,… I have preserved you to recount my wondrous works.

(Exod. 9:18:) <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &lt;VERY HEAVY HAIL&gt;</small>. Zavday ben Levi said: He scratched a single mark for him on the wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 2:16; Exod. R. 12:2.</i> He said to him: Tomorrow when the sun reaches here, I will bring hail down upon you. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SUCH AS HAS NEVER BEEN</small>. Nothing has happened like it, but it is going to happen to the nations. It is prepared for Sennacherib. &lt;These are&gt; the words of R. Simon. R. Hanina said: It is prepared for the punishment of Gog and Magog, as stated (concerning Gog in Ezek. 38:22): <small>AND I WILL POUR TORRENTIAL RAIN, HAILSTONES, &lt;FIRE, AND BRIMSTONE UPON HIM AND HIS HOSTS AND THE MANY PEOPLES THAT ARE WITH HIM&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">On Gog and Magog, see above, note 68.</i>
(Exod. 9:18:) <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &lt;VERY HEAVY HAIL&gt;</small>…. However (in Exod. 9:19 it says): <small>NOW SEND &lt;AND&gt; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &lt;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&gt;</small>…. Our masters have said: during all the plagues, Pharaoh never said: <small>THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT</small>, except in the plague of the hail alone (in Exod. 9:27). Why? When someone wants to fight with his companion and overcome him, he comes upon him suddenly, kills him, and takes everything he has. But the Holy One said to Pharaoh (in Exod. 9:19): <small>NOW SEND &lt;AND&gt; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &lt;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&gt;</small>…. &lt;It was&gt; at that time &lt;that&gt; Pharaoh said: <small>THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT</small>.
(Exod. 9:20:) <small>THOSE &lt;OF PHARAOH'S SERVANTS&gt; WHO FEARED THE WORD OF THE LORD</small>. From here R.

Where did they come from, in view of what is written (in Exod. 9:6): <small>THEN ALL THE EGYPTIAN LIVESTOCK DIED</small>…? It is simply that (according to Exod. 9:20–21): <small>THOSE</small> [<small>OF PHARAOH'S SERVANTS</small>] <small>WHO FEARED THE WORD OF THE LORD HAD THEIR SERVANTS AND THEIR LIVESTOCK FLEE INTO THE HOUSES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The argument here is that, although some Egyptians saved their livestock, Pharaoh led even this remnant, i.e., the <small>SIX HUNDRED SELECT CHARIOTS</small>, to their destruction (Exod. 14:26).</i> <small>BUT THOSE WHO PAID NO ATTENTION TO &lt;THE WORD OF THE LORD LEFT THEIR SERVANTS AND LIVESTOCK IN THE FIELD</small> &gt;. &lt;It was with reference to these that&gt; the Holy One said (to Moses in vs. 22): <small>HOLD OUT YOUR ARM TOWARD THE HEAVENS &lt;THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small> &gt;.

Siman 21

(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND HAIL</small>…. And why? By virtue of the Torah, which was &lt;also&gt; given in thunder. It is so stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS</small>.
(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD</small>, &lt;implies the Holy One&gt; and all &lt;his&gt; council,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>sugkletos</i>.</i> for did they not decree that the hail come down upon Egypt?<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>. Exod. 2:16; Exod. R. 12:4. The exegetical principle here is that, wherever the expression, <small>AND THE LORD</small>, appears, there is an implication that the heavenly court is also present. So below, 3:17; <i>yBer</i>. 9:7 (14b); <i>ySan</i>. 1:1 (18a); Gen. R. 51:2; Lev. R. 24:2.</i>
(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND HAIL…. AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN HAIL UPON THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. R. Hananyah said: <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small> (rt.: <i><small>MTR</small></i>) <small>HAIL</small>. At first the Holy One sent down rain (<i><small>MTR</small></i>) upon them, &lt;but&gt; as it came down it became hail. It is so stated: <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small> (rt.: <i><small>MTR</small></i>) <small>HAIL</small>. Why? Because no evil (such as hail) dwells with the Holy One. &lt;It was&gt; the rain &lt;that&gt; came down and &lt;then&gt; became hail when the wind entered it and turned it into hail. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 148:8): <small>STORM WIND THAT EXECUTES HIS COMMAND</small>. Ergo (in Exod. 9:23): <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN HAIL</small>.

Siman 22

(Exod. 9:24:) <small>SO THERE WAS HAIL AND FLASHING FIRE</small>. R. Jose b. R.

It is written (in Exod. 9:32): <small>BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest and R. Judah bar Shallum differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 2:16; Exod. R. 12:6.</i> R. Pinhas says: What is the meaning of <small>BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small> (rt.: '<i><small>PL</small></i>)? The Holy One performed miracles (rt.: <i><small>PL</small></i>') through them. But R. Judah says: They were late crops. R. Pinhas said to him: But look, it is written (in Exod. 9:25): <small>THE HAIL SMOTE EVERY HERB OF THE FIELD</small>; yet you say: Because they were tiny they were not smitten. Rather the Holy One performed miracles through them. At that time, when Pharaoh saw this, he said to Moses: Pray for me. He said to him: {(Exod. 8:5 [9]:) <small>YOU MAY HAVE THIS TRIUMPH OVER ME</small>; so I will let them go.} In the first plague you said to me: Pray for me and I will let them go. Then I prayed, but you did not let them go. {(Exod. 8:5 [9], cont.:) <small>FOR WHAT TIME SHALL I MAKE SUPPLICATION FOR YOU</small>…?} Pharaoh said to him (in Exod. 9:27): [<small>THIS TIME</small>] <small>I HAVE SINNED</small> {<small>AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD AND AGAINST YOU</small>.} Now I will let them go. As soon as Moses heard this, what is written (in vs. 33)? <small>SO LEAVING PHARAOH, MOSES WENT OUT OF THE CITY AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS UNTO THE LORD. &lt;THEN THE THUNDER AND THE HAIL CEASED&gt;</small>… See how dear the righteous are to the Holy One! For whatever they decide to do, the Holy One does &lt;for them&gt;.

He drew a circle and stood within it. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, your children have set their faces upon me, for here I am like a house child (i.e., a close friend) before you. I swear by your great name that I will not move from here until you have compassion upon your children. Immediately the rains came down. Now if Honi the Circle-Drawer, who was from the children of the children of Moses &lt; could do&gt; this, how much the more so in the case of Moses himself. Ergo (ibid.): <small>THEN THE THUNDER AND THE HAIL CEASED</small>, [<small>AND NO RAIN CAME POURING DOWN TO EARTH</small>]. And where is it to be found?

When they see that trouble has come upon them, they humble themselves; but as soon as the trouble passes and one feels relief, they return to their evil deeds. When Nebuchadnezzar saw trouble come upon him, he began giving praise to the Holy One. (Dan. 4:34 [37]:) <small>SO NOW I, NEBUCHADNEZZAR, PRAISE, EXALT, AND HONOR THE KING OF HEAVEN</small>…. R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of R. Helbo, &lt;who spoke&gt; in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahman: Were it not for the fact that the Holy One judges the hearts and thoughts, would Nebuchadnezzar have given praise with one verse, just as David gave praise in his whole book? When Nebuchadnezzar saw himself &lt;to have&gt; greatness, he began to boast (in Dan. 4:1 [4] and 27 [30]): <small>I &lt;AM&gt; NEBUCHADNEZZAR,… IS NOT THIS BABYLON THE GREAT &lt; WHICH I HAVE BUILT</small> &gt;…? The Holy One said to him: You wicked man, what are you boasting about? (Vs. 28 [31]:) <small>THE WORDS WERE STILL ON THE KING'S LIPS, &lt;WHEN A VOICE FELL FROM HEAVEN…: THE KINGDOM HAS PASSED FROM YOU&gt;</small>…. As long as the wicked see trouble coming upon them they are humble. When they see that it is going &lt;away&gt;, they return to their wickedness. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 9:34): <small>BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT &lt;THE RAIN AND THE HAIL AND THE THUNDER&gt; HAD CEASED, &lt;HE REVERTED TO SINNING&gt;</small>. The nations of the world continue to sin, but as for Israel (according to Lam. 4:22): <small>YOUR INIQUITY IS ENDED, O DAUGHTER OF ZION</small>. When?

The darkness which the Holy One sent upon Egypt was very severe. R.

Here is the same darkness which came upon Egypt. It came from the midst of Gehinnom. And how thick was this darkness?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exod.

(Exod. 10:22:) <small>AND THERE WAS THICK DARKNESS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THREE DAYS</small>. There were &lt; actually &gt; seven days of darkness over the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 3:3; Exod. R. 14:3.</i> For the first three days whoever was sitting and wanted to stand would stand, and whoever was standing and wanted to sit would sit. Then for the next three days whoever was sitting was unable to stand and whoever was {sitting} [standing] was unable to sit.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 3:3, and Exod. R. 14:3 explains how the two sets of three days are derived from Exod. 10:22–23. First <small>THERE WAS A THICK DARKNESS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THREE DAYS WHEN THEY COULD NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER. THEN FOR THREE DAYS NO ONE COULD GET UP FROM WHERE HE WAS</small>.</i> Here are six &lt;days&gt;. And which day was the seventh? The one of which it is stated (in Exod. 14:20): <small>THUS THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS WHICH LIT UP THE NIGHT</small>. The cloud was in Egypt; and while it gave light to Israel, it was darkened for Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>BUT ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LIGHT IN THEIR DWELLINGS</small>. Now, Israel entered the houses of the Egyptians, and whatever the Egyptians had, Israel searched out and looked at &lt;them&gt;. So, when the Holy One said to Israel (in Exod. 3:22): <small>BUT EACH WOMAN SHALL BORROW &lt; OBJECTS OF SILVER, OBJECTS OF GOLD, AND CLOTHING &gt; FROM HER NEIGHBOR AND FROM THE WOMAN WHO SOJOURNS IN HER HOUSE</small>…, Israel entered in among the Egyptians. Then, when each and every one would say to his companion and neighbor: Lend me that object which you have, and when he would say: I do not have it, he would say: I know that you have it, and here it is in your chest. See, it is in such and such a place. I saw it in your hand. So he lent him that object. And how did Israel know this? It is simply that in those days of darkness they had entered their houses and seen their silver, their gold, and whatever objects they had. R. Abbin the Levite said: Also when the plague of blood came over the Egyptians,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above 2:14.</i> the Nile was turned into blood, as stated (in Exod. 7:24): <small>AND ALL THE EGYPTIANS DUG AROUND THE NILE FOR WATER TO DRINK, &lt; BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF THE NILE</small>&gt;. What did they do? They saw Israel filling its casks from the Nile. So they went after them and sought water to drink from them, but it became blood within their mouths. R. Abbin said: Whatever they bought from Israel for a price they drank as water. Since it is impossible for anyone to exist without water, they bought water from Israel and thereby enriched Israel. [So also here, when the plague of darkness came upon them, they were acquainted with the Egyptians' houses and thereby &lt;the Egyptians &gt; made Israel rich.]

(Exod. 10:21:) <small>STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One brought the plagues upon them in the order<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>taxis</i>.</i> of a flesh-and-blood [king]. In the case of a flesh-and-blood king, when a state revolts against him, what does he do?

If they repent, well and good; but if not, he binds them in prison. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he kills their noble ones. So did the Holy One come against the Egyptians in the order of kings.

Then, when they did not repent, he hurled stones at them from a catapult. This is the hail. Then when they did not repent even after that, he stirred up a lot of troops against them. These were the locusts. Then after that he put them in prison. [This is the darkness,] as stated (in Exod. 10:21): <small>DARKNESS THAT CAN BE TOUCHED</small>…. Then, when they did not repent, he killed all their eldest sons, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN</small>.

Whatever the Egyptians devised against Israel, [the Holy One] brought against them. Those &lt; Egyptians &gt; devised for them to draw their water. What is written (in Ps. 78:44)? <small>HE TURNED THEIR NILES INTO BLOOD SO THAT THEIR STREAMS WERE UNDRINKABLE</small>. Those &lt; Egyptians &gt; devised for them to be laden as traveling traders.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateutes</i>.</i> He sent frogs upon them and covered them with resin. Those &lt; Egyptians &gt; devised for them to work on the land. The Holy One made the land swarm with gnats. Those &lt;Egyptians&gt; devised that they should bear their children as a <i>paidagogos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word designates a slave who was assigned to a child as an attendant and guardian.</i> He sent lions, wolves, and bears among them. &lt;If&gt; an Egyptian had ten children, when he told Israel to bring them to the market place, the lion came and took one, the wolf one, the bear one, the leopard one, and the snake one. Then he came &lt;back&gt; to the Egyptian alone. The Egyptian said: Where are my children? Israel said to him: Sit down and I myself will render you an accounting: The lion took one &lt;etc.&gt;; and so &lt;he continued&gt; on, until he had given him an accounting. Now they (the Egyptians) devised that they would tend their livestock, but he sent out the plague among them, as stated (in Exod. 9:6): <small>THEN ALL THE EGYPTIAN LIVESTOCK DIED</small>. They intended that they would be bath attendants {bathe them}. He brought the boils upon them. They intended to stone them with stones. The Holy One brought the hail upon them, as stated (in Exod. 9:22): <small>THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL &lt;IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small> &gt;…. They intended that they would be their vine dressers. The Holy One brought the locusts, who ate their trees, as stated (in Exod. 10:15): <small>AND THEY ATE ALL THE GRASS OF THE EARTH</small>…. They intended to imprison them in prison. The Holy One brought darkness upon them, as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>THEY COULD NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER</small>…. They intended to kill them. The Holy One killed their first-born, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN</small>. They intended to drown them in water. The Holy One also drowned them in water, as stated (in Ps. 136:15): <small>BUT OVERTHREW PHARAOH AND HIS HOST IN THE REED SEA</small>….

Now all the plagues which the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians, he is going to bring upon Edom (i.e., Rome).

Thus did R. Tanhuma interpret (Exod. 12:1–2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, SAYING: THIS MONTH SHALL BE FOR YOU THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTHS</small>….

R. Aqiva says: The text &lt;reads&gt; <small>ARISE</small>&lt;…,&gt; [<small>COME AWAY</small>] (both of which are feminine imperatives with the letter <i>yod</i> at the end). The &lt; extra &gt; <i>yod</i> stands for ten, [due to] the ten commandments which you are going to receive on Sinai. <small>ARISE, MY DARLING, MY FAIR ONE &lt;AND COME AWAY</small>&gt;…. R.

Another interpretation (of Cant. 2:10): <small>&lt;ARISE</small>,&gt; <small>MY DARLING</small> (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>). &lt;She is&gt; the daughter of Abraham, the one who was my companion (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>), as stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>THE SEED OF MY FRIEND ABRAHAM</small>.

What is written above (in Exod. 11:9) on the matter? <small>NOW THE LORD HAD SAID UNTO MOSES: PHARAOH WILL NOT HEARKEN UNTO YOU</small>…. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree. R.

Esau, who is older (<i>gadol</i>), as stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>HER OLDER SON &lt;ESAU&gt;</small>, reckons by the sun, which is the greater &lt;light&gt;, as stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>THE GREATER</small> (<i>gadol</i>) <small>LIGHT &lt;TO RULE THE DAY</small>&gt;. Jacob, who is called younger (<i>qatan</i>), as stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>HER YOUNGER SON &lt;JACOB</small>&gt; reckons by the lesser (<i>qatan</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; by the moon, as stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>AND THE LESSER LIGHT &lt;TO RULE THE NIGHT</small> &gt;. Ergo (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH</small> [<small>SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>].

So for her he wrote a marriage contract and &lt;recorded&gt; consulship, month, Sabbath, and leap year (i.e., one with a second month of Adar inserted). Similarly did the Holy One say: When I created my world, the peoples of the world arose. I gave them neither new moon, Sabbath, nor leap year; but when Israel arose, to them I gave new moons (i.e., months) and leap years. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (<small>THIS MONTH</small>).

R.

An earthly court has made a determination to proclaim &lt;a leap year&gt;. It says tomorrow we are celebrating New Year's Day. The ministering angels say to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, you did not tell us: Tomorrow is New Year's Day. He said to them: The reckoning is in their hands, as stated (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>) <small>BELONGS TO YOU</small>; it is transferred to you. As for you and me, let us go to my children, so that whatever they do, we may go along with them.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>).

But if not, you will be keeping the records of its waning: Rehoboam, {Abijah}. Then after Rehoboam they began to wane and pass away. Solomon made shields of gold; but when Rehoboam arose, he made them of bronze, as stated (in I Kings 14:27): <small>THEN KING REHOBOAM MADE SHIELDS OF BRONZE IN PLACE OF THEM</small>. They began to diminish: {Rehoboam}, Ahijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, {<small>JUDAH</small>,} [Jehoram], Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, and Zedekiah. [It is also written (in II Kings 25:7):] <small>THEN HE PUT OUT ZEDEKIAH'S EYES</small>. Ergo: The moon was in its decline. The moon set; they began to walk in darkness. The people of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, how long will the worldly darkness remain upon us, and the light belong to the peoples of the world? The Holy One said: [By your life, In the world to come I am bringing darkness to the nations of the world] and the light to you.

She said: Whatever woman saw me thus would say: This is a whore. What did she do (according to vs. 6)? <small>SHE WENT DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR AND DID JUST AS HER MOTHER-IN-LAW HAD COMMANDED HER</small>. &lt;It was only&gt; after she went down, &lt;that&gt; she did everything that her mother-in-law had commanded her.

What is the meaning of <small>WAS STARTLED</small>? He imagined that she might be a spirit or a demon (<i>mazziq</i>).

Therefore (in Exod. 12:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. &lt;Exod. 11:4; 12:29 also&gt; teaches that the night &lt;generally&gt; divides on its own, but he (i.e., the Holy One) divided it like a thread of hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., while Moses could only approximate and say: <small>ABOUT MIDNIGHT</small>, the Holy One could act <small>IN</small> the exact <small>MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>.

It is so stated (in Exod. 12:33): <small>AND THE EGYPTIANS PRESSED &lt;THE PEOPLE ON, TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE LAND IN HASTE</small>&gt;…. The Holy One said to them: By your life, none of you shall die here but in the sea. Why did all of them not die from the plague of the first-born, but in the sea? R. Samuel bar Nahman said: &lt;It&gt; was through guile &lt;that&gt; the Egyptians came upon Israel. They said: If we enslave them by fire, their God will be able to bring fire upon us from above just as he brought it upon the Sodomites. He has, however, sworn never again to bring a flood into the world. {By your life,} come and let us enslave them through water. The Holy One said: I have sworn never again to bring a flood into the world. By your life, those people have gone into the flood. It is so stated (in Ps. 63:11 [10]): <small>THEY SHALL BE DRAGGED</small><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Interpreting <i>yaggiruhu</i> as coming from the root <i><small>GRR</small></i> instead of from <i><small>NGR</small></i>.</i> <small>TO THE POWER OF THE DRYNESS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Interpreting <i><small>HRB</small></i> as <i>horev</i> instead of <i>herev</i>.

R. 2:15:1.</i> (of the sea bed). These people (i.e. these Egyptians) were dragged and went into the sea on their own. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY SHALL BE A PORTION FOR THE FOXES</small>. Solomon said (Cant. 2:15): <small>TAKE US &lt;TO&gt; THE FOXES</small> (<i><small>ShW'LYM</small></i>)…. R.

The Holy One exacted punishment from them in Egypt and afterwards he exacted punishment from them at the sea.

When he had killed their prince, he afterwards killed them; and so it says (in Exod. 12:12): <small>AND ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT &lt;I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS</small>&gt;…. &lt;Gods &gt; of stone have rotted; &lt;those&gt; of silver and gold have been melted. When he had exacted punishment from their gods, he afterwards exacted punishment from them. (Exod. 15:1, cf. 21:) <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN INTO THE SEA</small>. This is the prince. And after that (in vs. 4): <small>PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS AND HIS ARMY &lt;HE HAS CAST INTO THE SEA</small>&gt;. Also in the case of this evil Roman Empire, when the Holy One has exacted punishment from their prince, he will afterwards exact punishment from them, just as he did to the Babylonian Empire. When he had exacted punishment from their prince, he afterwards exacted punishment from Nebuchadnezzar. It is so stated (in Jer. 51:44): <small>I WILL ATTEND TO BEL</small> (the prince of Babylon) <small>IN BABYLON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. vs. 47: <small>I WILL DEAL WITH THE IMAGES OF BABYLON…; AND ALL ITS SLAIN SHALL FALL IN THE MIDST OF IT</small>.</i> And so also he does to Edom (i.e., to Rome), as stated (in Jer. 46:15): <small>WHY HAS ABBIREKHA BEEN WASHED AWAY</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands <i><small>ABBIREKHA</small></i> as a singular subject, because the Hebrew verb translated, <small>HAS BEEN WASHED AWAY</small>, is singular; however, it is common to follow such a singular verb with a plural subject. Thus the new JPS translation reads: <small>WHY ARE YOUR STALWARTS SWEPT AWAY</small>?</i> This is their prince since he is afflicting that <i>Abbirekha</i> with leprosy.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">See below, Lev. 4:16; cf. Gen. 41:43, where “Abrech” (‘<i><small>BRK</small></i>) can be taken as a princely title, which according to Gen. R. 90:3 has the homiletic meaning, “Father (‘<small><i>B</i></small>) in wisdom and tender (<i><small>RK</small></i>) in years.” In the biblical context Jer. 46:15 refers to Egypt, but the midrash regards <i>Abbirekha</i> as intimating the prince of Edom, since according to sec. 6, above, “All the plagues which the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians he is going to bring upon Edom.”</i> Now <small>WASHED AWAY</small> (rt.: <small>SHP</small>) can only mean leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>&lt;WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &gt; A SWELLING OR A SORE</small> (rt.: <small>SPH</small>) <small>&lt;OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY &gt;</small>…. Then afterwards he exacts punishment from it (i.e., the whole Kingdom of Edom, rt.: '<small>DM</small>). It is so stated (in Jer. 46:15, cont.): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD THRUST IT DOWN</small>. And so it also says (in Is. 24:21): <small>THE LORD SHALL PUNISH THE HOST OF HEAVEN IN HEAVEN</small>; then afterwards (ibid.): <small>AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</small> (rt.: '<small>DM</small>) {<small>IN</small>} [<small>ON</small>] <small>THE EARTH</small> (rt.: '<small>DM</small>). But in the case of Israel, just as their God lives and abides forever and forevermore, so do they live and abide forever and forevermore. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 10:10): <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD: HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>; while concerning Israel it is written (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.

(Exod. 13:17:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt;THE PEOPLE&gt; GO</small>…. This text is related (to Job 9:4): <small>ONE WISE OF HEART AND MIGHTY IN STRENGTH—WHO HAS HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST HIM AND PROSPERED</small>? [<small>ONE WISE OF HEART</small>:] This is the Holy One, as stated (in Job 12:13): <small>WITH HIM ARE WISDOM AND</small> {<small>UNDERSTANDING</small>} [<small>VALOR</small>]. (Job 9:4, cont.:) <small>WHO HAS HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST HIM AND PROSPERED</small>? The generation of the flood hardened themselves against him; so he washed them away with water. The generation of the dispersion hardened themselves against him; &lt;so&gt; he dispersed them throughout the world. The people of Sodom hardened themselves against him, and what was their end? (Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt;… BRIMSTONE AND FIRE.&gt;</small> (Exod. 5:2:) <small>PHARAOH SAID: WHO IS THE LORD</small>? For the Holy One had said to him (in vs. 1): <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>; but he also hardened himself, as stated (in Exod. 13:15): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST LETTING</small> {<small>THEM</small>} [<small>US</small>] <small>GO</small>. As soon as the plague of the first-born came upon him, he immediately let them go. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt; THE PEOPLE &gt; GO</small>….

Another interpretation (of Exod. 13:17): [<small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt;THE PEOPLE&gt; GO</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 66:3): <small>SAY TO GOD: HOW AWESOME ARE YOUR WORKS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 20:10; <i>PR</i> 19:2; <i>PRK</i> 11:2; M. Pss. 22:15.</i> R. Eleazar the son of R. Jose the Galilean said: What is the meaning of <small>SAY TO GOD</small>?

R. Berekhyah and R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite differed. One said: <small>THEY DWINDLE AWAY</small> (<i>yekhahashu</i>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; they shall be broken, just as it is stated (in Deut. 33:29): <small>YOUR ENEMIES SHALL DWINDLE AWAY</small> (<i>yekhahashu</i>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>. But the other said: <small>THEY ARE DECEITFUL</small> (rt.: <small>KH<i>Sh</i></small>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; your enemies shall lie and act deceitfully (rt.: <i><small>KHSh</small></i>).

Ergo (in Ps. 66:3): <small>&lt;YOUR ENEMIES&gt; SHALL BE DECEITFUL BEFORE YOU</small>. Sennacherib said (in II Kings 18:35): <small>WHO AMONG ALL THE GODS OF &lt;THOSE&gt; LANDS &lt;HAVE DELIVERED THEIR LAND FROM MY HAND&gt;</small>…? He did not move from there until he had dwindled away, as stated (in II Chron. 32:21): <small>&lt;THEN THE LORD SENT AN ANGEL, WHO DESTROYED EVERY MIGHTY WARRIOR, COMMANDER, AND OFFICER IN THE CAMP OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA. &gt; SO HE RETURNED SHAME</small> [<small>FACED TO HIS OWN LAND</small>]. Pharaoh said (in Exod. 5:2): <small>I DO NOT KNOW THE LORD, &lt;AND MOREOVER I WILL NOT LET ISRAEL GO&gt;</small>. &lt;That statement&gt; became a lie (<small>KH<i>Sh</i></small>) for them, when &lt;Pharaoh&gt; said (in Exod. 9:27): <small>THE LORD IS RIGHT, AND I AND MY PEOPLE ARE IN THE WRONG</small>. So he himself sent them away, as stated (in Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt; THE PEOPLE &gt; GO</small>….

Another interpretation (of Exod. 13:17): [<small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt;THE PEOPLE&gt; GO</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE'S WAYS, HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 54:1; <i>PRK</i> 11:1.</i> R. Joshua ben Levi said: About whom does it speak? About the evil drive, for is there &lt;any&gt; enemy of mine greater than this? It is customary that when one dwells in a city with a companion for one year, even if he hates him, he becomes his friend. The evil drive grows up with a person from his youth to his old age, and every day it wants to make him fall. So if it cannot make him fall within ten years, it makes him fall within twenty years. They said about Johanan the High Priest (i.e., John Hyrcanus) that he served in the High Priesthood for eighty years and in the end became a Sadducee.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. 12:293–298; <i>Ber</i>. 29a (Bar.); but cf. <i>Qid</i>. 66a, according to which it was, not John Hyrcanus (High Priest from 135/4 to 104 BCE), but Alexander Jannaeus (High Priest from 103 to 76) who turned from the Pharisees to heresy.</i>
R. Berekhyah applies to &lt;the evil drive&gt; (Prov. 25:21): <small>IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, GIVE HIM BREAD TO EAT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See M.

(Prov. 25:21, cont.:) <small>AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM WATER TO DRINK</small> from the waters of Torah, just as it says (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small>. For what reason? (Prov. 25:22:) <small>BECAUSE YOU WILL BE HEAPING BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE'S WAYS</small>. This refers to the good drive. (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>. This refers to the evil drive. David said (in Ps. 35:10): <small>ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY: LORD, WHO IS LIKE YOU? YOU DELIVER THE POOR FROM ONE STRONGER THAN HE</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; the good drive from the evil drive.
R.

Now when the Holy One is pleased with the ways of a person, he makes the one to be at peace with the other. There is a story about a certain snake who came hissing from the field. He entered someone's house on the Sabbath eve at nightfall, and saw a bowl of crushed garlic placed on the table. He put his mouth over it to eat the garlic. After he had eaten it, he vomited it into &lt;the bowl&gt;. Then he covered the bowl just as it had been at first. Another house snake saw it. What did he do? He went and uncovered the bowl. When they found it uncovered, they emptied it out. Who caused this householder not to die? The snake who uncovered &lt;the bowl&gt;. Ergo, (in Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE'S WAYS, &lt;HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM&gt;</small>.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED &lt;WITH ONE'S</small> (<i>ish</i>) <small>WAYS&gt;</small>. This refers to Israel, about which it is written (in Deut. 27:14): {<small>AND</small>} <small>EACH ONE</small> (<i>ish</i>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small>. &lt;The verse from Proverbs refers to Israel, &gt; while they were in Egypt, when the time had come for the redemption. (Prov. 16:7, cont.): <small>HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>. This refers to Pharaoh of whom it is written (in Exod. 15:9): <small>I WILL PURSUE, I WILL OVERTAKE, I WILL DIVIDE THE SPOIL</small>. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 13:17:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &lt;THE PEOPLE &gt; GO</small>.

When the one who sold the &lt; timbers &gt; saw these things, he began to {be angry} [lament] and said: Woe to that person! What has he sold? So it was in the case of Pharaoh. When Israel was enslaved to him with clay and bricks, it was not known that they were a people. As soon as they had left Egypt, when they went and became troops by the sea, Pharaoh went out and saw that these very ones had become troops.

According to custom the slave gives light to the master, but in this case the Holy One gave light to Israel, as stated (Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM &lt;BY DAY IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT&gt;</small>…. Ergo, he did not lead them in the manner of the whole earth. And why all this?

(Exod. 15:1:) <small>THEN SANG MOSES</small>…. This text is related (to Cant. 4:8): [<small>COME</small>] <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON, MY BRIDE</small>, [<small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>]. It was only necessary to say &lt;a single&gt; {<small>COME</small>} <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>, [<small>MY BRIDE</small>]. What is the meaning of &lt;the second&gt; <small>COME WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>? Simply that in the world to come the Holy One will bring and assemble the dispersion of Israel. They shall go to Jerusalem, and the Divine Presence shall go forth for an <i>apante</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “meeting.”</i> with them {i.e., to their region}. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 4:8): <small>COME WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>.
Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:8): <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small> (rt.: <small>LBN</small>).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since this root also designates a brick, Lebanon becomes an allusion to the bricks made in Egypt. See Exod. R. 23:5.</i> R. Levi said: The Holy One said: I was with you during the Egyptian enslavement. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: R. Levi bar Susi expounded as follows: (Exod. 24:10:) <small>AND THEY SAW THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>, after they had been redeemed &lt;from the Egyptian enslavement, (ibid., cont.:) <small>AND UNDER HIS FEET THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE BRICKWORK</small> (rt.: <small>LBN</small>) <small>OF SAPPHIRE</small>, before they were redeemed.

Of Egypt it is written (ibid.) <small>AND UNDER HIS FEET THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE BRICKWORK</small> (rt.: <small>LBN</small>) <small>OF SAPPHIRE</small>; but of Babylon it is written (in Ezek. 1:26): <small>IN APPEARANCE LIKE</small> {<small>THE</small>} <small>STONEWORK OF SAPPHIRE</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since stone is harder to work than brick, the Babylonian enslavement must have been more difficult.</i> Of Egypt it is written (in Exod. 1:14): <small>AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER WITH HARD LABOR</small>; but of Babylon it is written (in Is. 14:3): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GIVES &lt;YOU&gt; REST &lt;FROM YOUR SORROW, FROM YOUR TROUBLE, &gt; AND FROM YOUR HARD LABOR</small>. The Holy One said to them: In Babylon I was with you, and in Egypt I was with you.

(Cant. 4:8, cont.:) <small>SING</small><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Both the Masoretic and the Buber texts read <small>LOOK</small> (<i>tashori</i>) here, but the interpretation of the midrash assumes that the text reads <small>SING</small> (<i>tashiri</i>), a difference of a single vowel.

Another interpretation [(of Cant. 4:8, cont.): <small>SING FROM THE TOP OF AMANA</small>.] By what merit did Israel merit uttering a song over the sea?

Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN</small> (<i>az</i>) <small>SANG MOSES</small>….] This text is related (to Ps. 40:2 [1]): <small>I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE LORD</small>…. R. Pinhas ben Hama the Priest said: If you waited patiently and he did not come, continue to wait. David said (in Ps. 27:14): <small>WAIT FOR THE LORD</small>; [<small>BE STRONG AND LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE! O WAIT FOR THE LORD</small>]. If he came, your expectation was right.

(Exod. 15:1) <small>THEN</small> (<i>az</i>) <small>SANG MOSES</small>. What is the meaning of (<i>az</i>)? With an <i>az</i> the Holy One made the dry land into sea for the generation of Enosh.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:1): Why with <i>az</i>? Moses said: With an <i>az</i> I complained to the Holy One, as stated (in Exod. 5:23): <small>FOR EVER SINCE</small> (<i>az</i>) <small>I CAME &lt;TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME, HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE&gt;</small>…. With the word by which I sinned, with that very word <i>az</i> I am making amends by praising you (in Exod. 15:1).
Another interpretation of <i>az</i> (spelled with the two Hebrew letters <i>alef</i> and <i>zayin</i>)<i>. Alef</i> is one and <i>zayin</i> is seven for a total of eight. Moses said: By the merit of circumcision, which was ordained for &lt;day&gt; eight (Lev. 12:3), the sea was rent asunder. So let us praise him with an <i>az</i>. R.

Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN SHALL MOSES &lt;AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt; SING</small>.] "Then sang Moses," is not &lt;actually&gt; stated here, but <small>THEN SHALL</small> [<small>MOSES</small>] <small>SING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Shirata</i> 1; also <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 4:10.</i> In the world to come Israel is going to utter a song to the <small>LORD</small>. {The song is suitable} [He is suitable for the song], and the song is suitable for the <small>LORD</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN SANG</small>.

The Holy One said to them: When my children are put in distress, would you offer me praise? When they came up from the sea, Israel and the ministering angels wanted to utter a song. R. Abbin the Levite said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who went down to battle and won. His son and his servant came to him, and in their hands was a crown to put on the king's head. They came to the king and said to him: Your son and your servant are standing by with a crown in their hands. Who will enter first? He said to them: &lt;You are&gt; the world's greatest fools! Shall my servant precede my son? Let my son enter first. Similarly, when Israel came up from the sea, Israel and the ministering angels came to utter a song. The Holy One said to the ministering angels: Let Israel be first. (Exod. 15:1:) <small>THEN SANG MOSES</small> [<small>AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>]. The women and the ministering angels were found to be standing by. Who would offer praise first? R. Hiyya bar Abba bar Shallum said: He made peace between them, as stated (in Ps. 68:26 [25]): <small>SINGERS COME FIRST; THEN FOLLOW MUSICIANS IN THE MIDST OF TIMBREL-PLAYING MAIDENS</small>.

These are the women. The ministering angels began to complain to the Holy One. They said: Is it not enough for the men to precede us? But are the women to do so as well?

(Exod. 15:1, cont.:) <small>I WILL SING TO THE LORD FOR HE IS EXALTEDLY &lt; EXALTED</small> &gt;. R. Abbin the Levite said: There are four exalted beings in the world.

(Exod. 15:1, cont.:) <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</small>. Was there &lt;only&gt; one horse, in view of what is written: <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</small>? It is simply that, they were not all counted &lt; individually &gt; before the Holy One but &lt;were counted &gt; as a single &lt;unit&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

[Bar Qappara said:] The Holy One bound them to one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Thus they became a single unit, as implied by the singular nouns in Exod. 15:1.</i> Why? So that Israel would benefit in the booty. Why? When Israel left Egypt, the Egyptians went after them. Pharaoh said to them: I know that they took your silver and gold, but pay no attention to booty. What did he do? He opened the treasury<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>thesauros</i>.</i> of Joseph. He said: Take silver and gold for yourselves. So they took &lt;it&gt; and adorned their horses. Thus it is stated (in the singular in Exod. 14:9): <small>ALL THE HORSE OF PHARAOH'S CHARIOT</small> (<small>RKB</small>). Therefore they were tied to one another so that Israel would benefit in the booty. In this world Israel has benefited in the plunder of her enemies, but in the world to come whatever the nations acquire will belong to Israel. It is so stated (of Tyre, which collects harlotry fees from all the kingdoms of the earth, in Is. 23:18): <small>HER PROFITS AND HER HARLOT'S HIRE SHALL BE DEDICATED TO THE LORD</small>.

(Exod. 15:22:) <small>THEN MOSES HAD ISRAEL JOURNEY &lt;FROM THE REED SEA&gt;</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>. Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, just as the sheep are scattered and the shepherd gathers them, so in the wilderness Israelites were always fighting among themselves, weeping, and complaining, as stated (in Ps. 78:40): <small>HOW OFTEN DID THEY DEFY HIM IN THE WILDERNESS</small>! The Holy One, as it were, did not depart from them but led them like sheep. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, just as the sheep destroy the trees, and yet their master is not upset with them, &lt;so it is with Israel&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 24:3; M. Pss. 78:17.</i> Therefore he calls them sheep. And so it says (in Ezek. 34:31): <small>FOR YOU MY FLOCK, THE FLOCK OF MY PASTURE, YOU ARE HUMANS</small>. If sheep, why humans; and if humans, why sheep?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, why does Ezekiel inconsistently call Israel both ovine and human?</i> R. Johanan said: They are sheep when it comes to punishments and humans when it comes to giving a reward. [If they are guilty, he treats them like sheep in order to punish them; but if they perform the commandments he treats them like humans in order to give them a reward. Ergo, sheep for punishments, and humans for giving a reward.]
Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>. R. Berekhyah said: See how beloved Israel was before the Holy One, when he called them a lamb! It is so stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED LAMB</small>. Whoever has a single lamb feeds it and waters it on time because it is &lt;only&gt; one. However, whoever has a lot of sheep is not able to care for them. He merely expends a lot of toil with them. See the love with which the Holy One loved Israel when he called them sheep and says (in Ezek. 36:37): <small>I WILL MULTIPLY THEM LIKE SHEEP</small>!<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike human shepherds, the Holy One cares for each member of the flock as if it were an only sheep.</i>
Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, [just] as a shepherd looks out for his sheep during the day because of the heat and during the night because of the wolves, so the Holy One looks out for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Is. 4:6): <small>THERE SHALL BE A SUKKAH AS A SHADE &lt; FROM THE HEAT&gt; BY DAY</small>…. And it says (in Exod. 13:22): <small>THE PILLAR OF CLOUD DID NOT DEPART BY DAY</small>…. It also says (in Ps. 77:21 [20]): <small>YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE SHEEP</small>…. What is the meaning of <small>YOU LED</small> (<small>NHYT</small>)? <small>NHYT</small> is simply an acronym.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>notarikon</i>.</i> &lt;N:&gt; Awesome things (<i>nora'ot</i>) &lt;which&gt; you showed us in Egypt. &lt;H:&gt; Your wrath (<i>haronekha</i>) &lt;which&gt; you poured out upon them. &lt;Y:&gt; Your right hand (<i>yeminekha</i>) &lt;which&gt; devoured them. &lt;T:&gt; The deep (<i>tehom</i>) &lt;with which&gt; you covered them. R. Joshua says: &lt;N: &gt; Wonders (<i>nifla'ot</i>) &lt;which&gt; you performed for us. &lt;H:&gt; Freedom (<i>herut</i>) &lt;which&gt; you gave us. &lt;Y:&gt; A sea (<i>yam</i>) &lt;which&gt; you parted for us. &lt;T:&gt; Torah &lt;which&gt; you gave us. R.

Now all these were through the merit of Moses. Ergo (in Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY &lt;FROM THE REED SEA …&gt;</small>.

Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt;</small><small>JOURNEY &lt;FROM THE REED SEA …&gt;</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY</small>? That he had them journey under duress when they were unwilling. How? It is simply that when Israel left Egypt, Pharaoh left in pursuit of them with all those troops,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochlos</i> (“multitude”).</i> as stated (in Exod. 14:7): <small>THEN HE TOOK SIX HUNDRED SELECT CHARIOTS</small>. What did he do? He arose and adorned all those horses with precious stones and pearls.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>margellion</i>.</i> When they came to the sea, the Holy One drowned them. Then all those precious stones and pearls floated up on the seashore where they were thrown. Then Israel went down every day to take some. So they did not want to move from there. When Moses saw that, he said to them: What are you thinking? That on every day the sea will bring up precious stones and pearls for you? He arose and had them travel under duress.
Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY &lt;FROM THE REED SEA</small>…&gt;. R. Joshua said: Which journey did Israel make that was not by divine command?<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Wayassa</i>‘ 1.</i> This is the one of which it is stated (in Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY</small>.
R. Eleazar of Modim says: They did journey by divine command, as we find to be so {in one place &lt;or&gt; two or three} [elsewhere in two or three places] (e.g., in Numb. 9:18, 20, 23): <small>AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY</small> (i.e., the children of Israel) <small>JOURNEYED</small>. So also here (in Exod. 15:22), although he has written <small>THEN</small> [<small>MOSES</small>] <small>HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY</small>, they journeyed by divine command. Then what is the meaning of (Exod 15:22:) <small>THEN MOSES HAD &lt;ISRAEL&gt; JOURNEY</small>? When he told them to journey, they did not say to him: Where are we journeying? Into the desert? Perhaps there is nothing there. Rather they arose and journeyed in trustfulness. Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 2:2): <small>GO AND PROCLAIM IN THE EARS OF JERUSALEM</small>, [<small>SAYING: THUS SAYS THE LORD: I HAVE REMEMBERED IN YOUR FAVOR THE FAITHFULNESS OF YOUR YOUTH</small>…, <small>HOW YOU WENT AFTER ME IN THE DESERT, IN A LAND NOT SOWN</small>].

[(Exod. 15:22, cont.:) <small>THEY WENT THREE DAYS IN THE WILDERNESS AND FOUND NO WATER</small>.] R. Joshua says: When Israel crossed through the sea, fresh water came forth for them. So they partook of it in their vessels and drank; but as soon as the water was finished, they complained, as stated (in Exod. 15:24): <small>AND THE PEOPLE MURMURED AGAINST MOSES, &lt; SAYING: WHAT SHALL WE DRINK?&gt; WHEN</small> (in vs. 23) <small>THEY CAME TO MARAH, &lt;THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF MARAH BECAUSE IT WAS BITTER</small> (<i>Marim</i>). <small>FOR THAT REASON ITS NAME WAS CALLED MARAH.&gt;</small> They should have consulted with the greatest one among them; but they arose and complained.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Wayassa</i>‘ 1.</i> R. Eleazar of Modim says: Israel was accustomed to speaking words of complaint against the Holy One. Immediately (in Exod. 15:25:) <small>&lt;MOSES&gt; CRIED UNTO THE LORD, AND THE LORD TAUGHT</small> (<i>wayyorehu</i>) <small>HIM A TREE</small>. "Showed him (<i>wayyar'ehu</i>)" is not stated &lt;here&gt;, but <small>TAUGHT HIM</small> (<i>wayyorehu</i>). R. Simeon ben Johay said: He taught him [something] from the Torah, concerning which it is written (in Prov. 3:18) <small>IT IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. The Holy One taught him (the living tree of Torah). Then he spoke over the water and it became fresh.

By whatever means he wounds he heals. The Holy One told Moses to put something sour into something sour for it to become sweet thereby.

(Exod. 16:4:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. This text is related (to Job 36:31): <small>FOR THROUGH THESE THINGS HE JUDGES PEOPLES</small>. These things are the heavens; through them he judges the peoples of the world. You yourself know that, when the generation of the flood sinned, he judged them through those &lt; heavens &gt;, as stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>HE WILL RAIN DOWN SNARES UPON THE WICKED</small>…. Ergo (in Job 36:31): <small>FOR THROUGH THESE THINGS HE JUDGES PEOPLES</small>…. When the people of Sodom sinned, he judged them through the heavens, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Through the heavens he judges the peoples. (Job 36:31, cont.:) <small>HE GIVES FOOD IN ABUNDANCE</small>. From those &lt; heavens &gt; we know that he gave nourishment to Israel.

Thus &lt;the oven&gt; gave him the burning coals and the bread. Both of them came out of the oven. So the Holy One brought down fire upon the Sodomites and burned them up, but for Israel he brought down manna from heaven, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN &lt;BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS &gt; FOR YOU</small>….
Another interpretation: It should not have said: <small>FROM THE HEAVENS</small>, but "From the earth," because their bread customarily comes up only from the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 4:20; cf.

When he wished &lt;to do so&gt;, he divided the sea before Israel and made it dry land; and when he wished &lt;to do so&gt; he made it a sea. The custom of heaven is to bring down dew and rain and for the earth to bring forth bread, as stated (in Job 28:5): <small>AS FOR THE EARTH, OUT OF IT COMES FORTH BREAD</small>. But when he wished &lt;to do so&gt;, he brought down the bread from the heavens, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD &lt; FROM THE HEAVENS&gt; FOR YOU</small>…. And the dew goes up from the earth, as stated (in Exod. 16:14): <small>WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP</small>. This text is related (to II Chron. 12:8): <small>NEVERTHELESS, THEY SHALL BE</small> {<small>MY</small>} [<small>HIS</small>] <small>SERVANTS</small>…. But they were not servants to Nebuchadnezzar, as stated (in Dan. 1:6): <small>NOW AMONG THOSE FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH WERE DANIEL, &lt; HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH &gt;</small>…. What did he do for them? (Vs. 5): <small>THE KING APPOINTED FOR THEM</small> [<small>A DAILY PORTION</small>]….

Whoever believes has the right to eat of it, but whoever does not believe, (according to Job 20:17): <small>MAY NOT LOOK UPON THE STREAMS, &lt;THE TORRENTIAL RIVERS OF HONEY AND CREAM&gt;</small>.

The peoples of the world were not able to taste it because in their mouths it became like bitter wormwood. What did they do? They caught a deer that had drunk of it, and they took from it a taste of manna. Then they said: Blessed be the {body} [nation] which has this. R.

Where it is stated (in Ezek. 16:19): <small>ALSO MY BREAD, WHICH I GAVE YOU, FINE FLOUR, OIL, AND HONEY</small>…. Each and everyone tasted it according to his physical ability. Whoever was active went out and gathered it from the field, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL GO OUT TO GATHER</small>.

(Exod. 16:14:) [<small>FINE AND FLAKY</small>]. Bar Qappara said: What is the meaning of <small>FLAKY</small> (<small>MHSPS</small>)?

Do not read: <small>BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small> ('<i><small>BYRYM</small></i>) but: <small>BREAD OF HUMAN MEMBERS</small> ('<i><small>BRYM</small></i>). The ministering angels ground up the manna.

R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: When the manna was given to Israel, it was given to them in Alush. And why in Alush? For the sake of our mother Sarah, of whom it is written (in Gen. 18:6): <small>KNEAD</small> (<i>lushi</i>) <small>IT AND MAKE CAKES</small>. Therefore, &lt;the manna &gt; was given to them in Alush.
(Exod. 16:4:) <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD &lt;FROM THE HEAVENS&gt; FOR YOU</small>…. The Holy One said to them: See what the difference is between me and you.

(Exod. 16:29:) <small>OBSERVE THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>OBSERVE</small> (<i>re'u</i>)? R.

If you say two, is it not already so stated (in Exod. 16:22): <small>TWO OMERS APIECE</small>? Hezekiah bar Hiyya said that it was different (<i><small>MShNH</small></i>) in its taste, in its aroma, and in its appearance. And not only that, but on every day, whoever had some of it left over from evening until morning caused a stench; yet concerning the Sabbath, it is written (in vs. 24): <small>IT DID NOT HAVE A STENCH</small>. Ergo, they gathered bread <small>TWOFOLD</small> (in the sense that it was different). [(Exod. 16:22:) <small>THEN ALL THE PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION CAME AND TOLD MOSES</small>.] At that time he remembered that he had forgotten to tell them the section of Torah on the Sabbath, as the Holy One had told him. As soon as they came and spoke to him, Moses said to them (in vs. 23): <small>THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN: TOMORROW IS A COMPLETE REST, A SABBATH HOLY TO THE LORD</small>…. Jeremiah said (in Jer. 2:29): <small>WHY DO YOU COMPLAIN AGAINST ME</small>…? Even Moses, when I told him to tell them the section of Torah on the Sabbath, forgot and did not tell them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL OF YOU HAVE SINNED AGAINST ME</small>. R. Judah says: The Holy One honored the Sabbath in that on every day the manna came down, but on the Sabbath it did not come down. It is so stated (in Exod. 16:27): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE SEVENTH DAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WENT OUT TO GATHER &lt; MANNA &gt; AND FOUND NOTHING</small>.

As they were walking along, he saw a certain person to whom he said: Have you seen my father? [&lt;His father&gt; said to him: You ride on my shoulders, and whatever you desire I do for you. Now you say to him: Have you seen my father?] What did he do? He threw him off his shoulders. Then a dog came and bit him. So in the case of Israel, when Israel came forth from Egypt, he immediately enveloped them with clouds of glory. &lt;When&gt; they desired, the Holy One brought down manna for them. &lt;When&gt; they desired, he brought quail for them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 78:29, cont.): <small>SO HE BROUGHT THEM WHAT THEY CRAVED</small>. He gave them everything they needed. They began to reflect and say (in Exod. 17:7): <small>IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US OR NOT</small>? The Holy One said to them: By your life, I am informing you. Behold, the dog is coming and biting you. And who is this &lt;dog&gt;? This is Amalek, as stated (in Exod. 17:8): <small>THEN AMALEK CAME</small>.
R. Berekhyah said: Why was his name called Amalek '<i><small>MLQ</small></i>? &lt;They were called&gt; '<i><small>MLQ</small></i> (i.e., a people lick), because they came to lick Israel's blood like a dog.

Joshua said: How many nobler ones there are here? Aaron, Hur, and seventy elders. &lt;Nevertheless,&gt; he spoke only to me! What is there for me to do &lt;but&gt; carry out his decree? &lt;Then&gt; immediately (in vs. 10): <small>JOSHUA DID &lt;AS MOSES TOLD HIM&gt;</small>….

Then Solomon said (in Eccl. 3:11): <small>HE HAS MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME</small>. If someone else had said it, they would have laughed at him, saying: Who has made known to this one what is beautiful and what is not beautiful?

Cf. <i>chalidophoros</i> (“cupbearer”).</i> and wine jugs from house to house, she examined herself at each and every jug. At the last one she examined herself and was found to be unclean. Rabban Gamaliel was afraid, saying: Perhaps the clean ones have been become unclean! He said to her: Did you not examine yourself? She said to him: By your life, My Lord, I examined myself between each and every jug, but at the last one I examined myself and was found to be unclean. Rabban Gamaliel said: If this woman had been slothful, all the clean ones would already have been unclean. (Eccl. 10:18:) <small>THROUGH SLOTH THE ROOF SAGS</small>.

[&lt;Thus&gt; the king was able to have his son marry with an old <i>argentaria</i> which appeared to be new (rt.: <small>HD<i>Sh</i></small>).] So too, when Israel went forth out of Egypt, the blind, the deaf, and the lame were among them. The Holy One said: [The Torah, all of it, is complete, as stated (in Ps. 19:8 [7]): <small>THE TORAH OF THE LORD IS PERFECT</small>.] Shall I give it to this generation when there are deformities among them? Shall I wait until their children arise? Shall I delay the joy of Torah? What did the Holy One do? He healed them. Then he gave them the Torah. But where is it shown [that he healed them]? Whoever was blind saw, as stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small>…. Whoever was deaf was made to hear, as stated (in Exod. 24:7): <small>ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small> (literally: <small>HEAR</small>).

Thus it is stated (in Jer. 31:33): <small>FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT WHICH I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD</small>: [<small>I WILL PUT MY TORAH IN THEIR INNERMOST PARTS, AND UPON THEIR HEART WILL I WRITE IT</small>.] And not only that, but I will increase peace among them.

For that reason he descended with twenty-two thousand corresponding &lt;in number&gt; to the host of Levites. Another interpretation (of Ps. 68:18 [17]): <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWO MYRIADS, THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small> (<i>shin'an</i>). &lt;This&gt; teaches that twenty-two thousand chariots came down with the Holy One.] Each and every chariot was like the chariot which Ezekiel saw, &lt;i.e.,&gt; a chariot of God. <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD</small>. R.

Another interpretation (of Ps. 68:18 [17]): <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWO MYRIADS, &lt;THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small> (<i>alfe shin'an</i>) &gt;. R.

Simon said: what is written (in Deut. 33:2)? <small>HE</small> (the Lord) <small>APPEARED FROM MOUNT PARAN, AND ARRIVED</small> ('<i>ata</i>) <small>FROM HOLY MYRIADS</small>. Thus he was <small>A BEACON</small> ('<i>ot</i>) in the midst of <small>HOLY MYRIADS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This reinterpretation is possible because in the Hebrew text neither “arrived” nor “beacon” (i.e., “sign” or “emblem”) have any consonants except <i>alef</i> plus <i>taw</i>.</i> There is no one like him. Who is comparable to him! R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: Wherever there are great throngs,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi</i>.</i> there is a pressing together. On Sinai, however, when the Holy One came, there came down with him thousands of thousands and a myriad of myriads (rt.: <small>RBH</small>), (according to Ps. 68:18 [17]) <small>THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small>; yet there was space for them. R. Eleazar ben Azariah and R. Eleazar of Modim made the following statements: One said: But would the mountain have contained them? The Holy One said to it: Widen (rt.: <small>RHB</small>) and lengthen yourself to receive the children of your Lord. But the other said: When the Holy One returns to Jerusalem, he will bring the diaspora back into it. It is so stated (in Is. 49:12): <small>LOOK</small>! <small>THESE ARE COMING</small> {<small>TO YOU</small>} <small>FROM AFAR</small>…. But will &lt;that city&gt; be able to contain them? The Holy One has told it (in Is. 54:2): <small>ENLARGE</small> (<small>RHB</small>) <small>THE SITE OF YOUR TABERNACLE</small>. (Ps. 68:18 [17], cont.): <small>THE LORD IS AMONG THEM, &lt;AS IN SINAI, SO IN THE HOLY PLACE</small>. &gt; Resh Laqish said: There is a tablet<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>tabula</i>.</i> over the heart of each and every angel where the name of the Holy One is joined with the name of each and every angel: &lt;e.g.,&gt; Michael (which means, "Who is like God?") and Raphael (which means, "God has healed.")

So also <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Pss., 797; <i>PRK</i> 12:22. Cf. Exod.

Nehemiah said: What is '<i>anokhi</i>? It is an Egyptian word. To what is the matter comparable? To a king whose son was captured and spent a long time with the captors. He learned the speech of those captors. When &lt;his father&gt; had taken vengeance on his enemies and brought him &lt;back&gt;, he went to converse with him in his own language; but he did not know it. What did he do? He began to speak with him in the language of his captors. Thus did the Holy One do with Israel. During all those years that Israel had been in Egypt, they had learned the Egyptian speech. When the Holy One had redeemed them, he came to give them the Torah, &lt;but&gt; they did not know how to understand it. The Holy One said: Here, I shall converse with them in the Egyptian language. '<i>Anokh</i>. In Egypt, when one wants to say "I" to a friend, he says: '<i>anokh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The word means “I” in Coptic.</i> Thus the Holy One began in their language and said (in Exod. 20:2): I ('<i>anokhi</i>).
Another interpretation: Since the Holy One had appeared to them in the sea as a warrior making war (Exod. 15:3), appeared to them on Sinai as a scribe teaching Torah, appeared to them in the days of Solomon as a youth (Cant. 5:15), and appeared to them in the days of Daniel as an elder (Dan. 7:9, 13, 22); the Holy One said to them: Even though they saw me in many forms, I am the one who was in the sea; I am the one who was on Sinai; <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.
R. Hiyya bar Abba said: He appeared to them in &lt;a form that was&gt; appropriate for each and every concern, and so in each and every matter. In the sea &lt;it was&gt; as a warrior &lt;that&gt; he waged the wars of Israel. On Sinai he taught Torah to Israel and served as a scribe. In the days of Daniel he taught Torah as an elder, for so it is fitting for Torah to be coming from the mouths of the elders. He appeared to them as a youth in the days of Solomon as was fitting for their deeds, as stated (in Cant. 5:15): <small>HIS VISAGE IS LIKE LEBANON, YOUNG AS THE CEDARS</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 20:2): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Hanina bar Pappa said: The Holy One appeared to them with an angry face, with a neutral face, with a friendly face, &lt;and&gt; with a laughing face.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 12:25; <i>PR</i> 21:6.</i> An angry face is for Scripture.

The Holy One said to them: Even though you see all these likenesses, (according to Exod. 20:2) <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Levi said: The Holy One appeared to them as an image<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.:<i>eikonion</i>.</i> with faces on every side. If a thousand people were looking at it, it would be looking &lt;back&gt; at all of them. So it is with the Holy One.

What is written (in Exod. 20:2) is &lt;this&gt;: <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small> (with <small>YOUR</small> in the singular). R. Jose bar Hanina said: It was according to the capacity of each and every person that the Divine Word spoke with him, and do not be surprised at this fact. Since we find in the case of the manna that, when it came down to Israel, each one of them savored it according to his capacity (<i>koah</i>), how much the more &lt;would the principle apply&gt; with the Divine Word!<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Exod. 1:22; 4:22; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 1:25; Exod.

He said to him: Because I have been studying Torah. And not only that, but I have been circumcised. He said to him: And who told you &lt;to do so&gt;? He said to him: I consulted with you.

Similarly, the lowliest soldier may win promotion but will never outrank the emperor. Therefore, Hadrian need never fear the Jews.</i> What did his associate regent do? He went up on the roof, fell down, and died. Thus the Holy Spirit cries out (in Jud. 5:31): <small>SO SHALL ALL YOUR ENEMIES PERISH, O LORD</small>. Hadrian said to Aquila: Why did you do this?

[Thus it is stated] (in Exod. 15:25): <small>THERE HE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM</small> [<small>A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE</small> (<i>mishpat</i>)]. The Holy One said to Moses: I have given them the Torah; you give them the ordinances (mishpatim).

He said to him: I want a place in your field. He said to him (in vs. 15): <small>&lt;WHAT IS&gt; A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER &lt;BETWEEN YOU AND ME</small>&gt;?

(Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY &lt;TO MY PEOPLE&gt;</small>…. R. Tanhuma opened on &lt;this verse with&gt; (Prov. 19:17): <small>THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 6:15.</i> Whoever lends to the poor is, as it were, as if he were lending to the Holy One. (Ibid.:) <small>THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>, [<small>AND HE WILL REPAY HIM HIS DUE</small>]. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>AND HE WILL REPAY HIM HIS DUE</small>? The Holy One said: When a poor person's soul (<i>nefesh</i>) was seeking to leave,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 6:15, expands: “When a poor person’s soul (<i>nefesh</i>) was seeking to leave out of hunger, you gave him a <i>prutah</i> (a small coin) and revived him.”</i> you revived him. By your life I am returning you life (<i>nefesh</i>) for life. Tomorrow, when your son or daughter comes into the hands of guilt or into the hands of death, [this deed] will be remembered on their behalf, and I will give them a life for a life. The Holy One said: By your life, you have been named as the one who gave him a loan, as stated (in Prov. 19:17): <small>&lt;THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR&gt; IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>. You find that for all the sins which a person commits, the Holy One sits in judgment over him, saying: How did his judgment come about? In the case of one who steals, the Holy One sits over him in judgment, also over the one who commits adultery and over the one who commits &lt;any other &gt; transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Exod. R. 31:14.</i> And so you find in the days of Ahab that Micah (i.e., Micaiah) said (in I Kings 22:19 or II Chron. 18:18):<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The text draws its wording from both I Kings 22:19 and from II Chron. 18:18, but Buber has emended his mss in conformity with I Kings 22:19.</i> <small>HEAR, THEREFORE, THE WORD OF THE LORD: I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left above?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 4:21; Exod. 1:21; Cant. R. 1:9:1.</i> &lt;Yes,&gt; and is it not written (in Exod. 15:6): <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND, O LORD, &lt;GLORIOUS IN POWER, YOUR RIGHT HAND SHATTERS THE ENEMY</small>&gt;? It also says (in Ps. 118:16): <small>THE RIGHT HAND OF THE LORD IS EXALTED</small>…. And it says here (in I Kings 22:19): <small>TO HIS RIGHT</small>… What is the meaning of <small>TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>? [Those on the right and those on the left.] The first group tilts the balance towards the scale of merit, and the other group tilts the balance towards the scale of guilt. So does the Holy One act towards all who commit &lt;any&gt; transgression. Their judgment is a matter of give and take. But in the case of one who has made a loan with interest, there is no give and take in his judgment. Instead &lt;the Holy One&gt; renders his judgment by himself. Thus the Holy One has said this to the ministering angels (in Ezek. 18:13): <small>WITH USURY HE HAS GIVEN</small>, {<small>AND WITH INTEREST</small>} <small>HE HAS TAKEN</small> [<small>INTEREST</small>]. <small>&lt;SHALL HE LIVE</small>?&gt; Immediately the ministering angels answer (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT LIVE. HE HAS COMMITTED ALL</small> [<small>THESE</small>] <small>ABOMINATIONS. HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Therefore Moses has said (in Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY TO MY PEOPLE</small>&gt;….&gt;

Another interpretation (of Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY &lt;TO MY PEOPLE, TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU, YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small>. &gt; What is the difference between a human act and an act of the Holy One? When someone human is in debt to a comrade, he says: Give me what you have on hand. He says to him: I have nothing now. They immediately have a quarrel and humiliate each other. But the Holy One is not like that. Thus you find that in the summer the day borrows from the night until the summer solstice.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Lev. 8:2; Exod. R. 31:15.</i> Then from the summer solstice until the winter solstice the night borrows from the day. Where is it shown? &lt;Where&gt; David said (in Ps. 19:3 [2]): <small>ONE DAY POURS OUT SPEECH TO ANOTHER</small>. The former is lending to the latter and the latter is lending to the former; but no one hears what the difference is between them, as stated (in vs. 4 [3]): <small>THERE IS NO UTTERANCE; THERE ARE NO WORDS</small>…. But when humans lend to each other, one hears quarreling. The Holy One said to Moses: Go and say to those Israelites: Although you lend to each other, you shall not treat &lt;the borrower &gt; with contempt.

Therefore, one looks at a poor person as though he were <small>WITH YOU</small>.

Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): <small>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">According to this reasoning, the various kingships were so close to each other in Israel because every king needed a seat in Israel in order to be regarded as a king.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND I SAID YOU SHALL CALL ME FATHER</small>. Just as a father is obliged &lt;to provide &gt; for his daughter's enjoyments, so did I bring down rain for you. (Exod. 16:14:) <small>WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP, &lt;THERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH LAY SOMETHING FINE AND FLAKY</small>&gt;…. (Jer. 3:20:) <small>SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER &lt;SO YOU HAVE BROKEN FAITH WITH ME, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>&gt;. R. Judah bar Simon said: Oh that &lt;you were&gt; like an unfaithful wife. This &lt;kind of&gt; a woman, who has a lover, gives him food, drink, and love. When his power is diminished, she leaves him and goes away. <small>SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER</small>. I have not done so to you. The manna came down for you, and the well rose up. I did not deprive you of anything when you were unfaithful with me. See, I gave you an angel who watched over you. (Exod. 23:20:) <small>SEE, I AM SENDING YOU AN ANGEL &lt;TO WATCH OVER YOU</small>&gt;. When you became worthy and received the Torah, I went before you in person. But now, when you have been found guilty, here I am &lt;merely&gt; (ibid.:) <small>SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU</small>. [Another interpretation:]<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 6:18.</i> The Holy One said to Moses: I am sending &lt;an angel&gt; before you but not before them. He said: If you send &lt;him&gt; out before me, I do not want &lt;him&gt;; but Joshua saw the angel and fell down before him. What did he say to him (in Josh. 5:13)? <small>ARE YOU FOR US OR FOR OUR ADVERSARIES</small>? When he said to him: <small>ARE YOU FOR US</small>? he began to cry in great anguish.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “From under the nails of his feet.”</i> (Ibid., vs. 14:) Then he said: <small>NO, BUT</small> <b>[I]</b> <small>AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST. NOW I HAVE COME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 97:3 (traditional text only).</i> Here are two times that I have come to give Israel an inheritance. I am the one who came in the days of your master, Moses; but he rejected me. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOW I HAVE COME. THEN JOSHUA FELL ON HIS FACE</small>. He saw him and fell on his face, but when Moses saw &lt;him&gt;, he rejected him. The Holy One said (in Exod. 23:20): <small>SEE, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU</small>, to you and to whomever observes the Torah [as you &lt;do&gt;. Resh Laqish said: It is written (in Ps. 91:4): <small>HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS AND YOU WILL FIND REFUGE UNDER HIS WINGS</small>, &lt;i.e.&gt; all who observe the Torah.] (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HIS FIDELITY IS A SHIELD AND BUCKLER</small>. Therefore (in Exod. 23:20): &lt; <small>I AM SENDING MY ANGEL BEFORE YOU &gt; TO GUARD YOU ON THE WAY</small>….

(Exod. 23:21:) <small>PAY HEED TO HIM, AND HEARKEN</small> (<small><i>SM</i></small>') <small>TO HIS VOICE. DO NOT REBEL AGAINST HIM, FOR HE WILL NOT PARDON YOUR TRANSGRESSION</small>. You were not worthy of hearing (rt.: <small><i>SM</i></small>') my voice. Hearken to (rt.: <small><i>SM</i></small>') the voice of an angel. He is unable to pardon your transgressions, because he is from the class who do not sin. Another interpretation (of Exod. 23:21:) <small>FOR HE WILL NOT PARDON YOUR TRANSGRESSION</small>. Why? Because he is an agent (<i>sheliah</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sheliah</i> designates one given power of attorney. It is equivalent to the Gk. term, <i>apostolos</i> (“apostle”), as used by early Christians.</i> and whatever an agent is ordered to do, he does. But I lift up my face to you (i.e., show you favor), as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE &lt;UNTO YOU</small>&gt;. David said to him: Sovereign of the World, You have delivered me to your angel, one who does not lift up his face. Who can withstand him? (Ps. 130:3) <small>IF YOU, O LORD</small>, {<small>LORD</small>}, <small>KEEP ACCOUNT OF INIQUITIES, WHO WILL WITHSTAND</small>? &lt;Even&gt; if you say there is no forgiveness with you, it is with you, as stated in (vs. 4): <small>FOR WITH YOU THERE IS FORGIVENESS SO THAT YOU MAY BE FEARED</small>.

Siman 12

(Exod. 23:21, cont.:) <small>FOR MY NAME IS WITH HIM</small>. The name of the Holy One is associated with each and every angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In other words the name of each angel contains the name of the Holy One, e.g., Michael, Rafael, and Gabriel, all of which contain the name, <i>El</i>.</i> Moses said to him: I do not want an angel to go with us.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 6:18, reads more clearly: “I do not want an angel to go with us but you.”</i> He said to him: If you &lt;yourself &gt; do not go with us, we are not moving from our place. The Holy One said to him: By your life, even though I will not send an angel before you, I will send the hornet before you, as stated (in Exod. 23:28): <small>I WILL SEND THE HORNET &lt; BEFORE YOU TO DRIVE OUT THE HEVITES, THE CANAANITES, AND THE HITTITES FROM BEFORE YOU</small>&gt;. How did the Amorites die? R. Levi said: He wedded two hornets to each and every one &lt;of them&gt;. Then when each and every hornet poured out its venom right into &lt;an Amorite's&gt; eyes, he died immediately. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: How did they die? A poison entered them, they {became saturated} [contracted diarrhea], and they died in the presence of Israel. R. Berekhyah said: The Holy One bound them before Israel. Then they came and killed them, as stated (in Deut. 3:3): <small>SO THE LORD OUR GOD GAVE OG, KING OF BASHAN, INTO OUR HANDS</small>…. &lt;The Holy One acted&gt; like someone who binds his child's enemy and sets him before his child. In case you say the Amorites were small, the Holy One exalts them (in Amos 2:9): [<small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES BEFORE THEM</small>,] <small>WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT</small>. And what did I do to them? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I DESTROYED THEIR FRUIT ABOVE</small>, i.e., their prince; <small>AND THEIR ROOTS BELOW</small>, i.e., the &lt;rest of the&gt; Amorites. The Holy One said: In this world I sent an angel before them, and he destroyed the peoples of the world; but in the world to come, I am sending you Elijah, may his memory be blessed. It is so stated (in Mal. 3:24 [4:5]): <small>LO, I AM SENDING YOU THE PROPHET ELIJAH BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD</small>.

(Exod. 25:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>…. This text is related (to Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>…. <small>INSTRUCTION</small> (<small>LQH</small>) &lt;denotes&gt; my Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:2.</i> &lt;It was&gt; customary for two traders<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateutai</i>. This interpretation follows the reading from the parallel text in <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:2. The spelling, <i><small>PRGMTYN</small></i>, in the Buber text suggests the Greek <i>pragmata</i> (“affairs,” “business”) and does not fit the context.</i> to be in the &lt;same&gt; district. One took in (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) raw silk,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>metaxa</i>.</i> and the other took in finished silk.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>holoserikon</i>. Cf. the parallel <i>Tanh</i>. text, which reads “pepper” (<i>pilpelin</i>) here.</i> They stood side by side. One said to his companion: Do you want to make a change? He said: Yes. &lt;So&gt; they changed &lt;roles&gt; with each other. The first handed over the raw silk and took the finished silk for himself. It turned out that a single commodity &lt;remained&gt; in the hands of the one, and a single commodity &lt;remained&gt; in the hands of the other. But Torah is not like that. One learns the &lt;talmudic&gt; order, "Seeds (<i>Zera'im</i>)," while another learns the order, "Damages (<i>Neziqin)."</i> Both of them stood side by side. One said to his companion: Teach me the order, "Seeds," and I shall teach you the order, "Damages." It turned out that the one had two &lt;orders&gt; in hand, and the other had two &lt; orders &gt; in hand. Is there &lt;any&gt; merchandise greater than this? Ergo (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>….
Another interpretation: Whoever acquires goods and takes to the road, is afraid of brigands,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai</i>.</i> but Torah is not like that. Can a brigand remove his Torah from the midst of his heart? Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &lt;I GAVE YOU&gt; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.
Our masters have told a story about a ship in which there were traders.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateutai</i>.</i> Now there was there a certain associate (<i>haver</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In this context the word designates a Rabbinic scholar.</i> They said to him: What is your business?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia</i>.</i> He said to them: It is secret. They said to him: Why will you not reveal it to us? He said to them: When I enter the district, I will reveal it to you. They began to go over the ship; and when they did not find &lt;anything&gt;, they began to laugh at him. They only did so until the tax collectors dealt with them and took whatever they had on hand. They had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. That associate entered the synagogue and began to sit and expound to them (the people). They began to honor him and to provide for him. Those who were with him in the ship began to come to him and seek &lt; assistance &gt; from him. They said to him, If you please, because you know us, plead our cause. What caused him to be saved? The Torah, which was in his heart. Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &lt;I GAVE YOU &gt; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &lt;I GAVE YOU &gt; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>. Whenever someone borrows from the children of Adam, acquires goods, and takes to the road, at times they are lost; but the Torah is not like this.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:3.</i> Rather, when one learns one chapter from here and another chapter from there, he is supported by them. Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &lt;I GAVE YOU&gt; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.

Siman 2

[(Exod. 25:2:) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.] The Holy One said to them: The Torah was mine, and you undertook them (the commandments).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:3: “And you undertook it (the Torah).”</i> Take me along with it. (Ibid.:) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>ME AS A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">So the midrash interprets this part of Exod. 25:2.</i> Resh Laqish said: Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ter</i>. 1:1): <small>THERE ARE FIVE WHO DO NOT SEPARATE OUT THE PRIESTLY SHARE; AND IF THEY DO SEPARATE IT OUT, THEIR PRIESTLY SHARE IS NOT A &lt; VALID &gt; PRIESTLY SHARE. &lt;THE FIVE ARE &gt; THE DEAF, THE INSANE, THE MINOR, ONE WHO SEPARATES OUT A PRIESTLY SHARE WHICH IS NOT HIS OWN, AND A FOREIGNER WHO SEPARATES OUT A PRIESTLY SHARE FROM WHAT BELONGS TO ISRAEL. [EVEN IF IT IS WITH PERMISSION], HIS PRIESTLY SHARE IS NOT A &lt; VALID &gt; PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Now all of them are derived from this verse (i.e., Exod. 25:2): <small>&lt;SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE; YOU SHALL TAKE MY PRIESTLY OFFERING FROM EVERY PERSON WHOSE HEART MOVES HIM</small>.&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yTer</i>. 1:1 (40a).</i> <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>: A deaf person is exempt because he does not hear. <small>WHOSE HEART MOVES HIM</small>: An insane person is exempt because his heart is not being moved. <small>FROM EVERY PERSON</small>: The minor is exempt because he is not a &lt;grown&gt;person (<i>ish</i>). Also one who separates out what is not his, as stated (ibid.): <small>FROM EVERY PERSON</small>, i.e., from what belongs to them. Also the foreigner who separates out a priestly share of what belongs to Israel, even with permission, as stated (ibid.): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, is exempt because he is not from Israel.

Siman 3

(Exod. 25:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &lt;AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>&gt;. It is not written here: "And let them take a priestly share," but <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME</small> (<i>li</i>) <small>A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Anything about which <i>li</i> ("to me" or "for me") is used, &lt;belongs to the Holy One&gt; in this world and in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 2:2; <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:16 (92); cf. Numb. R. 15:17; cf. below, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 8:9.</i> (Lev. 25:23:) <small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY, FOR</small> [<small>THE LAND]</small> <small>BELONGS TO ME</small> (<i>li</i>), in this world and in the world to come. [(Numb. 8:17:) <small>FOR EVERY FIRST-BORN AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BELONGS TO ME</small> (<i>li</i>), in this world and in the world to come. (Numb. 8:14:) <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BELONG TO ME</small> (<i>li</i>), in this world and in the world to come.] So also the priestly share &lt;belongs to the Holy One&gt; in this world and in the world to come.
Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME</small> (<i>li</i>) <small>A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Every offering concerning which <i>li</i> ("to me") is used contains a blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:4.</i> The priestly share contains a blessing. R. Johanan said: Israel brought everything for working on the Tabernacle on two mornings.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Below, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 11:2; Numb. 2:29; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 11:5; Numb. 2:27; Deut. 4:5; Exod. R. 41:2; 51:2; Numb. R. 2:10; 12:16; M. Pss. 101:4.</i> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 36:3): <small>AND THEY STILL BROUGHT FREEWILL OFFERINGS UNTO HIM IN THE MORNING, IN THE MORNING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So in literal translation, which conveys R. Johanan’s understanding of the verse. A more usual translation would read: <small>AND THEY STILL BROUGHT FREEWILL OFFERINGS UNTO HIM EVERY MORNING</small>.</i> So a blessing was given in the priestly share of the Tabernacle. (Exod. 25:2) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.] The Holy One said to them: I am not bothering with &lt;any&gt; other people except you. What is written (in Hab. 2:4)? <small>LO, HIS INNER SOUL IS ARROGANT, NOT UPRIGHT; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITHFULNESS. LO, &lt;HIS INNER SOUL&gt; IS ARROGANT</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar. How? The Holy One had made him king over all the world but he was unhappy with his lot. (Ibid.:) <small>HIS INNER SOUL IS &lt;…&gt; NOT UPRIGHT</small>. Then he looked at himself and felt ashamed;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 13:8, according to which Nebuchadnezzar was a dwarf. Similarly <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:4, which finds a clue to his smallness in his name.</i> but he said: I am king. Thus it says: <small>HIS INNER SOUL IS &lt;…&gt; NOT UPRIGHT</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITHFULNESS</small> (rt.: '<small>MN</small>). In the world to come the Holy One will judge the children of Adam, each and every one along with the children of his handiwork (rt.: '<small>MN</small>); <small>BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE</small> with fidelity (rt.: '<small>MN</small>). The Holy One said to them: Each and every one {is from} [lives off] his handiwork (rt.: '<small>MN</small>). Now I have redeemed you from Egypt, but you are not setting aside for me a priestly share. (Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>….

Siman 4

(Exod. 25:3–7:) <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE THAT YOU SHALL TAKE FROM THEM</small>: <small>&lt;GOLD, SILVER, AND BRONZE; &gt; BLUE, PURPLE, &lt;AND SCARLET YARNS; FINE LINEN, GOAT HAIR, REDDENED&gt; RAM SKINS, DOLPHIN SKINS, AND ACACIA WOOD;&gt; OIL FOR LIGHTING, &lt;SPICE FOR ANOINTING OIL AND FOR AROMATIC INCENSE, ONYX STONES</small>&gt;…. R. Judah bar Simon said: &lt;The Holy One said to Israel:&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This necessary addition to the text comes from the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:5.</i> Do not think that you are repaying me thirteen things<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably the thirteen types of offerings mentioned in Exod. 25:1–7; but these verses mention more than thirteen.</i> which correspond to thirteen things which I set aside for you in Egypt. These were the following (according to Ezek. 16:10–12, 19): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERY, SHOD YOU WITH DOLPHIN SKIN, WRAPPED YOU IN FINE LINEN, COVERED YOU WITH SILK, ADORNED YOU WITH JEWELS, PUT BRACELETS ON YOUR ARMS, AND A CHAIN AROUND YOUR NECK; I PUT A RING ON YOUR NOSE, EARRINGS ON YOUR EARS, AND A SPLENDID CROWN UPON YOUR HEAD…. AND MY BREAD WHICH I GAVE YOU, &lt; BREAD &gt; OF FINE FLOUR, OIL, AND HONEY, &lt;THIS BREAD&gt; I GAVE YOU TO EAT</small>. Ergo, the thirteen things which you have set aside for me correspond to (but do not repay) the thirteen things which I set aside for you in Egypt. In the age to come I am repaying you these corresponding thirteen things, those which are mentioned (in Is. 4:5–6): <small>FOR THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE</small> [<small>WHOLE]</small> <small>SITE OF MOUNT ZION &lt;AND OVER ITS ASSEMBLY A CLOUD AND SMOKE BY DAY AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT</small> &gt;…. <small>AND THERE SHALL BE A SUKKAH AS A SHADE FROM THE HEAT BY DAY</small>….

Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:3, 5:) <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE,…, SKINS OF TEHASHIM</small> (i.e., <small>DOLPHINS</small>),…. R. Judah and R.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:3): <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE</small>…: [<small>GOLD, SILVER, AND BRONZE]</small>. <small>GOLD</small> corresponds to the kingdom of Babylon, concerning which is written (in Dan. 2:38): <small>YOU</small> (Nebuchadnezzar) <small>ARE THE HEAD OF GOLD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:7; cf.

It is simply that, when Nebuchadnezzar saw the dream, Daniel came and interpreted it for him. He said to him (in Dan. 2:38): <small>YOU</small> (Nebuchadnezzar) <small>ARE THE HEAD OF GOLD</small>.

Another interpretation: Why was it likened to iron and clay? Just as iron is hard, so is this wicked kingdom hard. And why is it like clay? Because the Holy One is going to break it like clay, as stated (in Is. 30:14): <small>HE SHALL BREAK IT AS A POTTER'S VESSEL IS BROKEN</small>….

Our masters have said of the generation of Malachi: He rebuked them, and they answered him. He said to them (ibid.): <small>WOULD ANYONE ROB</small> (<i><small>QB</small></i>') <small>GOD</small>? R.

And you say (ibid.): <small>HOW HAVE YOU LOVED US</small>? By universal custom, when someone has two sons, one first-born and one younger, who receives the most? The first-born. Esau came out &lt; of the womb&gt; first, as stated (in Gen. 25:25): <small>THE FIRST</small> (i.e., Esau) <small>CAME FORTH RUDDY</small>. It was proper for him to receive two shares, but I did not act in this way. Instead Jacob received two shares, this world and the world to come.

Thus it is stated (in Gen. 33:14): <small>PLEASE LET MY LORD GO AWAY</small>…, <small>UNTIL I COME TO MY LORD IN SEIR</small>. R. Jacob said: I went through all the Scripture &lt;to see&gt; whether Jacob did or did not go to Seir, and I found no &lt; indication that he did so&gt;. Then when is he going &lt;there&gt;? In the Age to come, as stated (in Obad., vs. 21): <small>FOR SAVIORS SHALL GO UP ON MOUNT ZION &lt;TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU</small>,&gt;…. Therefore (in Mal. 1:2): <small>YET I HAVE LOVED JACOB</small>. Jacob is a partner with Esau in this world; {I &lt;am a&gt; } [but Esau is no] partner with Jacob in the world to come.

Joshua ben Levi said: If the peoples of the world had known how good the Tabernacle was for them,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 1:11; Numb. R. 1:3.</i> they would have surrounded it with encampments and fortifications.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>castra</i>.</i> Why? Before the Tabernacle was erected, the divine word went forth and entered into the midst of the tents belonging to the peoples of the world. Then they were seized with panic, since it is stated (in Deut. 5:23 [26]): <small>FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH THAT HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED</small>? You heard it and are alive, but the peoples of the world heard it and were seized with panic in the midst of their tents. And you should not only say &lt; this &gt; about the Tabernacle, but even the Temple was good for them. Where is it shown? That is what Solomon ordained in his prayer (in I Kings 8:41, 43 // II Chron. 6:32, 33): <small>AND LIKEWISE, &lt;WHEN&gt; THE FOREIGNER, WHO IS NOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, &lt;COMES FROM A FAR COUNTRY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR NAME&gt;…, MAY YOU HEARKEN UNTO &lt;HIM IN YOUR&gt; HEAVENLY &lt;ABODE</small>&gt;….<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh</i>.

Yet in the case of the foreigner, whether they do or do not do &lt;what is right &gt;, give him whatever he asks, (according to vs. 43, cont.) <small>SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH</small> [<small>MAY KNOW]</small> <small>&lt;YOUR NAME</small>&gt;…. Therefore, the Temple was good for the peoples of the world. [R. Samuel bar Nahman said: Before the Temple was built, the world rested upon a throne<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>thronos</i>.</i> of two legs; but since the Temple has been built, the world is firmly established<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>BSS</i>; cf.

Even the Tabernacle was good for the peoples of the world.] Therefore the Holy One said to Moses: Make me a tabernacle (rt.: <small><i>Sh</i>KN</small>), because I desire to dwell (rt.: <small><i>Sh</i>KN</small>) with my children. When the ministering angels heard that, they said to him: Sovereign of the World, why are you leaving heavenly beings and descending to earthly beings? Your glory is that you &lt;dwell&gt; in the heavens, <small>YOU WHO</small> (according to Ps. 8:2 [1]) <small>HAVE SET YOUR MAJESTY OVER THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One said to them: By your lives, I am doing just as you said. Habakkuk said (in Hab. 3:3): <small>GOD IS COMING FROM TEMAN</small>. Then afterwards (in the same verse): <small>AND THE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS PRAISE</small>. The Holy One said to them: Now how are you surprised over this? Look at how I cherish the earthly beings, so as to descend and dwell under tent sheets of goats' hair. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 26:7): <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF GOATS</small>' <small>HAIR</small>.

R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:5; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:6, 9; <i>PR</i> 33:10; cf. <i>Shab</i>. 28a; <i>yShab</i>. 2:1 (4d); Eccl.

You yourself know that it is written (in Exod. 26:7–8): <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF &lt;GOATS</small>' <small>HAIR FOR A TENT OVER THE TABERNACLE</small>&gt;…. <small>THE LENGTH OF EACH TENT SHEET SHALL BE THIRTY CUBITS</small>….. Who brings you tent sheets of thirty &lt;cubits&gt;? Hence you learn according to the words of R. Nehemiah that it was a miracle. [And you should not only say so concerning the tent sheeting, but there was even a miracle concerning the boards.] Where did the boards come from?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen.

When he tells you to make a tabernacle, the cedars will be available in your hands. Immediately they did as their father told them. They arose and planted cedars.
Our masters have said (concerning Exod. 26:28): <small>THE CENTER BAR &lt; THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARDS</small> &gt; came down to Egypt at the hands of Jacob, the one which served &lt;as a bolt&gt; <small>FROM END TO END</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">On the miraculous bending of the bar around three sides of the Tabernacle, see Rashi and the <i>Tosafot</i> on <i>Shab</i>. 94b.</i> It did not do so without the cedars uttering<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">So also <i>Yalqut Shim’oni</i>, Exod. 369–370.

R.

Simply in order to heal what Israel did in Shittim (Numb. 25:1–9). Another interpretation (of Exod. 26:15): <small>ACACIA</small> (<i>shittim</i>) <small>WOOD</small>. They sinned in Shittim, and they were stricken in Shittim. They sinned in Shittim (according to Numb. 25:1): <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM, &lt;THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB</small>&gt;. And they were stricken in shittim (according to Numb. 25:9): <small>AND THOSE WHO DIED FROM THE PLAGUE WERE &lt;TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND</small> &gt;. Moreover, they did not move from there until they were healed. Phinehas arose and turned back the wrath from them, as stated (in vs. 11): <small>PHINEHAS BEN ELEAZAR &lt;BEN AARON THE PRIEST HAS TURNED AROUND MY WRATH FROM UPON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> &gt;…. The Holy One said: In the world to come I will heal the shittim, as stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE, THE HILLS SHALL RUN WITH MILK, AND</small> [<small>ALL]</small> <small>THE WATERCOURSES OF JUDAH SHALL RUN WITH WATER.

(Exod. 27:20:) <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>…. This text is related (to Cant. 1:15): <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED</small>…. R. Aqiva said: All of the whole world and its fullness was not as worthy as the day on which the Torah of Song of Songs was given to Israel; for while all of the writings are holy, the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yad</i>. 3:5; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 8:1; Cant. R. 1:1:11.</i> R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who took a <i>se'ah</i> of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him: Take from it so much fine flour, so much crushed grain, so much bran. Similarly all the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi said: See how the Holy One praises the assembly of Israel in it (i.e., in Cant. 1:15). <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED. AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in works.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Cant. R. 1:15:1.</i> <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the work of your ancestors. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the house. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the field. In the house (according to Deut. 6:9): <small>UPON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE</small>. In the field through priestly shares, tithes, gleaning the forgotten sheaf (of Deut. 24:19), and through the <i>pe'ah</i> (of Lev. 19:9). (Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> on the roof (according to Deut. 22:8): <small>YOU SHALL MAKE A PARAPET FOR YOUR ROOF</small>. (Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in this world. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the world to come.
(Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED</small>. R. Simon ben Pazzi said: She praises him in a simple expression, and he praises her with a double expression. Why does he praise her with a double expression?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Cant. 1:15, where the man addresses the woman, <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small>, is written twice, while in vs. 16, where the woman addresses the man, <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> appears only once.</i> Because if she does not do his will, he can exchange her for another. But she praises him in simple language because she cannot exchange him for another. (Cant. 1:16:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY DEAR, LOVELY INDEED</small>. Therefore (in Cant. 1:15): <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED; AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>. These (eyes) are the Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synedrion</i>.</i> Just as the whole body follows the eyes, so Israel follows the Sanhedrin. Whatever they (of the Sanhedrin) declare unclean is unclean; &lt; whatever they declare &gt; clean is clean. (Ibid.:) <small>WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>.

Gk.: <i>phrixis</i> (“tremor”) or <i>phrixos</i> (“bristling”).</i> but the dove does not do so. Instead it stretches out its neck.

In the case of a woman, when the hair of her head grows, she puts the hair behind it (i.e., the veil); and it is becoming to her. So in the case of Israel, when their Sanhedrin sat in the chamber of hewn stones, it was confined behind your veil.
Another interpretation (of Cant. 1:15): <small>WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>. R.

(Exod. 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF</small> [<small>BEATEN</small>] <small>OLIVES</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 27:20): <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND &lt;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF BEATEN OLIVES FOR THE LIGHT</small> &gt;…, not because I need light but in order to give you light.

Abbin the Levite said: {You desire that whoever wants} [You find that whoever desires] to make windows for himself, makes them wider on the inside and narrower on the outside. Why?

Hiyya bar Abba said: Even the establishment of an altar was done only for the atonement of Israel. Why was it named an altar (<small>MZBH</small>)? M, because it pardons (<i>mohel</i>) the sins of Israel; Z, because it is a good memorial (<i>zikkaron</i>) for Israel; B, because it is a blessing (<i>berekhah</i>) for Israel; &lt;and&gt; H, because it is life (<i>hayyim</i>) for Israel. The unleavened bread and the shewbread blessed the bread, and the first fruits blessed the fruit of the tree. &lt;There is&gt; a story about R. Johanan ben Eleazar, who dwelt under a fig tree; and the fig tree was full of beautiful figs. A dew came down and the figs absorbed honey. The wind kneaded them with the dust.

Because the offerings were brought &lt;to the altar&gt;. &lt;There is&gt; a story about a certain scribe, who went up to Jerusalem each and every year.

So I sell them at a very dear price, but all this gain is &lt;attributable&gt; to Jerusalem, on account of the libation of wine which they offer. When they abrogated it, all these good things were withheld. So you find that, when Israel was exiled to Babylon, Ezra said to them: Go up to the land of Israel. But they were unwilling.

(Exod. 30:12:) <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS</small> (<i>rosh</i>) <small>OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>…. This text is related (to Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL. LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. &lt;The verse&gt; is speaking of Israel's Sanhedrin, since it was located in the center of the Temple in the Chamber of Hewn Stones, which resembles a navel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 9:2; <i>PR</i> 10:2; Numb. R. 1:4; below, Tanh. (Buber), Numb. 1:4 and Deut. 1:3 with the notes there; Ocf. <i>Sanh</i>. 37a; Exod. R. 39:1; below, Numb. 1:4; also Deut. 1:3.</i> As the navel is located in the middle of the body, so was the Sanhedrin located in the middle of the Temple.
Another interpretation of <small>NAVEL</small>. As in the case of the navel, all the time that the infant is located in its mother's abdomen, the navel &lt; coming &gt; from it is a life&lt;line&gt;; so Israel draws its life from the Sanhedrin. Therefore, there is a resemblance between the Sanhedrin and a navel. What is the meaning of <small>ROUND BOWL</small> (literally: <small>BOWL OF ROUNDNESS</small> [<i>sahar</i>])? <i>A patera</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word denotes a merchant’s dish in which the various coins were arranged.</i> used in business.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia</i>.</i> {The <small>ROUNDNESS</small> (<i>sahar</i>) is like the merchant (<i>soher</i>).} Whatever is needed comes out of it (i.e., round bowl). Now this expression (<small>ROUND BOWL</small>, i.e., <i>aggan ha-sahar</i>) can only be a word for <i>patera</i>, as stated (in Exod. 24:6): <small>AND MOSES TOOK HALF THE BLOOD AND PUT IT IN BOWLS</small> (<i>agganot</i>). Another interpretation (of Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL</small>. Abbin bar Bar Hisda said: What is the meaning of <small>ROUND BOWL</small> (<i>aggan ha-sahar)?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. R. 7:3:1.</i> It is like the half moon, since they call the moon roundness (<i>sihra</i> in Aramaic).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Aramaic word actually means “moonlight.”</i> &lt;Ergo:&gt; <small>ROUND BOWL</small>, &lt;i.e. the moon&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aggan ha-sahar</i> actually denotes a full moon, but once the concept of the moon is introduced, it is easy to visualize the moon in any phase.</i> Our masters have said (in <i>Sanh</i> 4:3): <small>THE SANHEDRIN WAS &lt;ARRANGED&gt; LIKE HALF OF A ROUND THRESHING FLOOR</small>. (Cant. 7:3 [2], cont.:) <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>, since there is never less than one-third of them. In the case of mixed wine, whoever mixes it properly mixes a third of a cup of wine with two parts water. So the Sanhedrin would sit from the &lt;time of &gt; the morning sacrifice until the sacrifice at twilight, so that none of them was free for &lt;heeding nature's&gt; necessities. Then what did they do when one of them wanted to leave? He would count. If there were twenty-three, he would leave; but if not, he would not leave. Thus it is written (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>; and there was never less than one third of them. Ergo (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>.

Ergo (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY</small> (i.e., Leviticus) <small>IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small> (i.e.., sin offerings). Resh Laqish said: Why is it likened to wheat? It is simply that just as all of these wheat grains are reckoned by measure, so all of Israel was reckoned by number (<i>minyan</i>). The elders, the saints, the sages, and all Israel are reckoned by number (<i>minyan</i>).
(Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>.

Still (according to Ps. 3:4 [3]) <small>&lt;YOU, O LORD, ARE&gt; A SHIELD ABOUT ME</small>.

Another interpretation: David spoke with respect to the event of the &lt;golden&gt; calf. The world said: This is the people who heard from the mouth of its God (in Exod. 20:3): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO &lt;OTHER GODS BESIDE ME&gt;</small>.

SELAH</small>. &lt;The word&gt; <small>MANY</small> (in Ps. 3:3 [2]) can only mean the peoples of the world, since it is stated (in Is. 17:12): <small>HERE IS THE ROAR OF MANY PEOPLES</small>. Israel had promised (to have no other gods) and you agreed with them; so you said to Moses our Teacher (in Deut. 9:14): <small>LET ME ALONE, AND I WILL DESTROY THEM</small>.

(Ps. 3:4 [3]): <small>THE ONE WHO RAISES UP MY HEAD</small>. Instead of that which we owed you, &lt;namely&gt; the lifting off of our head, you gave us an uplifted head at the hands of Moses our Teacher, [to whom you said] (in Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF</small> (literally: <small>LIFT UP THE HEAD OF</small>) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>….&gt;

(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE &lt;A CENSUS</small>&gt;. R. Joshua bar Nahmani the Priest said: The Holy One said to Moses: Go and number Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 2:8; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 9:1.</i> Moses said to the Holy One: It is written (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>…; (and in Hos. 2:1 [1:10]): <small>THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA</small>…. So are you saying: Go and number Israel! Moses said to the Holy One: I am unable to hold out in counting them. The Holy One said to him: Moses, it is not as you think. However, if you wish to hold out in counting Israel, take the initial letters of the tribes. Then you shall hold out in counting them. &lt;Take&gt; the <i>resh</i> from Reuben, the shin from Simeon, the <i>lamed</i> from Levi, etc., for each and every tribe. To what is the matter comparable? To a money-changer who had a boy. He said to him: Count these coins for me. He said to him: How can I count them? He said to him: count the tops of the stacks of coins, and you will hold out in the calculation. So when Moses met with difficulties in the calculation of Israel, the Holy One said to him: Take the initial letters of the tribes, and you shall hold out in their calculation. The <i>resh</i> of Reuben equals two hundred thousand;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following numbers comprise numerical equivalents of the initial Hebrew letters times one thousand.</i> the <i>nun</i> of Naphtali equals fifty thousand; the shin of Simeon equals three hundred thousand; the <i>yod</i> of Judah &lt;plus&gt; the <i>yod</i> of Joseph &lt;plus&gt; the <i>yod</i> of Issachar equal thirty thousand; the <i>zayin</i> of Zebulun equals seven thousand; the <i>dalet</i> of Dan equals four thousand; the <i>gimel</i> of Gad equals three thousand; the <i>bet</i> of Benjamin equals two thousand; the <i>alef</i> of Asher equals one thousand. The result is five hundred ninety-seven thousand. Where are the three thousand (from the original six hundred thousand of Exod. 12:37)? These were the ones who fell in the days of the &lt;golden&gt; calf, as stated (in Exod. 32:28): <small>SO THE CHILDREN OF LEVI ACTED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES, AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND OF THE PEOPLE FELL ON THAT DAY</small>. For that reason the Holy One said to Moses: Number Israel in order to know how many are missing.

(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS &lt;…, EACH SHALL GIVE A RANSOM FOR HIS LIFE…,&gt; SO THAT NO PLAGUE COME UPON THEM</small>. When Moses heard this, he was afraid, and said (as Job. 2:4): <small>SKIN FOR SKIN</small>! <small>ALL THAT ONE HAS HE WILL GIVE FOR HIS LIFE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 9:11; cf. below, Numb. 2:19.</i> R.

It is so stated (in I Kings 20:39): <small>IT WILL BE YOUR LIFE FOR HIS LIFE OR YOU WILL PAY A TALENT</small> [<small>OF SILVER</small>]. R. Johanan said: From whom did he learn &lt;about the ransom &gt;? From the one who commits libel. Thus it is stated (concerning the man who commits libel against his virgin bride in Deut. 22:19): <small>AND THEY SHALL FINE HIM A HUNDRED &lt;SHEKELS OF&gt; SILVER</small>. Now we have committed libel against the Holy One<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PR</i> 10:12.</i> and said (of the golden calf in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. &lt;Therefore,&gt; each and every one of us must give a hundred &lt;shekels&gt; of silver. Resh Laqish said: Moses learned &lt;about the ransom&gt; from &lt;the law concerning &gt; the rapist. It is written (concerning the rapist in Deut. 22:29): <small>THE MAN WHO LAY WITH HER SHALL GIVE</small> [<small>TO THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FATHER FIFTY &lt;SHEKELS OF&gt; SILVER</small>]. Now we have raped the &lt;divine&gt; word. Thus it is written (in Exod. 20:3): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO</small> [<small>OTHER GODS</small>] <small>&lt;BESIDES ME</small>&gt;; and we have committed idolatry. &lt;Therefore,&gt; each and every one of us must give fifty &lt; shekels of&gt; silver. R. Judah bar Simon said: Moses learned from &lt;the law concerning&gt; a goring bull, since it is stated (in Exod. 21:32): <small>IF A BULL GORES A MALE</small> [<small>OR FEMALE</small>] <small>SLAVE</small>, [<small>HE SHALL GIVE THIRTY SHEKELS OF SILVER TO THE MASTER</small>]. Now we have exchanged his glory for a bull. It is so stated (in Ps. 106:20): <small>THUS THEY EXCHANGED THEIR GLORY FOR THE IMAGE OF A BULL</small>. Does every one of us have to give thirty shekels? The Holy One knew what was in Moses' heart. He said to him: By your life, &lt;the ransom will be&gt; not a talent of silver, not a hundred &lt; shekels of&gt; silver, not fifty shekels of silver, and not thirty shekels, but (as in Exod. 30:13): <small>&lt;EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED IN THE RECORDS &gt; SHALL GIVE THIS: &lt;A HALF SHEKEL &gt;</small>.

(Exod. 33:12:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: SEE, YOU &lt;SAY UNTO ME: BRING THIS PEOPLE UP</small>&gt;…. it is written (in Ps. 77:6 [5]): <small>I HAVE CONSIDERED THE DAYS OF OLD</small>.

"Anyone who sought Moses" is not written here, but <small>ANYONE WHO SOUGHT THE LORD</small>. This &lt; wording &gt; teaches that everyone who welcomes an elder fulfills Torah. &lt;It is&gt; as though he is welcoming the Divine Presence.

(Exod. 33:20:) <small>HE ALSO SAID: YOU CANNOT SEE MY FACE</small>. Moses wanted to understand about the reward for &lt; keeping the&gt; commandments and about the prosperity of the wicked.

After Moses had learned it, the Holy One said to him: Go and teach it to my children. Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, write it down for your children. He said to him: I want to give it to them in writing, because it has been revealed to me that the peoples of the world are going to have dominion over them and take it away from them, so that my children would be like the peoples of the world. Then give them the Scripture in writing but the Mishnah, the Aggadah, and the Talmud orally. (Exod. 34:27): <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WRITE DOWN &lt; THESE WORDS</small> &gt;.

R. 7:1:4.</i> To two ships which were at sea full of merchandise. One was coming and the other was going. The one which was coming they praised. &lt;Those who&gt; stood by them were amazed. They said: Why are you praising this one when you do not praise the other one. They said to them: We praise this one which came back, because we know that it went away safely and came back safely; but as for the other one, we do not know what it is going to do. Likewise, when someone is born, no child of Adam knows about his &lt;future&gt; deeds. When he has departed from the world they do know what his deeds were. Ergo: <small>AND THE DAY OF DEATH THAN THE DAY OF ONE'S BIRTH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>. The Names of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were &lt;better&gt; than the good oil with which Nadab and Abihu were anointed.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. 29:41.</i> Why?

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME &lt;IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>&gt;. The name of Bezalel was better <small>THAN GOOD OIL</small>. Why? Because the scriptural verse has proclaimed<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRSM</i>. Cf. the Greek word <i>parresia</i>, which means “boldness of speech.”</i> it, where it is stated (in Exod. 35:30); <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL: SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &lt;…&gt; BY NAME</small>

[(Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &lt;…&gt; BY NAME.</small>] This text is related (to Is. 40:25–26): <small>THEN UNTO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME THAT I SHOULD BE EQUAL? SAYS THE HOLY ONE. LIFT UP YOUR EYES ON HIGH &lt;AND SEE: WHO CREATED THESE</small>? &gt;…. The Holy One said: <small>THEN UNTO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME</small>?

(Is. 40:26:) <small>WHO CREATED THESE</small>? [<small>THE ONE WHO SENDS FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER. HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &lt;A SINGLE&gt; NAME</small>.] It is written (ibid.): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &lt;A SINGLE &gt; NAME</small>. But one scriptural verse says, <small>NAMES</small> (i.e., Ps. 147:4): [<small>HE GIVES NAMES TO THEM ALL</small>]. If &lt;Ps. 147:4 says&gt; <small>NAMES</small>, why &lt;does Is. 40:26 say&gt; <small>BY &lt;A SINGLE&gt; NAME</small>? If &lt;Is. 40:26 says&gt; <small>BY &lt;A SINGLE&gt; NAME</small>, why &lt;does Ps. 147:4 say&gt; <small>NAMES</small>? It is simply that, when the Holy One wishes, he calls them all as a single &lt;unit&gt;; but when he wishes &lt;otherwise&gt;, he calls each and every one by his own name, &lt;e.g.&gt; Michael and Gabriel. Ergo (in Is. 40:26): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &lt;A SINGLE&gt; NAME</small>.
Another interpretation (of Is. 40:26): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY NAME</small>. So it is for above. Where is it shown for below? Where it is stated (in Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED &lt;BEZALEL…&gt; BY NAME</small>.

(Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED</small> [<small>BEZALEL BEN URI BEN HUR</small>] <small>&lt;OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH&gt; BY NAME</small>.

And &lt; Scripture &gt; does not speak about Bezalel alone, but about any who were engaged in the work of the tabernacle. In them the Holy One instilled understanding, wisdom and knowledge. It is so stated (in Exod. 36:8): <small>THEN ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES &lt; AMONG THE WORKERS MADE THE TABERNACLE</small> &gt;…. But out of all of them none was proclaimed &lt;by name&gt; except Bezalel. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &lt;…&gt; BY NAME</small>.

Now from where did all this glory come?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 10:4; Exod.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE ESTABLISHED IT AND ALSO PROBED IT</small>. That was the second &lt;time&gt;. Then after that he said (in vs. 28): <small>AND HE SAID TO THE MAN</small> (Moses). But R.

Siman 6

Another interpretation (of Exod. 35:30): <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED</small> [… <small>IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>]. See the wisdom, [understanding, and knowledge] which I have instilled in his heart (i.e., the heart of Bezalel).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">So according to the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 10:5.</i> By these three things were heaven and earth created,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Exod.

Moreover, by these three things was the Tabernacle made, as stated (in Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>. Again, by these three things was the Temple made, as stated (in I Kings 7:14): <small>HE</small> (i.e., Hiram) <small>WAS THE SON OF A WIDOW…; AND HE WAS FILLED WITH WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM &lt;WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE &gt;</small>.

Now all this was by virtue of the blessing with which Moses blessed this tribe, as stated (in Deut. 33:7): <small>AND THIS IS FOR JUDAH</small>, [<small>AND HE SAID: HEAR, O LORD, THE VOICE OF JUDAH</small>….] The Holy One said to Israel: in this world my Spirit shall instill wisdom within you, but in the world to come I &lt;myself&gt; will teach you, as stated (in Ezek. 37:14): <small>I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Prov. 9:9): <small>GIVE TO ONE WHO IS WISE</small>…. This is Bezalel. When Moses said to Bezalel: Make a Tabernacle, Bezalel said: What is the Tabernacle for? He said to him: To have the Divine Presence dwell within it and teach Israel Torah. Bezalel said: And where will the Torah be put? He said to him: When we make a Tabernacle, we shall make an Ark.

Ergo (in Jer. 30:17): <small>AND I WILL HEAL YOU OF YOUR WOUNDS</small>. Also, when Israel sinned at Shittim, the Holy One said to them: By your life, through that in which you sinned, you shall be healed.

They said: &lt;It comes &gt; from the blood of the Day of Atonement (rt.: <small>KPR</small>), when the High Priest came in and sprinkled it. Why is it named a Mercy Seat (rt.: <small>KPR</small>)? Because he atoned (rt.: <small>KPR</small>) &lt; there &gt; for the sins of Israel. Then after that he made the table on which the shewbread lay.

Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:20): <small>A FAITHFUL PERSON WILL RECEIVE MANY BLESSINGS</small>. This was Moses.

Similarly the Holy One loved Israel, brought them to Mount Sinai, gave them the Torah, and called them kings (in Exod. 19:6). At the end of forty days they made the calf and said (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. In that hour the peoples of the world said: The Holy One will never again be reconciled to them.

(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES &lt;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>&gt;…. This text is related (to Ps. 103:20): <small>BLESS THE LORD, O HIS MESSENGERS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mal’akhaw</i>. Throughout this section of the midrash <i>mal’akh</i>(<i>im</i>) is interpreted as referring to humans; therefore “messenger(s)” is a more appropriate translation here than the more usual “angel(s).”</i> <small>OF HIS, MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:1; Lev. R. 1:1.</i> These are the prophets, since they are called messengers where it is stated (in Numb. 20:16): <small>AND HE SENT A MESSENGER</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>WHO BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Numb</i>. R. 16:1; see also Gen. R. 68:12, according to which the angels on Jacob’s ladder symbolized Moses ascending and descending Sinai.</i> So also (in II Chron. 36:16): <small>BUT THEY MOCKED THE MESSENGERS</small> (<i>mal'akhim</i>) <small>OF GOD, &lt;DISDAINED HIS WORDS, AND TAUNTED HIS PROPHETS</small>,&gt;…. R. Huna said in the name of R. Aha: These &lt;messengers&gt; are Israel, since it says (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD, HEARKENING TO THE VOICE OF HIS WORD</small>, in &lt;reference to the fact&gt; that they &lt;were the ones who&gt; had put fulfilling ahead of hearkening.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In Exod. 24:7, where Israel promises: <small>WE WILL FULFILL AND WE WILL HEARKEN</small>, in that order.</i> R. Isaac the Smith said: These are those who observe the Sabbatical year. So why were they called <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small>? When &lt;such a one&gt; sees his field abandoned, his trees abandoned, his fences breached, and sees his fruit trees eaten, he suppresses his drive (like one mighty in strength) and does not speak. Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Avot</i> 4:1): <small>AND WHO IS MIGHTY? ONE WHO SUBDUES HIS DRIVE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Also <i>Tamid</i> 32a.</i>
R. Tanhum ben Hanila'i says: (Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small>. This is Moses because no one is as <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small> as Moses. When Israel stood before Mount Sinai, they were not capable of hearing the divinely spoken word, as stated (in Deut. 5:22 [25]): <small>IF WE CONTINUE HEARING THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD ANY LONGER, WE SHALL DIE</small>. But Moses was not harmed, &lt;an exception made &gt; in order to teach you that the great ones are more righteous than the ministering angels, since the ministering angels are not able to hear his voice. Rather they stand with excitement and dismay, while the righteous are able to hear his voice. It is so stated (in Joel 2:11): <small>THE LORD SHOUTS ALOUD BEFORE HIS ARMY, FOR HIS HOST IS VERY GREAT</small>, {<small>IF MIGHT &lt;COMES TO&gt; THE ONES WHO FULFILL</small>} [<small>FOR MIGHTY IS THE ONE WHO FULFILLS</small>] <small>HIS WORD. HIS HOST</small> denotes angels, since it is stated (re angels in Gen. 32:3 [2]): <small>THIS IS GOD'S HOST</small>. And so it says (in Dan. 7:10): <small>THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS MINISTERED TO HIM</small>. And who among them are the strongest? The righteous, of whom it is stated (in Joel 2:11): {<small>IF MIGHT &lt;COMES TO&gt; THE ONES WHO FULFILL</small>} [<small>FOR MIGHTY IS THE ONE WHO FULFILLS</small>] <small>HIS WORD</small>, i.e., a righteous person who does his bidding. And who is this? This is Moses, to whom the [Holy One] said: Make a tabernacle. So he was hurried and made it. Then he stood alone outside, because he was afraid to enter the Tent of Meeting, as stated (in Exod. 40:35, 38): <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING</small>…. <small>FOR THE CLOUD OF THE LORD RESTED UPON THE TABERNACLE</small>…. The Holy One said: It is not right for Moses, since he fretted over the Tabernacle, to stand outside while I stand inside; so look, I am calling upon him to enter. It is therefore written (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. Look at the mighty strength of the righteous, in that they are able to hear his voice! So also it is written concerning Samuel (in I Sam. 3:10): <small>THEN THE LORD CAME, AND STOOD THERE, AND HE CALLED AS AT OTHER TIMES: SAMUEL, SAMUEL</small>. [<small>SO SAMUEL SAID: SPEAK, FOR YOUR SERVANT IS LISTENING</small>.] Therefore David has said (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD, HEARKENING TO THE VOICE OF HIS WORD</small>. Now if you say that, when he spoke with Moses, he spoke in a low voice, &lt;and&gt; for that reason he was able to hear, he only spoke in the voice &lt;used in&gt; the giving of Torah. &lt;That was&gt; when they heard his voice and were dying at the first utterance. It is so stated (in Deut. 5:22 [25]): <small>IF WE CONTINUE &lt;HEARING THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD ANY LONGER, WE SHALL DIE</small>&gt;. And so it says (in Cant. 5:6): <small>MY SOUL DEPARTED WHEN HE SPOKE</small>. And where is it shown that he spoke with the voice &lt;used in&gt; the giving of Torah? Where it says so (in Ps. 29:4–5): <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD HAS POWER; THE VOICE OF THE LORD HAS MAJESTY</small>; [<small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS CEDARS</small>]. It also says so (in Numb. 7:89): <small>WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH HIM, HE WOULD HEAR THE VOICE SPEAKING UNTO HIM</small>, the voice which he heard in the giving of Torah. {(Ps. 29:5:) <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS CEDARS</small>.} He also spoke thus for each and every utterance and for each and every saying. Perhaps you will say that Israel heard the voice from outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 1:1, (2: <i>Wayyiqra</i>, pereq 2).</i> The text (of Numb. 7:89) reads: <small>HE WOULD HEAR</small> [<small>THE VOICE</small>]. He heard the voice alone. But since he spoke in a loud voice, why did they not hear? Because the Holy One decreed over the utterance, that it would go forth and come to Moses. So the Holy One made a path for it by which the utterance went forth until it reached Moses, and it was not heard here and there. It is so stated (in Job 28:25): <small>TO FIX A WEIGHT FOR THE WIND</small>. Thus, when each saying went forth from the mouth of the Holy One, [every one had a &lt; fixed &gt; weight]. And so it says (in Job 28:26): <small>AND A WAY FOR THE THUNDER OF VOICES</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash requires this literal translation. A more idiomatic translation would read: <small>A WAY FOR THUNDERSTORMS</small>.</i> in that the Holy One made a way for that voice, because it was going forth to Moses alone. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>. It was heard by him and not by another. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD</small>.

(Lev. <b>1:1:)</b> <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES &lt;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>&gt;.

This benediction has been the subject of much scholarly debate by many interpreters, including myself in “The Gospel of John and the Jews: The Story of a Religious Divorce,” <i>AntiSemitism and the Foundations of Christianity</i>, edited by Alan T. Davies (New York, Paulist, 1979), pp. 84–88, 95–97, and in “The Date of Luke-Acts,” <i>Luke-Acts: New Perspectives from the Society of Biblical literature Seminar</i>, edited by Charles H.

So also &lt;do we treat&gt; whoever does not say &lt;benediction 14&gt;, "Who builds Jerusalem," since they will suspect that he may be a Samaritan. R.

(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 29:23): <small>ONE'S PRIDE WILL BRING HIM LOW, BUT THE LOW IN SPIRIT WILL OBTAIN HONOR</small>. Whenever anyone flees from authority, the authority will pursue him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:3.</i> Saul fled from authority when he came to reign, as stated (in I Sam. 10:22): <small>SO THEY INQUIRED OF THE LORD AGAIN: HAS ANYONE ELSE COME</small> [<small>HERE</small>]? <small>AND THE LORD SAID: HERE HE IS HIDING AMONG THE BAGGAGE</small>. What does it (the word <small>BAGGAGE</small>) mean? When they came and brought him word of his kingship, he told them: I am not worthy of kingship. Rather inquire by means of Urim and Thummim whether I am worthy; and if not, leave me alone. Immediately (ibid.), <small>THEY INQUIRED OF THE LORD AGAIN</small> (i.e., this second time), &lt;and&gt; immediately he hid himself until they had inquired of Urim and Thummim. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: HERE HE IS HIDING AMONG THE BAGGAGE</small> (literally: <small>INSTRUMENTS</small>). Thus have our masters taught: These instruments were Urim and Thummim. This man fled from authority, and it pursued him, as stated (in I Sam. 10:24): <small>DO YOU SEE THE ONE WHOM THE LORD HAS CHOSEN, THAT THERE IS NO ONE LIKE HIM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES</small>? But Abimelech ben Jerubbaal pursued authority, and it fled from him, as stated (in Jud. 9:1–2, 23): <small>BUT ABIMELECH BEN JERUBBAAL WENT TO SHECHEM &lt;UNTO HIS MOTHER'S BROTHERS &gt;…, &lt;SAYING&gt;: PLEASE SPEAK IN THE EARS OF ALL THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM…. THEN</small> {<small>THE LORD</small>} [<small>GOD</small>] <small>SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT BETWEEN ABIMELECH &lt;AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM</small> &gt;….
Moses also fled from authority when the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): {<small>ARISE</small>} [<small>COME</small>], <small>I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>…. (Exod. 14:13): <small>BUT HE SAID: PRAY LORD, PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. R.

Pss. 18:22; cf. Exod. R. 3:14; also <i>PR</i> 7:2.</i> and he was answering him: <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 4:10): <small>THEN MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: &lt;PRAY, LORD,&gt; I HAVE NEVER BEEN A MAN OF WORDS, EITHER IN THE PAST OR NOW THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN UNTO YOUR SERVANT, FOR I AM SLOW OF SPEECH AND SLOW OF TONGUE</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: By your life, in the end you shall go. When he did go, he said: (in Exod. 5:1): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD, THE GOD OF</small> {<small>THE HEBREWS</small>} [<small>ISRAEL</small>]: <small>&lt;LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>&gt;…. That wicked man said (in vs. 2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD, THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb.

(Exod. 8:16 [20]:) <small>RISE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>. &lt;These verses are&gt; to teach you that he fled from authority. In the end he led them forth, divided the sea for them, brought them into the desert, brought down the manna for them, brought up the well for them, brought over the quails for them, and made the Tabernacle. Then he said: From now on what is there for me to do? He got ready and sat down. The Holy One said to him: By your life, now you have a greater work than any that you have done, &lt;i.e.,&gt; to teach my children clean and unclean, to enlighten them on how to offer sacrifice to me, as stated (in Lev. 1:1–2): <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small> &lt;…&gt; [<small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &lt;…&gt;: WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>.] Abimelech pursued authority and it fled from him, in fulfillment of what is stated (in Prov. 29:23): <small>ONE'S PRIDE WILL BRING HIM LOW</small>. (Ibid., cont.: <small>BUT THE LOW IN SPIRIT WILL OBTAIN HONOR</small>. This is Moses, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 8:6 [5]): <small>FOR YOU HAVE MADE HIM A LITTLE LESS THAN DIVINE, AND CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND MAJESTY</small>.

(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 89:20 [19]): <small>THEN YOU SPOKE TO YOUR SAINTS IN A VISION AND SAID: I HAVE CONFERRED HELP UPON ONE WHO IS MIGHTY; I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE</small>. Although the Holy One spoke with the first Adam and commanded him concerning the tree of knowledge, he was alone in the world. So also in the case of Noah, although he spoke with him, he &lt; alone &gt; was upright in his generations. And so it was in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were unique in the world. But in the case of Moses, how many righteous ones [were in the world]? Seventy elders, Bezalel, Uri, Aaron and his sons, and the &lt;tribal&gt; princes. Yet of them all he called only Moses. Ergo, it says (in Ps. 89:20 [19]): <small>I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE</small>. This is Moses, [since it is written] (in Ps. 106:23): &lt;…,&gt; <small>HAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN ONE</small> &lt;…&gt;.

Let our master instruct us:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6.</i> Is it right for one to enter the Temple mount with his staff or his money girdle?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>funda</i> (“moneybag”).</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ber</i>. 9:5): <small>ONE MAY NOT ENTER THE TEMPLE MOUNT WITH HIS STAFF, HIS MONEY GIRDLE, OR WITH DUST ON HIS FEET</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. R. 4:17:1; cf. Mark 11:16; Josephus, <i>Contra Apionem</i>, 8:106; see <i>Ber</i>. 62a.</i> lest he treat it with disrespect, even in its destruction. The Holy One said (in Lev. 26:2): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY: I AM THE LORD</small>. And what was the reason for comparing keeping the Sabbath with the Sanctuary? Thus did R. Hiyya the Great teach: Just as keeping the Sabbath is forever so is reverence for the Sanctuary forever. Now Solomon cried out (in Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>. Solomon was observing how the wicked subverted &lt;justice&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed word is found in the traditional <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6.</i> in the Sanctuary. Solomon said: The place where the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Synedrion</i>.</i> sat to judge criminal law, [civil law,] decisions on scourgings, and decisions on clean and unclean, there they defiled it.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 4:1; Eccl.

(Lam. 5:18:) <small>BECAUSE OF MOUNT ZION, WHICH LIES DESOLATE, THE JACKALS WALK OVER IT</small>. The Holy One said to him: You name those entering, but you do not name those leaving. (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>. (Lam. 2:20:) <small>SHOULD PRIEST AND PROPHET BE SLAIN IN THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD</small>? Here is the blood of Zechariah shed on the stones,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 23:35 // Luke 11:51.</i> as stated (in Ezek. 24:7): <small>FOR HER BLOOD WAS IN HER MIDST; SHE SET IT UPON BARE ROCK</small>.

Siman 9

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>. This is the central gate in which the Great Sanhedrin sat. <small>THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>. (Lam. 2:9:) <small>HER GATES HAVE SUNK INTO THE GROUND</small>. The Holy One said (in Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small> (<i><small>RSh</small></i>'). There was one place for the Righteous One of the World, the Holy Temple, which was set apart for the Divine Presence. Then Manasseh wronged (rt.: <i><small>RSh</small></i>') it, and brought an image into its midst.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small>, The Holy One said: I created the soul, and it is delivered into my hand, [as stated] (in Job 12:10): <small>IN WHOSE HAND IS EVERY LIVING SOUL</small>. And justice also is delivered into my hand, as stated (in Deut. 32:41): <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small>. But I did not deliver the soul to judgment. Rather &lt;it is in my hand&gt; that it might see what is fitting for it and not sin; yet it does sin. (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>, for the soul is placed next to the judgment.

(Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS &lt;BY MISTAKE</small>&gt;. This text is related (to Prov. 19:2): <small>ALSO, A SOUL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT GOOD</small>; [<small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>]. When someone sins, even by mistake, it is not a good sign<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion</i>.</i> for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6; Lev. R. 4:3; Eccl. R. 12:14:1.</i> How so? There were two stores before him, one belonging to a star worshiper and one belonging to Israel. He entered the one belonging to the star worshiper. He entered deliberately. He is called a sinner, as stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel accounts explain more fully that one who entered the wrong store by mistake was merely <small>NOT GOOD</small>, but entering it deliberately made one a <small>SINNER</small>.</i>
Rav Isaac bar Samuel bar Martha said: There were two ways before him, one long and one short. The short one was full of pebbles, but the long one did not have a pebble in it. He left the long one and went by the short one on the Sabbath. Concerning him it was stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. Our masters have taught (in <i>Avot</i>. 4:2): <small>ONE GOOD LEADS TO ANOTHER, AND ONE TRANSGRESSION LEADS TO ANOTHER</small>. A person should not worry about a sin which he commits by mistake, but rather that an opening has been made for him to sin, whether by mistake or deliberately. Moreover, one should not rejoice over a good deed which comes to him (for fulfillment), but rather that many good deeds are going to come to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Avot</i>. 4:2: <small>THE RECOMPENSE FOR A GOOD DEED IS A GOOD DEED</small>.</i> Therefore, if one has sinned by mistake, this is not a good sign. How much the more so if he sins deliberately! About him it has been stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. So also (in Prov. 6:16–19): <small>SIX THINGS THE LORD HATES…: HAUGHTY EYES, A LYING TONGUE,… FEET QUICK TO RUN TO EVIL</small>, &lt;….&gt; This refers to Ahab ben Kolaiah and Zedekiah ben Maaseiah (the false prophets of Jer. 29:21–23), who sinned in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 93a; <i>PRK</i> 24:15.</i> And that was not enough for them, but after they had gone into exile in Babylon, they added to their sin. And what had they done in Jerusalem? They were false prophets. Moreover, they did not forsake their trade in Babylon. Now they would pimp for each other. Ahab would go to visit &lt;one of&gt; the great ones in the kingdom and would say to him: I am so-and-so, a prophet. The Holy One has sent me to say something to your wife. Then he would say to him: Here she is before you. Go on in. When he was alone with her, he would say to her: The Holy One wants to raise up prophets from you. Simply go, have intercourse with Zedekiah, and give birth to prophets from him. So he would come and have intercourse with her. Then Zedekiah would similarly pimp for Ahab. And this was their trade for several years. Come and see how wicked they were. They gave themselves a reputation in Babylon for being great prophets. When some woman became pregnant and saw one of them, she would say to him, O Prophet, what is in my womb? A male or a female? He would say: A male. Then he would go to her neighbors and say: So-and-so will bear a female. If she bore a male, she would say: So-and-so, the prophet, told me. If it was a female, the neighbors would say: Thus did so-and-so, the prophet, tell us; but he did not want to worry you. Now they acted in this way until they came to Shemirah, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah said to her. Thus says the Lord: Inform Ahab….<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For the missing part of the story, see <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6; <i>Sanh</i>. 93a; <i>PRK</i> 24:15.</i> What caused these wicked men to be burned? It was because they ran with their feet after transgressions. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. Nevertheless (ibid.) <small>ALSO, A SOUL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT GOOD</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses: Say unto Israel (in Lev. 4:2) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>.

Siman 11

(Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>. Is it the soul that sins? The Scripture verse (Eccl. 3:16) says: <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small> (<i>tsedeq</i>), <small>THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS. THE PLACE</small> is &lt;the source of&gt; the soul, which has been given out of righteousness (<i>tsedeq</i>), &lt;i.e.&gt; out of a place where there is no iniquity or sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6; Exod. R. 4:1.</i> &lt;When&gt; it does sins, the Scripture verse (Lev. 4:2) cries out in surprise: <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>?! (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small> (<i>tsedeq</i>), <small>THITHER &lt;CAME&gt; WICKEDNESS</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To two children of Adam who sinned against the king. One was a country bumpkin, and one a person from the palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>palatium;</i> Gk.: <i>palation</i>.</i> &lt;When&gt; he saw that both of them had committed a single offense, he released the country bumpkin but rendered a &lt;guilty&gt; verdict<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis</i>.</i> against the person from the palace. His palace people said to him: Both of them committed a single offense; &lt;yet&gt; you released the country bumpkin &lt;and&gt; gave a verdict against the person from the palace. He said to them: I released the country bumpkin because he did not know the laws<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. <i>nomos</i>.</i> of the kingdom, but the person from the palace is with me every day and knows what the laws of the kingdom are. Now for the one close to me who sinned, [what verdict] will be pronounced against him? So also the body is a country bumpkin. (Gen. 2:7:) <small>THE LORD FORMED THE HUMAN</small> [<small>OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND</small>]. But the soul is a palace person from above. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND BLEW INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE</small>. Yet both of them sinned. Why? Because it impossible for the body to exist without the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 4:5.</i> Thus, if there is no soul, there is no body, and if there is no body, there is no soul. So both of them sinned. (Ezek. 18:20:) <small>THE SOUL THAT SINS SHALL DIE</small>. Therefore the scripture verse (Lev. 4:2) cries out in surprise: <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE &lt;AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS</small> &gt;! What is the significance of <small>BY MISTAKE</small> (rt.: <i>Sh</i><small>GG</small>) <small>AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS</small>? &lt;It is&gt; to teach you that, when anyone sins <small>BY MISTAKE</small>, [it is as if] one transgresses against <small>THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS</small>. And so it says (in Numb. 15:22): <small>AND WHEN YOU SIN UNINTENTIONALLY</small> (rt.: <i>Sh</i><small>GG</small>) <small>AND DO NOT FULFILL ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The next verses explain how atonement is made.</i> [So also David has said (in Ps. 19:13–14 [12–13]): <small>WHO CAN DISCERN MISTAKES? CLEANSE ME FROM HIDDEN FAULTS</small>]. <small>ALSO RESTRAIN YOUR SERVANT FROM WILLFUL SINS…, AND I SHALL BE CLEAN OF GREAT TRANSGRESSION</small>, &lt;i.e.&gt; from the great sin which I have committed. But if you do so act (Ps. 19:15 [14]:), <small>LET THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH &lt;AND THE MEDITATIONS OF MY HEART&gt; BE ACCEPTABLE &lt;BEFORE YOU</small>&gt;. From here you learn that everyone who sins, even by mistake, is called a sinner. Our masters have said: A mistake in study is accounted as willful sin. It is therefore written (in Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS</small>. &lt;It is&gt; because it is from above that "a person (<i>adam</i>)" is not written here.

Siman 12

In the world to come the Holy One will bring in the soul and say to it: Why have you transgressed against the commandments? Then it will say: The body transgressed against the commandments. From the day that I left it, have I ever sinned? &lt;Then&gt; he will go back and say to the body: For what reason did you transgress the commandments? It will say to him: The soul sinned. Since the soul left me, have I ever sinned? What will the Holy One do? He will bring them both in and judge them as one. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard in which were grapes, figs, pomegranates, and early-ripening figs.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6; <i>Sanh</i>. 91ab; Lev. R. 4:5; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Simeon b. Johay</i>, edited by J.N. Epstein and E.Z. Melamed (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1955), pp. 76–77 (on Exod. 15:1); <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Shirata</i> 2; The Apocryphon of Ezekiel, cited in Epiphanius, <i>Panarion</i> (<i>Haereses</i>), 64:70 (Origen), K. Holl edition in <small><i>GCS</i></small>31(1922), pp. 236–243 (not in the Migne edition), translated by J.R. Mueller and S.E. Robinson in <i>The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha</i>, vol. I, edited by J.H. Charlesworth (Garden City, <small>NY</small>: Doubleday, 1983), p. 492; see Tertullian, <i>De resurrectione carnis</i>, 15–17.</i> The king said (to himself): If I post someone there who can see and walk, he will eat the early-ripening figs for himself. He &lt;therefore&gt; posted two guards, one lame and one blind. They stayed and watched the orchard. They smelled the early-ripening figs. The lame one said to the blind one: I see lovely early-ripening figs in the orchard. Come and give me a ride, so we can get them and eat them. The lame one rode upon the back of the blind one, so that he got them, and they ate them. One day the king came. He wanted the early-ripening figs, but he did not find any. He said to the blind one: Did you eat them? He said to him: Do I have any eyes? He said to the lame one: Have you eaten them? He said: Do I have any feet? He &lt; therefore &gt; mounted the lame person on the blind person's back and judged them as one. So the Holy One will take a spirit and toss it into a body, as stated (in Ps. 50:4): <small>HE SUMMONED THE HEAVENS ABOVE</small>, i.e., the soul; (ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE EARTH TO JUDGE HIS PEOPLE</small>, i.e., the body. So David foresaw how the Holy One would judge his creatures. He began to seek mercy for his soul. He said: Master of the World, when you judge your creatures, do not judge me like them. [(Ps. 143:2): <small>AND DO NOT ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOUR SERVANT, FOR NO ONE LIVING SHALL BE JUSTIFIED BEFORE YOU</small>.] Rather act justly with me, as stated (in Ps. 17:15): <small>AS FOR ME, I WILL BEHOLD YOUR FACE IN JUSTICE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world because the evil drive rules in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel text in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:6, reads: “in you.”</i> You have sinned, but in the world to come I will root it out from you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH</small>….

(Lev. 5:1:) <small>AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>…, <small>&lt;IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small>&gt;. This text is related (to Eccl. 5:1 [2]): <small>DO NOT BE RASH WITH YOUR MOUTH, AND LET NOT YOUR HEART HASTEN TO BRING FORTH A WORD BEFORE GOD</small>. These &lt; words refer to&gt; the children of Adam who vilify the name of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:7.</i> Come and see. When the celestial beings were created, those below were created with half of the name, as stated (in Is. 26:4): <small>FOR THROUGH YH</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YH</i> is the first half of the divine name, which the Hebrew spells out where the translation reads <small>THE LORD</small>.</i> <small>THE LORD FORMED THE WORLDS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets <i>tsur ‘olamim</i> as <small>FORMED THE WORLDS</small> (i.e., this world and the world to come) rather than as the more usual <small>EVERLASTING ROCK</small>. For similar interpretations, see <i>yHag</i>. 2:1 (77c); <i>Men</i>. 29b; Gen. R. 12:10; M. Pss. 62:1; 114:3; cf. also M. Pss. 118:14.</i> But why were they not created with all of it? So that none of them would repeat the full name of the Holy One. Woe to those creatures who vilify the name of the Holy One in vain. See what is written about offerings (in Lev. 1:2): <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>. It does not say "To the Lord, an offering," but <small>AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 1:6; <i>Ned</i>. 10ab; <i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 1:2, <i>Wayyiqra</i>, Parashah 2; <i>Sifre</i>, Deut.32:3 (306); Gen. R. 1:13.</i> so the Children of Adam vilify the name of the Lord in vain. It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 5:1 [2]): <small>DO NOT BE RASH WITH YOUR MOUTH</small>…. [<small>FOR GOD IS IN HEAVEN AND YOU ARE ON EARTH</small>.] For who would say that God is not in Heaven and that the children of Adam are not on earth? However, Solomon has said: Every time that the weakest of the weak is from above, he defeats the warrior from below. Go and learn from Abimelech (in Jud. 9:53): <small>BUT A CERTAIN WOMAN DROPPED AN UPPER MILLSTONE</small> [<small>ON ABIMELECH'S HEAD AND CRACKED HIS SKULL</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Since the woman was above the warrior Abimelech in the tower of Thebez, her killing him is an example of a relatively weak person defeating a warrior from above.</i> And how much the more so in the case of a warrior among warriors from above! See what is written about him (in Dan. 4:32 [35]): <small>ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE OF NO ACCOUNT</small>, [<small>AND HE DOES AS HE WISHES WITH THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH</small>]. It is also written (in Ps. 47:3 [2]): <small>FOR THE LORD MOST HIGH IS AWESOME, A GREAT KING OVER ALL THE EARTH</small>. But the children of Adam are below. (Eccl. 5:1 [2]:) <small>THEREFORE LET YOUR WORDS BE FEW</small>. So what is there for you to do? To put your hand upon your mouth and upon your ear in order to neither speak nor hear. Ergo (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">These words also appear in Lev. 5:21 [6:2].</i>

Siman 14

(Lev. 5:1:) <small>&lt;AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING,&gt; WHEN HE IS A WITNESS TO WHAT HE HAS EITHER SEEN OR COME TO KNOW, &lt;IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small> &gt;. This text is related (to Prov. 29:24): <small>THE ONE WHO SHARES WITH A THIEF HATES HIS OWN SOUL</small>; [<small>HE HEARS SWEARING AND DOES NOT SPEAK OUT</small>]. What has caused anyone to say of him: <small>IF A SOUL SINS</small>? &lt;It is&gt; simply because he did not come and tell a sage: So-and-so blasphemed the name of the Holy One. He therefore shares his iniquities with him, as stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small>. Therefore Solomon has said (in Prov. 29:24): <small>THE ONE WHO SHARES WITH A THIEF HATES HIS OWN SOUL</small>. Just as when the thief is caught, his partner is convicted along with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 6:2.</i> so whoever hears blasphemy of the Holy One and does not speak out is convicted along with him. And let no one say: What denunciation do I say? The Holy One has said (in Lev. 5:1ff.): On every matter, there is a denunciation in it. &lt;Would there be, therefore&gt; an exception for cursing the Name? Why? Because &lt;it is&gt; just like a case of a person cursing his companion. When one hears him, it is of no concern to him. But if he has cursed his father in his presence, he puts his life on the line and says: You have cursed my father. Moses said (in Deut. 32:6): <small>IS HE NOT YOUR FATHER WHO CREATED YOU</small>?

Siman 15

(Lev. 5:1:) <small>AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>, [<small>WHEN HE IS A WITNESS TO WHAT HE HAS EITHER SEEN OR COME TO KNOW</small>.] The Holy One said: If you want to bear witness, bear witness; but if not, I will bear witness. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>WHEN HE IS A WITNESS</small>. And where is it shown that the Holy One is called a witness? Where it is stated (in Jer. 29:23): <small>I AM THE ONE WHO KNOWS AND BEARS WITNESS, SAYS THE LORD</small>. Come and see. All the parashioth written in this book have <small>MISTAKE</small> written in them, except for this parashah, in which <small>MISTAKE</small> is not mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, <small>MISTAKE</small> (<i>shegagah</i>), i.e., <small>UNINTENTIONAL SIN</small>, does appear in this parashah (in 5:15, 18). Elsewhere in Lev. the word only appears in 4:2, 22, 27; 22:4.)</i> About him Solomon has said (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>]. It is comparable to two people who threw stones at an image of a king.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eikonion</i>, a diminutive form of <i>eikon</i>.</i> One was drunk, and one was in possession of his senses. Both of them were caught and went to trial. &lt;The judge&gt; rendered a &lt;guilty&gt; verdict<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis</i>.</i> against the one with his senses and acquitted the one who was drunk. So it is in the case of whoever sins. It is concerning him that <small>MISTAKE</small> is written (in Lev. 4:2): <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small> (rt.: <small><i>Sh</i>GG</small>) &lt; <small>AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS</small> &gt;…. (Lev. 4:13:) <small>AND IF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHOULD ERR</small> (rt.: <small><i>Sh</i>GG</small>), because they all sinned by mistake, they bring an offering, and shall be forgiven them. It is so stated (in Numb. 15:26): <small>THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND THE STRANGER WHO RESIDES IN THEIR MIDST SHALL BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE &lt;IT HAPPENED &gt; TO ALL THE PEOPLE BY MISTAKE</small>. But the one who blasphemes receives a &lt; guilty&gt; verdict, as stated (in Lev. 24:16) <small>AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. [It is also written] (in Jer. 4:2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES, IN TRUTH, IN JUSTICE, AND IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. [<small>THEN SHALL NATIONS BLESS THEMSELVES IN HIM, AND HIM SHALL THEY GLORY</small>.] The Scripture also says (in Deut. 10:20): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR, HIM YOU SHALL SERVE, TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>, then after that, <small>AND BY HIM YOU SHALL SWEAR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See below, <i>Tanh</i>.

About Abraham it is written (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small> (<i><small>YR</small></i>' '<i><small>LHYM</small></i>)…. About Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18): <small>FOR I FEAR</small> (<small><i>YR</i></small>') <small>GOD</small> ('<i><small>LHYM</small></i>). About Job it is written (in Job 1:2): <small>HE FEARED GOD</small> (<i><small>YR</small></i>' '<i><small>LHYM</small></i>) <small>AND SHUNNED EVIL</small>. (Deut. 10:20, cont.:) <small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE</small>, in that you will be busy with the Torah and with &lt;fulfilling&gt; the commandments. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>, in that you will honor the disciples of the wise and share your property with them. Moses said to Israel: Do not think that I may have allowed you to swear by my name, even in truth. It is only, if all these conditions (mentioned earlier in the verse) abide with you, that you are entitled to swear by my name; and if not, you are not entitled to swear by my name, even in truth. You shall not be like those of whom it is written (in Jer. 7:9): <small>WILL YOU &lt;…&gt; SWEAR FALSELY AND SACRIFICE TO BAAL</small>? Fulfill all these conditions and after that you are mine, as stated (in Jer. 4:1): <small>IF YOU RETURN, O ISRAEL, SAYS THE LORD, IF YOU RETURN UNTO ME</small>…. Then after that &lt;it says&gt; (in vs. 2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES</small>….

One would utter an oath to his companion that he was going to such and such a place to eat and drink. Then they would go and act to fulfill their oath. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS &lt;IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small> &gt;….

Now when the Holy One comes to judge all people in the age to come, he will judge them along with sorcerers and adulterers.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 1:7.</i> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:5): <small>THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU IN JUDGMENT; AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS, AGAINST THOSE WHO SWEAR TO A LIE</small>.&lt;…&gt; Moreover, I am finding them guilty and bringing them down to Gehinnom. The Holy One said: How is it that I have allowed you to be praising and glorifying my name, &lt;when&gt; you are reproaching, blaspheming, and swearing to a lie in my name? All people were created for my praise, as stated (in Prov. 16:4): <small>THE LORD HAS MADE EVERYTHING FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE</small>. So is it not enough for you that you do not praise him, but &lt;that&gt; you blaspheme &lt;him as well&gt;! The Scripture has said (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA, &lt;FOR IT CANNOT REST</small> (rt.: <i><small>ShQT</small></i>) &gt;…. &lt;They are&gt; just like this &lt;kind of&gt; sea which has rollers in its midst exalting themselves upward. When each and every one of them reaches the sand, it is broken and returns (<i>hozer</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The word also means “repents.”</i> Moreover, its companion is looking at it. That one also, when it is to be broken, exalts itself upward without repenting (<i>hozer</i>). So are the wicked, who look at one another and exalt themselves. Therefore, they are likened to the sea, as stated (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>…. All the generations, the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the Tower of Babel), did not learn from each other. Instead they were exalting themselves. Therefore, (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. The wicked have no rest in the world, but the righteous have serenity (<i><small>ShQT</small></i>), as stated (in Jer. 30:10): <small>AND JACOB SHALL AGAIN HAVE PEACE</small> (<small><i>ShQT</i></small>) <small>AND QUIET WITH NONE TO MAKE HIM AFRAID</small>.

Siman 18

Another interpretation (of Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. Just as the sea has its mud in its mouth, so the wicked have their stench in their mouth. Thus it is stated (at the end of Is. 57:20): <small>AND ITS WATERS TOSS UP SLIME AND MUD</small>. It is not from choice that one hears blasphemies and invectives, but from the midst of the sins which are within him. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS AND HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Most translations equate the sinning with the swearing. This more literal translation illustrates the point that the swearing comes from a soul which has already sinned.</i> You find &lt;that there are&gt; three things under human control and three things not under human control.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 6:12 (i.e., <i>Toledot</i> 12); Gen. R. 67:12.</i> The following are under one's control: The mouth, the hands and the feet. The mouth: If one wants to be engaged in the Torah, he is engaged; &lt;if one wants&gt; to blaspheme and revile, he does so, because his lips are under his control. The hands: If one wants to give alms, he gives them; &lt;if one wants&gt; to steal, he steals. Why? Because they are under his control. The feet: One wanting to go to the synagogue goes; &lt;one wanting&gt; to steal, commit adultery, &lt;or&gt; murder goes, because his feet are under his control. But the following are not under one's control: The eyes, the ears, and the nose. The eyes: If one was passing through the market place and saw someone committing a transgression in the market place, he was seeing what was not under his control. The ears: If one heard the sound of blasphemies and invectives and did not want to hear them, what should he do? He heard what was not under his control. The nose: If one passed through a place of idolatry, smelled idolatrous incense, and did not smell it willingly, what should he do? He smelled what was not under his control. But when the Holy One desires, even these things which are &lt; ordinarily &gt; under one's control are not &lt;any longer&gt; under one's control. The mouth: When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One did not allow him. He blessed them instead, as stated (in Deut. 23:6): <small>BUT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID NOT WANT TO HEED BALAAM; &lt;SO THE LORD YOUR GOD TURNED THE CURSE INTO A BLESSING FOR YOU</small>&gt;…. Also the hands: Thus you find in the case of Jeroboam, when the prophet came <small>AND</small> (according to I Kings 13:2) <small>CRIED OUT</small> {<small>UNTO</small>} [<small>AGAINST</small>] <small>THE ALTAR</small> [<small>ACCORDING TO</small>] <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD AND SAID</small>: <small>O ALTAR, ALTAR</small>, [<small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN UNTO THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>…. ] Then Jeroboam said: Moses wrote in the Torah (in Deut. 13:2 [1]): <small>IF THERE ARISES AMONG YOU A PROPHET… AND GIVES YOU A SIGN OR A PORTENT</small>. Now as for you, what portent are you giving me? He said to him: Is it a portent that you want? (I Kings 13:3:) <small>THIS IS THE PORTENT WHICH THE LORD HAS DECREED: BEHOLD, THE ALTAR WILL BE TORN ASUNDER</small>. Then (in vs. 4): <small>JEROBOAM</small> {<small>RAISED</small>} [<small>STRETCHED OUT</small>] <small>HIS ARM FROM OVER THE ALTAR, SAYING: SEIZE HIM, BUT HIS HAND &lt; WHICH HE STRETCHED AGAINST HIM &gt; WITHERED, &lt;AND HE COULD NOT DRAW IT BACK TO HIMSELF</small>&gt;. &lt;This is written &gt; to teach you that it was not under his control. Also the feet: Where it shown concerning them? From the men of Aram (i.e., Syria). When they came against Elisha, the Holy One said to them: Is it in your own right that you have come? What did he do to them? He misdirected them, as stated (in II Kings 6:19): <small>THEN ELISHA SAID TO THEM: THIS IS NOT THE ROAD, AND THIS IS NOT THE CITY</small>. &lt;This is written &gt; to teach you that even the feet are not under one's control.

(Lev. 6:1–2 [8–9]:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt; UNTO MOSES SAYING &gt;: COMMAND AARON</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD, IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>? The Holy One said: If I had &lt; merely &gt; desired an offering, would I not have told Michael to bring me an offering?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:1.</i> From whom do I desire sacrifice? From Israel. And so it says about the shewbread (in Lev. 24:8) [<small>HE SHALL ARRANGE IT BEFORE THE LORD REGULARLY</small>] <small>ON EVERY SABBATH DAY</small>. But it is written (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF RIVERS OF OIL</small>? Balaam the Wicked was an advocate<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synegoros.</i></i> for the nations of the world. It is in reference to his place (as their advocate)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallels in <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr.</i> 34 and in <i>Tanhuma</i>, which read: “It is in reference to the nations that….”</i> that &lt; Scripture &gt; speaks (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT</small> [<small>THOUSANDS OF RAMS WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF RIVERS OF OIL</small>]? He wants what you offer to him, &lt; i.e. &gt; a log<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A log is a liquid measure that equals the contents of six eggs.</i> of oil. We (gentiles) offer him ten thousand times ten thousands rivers of oil. What did Abraham offer to him? Was it not one ram? It is so stated (in Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN</small> [<small>ABRAHAM</small>] <small>LIFTED HIS EYES TO LOOK AND THERE WAS A RAM BEHIND HIM</small>…. If he wants, we should offer him thousands of rams; but what did Abraham offer him? His son. I might offer him my son and daughter, as stated (in Micah 6:7, cont.): <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION, THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL? MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION</small>? This is my first-born son. <small>THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL</small>? This is my daughter. See how crafty Balaam the Wicked was! He began to say (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &lt; AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR</small> &gt;. He did not say, "&lt; seven &gt; altars," but, <small>THE &lt; SEVEN &gt; ALTARS</small>. These are &lt; all of the &gt; seven altars, &lt; which &gt; they had built since the first Adam was created up to now. Now I am offering seven &lt; sacrifices &gt; corresponding to the seven of them. And what did they offer? Twelve cakes, as stated (in Lev. 24:5): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE FINE WHITE FLOUR AND BAKE IT INTO TWELVE CAKES</small>. When the Holy One appeared to him, he said to him: O Wicked One, what are you doing? He said to him (In Numb. 23:4) <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS</small>. To whom is this wicked one comparable? To a butcher who sold &lt; meat &gt; in the market. When his store was full of meat, the market commissioner<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>logistes</i>.</i> saw &lt; him &gt; and looked at the meat. &lt; When &gt; that butcher saw that he was looking at the meat, he said to him: Sir, I have already sent provisions<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>opsonion</i>.</i> to your house. So it was with Balaam. The Holy One said to him: O Wicked One, what are you doing here? He said to him (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS WITH A BULL AND A RAM ON EACHALTAR</small>. He said to him (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS</small>? He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION</small>? The Holy One said to him: O Evil One, if I had desired offering, I would have spoken to Michael and Gabriel, and they would have presented offerings to me. It is so stated (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD, IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>? Among the children of Abraham are Isaac and Jacob. &lt; These are the ones &gt; who are the rams of the world. The Holy One said to him: What do you desire? To deceive yourself before me? &lt; To persuade &gt; me to accept offerings from the gentiles? You are not able. He said to him: It is an oath, (in the words of Lev. 24:8, cont.) <small>AN EVERLASTING COVENANT ON THE PART OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, they say, so that I only accept offerings from Israel. It is so stated (in Lev. 6:1–2 [8–9]): <small>COMMAND AARON AND HIS CHILDREN, SAYING: &lt; THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small> &gt;…. When the nations said: What is this, whereby Israel is presenting offerings and sacrificing? the Holy One said to them (ibid.): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small> (rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>). (Cant. 3:6): <small>WHO IS THIS THAT COMES UP FROM THE DESERT &lt; LIKE COLUMNS OF SMOKE PERFUMED WITH MYRRH AND FRANKINCENSE</small> &gt;…? (Exod. 19:3:) <small>THEN MOSES WENT</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) <small>UP UNTO GOD</small>.

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:1–2 [8–9]:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE…: COMMAND AARON…: THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. The Holy One said: Fulfill what is written above on the matter. Then after that &lt; comes &gt; <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. Why? (Is. 61:8:) <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. Even <small>WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Lev. 5:23 [6])? <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, WHEN ONE HAS SINNED AND IS GUILTY, HE SHALL RESTORE THE STOLEN GOODS WHICH HE ROBBED</small>. Then after that (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. If you desire to present an offering, you shall not rob anyone. Why? <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. So when do you present a burnt offering so that I accept it? When your hands are clean of robbery. David said (in Ps. 24:3–4): <small>WHO MAY ASCEND THE HILL OF THE LORD? AND WHO MAY STAND IN HIS HOLY PLACE? ONE WITH CLEAN HANDS AND A PURE HEART</small>. From the beginning of &lt; this book on &gt; offerings you learn (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ONE</small> (<i>adam</i>) <small>OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>. Why is Adam mentioned? It is simply that the Holy One said: When you sacrifice to me, you shall be like the first Adam in that he did not rob from others, since he was alone in the world. So also you shall not rob people. Why? (Is. 61:8:) <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>.
Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. Why is it named a <small>BURNT OFFERING</small> ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>)? Because it is the highest (rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>) of all the offerings. It is that which ascends ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>). You should know that when someone brings a sin offering, the priest takes it and likewise the meal offering. Moreover, the peace offerings belong to their owners and a guilt offering belongs to the priest. In the case of the burnt offering, however, no creature tastes it. Rather all of it belongs to the Holy One. Therefore, it is called <small>BURNT OFFERING</small> ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>), because it ascends ('<i>olah</i>) to the Holy One, who is &lt; the &gt; Most High (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>).

Siman 3

Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>COMMAND AARON</small>…. What is the function of Aaron here?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:2.</i> Israel was bringing offerings while Aaron waited. So the Scripture says here: <small>COMMAND AARON</small>. Note also, it is written (in Numb. 28:2): <small>COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING &lt; … YOU SHALL TAKE HEED TO OFFER ME IN ITS DUE SEASON</small> &gt;, but here it says (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>COMMAND AARON &lt; … &gt;: THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE ONE WHO ASCENDS</small> (<i><small>H'LH</small></i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The masoretic text vocalizes this word as <i>ha’olah</i>, which means, <small>THE BURNT OFFERING</small>, but the midrash interprets the word as though it were vocalized <i>ha’oleh</i>, which means, “The one who ascends,” with the ascending implying self-exaltation. So also Lev. R. 7:6.</i> The Holy One said: Whenever someone raises (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) himself up, his end is to go in the fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">M.Ps. 11:5.</i> [It is so stated (in Lev. 6:2 [9], cont.):] <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>…. The generation of the flood &lt; suffered &gt; because of what they said (in Job 21:15): <small>WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM? AND WHAT DO WE PROFIT WHEN WE PRAY TO HIM</small>? For that reason they were sentenced to the fire (of Gehinnom). And likewise the Sodomites, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE</small>. When Pharaoh said (in Exod. 5:2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD</small>, [<small>THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>]? he exalted (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) himself and said (in Ezek. 29:3): <small>THE NILE IS MY OWN AND I MADE MYSELF</small>. &lt; He is &gt; therefore (in the words of Lev. 6:2 [9]) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>, for so it says (in Ps. 18:14 [13]): <small>THE LORD THUNDERED</small> {<small>FROM HEAVEN</small>} [<small>IN THE HEAVENS</small>], <small>AND THE MOST HIGH GAVE FORTH HIS VOICE, HAIL AND COALS OF FIRE</small>. And also when Sennacherib exalted (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) himself and said (in II Kings 19:23 = Is. 37:24): <small>IT IS I WHO HAVE ASCENDED</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) <small>THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHTS TO THE REMOTEST PARTS OF LEBANON</small>…, what happened to him? (II Kings 19:35:) <small>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &lt; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THOUSAND &gt; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>…. (According to II Kings 19:23: cf. 18:17–35) he had blasphemed through a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel in Is. 37:24 reads “servant” instead of “messenger.”</i> therefore (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21:) <small>THE ANGEL</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &lt; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THOUSAND &gt; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>. What did he do to him? (Is. 10:16): <small>AND UNDER HIS GLORY THERE SHALL BURN A BURNING LIKE THE BURNING OF FIRE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>UNDER HIS GLORY</small>? That it burned him from within and left alone his clothes on the outside, since a person's glory is his garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 94a.</i> Why did the Holy One leave their clothes behind? Because they were descendants of Shem, as stated (in Gen. 10:22): <small>THE SONS OF SHEM ARE ELAM, ASSHUR</small>,…. The Holy One said: I am indebted to their father Shem, because he took the garment and covered his father's nakedness, as stated (in Gen. 9:23): <small>THEN SHEM AND JAPHETH TOOK A GARMENT</small>…, <small>&lt; AND THEY COVERED THEIR FATHER'S NAKEDNESS</small> &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 2:21, which interprets the verse to show that Shem took the lead in this act.</i> Therefore, the Holy One left their clothes alone and burned &lt; only &gt; their body. (Lev. 6:2 [9]:) <small>THAT</small> (i.e. the person who exalts himself) <small>IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS</small> (<i>ha'oleh</i>) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>…. And so &lt; it was in the case of &gt; [Nebuchadnezzar, &lt; who &gt; he exalted (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) himself. He said (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>). The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, was it not enough that you should say (in vs. 13): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) <small>&lt; TO THE HEAVENS</small> &gt;; <small>ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD I WILL SET MY THRONE</small>, but that you should say (in vs. 14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD</small>, on high (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>)? And so he (i.e., Nebuchadnezzar) said to Hananiah and his friends (in Dan. 3:15): {<small>WHO IS</small>} [<small>NOW WHO IS</small>] <small>THE GOD WHO SHALL DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HAND</small>? I have burned his house and exiled his people. He did not stand against me in his house; so will he overcome me in my house? What did he do? He threw them into the fiery furnace. What did the Holy One do? He gave a sign to the furnace and it became a highway.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><small>PLTYA</small>, from the Gk.: <i>plateia.</i> Buber suggests emending to <i><small>PLNTYH</small></i>, from the Gk.: <i>planetes</i>, i.e., “planets”.</i> Whoever was designated to be burned [was not burned and whoever was not designated to be burned] was burned. So the fire went forth and burned half of the peoples. Thus you find, when they assembled for the dedication of the image, at first there were eight peoples, as stated (in Dan. 3:3): <small>THEN THE SATRAPS, THE PREFECTS, AND THE GOVERNORS, THE COUNSELORS, THE TREASURERS, THE JUDGES, THE MAGISTRATES, AND ALL THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ASSEMBLED</small>. That makes eight peoples; but when they came in to see Hananiah and his friends, there were only four peoples written there (in vs. 27): <small>THE SATRAPS, THE PREFECTS, THE GOVERNORS, AND THE ROYAL COMPANIONS ASSEMBLED</small>. {That makes four peoples.} [So where were four peoples?] It is simply that (in vs. 22) <small>THE FLAME OF THE FIRE SLEW THEM</small>. Now Nebuchadnezzar also was burned by the fire, and the fright (i.e., repulsiveness) of &lt; a body disfigured by &gt; burning was put upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For this interpretation, Jastrow, s.v., ‘<i>immus</i>.</i> Why was all of him not burned? The Holy One said: Leave this evil man half of himself so that he may know against whom he blasphemed. The Holy One said to him: O Wicked One, did you not say: I do not want to live with the children of Adam, but (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: '<small><i>LH</i></small>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD</small>? [By your life,] (according to Dan. 4:22 [25]) <small>YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANS</small>. Just as he brought the plagues upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, so he brought &lt; punishment &gt; upon Nebuchadnezzar. It is so stated (in Dan. 3:32 [4:2]): <small>THE SIGNS AND WONDERS WHICH THE MOST HIGH GOD HAS WORKED FOR ME IT SEEMED GOOD TO ME TO MAKE KNOWN</small>. This fright of &lt; a body disfigured by &gt; burning fell upon him. Therefore it is stated (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS</small> (<i><small>H</small>'<small>LH</small></i>) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>….

[(Lev. 6.2 [9]:) <small>&lt; THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE ONE WHO ASCENDS</small> (<i>h'lh</i>); &gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See above, note 8.</i> <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>.] This is the evil kingdom (of Rome), which exalted (rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>) itself, as stated (in Obad., vs. 4): <small>THOUGH YOU MAKE &lt; YOUR ABODE &gt; AS HIGH AS THE EAGLE, AND THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS, &lt; I WILL BRING YOU DOWN FROM THERE, SAYS THE LORD</small> &gt;. Moreover, it will be judged by fire, as stated (in Dan. 7:11): <small>&lt; I LOOKED ON THEN BECAUSE OF THE SOUND OF THE ARROGANT WORDS WHICH THE HORN UTTERED. &gt; I LOOKED ON UNTIL THE BEAST WAS SLAIN AND ITS BODY DESTROYED, GIVEN OVER FOR BURNING IN THE FIRE</small>.

(Lev. 7:11) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 3:17): <small>&lt; WISDOM'S &gt; WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>. Whatever is written in the Torah is written {as an expression of} [to establish] peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:3.</i> Although wars are written about in the Torah, they are written about for the sake of peace. You find that the Holy One cancelled the decree &lt; of utter destruction (<i>herem</i>) &gt; for the sake of peace. When? When the Holy One said to Moses (in Deut. 20:19): <small>WHEN YOU BESIEGE A CITY A LONG TIME</small>…., <small>&lt; YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>…. &gt; Now concerning that whole matter, the Holy One had said that he would destroy them, as stated (above in vs. 17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>. However, Moses did not do so. Rather he said: Am I to go and smite them now? I do not know who has sinned and who has not sinned. Instead, let me come against them in peace, as stated (in Deut. 2:26): <small>THEN I SENT MESSENGERS FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH &lt; UNTO KING SIHON OF HESHBON &gt; WITH WORDS OF PEACE, SAYING</small>: &lt; …. &gt; When he saw that he did not come in peace, he smote him, as stated (in Numb. 21:35): <small>SO THEY SMOTE HIM, HIS CHILDREN, AND ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>. The Holy One said to him: I myself told you (in Deut. 20:17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>…. Now you have come to them in Peace. By your life, just as you have said, so will I do. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT</small>. Therefore, it is so stated (in Prov. 3:17): <small>&lt; WISDOM'S &gt; WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 85:9 [8]): <small>LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD, THE LORD, WILL SPEAK; FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE UNTO HIS PEOPLE AND UNTO HIS SAINTS</small>. The peoples of the world said<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Reading ‘<i><small>MRW</small></i> with the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:4, instead of ‘<i><small>MRY</small></i> from the Buber text.</i> to Balaam: Why did the Holy One tell Israel to bring him sacrifices without telling us anything? Balaam said to them: The sacrifices are only peace (i.e., the peace offering). Whoever has accepted the Torah in which they are written must offer sacrifice. You rejected &lt; Torah &gt; from the start, and now you wish to offer sacrifices. Whoever accepted it is the one who offers &lt; sacrifices &gt;, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE; THE LORD WILL BLESS HIS PEOPLE WITH PEACE</small> (i.e., with peace offerings). It is therefore stated (in Ps. 85:9 [8]): <small>LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD, THE LORD, WILL SPEAK; FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE UNTO HIS PEOPLE AND UNTO HIS SAINTS</small>. What did he speak? (Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>…. Why was it worded, <small>THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>? Because it makes peace among the altar, the priests, and Israel. Come and see. The whole burnt offering belonged wholly to the flames. Also, in the case of the sin offering, its best parts and its devoted portions<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Emurim.</i> Perhaps from the Greek, <i>meria</i>, i.e., “thigh bones.”</i> belonged to the altar, its skin and its flesh belonged to the priests, but there was no enjoyment from it for Israel. So also in the case of the guilt offering. However, in the case of the thank offering, its blood and its devoted parts belonged to the altar, the breast and the shoulder belonged to the priests, but the skin and flesh belonged to Israel. It resulted in making peace among the altar, the priests, and Israel. It is therefore called (in Lev. 7:11), <small>THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>, because it made peace for all.

Siman 7

[(Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>.] When they offered the sacrifice of the peace offerings, the Holy One would lift up his face to them, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:5.</i> Is it possible for the Holy One to lift up a face to mortals? Two verses contradict each other. One text says (in Ezek. 33:11): {<small>FOR</small>} <small>I DO NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF THE WICKED BUT THAT THE WICKED TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE</small>. The other text says (in I Sam. 2:25): <small>FOR THE LORD TOOK PLEASURE IN SLAYING THEM</small>. How has he not taken pleasure in the death of the wicked? It is simply that before their verdict was sealed, he did not take pleasure; after a verdict was sealed, <small>THE LORD TOOK PLEASURE IN SLAYING THEM</small>. And so Daniel said (in Dan. 10:21): <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. Our masters have said: There was a story about Our Holy Rabbi (i.e., about R. Judah the Prince) that, when he was passing through Simonia (where he lived), all the people of the city came out to meet him.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yYev.</i> 12:6 (13a); Gen. R. 81:2; cf. <i>Yev.</i> 105:1.</i> They wanted one elder from him to teach Torah. He gave them R. Levi bar Simon. They said to him: Rabbenu, what is the meaning of what is written in Daniel (10:21): <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>? Is there something false in the Torah that it &lt; must specifically &gt; say <small>TRUTH</small> &lt; here &gt;? &lt; When &gt; he did not find an answer to give them, he immediately went away [from there and came] to Rabbi. He said to him: I could not stand up before them. They asked me one thing, and I could not find out what to answer them. He said to him: What was the &lt; one &gt; thing. He said to him: <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. Is there something false in the Torah? He said to him: There was a great answer for you to give them. He said to him: You had something to tell them: When someone sins, the Holy One inscribes death for him. &lt; If &gt; he repents, the record is canceled. &lt; If &gt; he does not repent, <small>IT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. [Here] also one text says (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>…, while another text says (in Deut. 10:17): <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small>. If he lifts it up, why does he not lift it up? It is simply that for the nations of the world, &lt; he is one &gt; <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small>, but for Israel, <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>. The Holy One said: Just as Israel lifts up a face to me, so I lift up a face to them. And how do they lift up a face to me? &lt; When &gt; someone poor from Israel has four children, he takes one loaf. They sit down and eat all that loaf, but they are not satisfied from what there is in it. So they give a blessing and say (from Deut. 8:10): <small>THEN YOU SHALL EAT, BE FULL</small>, [<small>AND BLESS</small>]. I shall also lift up a face to them, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>.

(Lev. 7:12:) <small>IF HE OFFERS IT FORA THANKSGIVING</small>…. See how the Holy One forgives the sins of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:6.</i> So what did they offer to the Holy One? It is simply that the Holy One said: Whoever has a bull, let him bring a bull; and whoever has a calf let him bring a calf. Whoever has a lamb, let him bring a lamb. Whoever has a dove, let him bring a dove. Whoever has only one of all these, let him bring fine flour; and whoever has neither flour nor anything at all, let him bring words. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 14:3 [2]): <small>TAKE YOUR WORDS WITH YOU</small> [<small>AND RETURN UNTO THE LORD</small>]. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 7:12:) <small>IF HE OFFERS IT FOR A THANKSGIVING</small>….

Siman 9

(Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>….

A burnt offering took place for a thought of the heart. Thus it is stated (in Job 1:5): <small>AND RISING EARLY IN THE MORNING, HE WOULD OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS, ONE FOR EACH OF THEM, FOR JOB SAID: PERHAPS MY CHILDREN HAVE SINNED AND BLASPHEMED GOD IN THEIR HEARTS</small>. But when the thank offering took place, it took place on account of their gratitude. The Holy One said: This is the dearest to me of all the offerings. David said (in Ps. 50:23): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES A THANK OFFERING HONORS ME</small> (<i><small>YKBDNNI</small></i>). It does not say <i><small>YKBDNI</small></i> but <i><small>YKBDNNI</small></i>, &lt; spelled with N &gt; two times, &lt; once &gt; for this world and &lt; once &gt; for the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Lev.

Siman 10

(Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. [Peace offerings rank high] because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven. Eleazar haQappar says: Peace is great, because even though Israel worships idols but &lt; still &gt; forms one fellowship (<i>havurah</i>), strict justice does not harm them.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:7; Numb. R. 11:17; cf. Gen. R. 38:6.</i> It is so stated (in Hos. 4:17): <small>EPHRAIM IS ASSOCIATED</small> (<i>havur</i>) <small>WITH IDOLS. LET HIM BE</small>. R. Levi says: Peace is great, because there is no conclusion to the Priestly Blessing except peace, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said: Peace is great, because the Holy One has written things in the Torah which are there only because of Peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yPe’ah</i> 1:1 (16a); see Gen. R. 48:18; 100:8; Lev. R. 9:9; Deut. R. 5:5; <i>Yev.</i> 65b.</i> They are the following:
<br>When Jacob had died, (Gen. 50:15:) <small>AND JOSEPH'S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD</small>…, what did they do?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 1:2.</i> They went to Bilhah and said to her: Go in unto Joseph and say to him (in Gen. 50:16): <small>BEFORE HE DIED YOUR FATHER GAVE A COMMAND SAYING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The command was for Joseph to forgive his brothers and so make peace.</i> Now Jacob never commanded any of these things at all; yet they said this thing on their own. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: See how much ink was spilled, how many pens<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalamoi</i>.</i> were broken, {how many children were whipped,} how many skins were {destroyed} [prepared], [and how many children were whipped], in order to learn something which was not in the Torah. See how great is the power of peace!<br>And so you find in the case of Sarah, when the ministering angels came to Abraham and said to him (in Gen. 18:14): <small>AT THE SET TIME I WILL RETURN UNTO YOU, AT THE TIME THAT LIFE IS DUE, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON</small>, at that time (according to Gen. 18:12) <small>SARAH LAUGHED TO HERSELF, SAYING</small>:… [<small>AND MY HUSBAND IS AN OLD MAN</small>].

For the sake of peace.
Also in the world to come, when the Holy One returns the Diaspora to Jerusalem, he shall return them in peace. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 122:6): <small>PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM</small>. And so it says (in Is. 66:12): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL EXTEND PEACE UNTO HER LIKE A RIVER</small>.

(Lev. 8:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt; UNTO MOSES &gt;…: TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM, THE VESTMENTS</small> &lt; …. &gt; This text is related (to Ps. 65:5 [4]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS</small>. Blessed is the one whom the Holy One has chosen, even though he has not brought him near.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:8.</i> And Blessed is the one whom he has brought near, even though he did not choose him. Now which was this one whom he chose? This was Abraham. {However he did not bring him near; instead he brought himself near to him.} It is so stated (in Neh. 9:7): <small>YOU ARE THE LORD, THE GOD WHO CHOSE ABRAM</small>…. [However he did not bring him near. Instead he brought himself near.] In the case of Jacob, the Holy One chose him, as stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>JACOB, WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN</small>. It also says (in Ps. 135:4): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN JACOB FOR HIMSELF</small>. But he did not bring him near. Instead he brought himself near. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. Moses he chose but did not bring near, as stated (in Ps. 106:23): &lt; …, &gt; <small>HAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN ONE &lt; STOOD IN THE BREACH</small> &gt;,…. David he chose but did not bring near, as stated (in Ps. 78:70): <small>HE CHOSE DAVID, HIS SERVANT</small>. He also brought himself near, as stated (in Ps. 119:63): <small>I AM A COMPANION TO ALL WHO FEAR YOU</small>. Blessed are those whom the Holy One chose, even though he did not bring them near. Come and see Jethro. The Holy One brought him near, but he did not choose him. In the case of Rahab the harlot, he brought her near but did not choose her. Aaron was doubly blessed because &lt; the Holy One &gt; chose him and brought him near. Where is it shown that he chose him? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 2:28): <small>AND I CHOSE HIM</small> [<small>FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST</small>]. And where is it shown that he brought him near? Where it is stated (in Exod. 28:1): <small>AND YOU SHALL BRING NEAR UNTO YOURSELF YOUR BROTHER AARON &lt; AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM,… TO SERVE ME AS PRIESTS</small> &gt;. Therefore, David praised him (in Ps. 65:5 [4]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR &lt; TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS</small> &gt;.

[(Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS</small>.] It is written (in Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>, [<small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>.] This verse functioned in the beginning of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:9: “from the beginning of the world until now.”</i> <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Noah and his children. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to the generation of the flood. There is also this interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Shem of whom it is stated (in Gen. 9:26): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM</small>. (Prov. 3:35, cont.): <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Ham of whom it is stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small> (the son of Ham).
Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Abraham. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to the kings whom he smote (in Gen. 14:15). <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Isaac. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are the people of Gerar. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Jacob. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Esau and his chiefs. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Joshua. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are the thirty-one kings whom he smote (according to Josh. 12:24). <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to David. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Goliath. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Eli. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are his sons, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 2:12): <small>NOW ELI'S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS. THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are the sons of Aaron, of whom it is stated (in Lev. 8:2): <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS</small>…. Why is <small>TAKE</small> mentioned here? The Holy One said to Moses: I am duty-bound to taking. You are to arise and magnify him through taking. And when did he take Aaron? When (in Numb. 17:11 [16:46]) <small>WRATH HAS GONE FORTH</small> upon those who hate Israel. Moses said to him (at the beginning of the verse): <small>TAKE THE FIRE PAN, AND PUT FIRE &lt; FROM THE ALTAR &gt; ON IT</small>. Aaron said to him: My Lord Moses, do you wish to kill me? Because my sons offered profane<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hedyotut</i>, from the Gk.: <i>idioteia</i>, i.e., “uncouthness.”</i> fire to the Holy One, they were destroyed by fire, [as stated (in Lev. 10:1–2): <small>&lt; NOW AARON'S SONS, NADAB AND ABIHU EACH TOOK HIS FIRE PAN…; &gt; AND THEY OFFERED ALIEN FIRE BEFORE THE LORD</small>…. <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM</small>.] Now you are saying: <small>TAKE THE FIRE PAN</small>! My sons brought in strange fire and were destroyed by fire. So should I bring forth holy fire outside? Then I would die or be destroyed by fire. Moses said to him: Go and act quickly; for as you are talking, they are dying. Rather (according to Numb. 17:11 [16:46], cont.) <small>TAKE IT QUICKLY UNTO THE CONGREGATION AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THEM</small>. When Aaron heard that, he said: If I die for Israel, am I not adequate? Immediately (in Numb. 17:12 [16:47]) <small>AARON TOOK IT AS MOSES HAD SAID</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses (in Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON</small>. He magnified him through taking. Just as Aaron is going to save his children by taking, so you are to magnify him through taking. Ergo (in Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON</small>.

The Holy One said to him (i.e., to Moses): Entice him with words, because he is fleeing from the &lt; priestly &gt; office. <small>TAKE</small> can only be a word &lt; implying &gt; persuasion, for so did Nebuchadnezzar (sic)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text throughout Jer. 39 reads “Nebuchadrezzar.”</i> say to Nebuzaradan (concerning Jeremiah in Jer. 39:12): <small>TAKE HIM AND LOOK AFTER HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Since Jeremiah was being taken for his own good, he would not have been taken by force but by persuasion.</i> So also it (i.e., Scripture) speaks of our mother Sarah (in Gen. 12:15): <small>&lt; SO PHARAOH'S COURTIERS SAW HER AND PRAISED HER TO PHARAOH, &gt; AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH'S HOUSE</small>. And also (here in Lev. 8:2), <small>TAKE AARON</small> is language &lt; implying &gt; persuasion because he was fleeing from the office.

Siman 15

(Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: Pay him honor in front of all Israel, in order that they may see him when he enters the High Priesthood.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:11.</i> In addition, you are to warn them not to rebel against the priesthood like Korah and his crowd (in Numb. 16:1–35). For I know that Uzziah is going to arise and rebel against the Priesthood (in II Chron. 26:16–21). Thus it is stated (in Numb. 17:5 [16:40]): <small>IT WAS TO BE A REMINDER TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT NO OUTSIDER &lt; WHO WAS NOT OF AARON'S SEED &gt; SHOULD DRAW NEAR &lt; TO OFFER INCENSE BEFORE THE LORD</small> &gt;…. He (i.e., Uzziah) was not of Levi's seed just as Korah was &lt; not of Levi's seed &gt;. It (i.e., the altar covering of Numb. 17:4 [16:39]) gave him a reminder: What you did to Korah you would do to him. It said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>LET HIM NOT BE LIKE KORAH AND HIS CROWD</small>. He said to it: And how did you act toward him? It said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>AS THE LORD SPOKE TO HIM THROUGH MOSES</small>. He (the Holy One) said to him (Moses): Just as I did to your hand (in Exod. 4:6): <small>AND WHEN HE WITHDREW IT</small> {<small>FROM HIS BOSOM</small>}, <small>BEHOLD IT WAS LEPROUS, &lt; AS WHITE &gt; AS SNOW</small>; so will I do to him (in II Chron. 26:20–21). Therefore (in Lev. 8:3): <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>.

Siman 16

(Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>…. He said to him: Where?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 2:12; see Lev. R. 10:9; cf. Gen. R. 5:7.</i> He said unto him: Unto the door of the Tent of Meeting. Moses our Master said to him: Sovereign of the World, &lt; there are &gt; sixty myriads of adults and sixty myriads of young people. How will I have them stand at the opening of the Tent of Meeting? &lt; The area is &gt; only the size of a field requiring of two seahs of seed; yet you are saying (in Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>. The Holy One said to him: Are you surprised about this command? Are the heavens not like a cataract on the eye? For I made them &lt; to stretch &gt; from one end of the world to the other, [as stated] (in Is. 40:22): <small>WHO HAS STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN</small> [<small>AND SPREAD THEM OUT LIKE A TENT TO DWELL IN</small>]. And also in the world to come I will do likewise for Zion. How will all those populations<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> from the first Adam until the dead rise &lt; have room to &gt; stand? Then they are going to say (in Is. 49:20): <small>THE PLACE IS TOO CROWDED FOR ME; MAKE ROOM FOR ME TO DWELL</small>. What shall I do for them? I shall enlarge it, as stated (in Is. 54:2): <small>ENLARGE THE SITE OF YOUR TABERNACLE</small>? From where do you learn so? From Mount Sinai. When the Holy One appeared upon it, what is written (in Ps. 68:18 [17])? <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE MYRIADS, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS; &lt; THE LORD IS AMONG THEM ON SINAI</small> &gt;…. R. Avdimi of Haifa said: I have learned in my Mishnah: When the Holy One appeared on Mount Sinai to give the Torah, twenty-two thousand chariots came down with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 12:22; <i>PR</i> 21:7; Exod. R. 29:2.</i> R. Berekhyah [the Priest] said that the Holy One foresaw that none would remain in their teaching (literally: their water) except the tribe of Levi. He therefore came down &lt; with a number &gt; corresponding to the camp of the Levites (according to Numb. 22:39). R. Jannay said: If so, how is it that <small>THE CHARIOTS</small> (rt.: <i><small>RKB</small></i>) <small>OF GOD ARE MYRIADS</small>. It is simply that twenty-two thousand chariots came down with the Holy One, with each and every chariot like the chariot which Ezekiel ben Buzi saw (Ezek. 1:19–21); yet it (i.e., Mt. Sinai) contained them. Indeed the event was a miracle. The Holy One said: Become wider (rt.: <small><i>RHB</i></small>) and longer to receive my children, &lt; who are &gt; faithful children. And so you find in the world to come, that the Holy One will widen (rt.: <small><i>RHB</i></small>) Jerusalem, as stated (in Ezek. 41:7): <small>AND IT BECAME</small> {<small>LONGER</small>} [<small>WIDER</small>] (rt.: <small><i>RHB</i></small>) <small>AS IT WOUND ABOUT HIGHER</small> (<i><small>LM</small>'<small>LH</small></i>)…, until it was rising to the heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>PRK</i> 20:7.

Thus it is stated (in Ps. 108:5 [4]) <small>FOR</small> [<small>YOUR FAITHFULNESS IS</small>] <small>GREAT, ABOVE</small> (<small>M'L</small>) {<small>THE HEAVENS</small> (<i><small>HShMYM</small></i>)} [<small>HEAVEN</small> (<i><small>ShMYM</small></i>)].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the Mss reading (in the braces) adds an extra <i><small>H</small></i> to the Masoretic Text. Thus the <small><i>H</i></small> appears at the end of <i><small>M‘L</small></i> to make <i><small>M‘LH</small></i>.</i> When it (i.e., Jerusalem) reaches the heavens, it says (in Is. 49:20): <small>THE PLACE IS TOO CROWDED FOR ME</small>…. Nevertheless, the Holy One raises it up from the heavens to the firmament, from the second &lt; heaven &gt; to the third, from the third to the fourth, from the fourth to the fifth, from the fifth to the sixth, and from the sixth to the seventh. R. Eleazar ben Jacob said: &lt; The elevation of Jerusalem continues &gt; until it reaches the throne of glory. But how are they (the Israelites) to ascend? The Holy One will bring clouds and will have them fly. Thus it is stated (in Is. 60:8): <small>WHO ARE THESE THAT FLY LIKE A CLOUD</small>? Then each and every one of the righteous will have a canopy (<i>huppah</i>) for himself. Thus it is stated (in Is. 4:5): <small>FOR THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE</small> [<small>WHOLE</small>] <small>SITE OF MOUNT ZION AND OVER ITS ASSEMBLY</small> [<small>&lt; A CLOUD AND SMOKE BY DAY AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT &gt;; FOR OVER &lt; ALL &gt; THE GLORY THERE SHALL BE A CANOPY</small> (<i>huppah</i>)]. When it reaches the throne of glory, the Holy One shall say to them: I and you shall walk through the world &lt; together &gt;, as stated (in Lev. 26:12): <small>AND I WILL WALK AMONG YOU</small>. The Holy One will dwell in the middle and the righteous shall &lt; proudly &gt; point him out. It is so stated (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US</small>…. It also says (in Ps. 48:15 [14]): <small>FOR THIS IS GOD, OUR GOD, FOR EVER AND EVER; HE WILL LEAD EVERMORE</small>. Because the nations say (in Deut. 32:37): <small>AND HE WILL SAY: WHERE ARE THEIR GODS</small>? Israel shall therefore say (in Ps. 48:15 [14]): <small>FOR THIS IS GOD, OUR GOD, FOR EVER AND EVER; HE WILL LEAD EVERMORE</small>.

(Lev. 9:1:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>…. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:5): <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>. Who is this?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:1; cf. above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 2:4.</i> Aaron, of whom it is said (in Lev. 8:33, 35): <small>AND YOU</small> (i.e., you and your sons) <small>SHALL NOT GO OUT FROM THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING FOR SEVEN DAYS &lt; …. &gt; AND YOU SHALL REMAIN AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING DAY AND NIGHT FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. Moses said to them: Observe mourning for seven days. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOU SHALL OBSERVE THE CHARGE OF THE LORD</small>. Moses said to them: Observe <small>THE CHARGE OF THE LORD</small>, for so did the Holy One observe seven days of mourning before he brought the flood. Where is it shown that he mourned? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:6): <small>THEN THE LORD REGRETTED THAT HE HAD MADE HUMANITY ON THE EARTH</small>, [<small>AND HE WAS GRIEVING IN HIS HEART</small>]. <small>HE WAS GRIEVING</small> can only mean "he mourned," for so it says concerning David (in II Sam. 19:3): <small>AND THE VICTORY</small> [<small>ON THAT DAY</small>] <small>WAS TURNED INTO MOURNING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE</small> [<small>ON THAT DAY THEY HEARD IT BEING SAID</small>:] <small>THE KING WAS GRIEVING OVER HIS SON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 2:4; Gen. R. 27:4.</i> So also Ezra said to Israel, when they were weeping, each one for his brother and each one for his child (in Neh. 8:10): <small>GO, EAT CHOICE FOODS AND DRINK SWEET DRINKS</small>…. <small>DO NOT BE GRIEVING, FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE WAS GRIEVING IN HIS HEART</small>. At that time the Holy One observed the seven days of mourning, before he brought the flood. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:10): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER SEVEN DAYS</small> [<small>THAT THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD CAME UPON THE EARTH</small>]. And so Moses was saying to Aaron the Priest and to his sons: Just as the Holy One mourned over his world before he brought the flood, so &lt; you are to &gt; observe the &lt; required &gt; mourning before he touches (i.e., harms) you. So they observed &lt; the mourning &gt;, but they did not know for what reason they were observing it. Why? (Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL; AND A WISE HEART SHALL KNOW &lt; THERE IS &gt; A TIME OF JUDGMENT</small>.

Siman 2

[(Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>.] This is Moses, to whom the Holy One had already said (in Exod. 29:43): <small>AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION</small><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This translation leaves in doubt who or what is sanctified. A more traditional translation would read: IT (i.e., the door of the Tabernacle) <small>SHALL BE SANCTIFIED</small>.</i> <small>THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. &lt; In other words, &gt; I (the Holy One) will be sanctified there <small>THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Now Moses ministered during the seven days of priestly ordination but was afraid, saying: Perhaps divine judgment will strike him (i.e., Aaron). Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Still he did not act but said to Aaron: Observe seven days of mourning, for so the Holy One has told me (in Lev. 8:35): <small>FOR SO I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED</small>. When they had observed the seven days of mourning and &lt; when &gt; the eighth day had come, Nadab and Abihu went in to make an offering (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>). Divine judgment struck them, and they were destroyed by fire. It is so stated (in Lev. 10:2): <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM, SO THAT THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Moses came and said to Aaron (in Lev. 10:3): <small>THIS IS WHAT THE LORD SPOKE: THROUGH THOSE WHO ARE NEAR</small> (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>) <small>TO ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED</small>. Where did he speak? In the Sinai desert. (Exod. 29:43): <small>AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THE CHILDREN OFISRAEL, AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Ergo (in Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>….

(Lev. 9:1:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On this translation, See Jastrow, p. 373, s.v., <i><small>WYNY</small>’.</i></i> What is the meaning of &lt; the words &gt;, <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS</small> (rt.: <i><small>HLL</small></i>): <small>DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small> (<i><small>THWLW</small></i>, rt.: <i><small>HLL</small></i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This root can also mean “act with abandon” and is to be taken in that sense here. So also in the parallel, <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:2. For another interpretation of the word, see Lev. R. 20:2.</i> &lt; The verse refers &gt; to whoever sings in a Mahanaim dance (<i><small>MHWLH</small></i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As in Cant. 7:1 [6:13]. In comparing <i><small>THWLW</small></i> and <i><small>MHWLH</small></i>, the midrash assumes that both words come from the root <i><small>HLL</small></i> and ignores the fact that in the first case the <small><i>H</i></small> is a <i>he</i> while in the second case the <small><i>H</i></small> is a <i>het.</i></i> And so it says (in Jud. 21:21): <small>TO DANCE</small> (<i><small>LHWL</small></i>) <small>IN THE DANCES</small>.
{Because no happiness endures for a mortal,} (Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small> (rt.: <i><small>HLL</small></i>). Why? The one who is happy today shall not be happy tomorrow; and the one who is depressed today shall not be depressed tomorrow. And so it says (in Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small> (rt.: <i><small>HLL</small></i>)….<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 26:2–3.</i> Are you willing to understand that even the happiness of the Holy One did not endure? When? When the Holy One created his world. He was very happy, as stated (in Ps. 104:31): <small>MAY THE LORD BE HAPPY IN HIS WORKS</small>. It also says (in Gen. 1:31): <small>THEN GOD SAW EVERYTHING WHICH HE HAD MADE; AND BEHOLD, IT WAS VERY GOOD</small>. &lt; These verses are &gt; to teach you that the Holy One found pleasure in and took pride in his works. Then he gave the first Adam an easy commandment, but he did not fulfill it. Immediately he rendered him a verdict<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis.</i></i> &lt; of death &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE, AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. So he, as it were, did not remain in his happiness but said: I created everything only for the human, and now he dies. What pleasure is there for me? [Now surely if the Holy One] did not remain &lt; happy &gt;, how much the less shall the children of Adam &lt; remain happy &gt;! [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]
How happy Abraham was! He was blessed in the world, magnified, slew some kings, and handed over heaven and earth to the Holy One. Also when the Holy One gave him a son at age one hundred, he circumcised him and reared him. Then finally he was told (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY CHILD</small>…., <small>&lt; AND GO UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH, &gt; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING</small>. So he made a three-day journey, as stated (in Gen. 22:4): <small>ON THE THIRD DAY</small>…. When he returned from Mount Moriah, he buried Sarah. He did not find a place to bury her until he bought one for four hundred silver shekels. Then after that, old age came upon him. Now surely if such was the case with Abraham the Righteous, how much the more is it the case with the rest of the children of Adam!
{Isaac did not remain in his happiness.} [In the case of Isaac also, how happy he was!] The Holy One saved him from the sword and from {burning} [the fire] {and from the men of Gerar}. He also delivered him from the men of Gerar and informed them [about who he was, so that they came to him]. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:26, 28): <small>THEN ABIMELECH CAME UNTO HIM FROM GERAR</small> […. <small>AND THEY SAID: WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE LORD IS WITH YOU</small>.] But he did not remain in his happiness. Rather (according to Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE</small>. So just as &lt; this loss of happiness &gt; happened in the case of Isaac, (according to Gen. 22:2) the burnt offering of the Holy One, how much the more does it happen in the case of the wicked! [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]
Jacob was the first-born of the Holy One, as stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>. How happy he was! He saw a ladder, and (according to Gen. 28:12) <small>THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING</small>, as they looked at him with the Holy One standing above it. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:13): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD UPON IT</small>…. Then he went to Laban, fled from Esau, became Laban's servant for twenty years, and in the end became wealthy, sired children, and returned in peace. He also met Esau, was saved from him, and paid his vow. But in the end he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW DINAH &lt; THE DAUGHTER WHOM LEAH HAD BORNE TO JACOB &gt; WENT OUT</small>…, &lt; and was raped &gt;. There also came upon him the trouble over Joseph. Now surely if Jacob the Righteous, one to whom the Holy One had said: In whom I will be glorified, as stated (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>, did not remain in his happiness, how much the less will the wicked &lt; so remain &gt;! [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]
How happy Joshua was! He slew thirty-one kings, gave Israel the land to possess, and distributed it. In addition all Israel gave him a &lt; helping &gt; hand and said (in Josh. 1:18): <small>ANYONE WHO DISOBEYS YOUR COMMAND</small>… <small>&lt; SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH</small> &gt;. &lt; Such an honor was &gt; something of which Moses our master was not worthy. Still he (i.e., Joshua) did not remain in his happiness but died childless. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.
How happy Eli was, when he was king, chief justice, and high priest! It is so stated (in I Sam. 1:9): <small>NOW ELI</small> [<small>THE PRIEST</small>] <small>WAS SITTING ON THE THRONE BY THE DOORPOST OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD</small>. [<small>NOW ELI THE PRIEST WAS SITTING ON THE THRONE</small>, because he was king. &lt; He was &gt; <small>BY THE DOORPOST OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD</small>, because he was chief justice]. Still he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to I Sam. 4:18): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN HE</small> (i.e., a messenger) <small>MENTIONED THE ARK OF</small> {<small>THE LORD</small>} [<small>OF GOD</small>], <small>HE</small> (i.e., Eli) <small>FELL BACKWARD FROM OFF THE THRONE</small>…. Moreover, his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas died. So just as this &lt; shift in fortune &gt; {happens with the righteous ones} [happened with Eli the Righteous], how much the more &lt; does it happen with &gt; the wicked! It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.
You find neither man nor woman who saw joys like Elisheba bat Amminadab, [the wife of Aaron, as stated (in Exod. 6:23): <small>AND AARON TOOK FOR A WIFE ELISHEBA BAT AMMINADAB</small>.]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 26:2; <i>Zev.</i> 102a; below, <i>Tanh</i>.

Rather, when two of her sons went in to offer sacrifice, (according to Lev. 10:2) <small>FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM, SO THAT THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.
And so Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>.

He went up to the attic. &lt; There &gt; a snake &lt; from &gt; among the jars bit him, and he died. His father remained with those who were reclining &lt; at his table &gt;. So he delayed and did not come. &lt; Finally, &gt; his father said: Let me go up and see what my son is doing. His father went up &lt; and &gt; found him cast down dead among the jars. What did that saint do? He waited by himself until the guests had eaten and drunk sufficiently. When they had finished, he said: You came to say a bridegrooms' blessing over my son. Say a mourners' blessing over him. You came to bring my son to the wedding canopy. Bring him to &lt; his &gt; grave. R. Zakkay of Kabul said (in the words of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>.

Siman 5

(Lev. 9:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY MOSES CALLED &lt; AARON AND HIS SONS</small> &gt;…. Our masters have said: All those days when Moses was in the thorn bush, the Holy One said to him: Go on my mission; but he was saying (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. By your life I am paying you back. Some day soon, when that Tabernacle is being made, you will be thinking privately that you should serve in the high priesthood; but I am telling you: Call Aaron to serve. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 9:1): <small>MOSES CALLED AARON AND HIS SONS</small>. There is a calling which is for abundance [and there is a calling for famine. Where is it shown &lt; that there is a calling &gt; for abundance?] Where it is stated (in Ezek. 36:29): <small>I WILL CALL FOR THE GRAIN AND INCREASE IT</small>. And where is it shown &lt; that there is a calling &gt; for famine? [Where it is stated] (in II Kings 8:1): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CALLED FOR A FAMINE</small>… <small>&lt; FOR SEVEN YEARS</small> &gt;. There is a calling for greatness, as stated (in Lev. 9:1): <small>MOSES CALLED &lt; AARON</small> &gt;. Moses said to him: the Holy One has told me to ordain you as high priest. Aaron said to him: You have labored on the Tabernacle; so shall I be made high priest? He said to him: By your life, even though you are being made high priest, it is as if I were being made &lt; high priest &gt;;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Exod. 1:24.</i> for just as you were glad for me in my greatness, so I am glad for you in your greatness. Now when was he glad for him? When the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): <small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>. The Holy One said to him: Go, keep this commandment. Moses said to him (in Exod. 4:10 &amp; 13): <small>PRAY</small> (<i>bi</i>) <small>LORD</small>, you are doing me wrong (<i>biya</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>bia</i>. On this interpretation of the verse, see above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 1:18.</i> My brother is older than I; yet I am going ahead of him. The Holy One said to him: [By your life], you have spoken rightly; nevertheless (according to Exod. 4:14), <small>WHEN HE SEES YOU HE WILL BE GLAD IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: The Holy One said to him: That heart which is glad for his brother's greatness shall have those precious stones (of Exod. 28:17–21) laid upon it. Therefore, all those seven days that Moses was busy in the Tabernacle, he was sprinkling the blood and performing the sacrificial burning of the choice pieces. The Holy One said to them: What do you think? That you are high priest? Call your brother so that he may serve as high priest. Ergo (in Lev. 9:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY MOSES CALLED</small> [<small>AARON AND HIS SONS, AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>]. Why <small>THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>? In order to promote him in the presence of the elders. The Holy One said to him: Call the elders and ordain him in their presence, lest Israel say that he became high priest on his own. Therefore (in Lev. 9:1): <small>AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.

(Lev. 9:2:) <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO AARON; TAKE A BULLOCK &lt; OF THE HERD FOR A SIN OFFERING</small> &gt;. Why was it not told him &lt; to take &gt; a bull instead of a bullock?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:4.</i> He said to him: Because through the bullock (of Exod. 32) the priesthood was shaken in your hand, through a bullock it is being established in your hand. And not only that, but lest Israel say there are sins &lt; clinging &gt; to them from the deed of the bullock, for that reason he said they should offer a bullock &lt; for a sin offering &gt;. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 9:3): <small>AND YOU SHALL SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: TAKE A MALE GOAT FOR A SIN OFFERING AND A BULLOCK</small>…. &lt; These things were said &gt; so that they would know that they had been forgiven for the deed of the calf. The Holy One said to them: In this world they have been forgiven through offerings, but in the world to come I will wipe away their sins without an offering. It is so stated (in Is. 43:25): I, <small>EVEN I, WILL PARDON</small><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>mohel</i>; cf. the Masoretic Text which reads <i>moheh</i> (“wipe away.”</i> <small>YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS FOR MY OWN SAKE AND WILL NOT REMEMBER YOUR SINS</small>.

(Lev. 10:8–9:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO AARON</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>. Why did he give a commandment concerning wine?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. R. 3:5; Lev. R. 12:1; cf. Numb. R. 10:2; M. Prov. 23.</i> Because anyone who drinks wine will have boils, sores, shame, and reproach come upon him. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 23:29–35): <small>WHO HAS WOE? WHO HAS SORROW? WHO HAS CONTENTIONS? WHO HAS TALK? WHO HAS UNEXPLAINED SORES? WHO HAS REDNESS OF EYES? THOSE WHO TARRY OVER WINE. DO NOT STARE AT WINE WHEN IT IS RED, &lt; WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR TO THE CUP,… &gt; IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE; &lt; … &gt; YOUR EYES WILL SEE STRANGE THINGS; &lt; …. &gt; YOU WILL BE LIKE ONE WHO LIES DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA, &lt; …. &gt; THEY STRUCK ME, BUT I FELT NO HURT</small>. (Vs. 29:) <small>WHO HAS WOE? WHO HAS SORROW</small>? [&lt; means: &gt; About whom do they say: Woe? <small>WHO HAS CONTENTIONS</small>?] &lt; means: &gt; About whom do they say {that they are masters of} [that he is a master of] quarrels. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS TALK</small>?] &lt; means: &gt; And about whom do they talk? {To whom do they talk?} (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS UNEXPLAINED SORES</small>? &lt; means: &gt; Whom [do they say] has boils on his face? [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS REDNESS OF EYES</small> ('<i>ayin</i>)?] &lt; means: &gt; And about whom do they say that his eyes ('<i>ayin</i>) are bleary and red from wine? About whom do they say all these evils? (Vs. 30:) <small>THOSE WHO TARRY OVER WINE</small>. (Vs. 31:) <small>DO NOT STARE AT WINE WHEN IT IS RED</small>. Its end is blood. It is fine on the outside and bad on the inside; so never say that it is beautiful on the inside just as [it appears] on the outside (according to ibid., cont.:), <small>WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR</small> ('<i>ayin</i>) <small>TO THE CUP</small> (<i>kos</i>). &lt; This is the oral text (the <i>qere</i>). &gt; The written text (<i>ketiv</i>) &lt; says: &gt; <small>TO THE PURSE</small> (<i>kis</i>). The drunkard sets his eye on the cup, but the shopkeeper &lt; sets his eye &gt; on the purse.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 23:31): <small>WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR TO THE CUP</small>. When one sees his comrade drinking, he says: Pour one for me to drink. Then he drinks and defiles himself in dung and urine. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE/IT<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In the Biblical context it is the wine that goes down smoothly.</i> GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>. He ends in selling all the objects in his house and all his useful implements. Thus he {has the use of} [is left with] no clothes and no useful implements for the house, so that &lt; he is left &gt; {without a utensil} [with nothing]. So from &lt; having &gt; everything, <small>HE GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Yoma 74b–75a.</i>
Another interpretation (of Prov. 23:31): <small>HE/IT GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>. In the end he declares transgressions permissible and makes them {a common like something accessible &lt; to all &gt;} [something accessible &lt; to all &gt; like a common]. He converses with a woman in the market place where he talks obscenely and says evil things in a drunken state without being ashamed, because he is confused and knows neither what he is saying nor what he is doing. (Prov. 23:32:) <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>. When the snake bites a person, he does not feel it for an time; but after he goes home, &lt; the poison in &gt; the wound permeates him. <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>, most certainly like a snake. Just as in the case of the snake, &lt; the Holy One &gt; cursed the land on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 3:17): <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>; so in the case of wine, a third of the world was cursed on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 9:24–25): <small>THEN NOAH AWOKE FROM HIS WINE</small>…, [<small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As Enoch Zundel explains in his commentary on <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:5, Canaan’s curse comes through his father Ham, upon whom the curse actually fell. Since Ham represented a third of Noah’s sons, a third of the world came from him. So also Numb. R. 10:2.</i> Ergo (in Prov. 23:32): <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>…. (Vs. 33:) <small>YOUR EYES WILL SEE STRANGE THINGS</small>. See what wine causes one who drinks it! It causes him to serve idols. So it says (in Is. 28:7): <small>THESE ALSO REEL WITH LIQUOR AND STAGGER WITH STRONG DRINK</small>. What is the meaning of {<small>REEL</small>?} [<small>THESE</small>? &lt; These of &gt; which they spoke] (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:6): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND ROSE UP TO</small> {<small>PLAY</small>} [<small>TO ENGAGE IN AMOROUS SPORT</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Gen. 2:21.</i> &lt; It was &gt; because of wine that they said (in Exod. 32:4) <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. Therefore (in Prov. 23:33): <small>AND YOUR HEART WILL SPEAK DECEITFUL THINGS</small>. Thus it causes four things: idolatry, uncovering of nakedness, shedding of blood, and evil speech. See how strong wine is! So it is written (in Hab. 2:5): <small>AND MOREOVER, WINE IS TREACHEROUS</small>. It is also written (in Prov. 21:24): <small>A SCORNER AND ARROGANT ONE, INSOLENT IS HIS NAME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In the Masoretic Text <small>SCORNER</small> and <small>INSOLENT</small> are reversed.</i> Now <small>INSOLENT</small> must mean idolatry. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 119:21): <small>YOU REBUKE THE CURSED INSOLENT ONES</small>. Moreover, <small>INSOLENT ONES</small> must &lt; also &gt; refer to the uncovering of nakedness. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 86:14): <small>O GOD, INSOLENT ONES HAVE RISEN UP OVER AGAINST ME</small>….; and it says (in Ps. 19:14 [13]): <small>ALSO KEEP YOUR SERVANT FROM INSOLENT ONES</small>. Moreover, when one drinks and transgresses, he sees the whole world as a ship. It is so stated (in Prov. 23:34): <small>YOU WILL BE LIKE ONE WHO LIES DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA</small>. When he lies down they smite him, but he does not feel it. Thus it is stated (in vs. 35): <small>THEY STRUCK ME, BUT I FELT NO HURT; THEY BEAT ME, BUT I DID NOT KNOW IT</small>. So when he is unknowing and unashamed, he uncovers himself. Then afterwards he returns and seeks it (i.e., wine). [Thus it is stated] (ibid.): <small>WHEN I WAKE UP, I SEEK IT YET AGAIN</small>.
{Isaiah said:} See how evil is the end of those who drink wine. [Isaiah said] (in Is. 5:11): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO PURSUE STRONG DRINK; WHO REMAIN BEHIND IN THE EVENING FOR WINE TO INFLAME THEM</small>. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as wine causes such &lt; evils &gt;, it is right for me to command the priests not to drink wine when they minister before me? Ergo (in Lev. 10:9:) <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>.
Solomon said (in Prov. 23:20): <small>DO NOT BE AMONG THOSE WHO IMBIBE WINE</small>. Do not cause yourself to drink &lt; wine (<i><small>YYN</small></i>), which implies &gt; seventy. Then you would face seventy and fall into the hands of death. <i>Y</i> (= 10) plus <i>Y</i> (= 10), for a subtotal of 20, plus <i>N</i> (= 50) results in seventy.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 38a.</i> So you would face seventy &lt; members of &gt; the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Synedrion</i>.</i> and cause your own death. See what is written (in Deut. 21:18–19): <small>IF ONE HAS A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>…, <small>HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SHALL TAKE HOLD OF HIM &lt; AND BRING HIM OUT UNTO THE ELDERS OF HIS TOWN</small> &gt;…. Then the sentence shall be passed over him; <small>AND</small> (in vs. 21) [<small>ALL THE PEOPLE OF HIS OWN TOWN</small>] <small>SHALL STONE HIM</small> [<small>TO DEATH</small>] <small>WITH STONES</small>. Why? Because he is (according to vs. 20) <small>A GLUTTON AND A DRUNKARD</small>. So Solomon has said (in Prov. 23:20): <small>DO NOT BE AMONG THOSE WHO IMBIBE WINE, WHO GORGE THEMSELVES ON MEAT</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See also Prov. 23:22, which adds an admonition to obey parents.</i> lest you bring stoning upon yourself, the most weighty of the executions.
R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: In the Hebrew language the name &lt; for wine &gt; is <i><small>YYN</small></i>, and in the Aramaic language its name is <i><small>HMR</small></i>. By gematria<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>geometria</i> or <i>grammateis</i>.

The wine enters into each and every member, so that the body becomes weakened and knowledge becomes confounded. When wine enters, knowledge departs. And so Eleazar haQappar has taught: Wine (<i><small>YYN</small></i>), with a numerical value of seventy enters; and secrets (<i><small>SWD</small></i>), with a numerical value of seventy,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i><small>S</small></i> (= 60), <i><small>W</small></i> (= 6), and <i><small>D</small></i> (= 4) add up to 70.</i> depart.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 38a, which attributes the teaching to R. Hiyya.</i> Therefore, the High Priest was commanded not to drink wine during the time of the service, lest it confound his knowledge; for he preserves the Torah (and preserves the service) and the knowledge. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 2:6): <small>THE TRUE TORAH WAS IN HIS MOUTH, AND NO INJUSTICE WAS FOUND ON HIS LIPS</small>. It also says (in vs. 7): <small>FOR THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE</small>. Therefore the Holy One commanded Aaron (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>…. [Moreover &lt; this injunction includes &gt; not only yourself, but (ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR CHILDREN AS WELL</small>. And] do [not] think that I may have commanded you &lt; only &gt; for the past in the beginning at a time when the Temple was standing and you were ministering in it, since it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE TENT OF WITNESS</small>…. [Rather,] you shall also keep yourselves from wine forever, as stated (ibid., cont.:): <small>IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOREVER THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS</small>. Therefore, keep yourselves from wine, because wine is a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion</i>.</i> of a curse. In the case of Noah, what is written about him (in Gen. 9:21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK</small>. What is written (in vs. 25)? <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Therefore (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>.

Siman 9

Blessed is the one who does not have a passion for wine, for you find such to be the case with the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, in that their ancestor had commanded and told them not to drink wine. But what was his reason for not drinking wine? It is simply that he had heard Jeremiah prophesying that the temple would be destroyed. He said to them: From now on you are to be in mourning. (Jer. 35:7:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT BUILD A HOUSE</small>, [<small>SOW SEED</small>,] <small>PLANT A VINEYARD, OR OWN SUCH THINGS; BUT YOU SHALL DWELL IN TENTS ALL</small> {<small>THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE</small>} [<small>ALL YOUR DAYS</small>]. Now they had observed the commandments of their ancestor; but when Jeremiah was prophesying to Israel &lt; and &gt; telling them to repent, they were not doing so. The Holy One said to Jeremiah: You are telling them to repent, and they are not doing so. Now in the case of the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, when their ancestor gave them a simple commandment, they observed it; but when I tell Israel to repent, they do not observe &lt; my commandment &gt;. It is so stated (in Jer. 35:14): <small>THE</small> {<small>WORD</small>} [<small>WORDS</small>] <small>OF JONADAB BEN RECHAB HAVE BEEN UPHELD. HE COMMANDED HIS CHILDREN NOT TO DRINK WINE, AND TO THIS DAY THEY HAVE NOT DRUNK IT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE</small> {<small>OBSERVED</small>} [<small>OBEYED</small>] <small>THE COMMANDMENTS OF THEIR ANCESTOR. BUT I SPOKE</small> {<small>TO YOU</small>} [<small>UNTO YOU</small>] {<small>FROM EARLY MORNING TO LATE EVENING</small>} [<small>CONSTANTLY</small>], <small>AND YOU DID NOT HEARKEN UNTO ME</small>. What is written there? The Holy One said to Jeremiah: Say to them: By your life, whereas you have heeded this commandment, your lineage shall never disappear from before me, even as it is written (in vs. 19): <small>THEREFORE, THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [<small>OF HOSTS, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>]: <small>SOMEONE BELONGING TO JONADAB BEN RECHAB SHALL NOT</small> {<small>EVER</small>} <small>BE CUT OFF</small> [<small>FROM STANDING</small>] <small>BEFORE ME FOR EVER</small>. He therefore enlightens them concerning wine (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>. Isaiah said (in Is. 24:11): <small>THERE IS A CRY OVER WINE IN THE STREETS; ALL GLADNESS IS OBSCURED</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ALL GLADNESS IS OBSCURED</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RB</small></i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 11:8.</i> &lt; That &gt; all gladness has become dark, just as you say (in Gen. 1:5):<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Also Gen. 1:8, 13, 19, 23, 31.</i> <small>AND THERE WAS EVENING</small> ('<small>RB</small>).

Thus it is written (in Ps. 48:3 [2]): <small>BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &lt; EVEN MOUNT ZION</small> &gt;. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world wine is a sign of a curse, but in the world to come I will make it into fresh grape juice. Thus it is stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE</small>….

(Lev. 11:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>…. {It is written (in Hab. 3:6):} [This text is related (to Hab. 3:6):] <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:6, below Deut. 11:3 and the note there.</i> It is simply that, when the Holy One wanted to give the Torah, he arose and measured (<i><small>MDD</small></i>) the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Bahodesh</i> 1, 5; Lev.

Another interpretation (of Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>, because he wanted to return the world to the measurements of his waters, when the nations did not want to accept the Torah. If it had not been for Israel accepting it, the world would have returned to the measurements of his waters. &lt; It is &gt; just as you say (in Is. 40:12): <small>WHO HAS MEASURED THE WATERS IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND</small>? But when Israel accepted it, the earth was still, as stated (in Ps. 76:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH WAS AFRAID AND WAS STILL</small>. So it is from there (i.e., from Sinai) that the gentiles received their judgement.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis</i>.</i> (Hab. 3:6, cont.:) <small>HE LOOKED AND MADE NATIONS TREMBLE</small> (rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>). How did he make &lt; them &gt; tremble (<i>hittir</i>, rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>)? R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Johanan: He proscribed (<i>dam hittir</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: he permitted their blood &lt; to be shed &gt;.</i> them {seven peoples}, as stated (in Is. 60:12): <small>AND THE NATIONS SHALL BE DESTROYED</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay says: {He proscribed (<i>hittir dam</i>) them {seven peoples} and their possessions.} [Otherwise, compare what is said (in Numb. 13:16): <small>TO SPY OUT</small> (<i>latur</i>) <small>THE LAND</small>.] R. Aha said: He had them jump into Gehinnom, for it is stated (in Lev. 11:21): <small>&lt; KNEE JOINTS ABOVE THEIR FEET &gt; TO LEAP</small> (rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>) <small>WITH UPON THE GROUND</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Deut. 11:3.</i> R.

R. Tanhum ben Hanila'i said: He permitted (<i>hittir</i>) what was forbidden, abhorrent creatures and creeping things. Why? The matter is comparable to a physician who went to visit two patients.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 13:2.</i> He saw that one of them was in danger. He said to the children of his house: Tell him to eat whatever he wants. He saw the other, who was recovering. He said to the children of his house: Such and such food he may eat; such and such food he may not eat. They said to the physician: What &lt; difference &gt; did you see between the two of them [that you said to the one who was in danger: Let him eat whatever he wants, but said to the one who was recovering: Such and such food he may eat; such and such food he may not eat]. The physician said to them: When I saw that the one was dying, I said: Give him &lt; any food &gt; because he is going to die; [but let the other one watch himself, because there is life in him]. So also the Holy One has permitted (<i>hittir</i>) abhorrent creatures, creeping things, and all the transgressions for gentiles, who serve stars, because they are &lt; destined &gt; for Gehinnom. But in the case of Israel, because they are &lt; destined &gt; for life in paradise, he has said to them {(in Lev. 11:44): <small>AND BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY</small>.} (in Lev. 11:43): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MAKE YOURSELVES LOATHSOME</small>. [(Lev. 11:44): <small>AND BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY</small>.] This you may eat and this you may not eat. Why? Because they are alive, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. Ergo (in Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>; [<small>HE LOOKED AND PERMITTED</small> (rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>) <small>GENTILES &lt; WHAT IS FORBIDDEN</small> &gt;]…..<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">So R.

When he showed him the making of the menorah, Moses found it difficult.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Numb. 3:4.</i> The Holy One said to him: See, I am making it before you. What did the Holy One do? He showed him white fire, [red fire,] black fire, and green fire. Then from them he made the menorah, its bowls, its pomegranates, its blossoms, and the six branches. Then he said to him (in Numb. 8:4): <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH</small>. When the Holy One showed him with the finger, he nevertheless found it difficult. What did the Holy One do? He engraved it on the his hand. He said to him: Go down and make it just as I have engraved it on your hand. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> {<small>LIKE</small>} [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN</small>. But where is it shown that he engraved it on his hand? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 8:3): <small>HE STRETCHED OUT THE PATTERN OF A HAND</small>. Now <small>PATTERN</small> can only be for the making of the menorah, concerning which it is stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> {<small>LIKE</small>} [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN &lt; WHICH YOU ARE BEING SHOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN</small> &gt;. Even so, he found it difficult and said (in Exod. 25:31): <small>WITH DIFFICULTY</small> (<i><small>MQShH</small></i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">While this meaning, so understood by the midrash, is possible, a more usual English translation would read, <small>HAMMERED WORK</small>, or something similar.</i> [<small>WILL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>]. How difficult was it to make? The Holy One said to him: Cast the gold into the fire, and it will be made automatically. So it is stated: <small>WITH DIFFICULTY WILL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. [<small>BE MADE</small> (a reflexive form, in the niph'al) is what is written], &lt; i.e., &gt; was made of its own accord.
In reference to the moon (<i>yareah</i>), where is it shown &lt; that Moses had difficulty &gt;? Exod. [12:1–2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, SAYING: THIS MONTH</small> (<i>hodesh</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hodesh</i> also means “new moon.”</i> Observe and sanctify &lt; it &gt; like this. He showed him with a finger: <small>THIS MONTH</small>.
In reference to creeping things, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Lev. 11:29): <small>NOW THESE SHALL BE UNCLEAN FOR YOU FROM AMONG THE SWARMING THINGS WHICH SWARM ON THE EARTH</small>]. The Holy One caught each and every species, showed them to Moses, and said to him: This you may eat, and this you may not eat. [Thus it is stated] (in Lev. 11:2, 4:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>. [….<small>HOWEVER, THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.] Moreover, do not be surprised over &lt; this &gt; thing, since it is a fact that the Holy One showed all creatures to the first Adam, and he gave them names. After he had given names to all of them, the Holy One said to him: And I, what is my name? He said to him: It is Y____, because it is written (in Is. 42:8): <small>I AM Y____; THAT IS MY NAME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Numb. 6:12.</i> [This the name, which the first Adam gave me.] It is my name, which I have agreed upon &lt; for use &gt; between me and my creatures. So if in the case of the first Adam, the Holy One had the creatures pass before him; in the case of Moses, when the Holy One wanted to warn Israel about the unclean and about the clean, are you surprised that he showed him and said to him {(in Lev. 11:2–4): <small>THESE</small> &lt; … &gt; <small>YOU MAY EAT</small>. &lt; … &gt; <small>AND THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>?} [(in Lev. 11:2): <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>?] {One must not say.}

Siman 12

[(Lev. 11:2:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>.] The Holy One said [to him]: Warn Israel not to eat bad things, lest your &lt; evil &gt; drive lead you astray, saying that the Holy One has forbidden Israel from having good things. The Holy One said: Whatever I have forbidden you from having, I have permitted you to have &lt; something &gt; that corresponds to it<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Hul</i>. 109b; Lev.

So Rashi on <i>Hul</i>. 109a.</i> I have forbidden you &lt; another &gt; man's wife; I have permitted you a beautiful woman, as stated [(in Deut. 21:11–12): <small>AND WHEN YOU SEE AMONG THE CAPTIVES A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM YOU DESIRE TO TAKE FOR A WIFE, &lt; YOU SHALL BRING HER INTO YOUR HOUSE</small>…. &gt;] I have forbidden you a brother's wife; I have permitted her for you after his death, [as stated (in Deut. 25:5):] <small>HER BROTHER-IN-LAW SHALL HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH HER</small> [<small>AND TAKE HER FOR A WIFE</small>].

R. Bisna said in the name of R. Hiyya: What the Holy One forbade for cattle he permitted for game animals, and what he forbade for fowl he permitted for fish. How? He forbade the fat in the case of cattle; he permitted it in the case of game animals. He forbade the thigh muscle in the case of game animals; he permitted it in the case of fowl. He forbade blood in the case of fowl; he permitted it in the case of fish. And why all this? In order to give Israel a good reward for observing the commandments.
(II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. 18:31 [30]:) <small>AS FOR GOD, HIS WAY IS PERFECT</small>…; for all the ways of the Holy One are perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:8; Gen.

Will some such thing benefit him (i.e., the Holy One) or harm him? Or what does he care whether one eats what is unclean or eats what is clean? It is simply that (according to Prov. 9:12) <small>IF YOU ARE WISE, YOU ARE WISE FOR YOURSELF</small>; [<small>AND IF YOU SCOFF, YOU WILL BEAR IT ALONE</small>]. Thus, the commandments were given only to purify (rt.: <i><small>TsRP</small></i>) [mortals] through them, as stated (in II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. [18:31 [30], cont.): <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD IS PURE</small> (rt.: <i><small>TsRP</small></i>). Why? So that he might be a shield over you, [as stated] (ibid., cont.): <small>HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 11:2:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>.

Siman 13

Job said (in Job 14:4): <small>WHO CAN PRODUCE SOMETHING CLEAN OUT OF SOMETHING UNCLEAN? NO ONE</small>. After the Holy One permitted the cow and forbade the camel, who could declare clean or declare unclean?<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:8.</i> Who has done so? No one. Not a single person in the world. Come and see: Originally at the creation of the world, everything was permitted, as stated (in Gen. 9:3): <small>AS WITH THE GREEN GRASS, I HAVE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING</small>. Then after Israel stood by Mount Sinai, he increased Torah and commandments for them in order to give them a good reward. But if so, why did he not so command the first Adam? The Holy One said: When I ordained an easy commandment for him, he transgressed against it. How could he fulfill all these commandments? On the very day on which it was commanded, on that day he nullified and transgressed against them (sic).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:8, which reads here: “Transgressed against it.”</i> He was unable to remain obedient to the command for a single day.

In the seventh he blew breath into him, as stated (in Gen. 2:7): <small>AND HE BLEW INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE</small>. In the eighth he brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth he commanded him: Eat of this, and do not eat of that. In the tenth he sinned. In the eleventh he was judged. In the twelfth he was expelled. Thus you must conclude that he did not remain obedient to the commandment for even a single hour. R. Judah ben Pedayah said: Would that someone remove the dust from your eyes, O First Adam, you who could not persevere in your temptation for even a single hour, while here your children are keeping all the commandments which were given to them and persevering in them!<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Gen.

But in the case of the first Adam, it was told him: Eat of this, and do not eat of that. [It is so stated (in Gen. 2:16–17): <small>YOU MAY FREELY EAT OF ANY TREE IN THE GARDEN; BUT AS FOR THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE &lt; OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU MAY NOT EAT OF IT</small> &gt;…. ] He did not remain obedient to the commandment for a single hour. [Instead (according to Gen. 3:6), <small>THEN SHE ALSO GAVE SOME TO HER HUSBAND, AND HE ATE</small>.] But [when] your children were commanded to eat this and not to eat that, [they remained obedient to those &lt; commandments &gt;]. And &lt; this obedience is &gt; especially &lt; evident &gt; when someone from Israel takes a bovine, an ox, or a lamb, slaughters it ritually, skins it, washes it, and inspects its health. When it is found to be unfit, he holds back and does not eat it. Ergo (in II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. 18:31 [30], cont.): <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD IS PURE</small>. [For that reason, the first Adam was not given commandments, because it was revealed to the Holy One that he could not remain obedient to them; but in the case of Israel, when the Holy One gave them many commandments, they accepted them and said (in Exod. 24:7): <small>ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small>. He therefore warned them (in Lev. 11:2–4:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>…. <small>THESE, HOWEVER, YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.]

The Rabbis interpreted this mix to mean that Media produced a righteous as well as a wicked person (perhaps Haman and Mordecai or Haman and Darius the Mede of Dan. 11:1). According to R. Judah b. R.

(Lev. 12:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>. This text is related (to Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>! In regard to this verse, Job spoke it when the afflictions had come upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4:1.</i> He said: <small>O THAT I WERE</small> [<small>AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD</small>], and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother's belly! <small>AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>! &lt; These words &gt; teach that the infant is watched over while it is in its mother's belly.
[(Job 29:3:) <small>WHEN HIS LIGHT SHONE OVER MY HEAD</small>. From here you learn that the infant has light in its mother's belly.]
(Job 29:4:) <small>WHEN I WAS IN THE DAYS OF MY YOUTH</small> (<i>horef</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Horef</i> also means “winter.” Buber notes here that in the following simile, the infant in the womb is being protected in the womb as the winter rain protects the soil.</i> [<small>WHEN THE GOD'S COMPANY WAS OVER MY TENT</small>. These words teach about the infant.] Just as the rain is at work in the soil for it to become muddy, so the infant is muddy in its mother's womb. {<small>WHEN THE GOD'S COMPANY WAS OVER MY TENT</small>. These words teach about the infant.} Moreover, just as the infant stays muddy, [so is a person muddied] by sins, so that misfortunes come upon him. At that time &lt; Job &gt; said (in Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>, and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother's belly!

Another interpretation (of Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE, &lt; AND YOU HAVE LAID YOUR HAND UPON ME &gt;</small>. The text speaks of the first Adam.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4:1; cf. Gen. R. 8:1; 14:5; Lev. R. 14:1; M. Pss. 139:6.</i> [R. Johanan] said: It is written about him that there were two creations. There is a double <i>Y</i> (i.e., a double <i>yod</i> in Gen. 2:7): <small>THE LORD GOD FORMED</small> (<i><small>YYTsR</small></i>) <small>THE HUMAN</small>. One formation is in this world, and one is for the world to come. But in the case of cattle, wild beasts, and birds, for them &lt; only &gt; one formation is written (without a double <i>Y</i> in Gen. 2:19): <small>SO OUT OF THE EARTH THE LORD GOD FORMED</small> (<i><small>YTsR</small></i>) <small>ALL THE WILD BEASTS OF THE FIELD &lt; AND ALL THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS &gt;</small>. It therefore says (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish says: <small>BEHIND</small> (in the sense of what comes afterwards) &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the first day. What is the reason? {Resh Laqish said} [Thus has R. Simeon ben Laqish said] (in Gen. 1:2): <small>AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS</small>. This <small>SPIRIT</small> was the soul of the first Adam. It therefore says (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE. BEHIND</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the first day. R. Eleazar ben Pedat says: <small>BEHIND</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day. How so? Because the Holy One created six things on the sixth day. They were these: (1) The soul, (2) wild beasts, (3) cattle, (4) creeping things, (5) beasts of the earth, and (6) Adam and Eve. Now Adam's soul was created first, as stated (in Gen. 1:24): <small>LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL. LIVING SOUL</small> can only be the soul of Adam, since it is stated (in Gen. 2:7): <small>AND THE HUMAN</small> (<i>adam</i>) <small>BECAME A LIVING SOUL</small>. Hence, <small>BEFORE</small> &lt; refers &gt; to the &lt; first &gt; event of the sixth day, and <small>BEHIND</small> &lt; refers &gt; to the sixth day, since &lt; the Holy One &gt; was occupied with him all of the sixth day. Ergo (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE. BEHIND</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &lt; refers &gt; to an event of the sixth day. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: What is the meaning of <small>BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>? Having two faces, male and female.

Then after it takes upon itself in its mother's belly all the commandments which are in the Torah, &lt; only &gt; after that it is born.

Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:2): <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<i><small>TsWR</small></i>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>. When flesh and blood fashions (rt.: <i><small>TsWR</small></i>) an image (rt.: <i><small>TsWR</small></i>), he (the fashioner) speaks, but his image does not speak. [Still, he] praises his image.

[Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:2:) <small>THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<i><small>TsWR</small></i>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>.] When flesh and blood wants to fashion an image, how many ingredients must he bring before he fashions it? But the Holy One fashions an image out of a single drop (of seminal fluid). Come and see the peacock<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>taos</i>.</i> in which there are three hundred sixty[-five] kinds of colors; yet it is created from a single drop of white stuff. Now you should not &lt; only &gt; speak about a bird, but also about a human being, who is fashioned from a single drop of white stuff. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>. [Ergo (in I Sam. 2:2): <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<i><small>TsWR</small></i>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>. Another interpretation: When a king of flesh and blood fashions a image, his image does not make &lt; another &gt; image; but when the Holy One fashions an image, his image does make &lt; another &gt; image, for it fashions the woman, and the woman bears an image like it. (Lev. 2:12:) <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>.]

Thus females are dependent (for procreation) upon the man; and the males, upon the woman. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>. R. Ayyevu said: The Holy One performs a miraculous act with a person. When a person is put in a furnace room<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kaminos</i> (“oven”). Here the word refers to the furnace room of a bathhouse.</i> for &lt; only &gt; a single day, is not his life struggling &lt; to survive &gt; because of it? But when an infant is put in its mother's belly for nine months,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to Lev.

When the person is put in a bath tub<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>embate.</i></i> for one day, does not his life fail because of it? But when the infant is put in its mother's womb for nine months, its life does not fail because of it. [Why? Because the Holy One is performing a miraculous act with it (i.e., with the infant).] Job said (in Job 36:3): <small>I WILL FETCH</small> ('<small><i>S</i></small>') <small>MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR</small>. Now Job saw the children of Adam with a woman ('<i><small>ShH</small></i>) giving birth to a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">‘<i><small>ShH</small></i> and ‘<i><small>S</small></i>’ are more alike in Hebrew than the transliterations show. In the unpointed text <i><small>S</small></i> (<i>sin</i>) and <i><small>Sh</small></i> (<i>shin</i>) are the same letter. Also a final <i><small>H</small></i> (<i>he</i>) sounds so much like a final ‘(<i>alef</i>) that Rabbinic Hebrew sometimes confuses the two. Thus the midrash understands Job 36:3 to mean that the <small>WOMAN</small> in Lev. 12:2 was Job’s <small>KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR</small>.</i> Also the ship (of Prov. 31:14) sails in the midst of the waters inch by inch.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The image suggests Prov. 31:14, according to which the heroic wife is <small>LIKE MERCHANT SHIPS; SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR</small>. So Enoch Zundel in his commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef</i>, on the parallel in <i>Tanh.</i>, Lev. 4:3.</i> Now he was surprised over these things and said (in Job 36:3): I (like the woman of Prov. 31:14) <small>WILL FETCH MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR</small>.

[Another interpretation (of Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>.] R.

Before the woman bears, she retains blood; after she gives birth, the blood departs to the breasts and becomes milk. Then the infant nurses on them. R.

When the <i>funda</i> {i.e., pouch}<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word means “moneybag”.</i> is full with its mouth down, the coins are scattered; but the woman has her <i>funda</i> &lt; with its opening &gt; down, and the fetus is retained. Another interpretation: An animal walks about with the fetus in the midst of its belly; but a woman walks about erect with the fetus in the midst of her belly, and the Holy One preserves it.

(Lev. 12:3): <small>AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED</small>. It is not written here that one lays out expenses &lt; over circumcision &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The added words are from the parallel in <i>Tanh.</i>, Lev. 4:5.</i> See how much Israel loves the commandments, how many expenses they lay out in order to observe them! The Holy One said: You make the commandments joyful; I am increasing your joy, as stated (in Is. 29:19): <small>THEN THE HUMBLE SHALL INCREASE THEIR JOY IN THE LORD</small>. Tyrannus Rufus the Wicked asked R. Aqiva: Which works are the more beautiful? Those of the Holy One or those of flesh and blood? He said to him: Those of flesh and blood are the more beautiful. Tyrannus Rufus the Wicked said to him: Look at the heavens and the earth. Are you able to make anything like them? R. Aqiva said to him: Do not talk to me about something which is high above mortals, things over which they have no control, but about things which are usual among the children of Adam. He said to him: Why do you circumcise? He said to him: I also knew that you were going to say this to me. I therefore anticipated &lt; your question &gt; when I said to you: A work of flesh and blood is more beautiful than one of the Holy One? Bring me wheat spikes and white bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qeluska’ot</i>, from the Gk.: <i>kollikes</i> (“long rolls of coarse bread”) or <i>kollikia</i> (the diminutive of <i>kollikes</i>).</i> [He said to him: The former is the work of the Holy One, and the latter is the work of flesh and blood.

Are not the latter more beautiful? Tyrannus Rufus said to him: Inasmuch as he finds pleasure in circumcision, why does no one emerge from his mother's belly circumcised? R. Aqiva said to him: And why does his umbilical cord come out on him? Does not his mother cut his umbilical cord? So why does he not come out circumcised? Because the Holy One only gave Israel the commandments in order to purify them. Therefore, David said (in II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. 18:31 [30]): {<small>EVERY</small>} <small>WORD OF</small> {<small>GOD</small>} [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>IS PURE</small>….

This text is related (to Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small> (<i><small>ShTP</small></i>)? R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R.

Rather (in vs. 11): <small>FOR HE REPAYS A PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS ACTIONS</small>, [<small>AND PROVIDES FOR ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS</small>]. He brings everything &lt; upon a person &gt; according to measure. R. Abbin the Levite said in the name of R.

Rather everything is with justice, as stated (in Ps. 75:8 [7]): [<small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES</small>]; <small>ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. The Holy One said to Job: Even with regard to the hair which is upon you, I have made a follicle for it and made a measure for it, as stated (in Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small> (i.e., <small>FOR THE HAIR</small>). There is a story about a certain priest who examined leprosy spots. When he became poor, he wanted to go abroad. He called his wife &lt; and &gt; said to her: Because people used to come to me to show their leprosy spots, come and let me teach you, so that you may examine the leprosy spots. If you see a person's hair with its follicle dried up, you will know that &lt; such a person &gt; is stricken, because for each and every hair the Holy One has created its own separate follicle [from which it drinks]. &lt; If &gt; its follicle dries up, the hair dries up. His wife said to him: But surely if for each and every hair the Holy One has created its own separate follicle [from which it drinks], in your case, since you are a human being, with so many hairs on you and with your children being supported<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i><small>PRHS</small></i>, perhaps related to the Gk. adj. <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> by you, is it not all the more certain that the Holy One will summon support for you?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Another interpretation (of Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small>? When the Holy One created the human, he created him in wisdom. How? If he had created him with a lot of water and a little blood, he would have become frail.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>asthenes</i>, i.e., “weak” or “sick.”</i> If he had created him with a lot of blood and a little water, he would have become a leper. &lt; He therefore created him with &gt; half water and half blood.

Because the verse says (in Is. 46:10) {<small>THE ONE WHO SAYS</small>} [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>; whoever hears this verse, says: perhaps there is tyranny on high.

(Eccl. 8:4:) <small>FOR A KING'S WORD IS SUPREME, AND WHO MAY SAY TO HIM: WHAT ARE YOU DOING</small>? It is customary, when a &lt; local &gt; ruler sits in judgement and wants to acquit or convict, for him to be afraid of one greater than himself, lest they put in an appeal<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Enqeliton</i>, from the Gk.: <i>ekkleton</i> (“appeal”) or <i>egkleton</i> (“accusation”).</i> to the imperial legate.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>comes</i>; Gk.: <i>komes</i>.</i> An imperial legate is afraid of a governor;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eparchos</i> (“governor”) or <i>huparchus</i> (“viceroy”).</i> a governor is afraid of the king; the king is afraid of you; but you, if you desire to acquit or convict, of whom are you afraid?

Thus it is stated (in Ps. 8:7 [6]): <small>YOU HAVE SET HIM AS RULER OVER THE</small> {<small>WORK</small>} [<small>WORKS</small>] <small>OF YOUR HANDS</small>…. (Hab. 1:7, cont.:) <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIM</small>. Thus when he sins, he brings upon himself torments from his &lt; own &gt; body. Why? Because his ways are not like the ways of flesh and blood. When &lt; a person of &gt; flesh and blood wants to punish his slaves, he brings {kneaders} [whips] and fetters, to punish them and cause them pain; but the Holy One is not like that. Rather it is from a person's whole body that he punishes and beats him. {Thus it is stated (in Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIM</small>.} [From where is it shown? From what we have read on the matter (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &lt; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY, HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO AARON THE PRIEST &gt;</small>…. ]

(Lev. 13:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small>…. This text is related (to Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>. &lt; This verse is able &gt; to teach you that the Holy One does not delight in convicting a person,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4:9.</i> as stated (in Ezek. 18:32): <small>FOR I DO NOT DELIGHT IN THE DEATH OF ONE WHO DIES</small>. In what does he delight? In vindicating (rt.: <i><small>TsDQ</small></i>) his people. [Thus it is stated (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &lt; SERVANT'</small>S <small>&gt; VINDICATION</small> (<i><small>TsDQ</small></i>)…,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This is the interpretation of the midrash and of the new <small>JPS</small> translation.</i> &lt; i.e. &gt; because of his people's vindication (<i><small>TsDQ</small></i>)] and not &lt; their &gt; conviction. So also you find that in the case of the first Adam, when he created him, he set him in the Garden of Eden. Then he gave him a command and said to him: Eat this, but do not eat from this, <small>FOR</small> (according to Gen. 2:17) <small>ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOU SHALL SURELY DIE</small>. &lt; When &gt; he transgressed, he brought a sentence<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis.</i></i> upon himself. &lt; Then &gt; the Sabbath came, and he acquitted him.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>pinnahu.</i> This word means “removed him” as well as “acquitted him.” In other words, Adam’s acquittal meant that his sentence was reduced from death to removal from the Garden. So M. Pss. 92:3.</i> He began to talk with him &lt; about &gt; whether he would repent? It is so stated (in Gen. 3:9): <small>THE LORD GOD CALLED UNTO THE HUMAN. THE LORD</small> can only mean the quality of mercy, as stated (in Exod. 34:6): <small>THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD</small>. For him he had the quality of mercy precede the quality of strict justice. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>, in that he does not delight in convicting a person. He began to talk (in Gen. 3:11–12): <small>WHO TOLD YOU &lt; THAT YOU WERE NAKED? DID YOU EAT FROM THE TREE &gt;</small>…? <small>THEN THE MAN SAID: THE WOMAN</small>…. He left Adam alone and began to talk with the woman, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD SAID TO THE WOMAN</small>…. But when he came to the serpent he did not talk with him. Instead he immediately gave him a sentence, as stated (in vss. 14–15): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, &lt; MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD &gt;</small>…. <small>I WILL PUT ENMITY &lt; BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN &gt;</small>…. &lt; Then &gt; he returned to the woman and said to her (in vs. 16): <small>I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOUR PAIN IN PREGNANCY</small>. And when he returned to the man, he did not convict him. Rather he intimated to him that he should repent. Where is it shown? R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Levi that he said to him (in vs. 19): <small>BY THE SWEAT OF YOUR BROW SHALL EAT BREAD, UNTIL YOU RETURN &lt; … &gt;. YOU RETURN</small> can only be an expression for repentance, since it is stated (in Hos. 14:2 [1]): <small>RETURN O ISRAEL, &lt; TO THE LORD YOUR GOD &gt;</small>. When &lt; Adam &gt; did not repent, he expelled him from the Garden of Eden, as stated [(in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND HE DROVE OUT THE MAN</small>. Ergo] (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Tanhuma bar Hanila'i in the name of R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Johanan: Before the Holy One stand only angels of peace and angels of mercy, but the angels of wrath are far from him. It is so stated (in Is. 13:5): <small>THEY COME FROM A FAR LAND FROM THE END OF THE HEAVENS, EVEN THE LORD AND THE WEAPONS OF HIS WRATH, TO RAVAGE THE WHOLE EARTH</small>. [Another interpretation] (of Ps. 5:5 [4], cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Johanan said: If you do not pursue evil, evil will not pursue you, nor will it dwell with you.

Siman 12

Another interpretation (of Ps. 5:5 [4], cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said in the name of R. Johanan: The name of the Holy One is not mentioned in connection with evil but only in connection with good. You know that it is so. When the Holy One created the light and the darkness and gave them names, &lt; Scripture &gt; mentioned his name in connection with the light but did not mention his name in connection with the darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 1:6.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:5): <small>AND GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY, AND THE DARKNESS HE CALLED NIGHT</small>. So also you find that, when he created Adam and Eve, &lt; Scripture &gt; mentioned his name in connection with them, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM</small>…; but when he cursed them, it did not mention his name in connection with them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:16–17): <small>AND UNTO THE WOMAN <i>HE</i> SAID</small>&lt; …. &gt; <small>AND UNTO ADAM <i>HE</i> SAID</small>&lt; …. &gt; Now if you say: &lt; Scripture &gt; mentioned &lt; his name &gt; in connection with the serpent when he cursed him, [since it is written (in Gen. 3:14): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE &lt; THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD</small>…. &gt;]; the sages have taught this: The Holy One has mentioned his name in connection with three things, even though they stood for evil:

        <br>In connection with the inciter, i.e., the serpent, when he incited the woman and said (in Gen. 3:5): <small>FOR GOD KNOWS &lt; THAT ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED &gt;</small>…. So because he incited, &lt; Scripture &gt; mentions his name in connection with &lt; the serpent &gt;.
        <br>In connection with one who transgresses the words of the sages, as is stated (in Jer. 11:3): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small>, [<small>THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>]: <small>CURSED IS THE ONE WHO DOES NOT HEED</small>….
        <br>In connection with one who makes flesh and blood his patron,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>patronus;</i> Gk.: <i>patronos</i> or <i>patron.</i></i> as stated (in Jer. 17:5): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: CURSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN A HUMAN BEING, WHO MAKES FLESH HIS STRENGTH AND WHOSE HEART TURNS FROM THE LORD</small>.
    
So also you find in the case of Noah, &lt; that Scripture used the name &gt; when he blessed his sons, as stated (in Gen. 9:26): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM</small>…; but when he cursed Canaan, [&lt; Scripture &gt; did not mention the name of the Holy One in connection with him], as stated (in vs. 25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>…. So also you find in the case of Elisha the Prophet, that when the king of Aram came to fight against Israel, he consulted with his servants and made <i>phossata</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>pittasim.</i> Buber believes that the word comes from the Greek, <i>pithos</i> (“wine jar”), which he misspells, <i>pidos.</i> Cf. the parallel version in <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, II Kings 230, which reads <i>patshin.</i> The present translation follows the suggestion of Jastrow, s.v. <i>pittas</i>, who emends the word to <i>possatin</i> (“ditches”), which comes from the Gk.: <i>phossata</i> or the Lat.: <i>fossata.</i></i> for them. He said: When Israel comes to fight against us, they will fall into the midst of the <i>phossata</i> {i.e., trenches}, as stated (in II Kings 6:8–9): <small>WHEN THE KING OF ARAM WAS FIGHTING AGAINST ISRAEL, HE CONSULTED WITH HIS SERVANTS, SAYING: MY CAMP SHALL BE IN SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE; BUT THE MAN OF GOD SENT UNTO THE KING OF ISRAEL</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>TAKE CARE NOT TO PASS</small> {<small>UNTO</small>} <small>THIS PLACE, BECAUSE THE ARAMAEANS ARE CAMPING THERE</small>. So the Holy One does nothing (according to Amos 3:7) <small>WITHOUT HAVING REVEALED HIS PURPOSE UNTO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>. When Israel passed by once and twice without falling, the king of Aram took notice and said to his servants (in II Kings 6:11): <small>WILL YOU NOT TELL ME WHICH OF US IS FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL</small>? His servants said to him (in vs. 12–14): <small>&lt; IT IS &gt; BECAUSE ELISHA, THE PROPHET THAT IS IN ISRAEL, TELLS THE KING OF ISRAEL THE WORDS WHICH YOU SPEAK IN YOUR BEDROOM. SO HE SAID: GO AND SEE &lt; WHERE HE IS &gt;</small>…. <small>THEN HE SENT HORSES AND CHARIOTS THERE</small>. Immediately (in vss. 15–16): <small>&lt; HIS SERVANT &gt; CRIED OUT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><small>CRIED OUT</small> is missing from the Masoretic Text.</i> <small>AND SAID &lt; UNTO HIM &gt;</small>: <small>ALAS, MY LORD, WHAT SHALL WE DO? THEN HE SAID: FEAR NOT, FOR THERE ARE MORE WITH US THAN WITH THEM</small>. Immediately Elisha prayed to the name of the Holy One, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>THEN ELISHA PRAYED AND SAID: LORD, PLEASE OPEN HIS EYES AND LET HIM SEE. SO THE LORD OPENED THE EYES OF THE SERVANT AND HE SAW, AND THERE WAS THE HILL FULL OF FIERY HORSES AND CHARIOTS ROUND ABOUT ELISHA</small>! Immediately Elisha arose and cursed the Aramaeans (in vs. 18), <small>AND HE SAID</small> [<small>PLEASE</small>] <small>SMITE THIS NATION WITH A BLINDING LIGHT; SO HE SMOTE THEM WITH A BLINDING LIGHT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF ELISHA</small>. Now &lt; Scripture &gt; did not mention the name, but when &lt; Elisha &gt; prayed over them again for their eyes to be opened, he said (in vs. 20): <small>O LORD, OPEN</small> [<small>THE EYES OF THESE MEN THAT THEY MAY SEE</small>.] Ergo: The name of the Holy One is not mentioned in connection with evil. So also you find that, when the angels of destruction came to destroy Jerusalem, as stated (in Ezek. 9:2): <small>AND HERE WERE SIX PERSONS COMING &lt; BY WAY OF THE UPPER GATE WHICH FACES NORTH, EACH WITH HIS WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION IN HIS HAND; AND A CERTAIN ONE IN THEIR MIDST CLOTHED IN LINEN &gt;</small>…; <small>&lt; AND THEY CAME FORWARD AND STOOD BY THE BRONZE ALTAR &gt;</small>; the Holy One said to Gabriel: Fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city, as it is written (in Ezek. 10:2): <small>THEN HE SPOKE UNTO THE PERSON CLOTHED IN LINEN &lt; AND SAID: GO IN AMONG THE WHEELWORK, UNDER THE CHERUB, AND FILL YOUR HANDS WITH COALS OF FIRE FROM AMONG THE CHERUBIM, AND SCATTER THEM OVER THE CITY &gt;</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. below, Lev. 8:5.</i> Gabriel came and stood at the wheel. The cherub said to him: What do you desire? He said to him: Thus and so has the Holy One commanded me. He said to him: Take them. He said to him: You put them in my hand. (Ezek. 10:7:) <small>THEN THE CHERUB STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FROM AMONG THE CHERUBIM &lt; UNTO THE FIRE THAT WAS AMONG THE CHERUBIM</small>…. &gt; R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay: If the coals had not been cooled off &lt; while passing &gt; from the hand of a cherub to the hand of Gabriel, there would not have remained of the enemies of Israel a &lt; single &gt; survivor or refugee.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 77a. For more details, see Lam. R. 1:13 (41).</i> So the Holy One wanted to do what was evil, not by himself, but through an angel. In the age to come, however, he will do what is good by himself, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU</small>…. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS; EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>.

Siman 13

[Another interpretation:] What is the meaning of (Ps. 5:5 [4]:) <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>? &lt; It is &gt; that &lt; Scripture &gt; does not cause the name of the Holy One to rest upon evil, except for two &lt; evil &gt; sayings upon which the Holy One did cause his name to rest. These are the following: (Dan. 9:14:) <small>SO THE <i>LORD</i> WATCHED OVER EVIL AND BROUGHT IT UPON US, BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>. Was it because <small>THE <i>LORD</i> OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>, that <small>HE WATCHED OVER EVIL</small>? It is simply that the Holy One acted justly when he first brought about the exile to Babylon of Jeconiah along with the artisans, the smiths, and all those mighty in the Torah. Now they went down to Babylon and created an academy for Torah; for if it had not happened like that, the Torah would have been forgotten in the Exile. It is simply that those who believed in the words of Jeremiah went forth with the Torah. &lt; They included &gt; (according to II Kings 24:16) <small>A THOUSAND ARTISANS AND SMITHS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ARTISANS</small> (<i><small>HRSh</small></i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Git</i>. 88a; <i>Sanh.</i> 38a; <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Dan., 1066.</i> When they opened the Torah they all became as those who are deaf (<i><small>HRSh</small></i>). &lt; And what is the meaning of &gt; <small>SMITHS</small> (rt.: <i><small>SGR</small></i>)? After they closed (rt.: <i><small>SGR</small></i>) it, there was no one in all Israel who was able to open it. Ergo (in Dan. 9:14): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>.
So he acted justly during that exile in that he watched over it, and he still performed a great kindness for &lt; Israel &gt; with reference to that exile. How? In &lt; the month of &gt; Tebet they were scheduled to go into exile from Jerusalem, for so does &lt; Scripture &gt; say (in Ezek. 24:1–2): <small>&lt; THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME UNTO ME IN THE NINTH YEAR OF THE TENTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH, SAYING &gt;: SON OF ADAM, WRITE DOWN THE NAME OF THE DAY</small>, [<small>THIS VERY DAY</small>;] <small>ON THIS VERY DAY THE KING OF BABYLON LAID SIEGE TO JERUSALEM</small>. What did the Holy One do? He said: If they go forth now in the cold, they will die. What did he do for them? He waited for them and sent them into exile during the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence follows the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 4:9. The Buber text, which reads: “He waited for them during the summer and sent them into exile,” makes little sense.</i> This is what the prophet says (in Jer. 8:13): <small>I WILL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM, SAYS THE LORD</small>. "Destroy" ('<small><i>SP</i></small>) can only mean "exile," since it is stated (in Zeph. 1:2): <small>I WILL REMOVE</small> ('<small><i>SP</i></small>) <small>ALL THINGS &lt; FROM THE FACE THE EARTH &gt;</small>…. Now, the second &lt; evil saying associated with the name of the Holy One &gt; is (Ezek. 9:4:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM: PASS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE CITY, THROUGH THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM AND MARK &lt; THE LETTER &gt;</small> <i><small>TAW</small></i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. For various interpretations of its meaning, see the parallel version in <i>Shab.</i> 55a.</i> <small>ON THE FOREHEADS OF THOSE PEOPLE &lt; WHO MOAN AND GROAN OVER ALL THE ABOMINATIONS &gt;</small>…. The Holy One said to Gabriel: Go and write an ink <i>taw</i> upon the foreheads of the righteous, so that the angels of destruction will have no dominion over them. Then upon the foreheads of the wicked write a blood <i>taw</i> so that the angels of destruction will have dominion over them. &lt; The &gt; prosecution<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kategoria</i>, i.e., “accusation,” “charge.” Here the concept is hypostatized as a separate being.</i> came in before the Holy One, [it said to him]: Sovereign of the World, how do the former differ from the latter? He said to it: The former are completely righteous, and the latter are completely wicked. It said to him: It was in their power to protest, but they did not protest. He said to it: It was revealed and known to me that, if they had protested, they would not have accepted their &lt; protest &gt;. It said to him: Sovereign of the World, how does the one group differ from the other. After all, it was in their power to demean themselves for the sanctification of your name and take beatings from Israel upon themselves, just as the prophets endured &lt; them &gt;. So look at how many woes Jeremiah suffered from Israel; also Isaiah, of whom it is written (in Is. 50:6): <small>I GAVE MY BACK TO THE SMITERS</small>…., and the rest of the prophets. Immediately (in Ezek. 9:6) he spoke again to the angels of destruction: [<small>KILL OFF</small>] <small>OLD FOLK, YOUTH, MAIDENS, SMALL CHILDREN, AND WOMEN, &lt; BUT DO NOT TOUCH ANYONE WHO BEARS THE <i>TAV</i> UPON HIMSELF &gt;</small>. This also was a kindness, in that the Holy One {interceded with} [mitigated] his wrath against Jerusalem, as stated (in Lam. 4:11): <small>THE LORD HAS COMPLETED</small> (<i><small>KLH</small></i>) <small>HIS WRATH</small>. For if he had not done so, all Israel would have received a verdict of destruction (<i><small>KLYH</small></i>). Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>, because the Holy One does not cause his name to rest upon evil. So also in the case of Israel, he allotted them glory and did not mention them for evil. When he came to the offerings, he said to Moses (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>, &lt; i.e. &gt; <small>OF YOU</small>, and not the peoples of the world. However, when he came to mention leprosy spots, he said (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small> &lt; … &gt;. It does not say: "One of you," but <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &lt; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &gt;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5): <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>.

Siman 14

(Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &lt; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &gt;</small>. It is difficult for the Holy One to reach out his hand against a human being.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4:10; cf. Lev. R. 17:4.</i> Rather he forewarns a person and afflicts his house, as stated (in Lev. 14:34): <small>AND WHEN I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. &lt; If &gt; he repents, fine; but if not, it afflicted his clothes, as stated (in Lev. 13:47): <small>WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT</small>. &lt; If &gt; he repents, fine; but if not, &lt; comes &gt; upon his body, as stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &lt; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &gt;</small>.

Siman 15

[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &lt; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &gt;</small>. Why do the plagues come?<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4:11; cf. Lev. R. 17:3.</i> Because of harlotry. And so you find in Jerusalem, that because they were absorbed in harlotry, they were afflicted with leprosy. What is written there (in Is. 3:16)? <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD SAID: BECAUSE &lt; THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION &gt; ARE HAUGHTY, &lt; AND WALK WITH EXTENDED NECK AND ROVING EYES &gt;</small>…. Then it says (in vs. 17): <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<i><small>SPH</small></i>) <small>THE SCALPS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION</small>.

[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH A SWELLING</small> (<i><small>S'T</small></i>) <small>OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, &lt; AND IT BECOMES &gt;</small> … <small>THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; is speaking about four empires.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 11; Lev. R. 15:9.</i> The <small>SWELLING</small> represents Babylon, since it is stated (in Is. 14:4): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE UP</small> (<i><small>NS'T</small></i>) <small>THIS SONG OF SCORN AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON AND SAY</small>…. The <small>SORE</small> (rt.: <i><small>SPH</small></i>) represents Media, because Haman conspired (rt.: <i><small>SPH</small></i>) with Ahasuerus to devastate, kill, and destroy. The <small>BRIGHT SPOT</small> represents the Greek empire.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">According to the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 11, the <small>BRIGHT SPOT</small> (rt.: <i><small>BHR</small></i>) represents Greece because that empire “lorded” it (rt.: <i><small>BHR</small></i>) over Israel and said: Whoever has an ox, let him write on the horns of the ox that he has no share in the God of Israel.” So also Lev. R. 15:9; Gen. R. 2:4; cf. 16:4.</i> <small>THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY</small> represents the wicked empire of Edom (i.e., of Rome), because the Holy One afflicted it and its prince with leprosy, as stated (in Jer. 46:15): <small>WHY HAS <i>ABBIREKA</i> BEEN WASHED AWAY</small>?….<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 3:19, and the note there.</i> In the world to come the Holy One shall sit in judgment over the wicked empire. He will say to them: Why did you oppress my children? They will say: It was you that acted, when you delivered them into our hands. Then the Holy One will say to them: Because (to paraphrase Is. 47:6) I delivered them into your hands, did you not show them mercy? Instead (according to Is. 47:6, cont.): <small>UPON THE AGED YOU MADE YOUR YOKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY</small>. This &lt; aged one &gt; is Rabbi Aqiva, whom the empire oppressed, &lt; the empire &gt; which has no end.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 13:5.</i>
Another interpretation (of Is. 47:6, cont.): <small>UPON THE AGED YOU MADE YOUR YOKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY</small>. Because they made their yoke as heavy on the aged as upon the youth, the Holy One said to them: By your life, I am sitting over you in judgment to judge you and convict you. Thus it is stated (in Is. 47:1): <small>COME DOWN AND SIT UPON THE DUST, O MAIDEN DAUGHTER OF BABYLON; SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE, O CHALDEAN DAUGHTER</small>…. It is calling Edom the <small>DAUGHTER OF BABYLON</small>, and it is calling Edom the <small>CHALDEAN DAUGHTER</small>. So what is the meaning of <small>DAUGHTER OF BABYLON</small>? Babylon's twin sister. Just as Babylon destroyed my house, so also has this one destroyed my house. Ergo (in Is. 47:1): <small>O DAUGHTER OF BABYLON, SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE</small>. Since she formerly sat upon a throne, now &lt; she is told &gt; <small>SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE</small>, &lt; … &gt; <small>FOR YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED</small> {<small>THE TENDER AND DELICATE ONE</small>} [<small>TENDER AND DELICATE</small>]. Since she pampered herself over against my children, therefore &lt; she is told &gt; <small>YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED TENDER AND DELICATE</small>. What shall I do to you? I will exact retribution from your prince and smite him with leprosy. Then after that, I will exact retribution from you. You should not say: In this empire &lt; only &gt;, but even upon Gog, since he vaunts himself upward in the world. I will smite him with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE WITH WHICH THE LORD WILL SMITE ALL THE PEOPLES WHO HAVE WARRED AGAINST JERUSALEM: &lt; THEIR FLESH SHALL ROT AWAY</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> For what reason? Because they engaged in battle with Israel. <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE</small>. For what reason? Because they <small>WARRED AGAINST JERUSALEM</small>. And do not be surprised that the Lord exacts retribution in leprosy from those who hate them even in this world. And who was &lt; such a one &gt;? This was Naaman, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 5:1): <small>NOW NAAMAN, THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF ARAM</small>…; <small>BUT THE MAN, THOUGH A VALIANT WARRIOR, WAS A LEPER</small>. For what reason was he a leper? Because he had taken a little girl captive from the land of Israel. And also in the world to come the Holy One will afflict them with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE</small>. The Holy One said: Because you have called my children unclean, I am making you unclean with a great uncleanness through leprosy. Where is it shown that they called Israel unclean? Where it is stated (in Lam. 4:15) <small>AWAY, UNCLEAN, THEY CRIED AT THEM</small>. In the case of Israel, however, I will sanctify, purify, and redeem them from among you, as stated (in Is. 62:12): <small>AND THEY SHALL CALL THEM THE HOLY PEOPLE, THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD</small>. So also Solomon has said (in Cant. 4:7): <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED, AND THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>.

(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many children of Adam have no share in the world to come?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:1; Numb. R. 14:1; <i>PR</i> 6:4; <i>ARN</i>, A, 36; Midrash on Proverbs, 22.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in Sanh. 10:1–2): <small>THESE ARE THEY WHO HAVE NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME</small>…. <small>THREE KINGS AND FOUR COMMONERS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> <small>HAVE NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME. THE THREE KINGS ARE JEROBOAM, AHAB, AND MANASSEH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh.</i> 101b-104a.</i> R. Judah ben Shallum the Levite said: The sages of the Mishnah wanted to teach that there were four kings and reckon Solomon with them; however, a heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) came forth and said (in the words of Ps. 105:15): <small>TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED</small>. Nevertheless they returned one day to teaching &lt; as before &gt;. Fire from the heavens came and destroyed their benches. &lt; The heavenly voice &gt; returned and said (according to Job 34:33): <small>SHOULD HE REPAY AS YOU WOULD, WHEN YOU HAVE REFUSED</small>? All the same, why did they so teach? Because it is written (in I Kings 11:1, 6): <small>NOW KING SOLOMON LOVED MANY FOREIGN WIVES</small> &lt; …. &gt; <small>AND SOLOMON DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD</small>. (<i>Sanh.</i> 10:2, at the end:) <small>THE FOUR COMMONERS ARE BALAAM, DOEG, AHITHOPHEL AND GEHAZI</small>. You find that these were condemned to Gehinnom on account of the words of their mouths. In the case of Balaam, he was driven into Gehinnom because of his speech, as stated (in Numb. 23:7): <small>FROM ARAM HAS BALAK BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB &lt; FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST: COME, CURSE JACOB FOR ME</small>…. <small>&gt;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 20:19; also below, Numb. 7:17.</i> &lt; He said: &gt; I was one of the exalted ones;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i><small>MRMYM</small></i>, which the midrash seems to understand as related to <i><small>M’RMYM</small></i>, i.e., “one of the Arameans.”</i> I was one of the division of &lt; the &gt; patriarchs. <small>BALAK BROUGHT ME</small> (<i>yanheni</i>) and cast me into Gehinnom. Now <small>BROUGHT ME</small> (<i>yanheni</i>, rt.: <i><small>NHH</small></i>) can only imply Gehinnom, since it is stated (in Ezek. 32:18): <small>SON OF ADAM, BRING</small> (rt.: <i><small>NHH</small></i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Buber text reads the middle letter in this root as a <i>het</i> in agreement with Numb. 23:7; but the parallels in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:1; Numb. R. 20:19, and the Masoretic Text all read the middle letter as a <i>he</i>, a reading which together with the preposition ‘<i>al</i>, requires the translation, <small>LAMENT OVER</small>.</i> <small>THE MASSES OF EGYPT AND CAST THEM DOWN</small>… <small>&lt; UNTO THE LOWEST PART OF THE NETHER WORLD ALONG WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT &gt;</small>. So also was Doeg banished because of his speech. When? When David fled to Nob, the city of priests {to Ahimelech}, where Ahimelech received him, Saul noticed and gathered all his servants. He said to them: A fine way you are treating me! For David does whatever he wishes, and not one of you has put a word in my ear. It is so stated (in I Sam. 22:8): <small>IS THAT WHY ALL OF YOU HAVE CONSPIRED</small> [<small>AGAINST ME? FOR NO ONE IS PUTTING A WORD IN MY EAR</small>] &lt; <small>WHEN MY SON IS MAKING A DEAL WITH THE SON OF JESSE &gt;</small>…. Doeg began to utter evil speech, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>THEN DOEG THE EDOMITE, WHO WAS STANDING AMONG THE SERVANTS OF SAUL, &lt; ANSWERED AND SAID: I SAW THE SON OF JESSE COME TO NOB</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> It was also by his hand that eighty-five priests who wear the ephod and the high priest Ahimelech were slain. And he smote Nob the city of priests with the edge of the sword. So also was Ahithophel banished because of his speech. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 17:23): <small>SO WHEN AHITHOPHEL SAW THAT HIS COUNSEL WAS NOT HEEDED</small>…. <small>THEN HE SET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER AND HANGED HIMSELF</small>. Gehazi also was banished on account of his speech. When Naaman became leprous and was healed at the hands of Elisha, Naaman began to give silver, gold and gifts<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>dora.</i></i> to Elisha, but he did not want to accept them. Now Gehazi was ministering to Elisha. He saw the silver, the gold, and the clothes; so he said (in II Kings 5:20, 21, 27): <small>MY LORD HAS SPARED &lt; THAT ARAMEAN &gt; NAAMAN</small>…. <small>&lt; THEN GEHAZI CHASED AFTER NAAMAN</small>…. <small>&gt; THEREFORE THE LEPROSY OF NAAMAN</small> [<small>SHALL CLEAVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER</small>]. Why? Because it is stated (in Deut. 13:18): <small>AND LET NOTHING CLEAVE TO YOUR HAND OF THAT WHICH IS DEVOTED</small>. Now Naaman and the king of Aram served idols; and it is written (in Deut. 7:26): <small>DO NOT BRING AN ABOMINATION UNTO YOUR HOUSE</small>…. Since you said (in II Kings 5:20): <small>AND I WILL ACCEPT SOMETHING FROM</small> {<small>HIS HAND</small>} [<small>HIM</small>], by your life, you shall &lt; also &gt; take his deformity. Thus it is stated (in vs. 27): <small>THEREFORE THE LEPROSY OF NAAMAN SHALL CLEAVE TO YOU</small>. R. Pedat said: The Holy One has made a covenant with the world that anyone who utters evil speech receives leprosy. Where is it shown? From what is written on the matter (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<i>hametsora</i>'), &lt; i.e. &gt; the one who proclaims evil (<i>hamotsi' ra</i>').<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 5:5; <i>ySot.</i> 2:1 (17d); ‘<i>Arakh.</i> 15b; Cf. Lev. R. 16:1.</i>

Siman 2

[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] Our masters have said: Plagues only affect a person on account of the evil speech which comes out of his mouth. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN</small>, &lt; i.e. &gt; to afflict your body. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>,] &lt; i.e. &gt; and do not say before the angel who is appointed over you: By mistake I brought forth the word from my mouth; for every word which issues from your mouth, whether good, evil, by mistake, or on purpose, is written in a book.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Matthew 12:36–37; cf. James 1:26.</i> Where is it shown that it is so? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:16): <small>THEN THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD SPOKE WITH ONE ANOTHER</small>. [<small>THE LORD HAS HEARKENED AND LISTENED, AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE HIM</small>…. ] And so when in severe trouble, David said (in Ps. 139:2, 4): <small>YOU KNOW WHEN I SIT DOWN AND WHEN I STAND UP</small>…. <small>&lt; FOR THERE IS NOT A WORD ON MY TONGUE, BUT THAT YOU, O LORD, KNOW IT FULLY</small>. <small>&gt;</small> Job also said (in Job 13:27): <small>YOU LOOK CLOSELY OVER MY FOOTSTEPS</small>. (Eccl. 5:5 [6], cont.:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>? These are the hands and the body when they are afflicted by leprosy.

Siman 3

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH &lt; CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN &gt;</small>. The Torah has spoken to you euphemistically. If your wife has told you that she is menstruating, do not cause your body to sin by touching her. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> who is appointed over the formation of the fetus: I made a mistake and did not know. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>? This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy. R. Aha said: If a man has intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating, the children will be afflicted with leprosy. How? &lt; If &gt; he has intercourse on the first day of her menstruation, the child which is born shall be afflicted after ten years. &lt; If &gt; he has intercourse with her on the second day, it shall be afflicted after twenty years. On the third day it shall be afflicted after thirty years. On the fourth day it shall be afflicted after forty years. On the fifth day it shall be afflicted after fifty years. On the sixth day it shall be afflicted after sixty years. On the seventh day it shall be afflicted after seventy years, corresponding to the seven days of her menstruation. Moreover, he shall not depart from the world before he has seen his fruit spoiled. Now the days of a person's life are only seventy years, for so David says (in Ps. 90:10): <small>THE DAYS OF OUR LIFE COMPRISE SEVENTY YEARS</small>. And if one is successful, &lt; then &gt; eighty, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND IF ONE HAS STRENGTH, &lt; THEN &gt; EIGHTY YEARS</small>. Therefore if a man has intercourse with a menstruating woman on the seventh day, the fetus is afflicted at seventy years of age, so that he does not depart from the world until he has seen his fruit spoiled. This punishment, as it were, does not come from me? I have already testified to you and told you (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH &lt; CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN, AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE &gt;</small>. If you have acted with malice aforethought and led astray a high priest, who is called an angel (<i>mal'akh</i>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7): <small>FOR THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE, AND THEY SHOULD SEEK TORAH FROM HIS MOUTH; FOR HE IS THE MESSENGER</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>OF THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>; then do not say: I sinned by mistake, &lt; i.e. &gt; (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> (i.e., before the high priest) <small>THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>. Why? You are leading yourself astray. You are afflicting yourself. The voice which you send forth from your mouth will destroy the work of your hands. (Eccl. 5:5 [6]:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE</small> [<small>AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>]? This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>….

Siman 4

[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>. Everything depends on the tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:2.</i> &lt; If &gt; one is acquitted, he is acquitted for life; &lt; if &gt; one is not acquitted, he is condemned to death. &lt; If &gt; one is engaged in Torah with his tongue, he is acquitted for life, inasmuch as the Torah [is called life, according to what is stated] (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&lt; WISDOM &gt; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. It (i.e., the Torah) is also one's healing for the evil tongue (i.e., slander), as stated (in Prov. 15:4): <small>A HEALING TONGUE IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. But if one is occupied with slander, his soul is condemned to death, since slander is more harmful than the shedding of blood. Thus whoever kills takes only one life, but the one who speaks slander kills three people: the one who tells it, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom it is told.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 4:2; Lev. R. 26:2; Numb. R. 19:2; Deut. R. 5:10; M. Pss. 12:2; <i>yPe’ah</i> 1:1 (16a).</i> Doeg spoke slander against Ahimelech; and he (i.e., Ahimelech) was killed, [as stated] (in I Sam. 22:16): <small>BUT</small> {<small>SAUL</small>} [<small>THE KING</small>] <small>SAID: YOU SHALL SURELY DIE, AHIMELECH</small>. Saul also was killed, [as stated] (in I Chron. 10:13): <small>&lt; SO SAUL DIED &gt; FOR THE TREACHERY WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED AGAINST THE LORD</small>. And thus did Saul say (in II Sam. 1:9, to a young man): <small>PLEASE STAND OVER ME AND SLAY ME, FOR DEATH THROES HAVE SEIZED ME</small>. &lt; The young man was &gt; the accuser<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kategoros.</i></i> of Nob, the city of priests. Now <small>DEATH THROES</small> (<i><small>ShBTs</small></i>) can only denote priesthood, since it is stated (in Exod. 28:13 with reference to high-priestly dress): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE GOLD BROCADE</small> (rt.: <i><small>ShBTs</small></i>). Doeg also was uprooted (<i><small>ShRSh</small></i>) from the life of this world and from all life in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 52:7 [5]): <small>GOD WILL ALSO TEAR YOU DOWN FOR EVER; HE WILL SEIZE YOU, TEAR YOU AWAY FROM YOUR TENT, AND UPROOT</small> (<i><small>ShRSh</small></i>) <small>YOU FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING. SELAH</small>. &lt; I.e., he will uproot you &gt; from life in the world to come. Who is more severe? One who smites with the sword or &lt; one who &gt; smites with the dart? [Say: The one who smites with the dart.] The one who smites with the sword is only able to kill his companion if he draws near to him and touches him; but in the case of one who smites with the dart, it is not so. Rather one throws the dart wherever he sees him. Therefore, one who speaks slander is comparable to the dart, as stated (in Jer. 9:7 [8]): <small>THEIR TONGUE IS A SHARPENED DART; IT SPEAKS DECEIT</small>. It also says (in Ps. 57:5 [4]): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ADAM, WHOSE TEETH ARE SPEARS AND DARTS</small>, [<small>AND WHOSE TONGUE A SHARP SWORD</small>]. See how harmful slander is, in that it is more harmful than adultery, blood shedding, and idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 52:2.</i> Of adultery it is written (in Gen. 39:9, where Joseph is addressing Potiphar's wife): <small>THEN HOW SHALL I DO THIS GREAT EVIL AND SIN AGAINST GOD</small>? Of blood shedding it is written (in Gen. 4:13): <small>AND CAIN SAID TO THE LORD: MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. Of idolatry it is written (in Exod. 32:31, with reference to the golden calf): <small>ALAS, THIS PEOPLE HAS SINNED A GREAT SIN</small>. But when it (i.e., Scripture) mentions slander, it does not say "great" (in the masculine singular, as in Gen. 4:13), "great" in the feminine singular, as in Gen. 39:9 and Exod. 32:31), but "great" (in the feminine plural). Thus it is written (in Ps. 12:4 [3]): <small>THE LORD SHALL CUT OFF ALL FLATTERING LIPS, &lt; EVERY &gt; TONGUE SPEAKING GREAT THINGS</small> (in the feminine plural). It is therefore stated (in Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>.] Do not say: Since I have license to speak, I am therefore speaking whatever I want. See, the Torah has already enlightened you (in Ps. 34:14 [13]): <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL</small> [<small>AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT</small>]. Perhaps you will say that you are suffering a loss. Are you not profiting instead? So the Holy Spirit proclaims (in Prov. 21:23): <small>THE ONE WHO GUARDS HIS MOUTH AND HIS TONGUE GUARDS HIS SOUL FROM TROUBLE</small> (<i>tsarot</i>). Do not read this. Instead &lt; read &gt;, "Guards his soul from leprosy (<i>tsar'at</i>)."

Siman 5

Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>. Slander is so harmful that one does not produce it from his mouth without denying the root (i.e., the existence of the Holy One).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 5:3; M. Ps. 52:2.</i> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 12:5 [4]): <small>THOSE WHO SAY: BY OUR TONGUES WE SHALL PREVAIL. OUR LIPS ARE WITH US. WHO IS TO BE OUR LORD</small>? The Holy One, as it were, cried out against those who speak slander (in Ps. 94:16): <small>WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS</small>…? Who can stand against them? And who will stand against them? Gehinnom? But Gehinnom also cries out: I am unable to stand against them. &lt; Then &gt; the Holy One said: I &lt; will come at them &gt; from above and you (Gehinnom), from below. I will hurl darts from above; and you will turn on them with burning coals from below. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 120:3–4): &lt; <small>WHAT SHALL BE GIVEN TO YOU, AND WHAT SHALL BE YOUR GAIN, YOU DECEITFUL TONGUE</small>? &gt; <small>SHARP DARTS OF THE WARRIOR ALONG WITH BURNING COALS OF BROOM WOOD</small>. The Holy One said to them (i.e., to Israel): Do you want to be delivered from Gehinnom? Keep yourselves far away from the deceitful tongue. Then you will be acquitted in this world and in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 34:13 [12]): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE AND LOVES &lt; MANY &gt; DAYS &lt; IN WHICH &gt; TO EXPERIENCE &lt; WHAT IS &gt; GOOD. WHO DESIRES LIFE</small>, concerns this world; <small>LOVES &lt; MANY &gt; DAYS</small>, refers to the world to come. It is therefore stated (in vs. 14 [13]): <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL &lt; AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT &gt;</small>. Our masters have said: There is a story about a certain peddler who went around in the villages.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 16:2; cf. also ‘<i>AZ</i> 19b.</i> Now he would call out and say: Who wants the elixir of life? The daughter of R. Jannay heard him. She said to her father: A certain peddler is going around and saying: Who wants the elixir of life? He said to her: Go and call him. She went and called him to R. Jannay. He said to him: Which elixir of life is it that you are selling? That peddler said to him: Pray, do not you know what this elixir is? He said to him: Even so, you inform me. He said to him: Bring me the book of Psalms. He brought it to him, and he unrolled it. Then he showed him what David had said (in Ps. 34:13–14 [12–13]): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE</small>…? <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL</small>…. What did R. Jannay do? He gave him six sela'im. His disciples said to him: Rabbi, did you not know this verse? He said to them: Yes, but this one came and explained it to me. {Therefore leprosy comes upon whoever speaks slander. (Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.} &lt; This story is &gt; to teach you that one who speaks slander will have plagues come upon him. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<i>metsora</i>'), &lt; i.e. &gt; the one who proclaims evil (<i>motsi' ra'</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 5:1; <i>ySot.</i> 2:1 (17d); ‘<i>Arakh</i>. 15b; Cf. Lev. R. 16:1.</i>

Siman 6

[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. Whoever speaks slander concerning his fellow will have leprosy come upon him. From where have you learned it? From Miriam.] See what is written about Miriam (in Numb. 12:1): <small>THEN MIRIAM AND AARON SPOKE AGAINST MOSES</small>. Therefore (in vs. 10): <small>THEN AARON TURNED UNTO MIRIAM, AND THERE WAS</small> [<small>MIRIAM</small>] <small>WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic Text reverses these two clauses in this verse.</i> What is written elsewhere (in Deut. 24:9)? <small>REMEMBER WHAT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID TO MIRIAM</small>. And what did she say against Moses? She said: Moses took (<i>natal</i>) a wife but ceased (<i>batel</i>) from being fruitful and multiplying.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 12:1 (99:2–3), which identifies the Cushite woman of Numb. 12:1 with Zipporah, for details.</i> What did the Holy One do to them? He appeared to them, and they needed an immersion. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:4): <small>THEN THE LORD SUDDENLY SPOKE UNTO MOSES, UNTO AARON, AND UNTO MIRIAM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SUDDENLY</small>? That when he appeared unto them, they had need for water <small>SUDDENLY</small>. He spoke to them, and thus they had need for water.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi on Numb. 12:4, who explains that they had need for water because the Holy One had appeared to them suddenly while they were unclean due to marital relations.</i> And I am speaking with you. Immediately Miriam became stricken with leprosy, as stated (in Numb. 12:10): <small>AND THERE WAS</small> [<small>MIRIAM</small>] <small>WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW</small>. Moreover, are not &lt; these &gt; words an argument a fortiori (<i>qal wahomer</i>)? For if Miriam had this happen, when she only spoke against her beloved brother when he was absent<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., she spoke privately to Aaron with no desire to be hostile to Moses. Cf. <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 12:1 (99:2).</i> and was only intending to return him to his wife, how much the more so in the case of one who utters slander against his colleague? What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 24:8)? <small>TAKE CARE WITH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY &lt; TO WATCH DILIGENTLY AND DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES SHALL TEACH</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> So the hand of the Holy One also afflicted Aaron with it, when he was high priest. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:9): <small>AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST THEM</small>, &lt; i.e. &gt; against Aaron and against Miriam. Aaron, however, was healed immediately; but Miriam, after seven days, as stated (in Numb. 12:15): <small>SO MIRIAM WAS SHUT UP</small> [<small>OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP</small>] <small>FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<i>metsora'</i>). The one who proclaims evil (<i>motsi' ra</i>') is the one who finds evil (<i>motse' ra</i>').

Siman 7

[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] And thus you find with the primeval serpent, because he spoke slander &lt; to Eve &gt; against his creator, for that reason he became leprous.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 19:4.</i> What did he say? R. Joshua ben Levi said (citing Gen. <i>3:5):</i> <small>FOR GOD KNOWS THAT ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT</small>, <small>&lt; YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED &gt;</small> [….] He said to her: Every artisan hates his fellow &lt; artisan &gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The saying is proverbial. See Gen. R. 32:2; M. Pss. 11:6.</i> Now when &lt; the Holy One &gt; wanted to create his world, he ate from this tree. So he created his world. You &lt; two &gt; also eat from it. Then you will be able to create like him. The Holy One said to &lt; the serpent &gt;: You have spoken slander. Your end is to be stricken with leprosy. It is so stated (in Gen. 3:14): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: &lt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> With what did he curse him? With leprosy. Now a curse ('<i>arirah</i>) can only be leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:52): <small>FOR IT IS A MALIGNANT</small> (<i>mam'eret</i>) <small>LEPROSY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The argument assumes that ‘<i>arirah</i> and <i>mam’eret</i> share the same root.

That they all shall be healed, but &lt; the serpent &gt; shall not be healed. The children of Adam shall be healed, as stated (in Is. 35:5–6): {<small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART</small>…. } <small>THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED</small>…. [<small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART</small>…. ] It is also written about the wild beasts and the cattle (in Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER, &lt; AND THE LION LIKE THE OX SHALL EAT STRAW &gt;</small>; but the snake shall not have healing, since it is stated (ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE SERPENT'S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>. R. Helbo said: Even though he may eat all the delicacies in the world, to him they only taste like dust. Moreover, it shall also be like this in the world to come. (Is. 65:25): <small>BUT THE SERPENT'S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>, for he shall have no healing, because he &lt; was the one who &gt; brought mortals down to the dust. And what caused him to have &lt; this punishment &gt;? &lt; It happened &gt; because he had spoken slander. Ergo (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. In this book there are a lot of laws. {(Lev. 7:1:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE GUILT OFFERING</small>.} (Lev. 6:2 [9]:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. [(Lev. 7:1:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE GUILT OFFERING</small>.] (Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. And here also (in Lev. 14:2) I have established the law of the leper: <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>….

(Lev. 14:2:) [<small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>:] <small>IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING</small>. With what?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:3; Lev. R. 16:7.</i> With (according to vs. 4) <small>TWO LIVE CLEAN BIRDS</small>. How is his offering different from all &lt; other &gt; offerings? It is simply that he has spoken slander; therefore, the text says, <small>BIRDS</small>, because they (like slanderers) carry their utterance, as stated (in Eccl. 10:20): <small>FOR A BIRD OF HEAVEN MAY CARRY THE UTTERANCE</small>.
(Lev. 14:4, cont.:) <small>CEDAR WOOD</small>. In the case of the cedar, no tree is taller (<i>gevoha</i>) than that one; so because &lt; the leper &gt; has exalted (<i>gevoha</i>) himself like a cedar, &lt; he has had &gt; the leprosy come upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 4:3.</i> Thus Simeon ben Eleazar has said: Leprosy comes on account of haughtiness, for so you find in the case of Uzziah (in II Chron. 26:16, 19): <small>BUT WHEN HE WAS STRONG, HE GREW SO ARROGANT THAT HE</small> {<small>ACTUALLY</small>} <small>ACTED CORRUPTLY AGAINST THE LORD</small> [<small>HIS GOD</small>] &lt; …. &gt; <small>BUT DURING HIS ANGER WITH THE PRIESTS, LEPROSY APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD</small>. (Lev. 14:4, cont.:) <small>AND WITH HYSSOP</small>. Among the trees there is none [as short] as the hyssop. Because &lt; the leper &gt; has humbled himself, &lt; leprosy &gt; is therefore cured through the hyssop.
(Lev. 14:5:) <small>&lt; THEN THE PRIEST SHALL GIVE A COMMAND &gt; TO KILL ONE BIRD</small>. Why kill one and release one? It is simply that, if he has repented, you (sic) should not see &lt; the leprosy &gt; again; but if you do not repent (<i>hozer</i>), the leprosy shall return (<i>hozer</i>) upon you, just as the live bird can return. Therefore (in vs. 7): <small>AND HE SHALL SEND THE &lt; LIVE &gt; BIRD OUT &lt; OVER THE OPEN COUNTRY &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 16:9.</i>
(Lev. 14:2:) <small>&lt; THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING: &gt; HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO THE PRIEST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE SHALL BE BROUGHT</small> (rt.: <i><small>BW</small></i>'). He comes (rt.: <i><small>BW</small>'</i>). Why? Because everything is far off from him, for so David says (in Ps. 38:12 [11]): <small>MY FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS</small> {<small>ARE FAR FROM ME. THEY</small>} <small>STAND ALOOF FROM MY AFFLICTION, AND MY KINFOLK STAND FAR OFF</small>. So also it says (in Lev. 13:46): <small>HE SHALL DWELL ALONE; HIS DWELLING SHALL BE OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 14:2): <small>HE SHALL BE BROUGHT</small> (rt.: <i><small>BW</small></i>').

Siman 9

(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. &lt; The verse &gt; speaks about Israel, when they were in Jerusalem and when Jeremiah said: Repent; but they did not repent. So what did the Holy One do? He afflicted them with leprosy, as stated (in Is. 3:17): <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<i><small>SPH</small></i>) <small>THE SCALPS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION. SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<i><small>SPH</small></i>) can only refer to leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>&lt; WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &gt; A SWELLING OR A SORE</small> (<i><small>SPH</small></i>)…. <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 17:6.</i>
(Lev. 14:3:) <small>AND THE PRIEST SHALL LOOK</small>. This &lt; priest &gt; is Jeremiah, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 1:1): <small>ONE OF THE PRIESTS THAT WERE IN ANATHOTH</small>…. (Lev. 14:3, cont.:) <small>AND BEHOLD, THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS HEALED IN THE LEPER</small>, when he had exiled them to Babylon. After they had gone into exile, Nebuchadnezzar said to them that they should bow down to the image, as stated (in Dan. 3:6): <small>AND WHOEVER DOES NOT FALL DOWN AND PAY HOMAGE &lt; SHALL IMMEDIATELY BE THROWN INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE &gt;</small>. They said to him (in vs. 18): <small>WE WILL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS &lt; NOR PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP &gt;</small>. What did he do? <small>AND</small> (according to Numb. 19:6) <small>THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE CEDAR WOOD, CRIMSON STUFF, AND HYSSOP</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This part of the verse is similar to Lev. 14:6, and follows the order of Lev. 14:6 in listing what the priest takes.

The Holy One said to them: In this world on account of sins you have been afflicted, been purified, repented, and have &lt; again &gt; been afflicted. In the world to come I am the one who will cleanse you from on high. It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE; I WILL PURIFY YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Although priestly cleansings may not be effective, in the world to come the Holy One will personally render effective purification.

(Lev. 14:34:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>…, <small>AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. Let our master instruct us: For how many things does leprosy come? Thus have our masters taught: The affliction comes &lt; upon one &gt; for eleven things:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:4; cf. Numb. R. 7:5; Lev. 17:3; ‘<i>Arakh</i>. 16a.</i> (1) For idolatry, (2) for blessing (i.e., for cursing) the name, (3) for unchastity, (4) for theft, (5) for slander, (6) for false witness, (7) upon<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In this passage “for” and “upon” translate the same Hebrew word (‘<i>al</i>).</i> the judge who perverts justice, (8) for swearing falsely, (9) upon one who enters a domain which is not his, (10) upon one who thinks false thoughts, and (11) upon one who instigates quarrels among brothers. And some also say: for the evil eye (i.e., for being miserly). [Moreover, you &lt; can &gt; expound them all &lt; from Scripture &gt;.]

        <br>How is it shown &lt; that leprosy comes &gt; for idolatry? In that, when they made the calf, they were afflicted with leprosy. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:25): <small>NOW MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE RIOTOUS</small> (<i>parua</i>'); and it is written concerning the leper (in Lev. 13:45): <small>HIS HEAD SHALL BE UNKEMPT</small> (<i>parua'</i>).
        <br>And how is it shown &lt; that leprosy comes &gt; for blessing (i.e., cursing) the name? From Goliath, of whom it is stated that he said in (I Sam. 17:8): <small>CHOOSE A MAN</small> ('<i>ish</i>) <small>FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Now man ('<i>ish</i>) can only be the Holy One, since it is stated (in Exod. 15:3): <small>THE LORD IS A MAN</small> ('<i>ish</i>) <small>OF WAR</small>. It is also written (in I Sam. 17:46) <small>THIS DAY &lt; THE LORD &gt; WILL DELIVER</small> (rt.: <i><small>SGR</small></i>) <small>YOU</small>. Now deliverance can only imply leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:5) <small>THE PRIEST SHALL ISOLATE</small> (rt.: <i><small>SGR</small></i>) <small>HIM</small>.
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for unchastity? Where it is written (in Is. 3:16–17): <small>&lt; BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION ARE HAUGHTY, AND WALK WITH EXTENDED NECK AND ROVING EYES</small>…; <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<i><small>SPH</small></i>) <small>THE SCALPS &lt; OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Vs. 17 differs from the Masoretic Text by replacing the divine name with <i>Adonay</i> (<small>LORD</small>) and by spelling <i><small>SPH</small></i> with a <i>samekh</i> instead of a <i>sin</i>.</i> It is also written (in Lev. 14:56): <small>FOR A SWELLING AND FOR A SORE</small> (rt.: <i><small>SPH</small></i>) <small>AND FOR A BRIGHT SPOT</small>.
        <br>&lt; How is it shown &gt; for theft and for swearing falsely? Where it is stated (in Zech. 5:4): <small>I HAVE SENT IT</small> (i.e., the curse of the flying scroll in vs. 1) <small>FORTH, SAYS THE LORD</small> {<small>GOD</small>} [<small>OF HOSTS</small>]; <small>AND IT SHALL COME UNTO THE HOUSE OF THE THIEF AND UNTO THE HOUSE OF THE ONE WHO SWEARS FALSELY IN MY NAME; AND IT SHALL LODGE WITHIN HIS HOUSE; AND IT SHALL CONSUME IT</small>, [<small>EVEN</small>] <small>WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>. What is a thing which consumes timbers and stones? See, it says this is leprosy, since it is written (concerning a house infested with leprosy in Lev. 14:45): <small>AND IT</small> (i.e., the plague)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In the biblical context <small>IT</small> would normally be translated as <small>HE</small> and refer to the one responsible for tearing down an infested house, but the midrash understands the plague itself as that which destroys the house.</i> <small>SHALL BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>.
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for slander? From Miriam [of whom it is written (in Numb. 12:10): <small>AND THERE WAS MIRIAM WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW; SO WHEN AARON TURNED UNTO MIRIAM, THERE SHE WAS, STRICKEN WITH LEPROSY</small>.] It also says (in Lev. 14:1): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<i>hametsora</i>'), &lt; i.e. &gt; the one who puts forth evil (<i>hamotsi ra</i>').
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for those who bear false witness? Where Israel testified over the Holy One and said (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. They were afflicted with leprosy, since it is written (below in vs. 25): <small>NOW MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE RIOTOUS</small> (<i>parua</i>').<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above in this section, where parua‘ in this verse is related to Lev. 13:45, according to which the leper’s <small>HEAD SHALL BE UNKEMPT</small> (<i>parua</i>‘).</i>
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for the judge who perverts justice? Where it is stated (of unjust judges in Is. 5:24): <small>AND IT SHALL BE THAT AS A TONGUE OF FIRE CONSUMES STRAW, AND AS CHAFF SINKS DOWN IN A FLAME, THEIR</small> {<small>BLOSSOM</small>} [<small>ROOT</small>] <small>SHALL BE LIKE THE ROT, AND THEIR</small> {<small>ROOT</small>} [<small>BLOSSOM</small>] <small>SHALL RISE UP LIKE THE DUST; FOR THEY HAVE REJECTED THE LAW OF THE LORD OF HOSTS AND SPURNED THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL. THEIR BLOSSOM</small> (<i><small>PRH</small></i>) can only refer to leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:12): <small>IF THE LEPROSY SHOULD BLOSSOM OUT WIDELY</small> (rt.: <i><small>PRH</small></i>).
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for one who enters a domain which is not his? From Uzziah, when he entered the domain of the priesthood. It is so stated (of him in II Chron. 26:16, 19): &lt; …; <small>HE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD HIS GOD AND ENTERED INTO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD TO OFFER INCENSE UPON THE ALTAR OF INCENSE</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> <small>THEN LEPROSY APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD</small>.
        <br>And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for one who instigates quarrels among brothers? Where it is stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH</small> &lt; … &gt;, because he had taken Sarah from Abraham.
    
And &lt; how is it shown &gt; for the evil eye (i.e., for being miserly)? R. Isaac said: When a someone's eye is too evil (i.e., when someone too miserly) to lend out his possessions, &lt; and when &gt; someone goes and says: Lend me your scythe, lend me your ax, or any object, and he says to him: I do not have one, what does the Holy One do to him?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 11b.</i> He afflicts his house with leprosy. When he comes to the priest and says to him: Something like a plague has appeared in the house belonging to me, he commands (according to Lev. 14:45): <small>LET HIM BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>. Then everybody will see his implements, when they {bring them out and lug them} [lug them and bring them] outside. So they publicize<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mepharsemin</i>, from <i><small>PRSM</small></i>, a verb related to the Greek, <i>parresiazesthai</i> (“to speak freely”).</i> his implements, and they all say: Did he not say: I do not have a scythe; I do not have an ax? See, he does have such and such an object, but he did not want to lend it. So his eye is evil (i.e., he is miserly), [and he is exposed]. Where is it shown? Where it says so (in Job 20:28): <small>THE PRODUCE OF HIS HOUSE SHALL DEPART, POURED OUT IN THE DAY OF HIS WRATH</small>. Moreover, there are also some who say: &lt; Leprosy &gt; also &lt; comes &gt; for vulgarity. &lt; How is it shown? &gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This necessary addition is found in the parallel of <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 4.</i> From Naaman (in II Kings 5:1): <small>NOW NAAMAN, THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF ARAM</small> […; <small>BUT THE MAN, THOUGH A VALIANT WARRIOR, WAS A LEPER</small>,] because he was vulgar. &lt; Leprosy &gt; also &lt; comes &gt; upon the one who says something against his colleague. Thus you find it so in the case of Moses our Master, when he said (in Exod. 4:1): <small>BUT</small> [<small>SURELY</small>] <small>THEY SHALL NOT BELIEVE ME</small>. The Holy One said to him: They are believers &lt; and &gt; children of believers: [Believers] (in Exod. 4:31): <small>AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED</small>; the children of believers, as stated (in Gen. 15:6): <small>AND HE</small> (Abram) <small>BELIEVED IN THE LORD</small>. However, it is necessary [for you] to be afflicted in {his} [your] body, since the one who suspects the innocent is afflicted in his body. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:6): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID TO HIM AGAIN: PUT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the Masoretic Text, which would be translated <small>PLEASE PUT</small>.</i> <small>YOUR HAND IN YOUR BOSOM</small>. [<small>SO HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS BOSOM; AND WHEN HE WITHDREW IT, BEHOLD, IT WAS LEPROUS, &lt; AS WHITE &gt; AS SNOW</small>.] The Holy One said to Israel: Look at the difference between you and the peoples of the world. When they sin, I afflict them first in their bodies and after that in their houses, as stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH WITH GREAT PLAGUES, AND &lt; ALSO &gt; HIS HOUSE</small>. But if you sin, I afflict your houses first. Where is it shown? {Where it is stated} [From what they read on the matter] (in Lev. 14:34): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH I AM GIVING YOU FOR A POSSESSION, AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>.

Siman 12

(Lev. 14:34:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &lt; OF CANAAN</small>…, <small>AND WHEN I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS &gt;</small>. How has the land sinned, that it should be afflicted?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:4.</i> It is simply that the land is afflicted for human sin, as stated (in Ps. 107:33–34): <small>&lt; HE TURNS</small>…; <small>&gt; A FRUITFUL LAND INTO A SALT MARSH BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT</small>. For what reason did suffering come into the world? Because of the people, so that they would look, consider, and say: Whoever sins is afflicted, and whoever does not sin is not afflicted. So why are the trees, the stones and the walls afflicted? So that their owners will look &lt; at them &gt; and repent. And so you find that when Israel sinned, the Holy One intended to exile them. The Holy One said: If I exile them at the start, they will become a shame and a disgrace to all the nations. What did he do? He brought Sennacherib the Wicked upon all the &lt; other &gt; nations and exiled them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 10:14): <small>MY HAND</small> (the hand of Sennacherib) <small>HAS FOUND THE WEALTH OF THE PEOPLES LIKE A NEST</small>. It is also written (in vs. 13): <small>AND</small> I (Sennacherib) <small>HAVE REMOVED THE BORDERS OF PEOPLES</small>. The Holy One said: When Israel sees that I have exiled the nations of the world, they will repent and fear my judgment. It is so stated (in Zeph. 3:6–7): <small>I HAVE ROOTED OUT THE NATIONS; THEIR CORNER TOWERS ARE DESOLATE</small>…. <small>AND I SAID: SURELY YOU WILL FEAR ME</small>… ! When they did not repent, they immediately went into exile. Therefore the Holy One warns them and first afflicts their houses, so that they will repent. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:34): <small>AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. For him to repent is preferable; but if not, one is afflicted in his body, as stated (in Lev. 15:2): <small>WHEN ANY MAN HAS A DISCHARGE ISSUING FROM HIS FLESH</small>…. {Therefore, the stones are afflicted at first.} For him to repent is preferable; but if not, his clothes are afflicted, as stated (in Lev. 13:47): <small>WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT</small>. Then if he does not repent, he is afflicted in his body. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 13:40): <small>WHEN SOMEONE'S HEAD BECOMES HAIRLESS &lt; SO THAT HE IS BALD, HE IS CLEAN &gt;</small>; but still with a balding of the head there is a substantial doubt whether he is unclean or clean.

The Holy One said: Before I created the human, I prepared all these things for him. &lt; The situation &gt; is comparable to an evil slave who was sold. His &lt; new &gt; master went to buy him. Since he knew about him being an evil slave, he took along chains and whips so that, if he rebelled, he might subdue him with them. When he did rebel, he brought out the chains and chained him. He brought out the whips and beat him. The slave said to him: Did you not know that I was an evil slave? Why did you buy me? He said to him: Because I knew that you were an evil slave, I prepared chains and whips for you, so that if you rebelled, I might subdue you with them.

Siman 13

(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD &lt; FOR MANY DAYS, NOT AT THE TIME OF HER IMPURITY &gt;</small>…. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted for a menstruant to sleep in the same bed with her husband, when he is in his clothes and she is in her clothes, one on one side and one on the other?<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:5; <i>Shab.</i> 13a.</i> Thus have our masters taught: It is forbidden &lt; for them &gt; to lie down &lt; together &gt;, because one does not one put a loophole before the observant person, and certainly not before the thief. Thus the sages compare the matter to a fire in the straw; and it says (in Lev. 18:19): <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT COME NEAR A WOMEN DURING HER PERIOD OF MENSTRUAL UNCLEANNESS</small>. &lt; This is &gt; to teach you that the Holy One warns Israel about sanctification and about purity, lest they act according to the practice of star worshipers and become unclean through their wives when they are menstruating; for whoever has intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating is under sentence of being cut off, as stated (in Lev. 20:18): <small>AND IF A MAN LIES WITH A WOMAN &lt; WHEN SHE IS &gt; UNWELL</small>…, <small>THEY BOTH SHALL BE CUT OFF &lt; FROM AMONG THEIR PEOPLE &gt;</small>. Because star worshipers do not stay away from the menstruant they are under sentence of being cut off, as stated (in Deut. 12:29): <small>WHEN THE LORD</small> [<small>GOD</small>] <small>HAS CUT OFF THE GENTILES</small>. Because all the star worshipers are children of menstruants, they like their idolatry are called an impurity, an uncleanness, an abomination, and a destruction. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 7:26): <small>DO NOT BRING AN ABOMINATION UNTO YOUR HOUSE</small>.

Siman 14

(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR MANY DAYS</small>. But are there not seven days in a menstrual period?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Lev. 5:6.</i> So why did it call them <small>MANY DAYS</small>? [Simply because she is separated from her husband, and they are days of suffering. For that reason it calls them <small>MANY DAYS</small>.] Similarly (in Exod. 2:23): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE COURSE OF THOSE MANY DAYS &lt; THAT THE KING OF EGYPT DIED &gt;</small>. It calls them <small>MANY DAYS</small>, because they were days of suffering.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 19:5.</i>

Siman 15

(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR MANY DAYS</small>. Those are three days. How so? The woman is unclean for seven days and becomes clean on the eighth day. If she sees blood on that day, she observes a day like the rest and becomes clean. &lt; If &gt; she sees it again on the {eighth} [ninth] day, she observes that day and becomes clean. [If she sees it again on the tenth day, she observes that one and is clean.] Ergo, three days which are <small>MANY DAYS</small>. However, if she sees blood on day eleven, which is the fourth day of her cleansing, she returns to her uncleanness, and observes her seven days of menstruation from the beginning; for so have the sages taught. There are eleven days between one menstrual period and another; therefore, the woman has to keep fifteen days. How does she do so? She keeps seven days of her menstrual period. Then after that she counts seven clean days and becomes clean on the eighth day. Then she performs a strict immersion after sunset, and she is lawful for her husband. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:28): <small>AND WHEN SHE IS CLEAN FROM HER DISCHARGE</small>, [<small>SHE SHALL COUNT OFF SEVEN DAYS, AND AFTER THAT SHE SHALL BE CLEAN</small>].

Siman 16

(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>. Why a woman and not a man?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 5:9.</i> Previously it applied to men and women. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:2): <small>WHEN ANY MAN HAS A DISCHARGE ISSUING FROM HIS FLESH</small>. R. Meir says: The man's uncleanness was more serious than the woman's uncleanness. Why? Because the uncleanness of women is a sign of children; however, that of a man is &lt; a sign &gt; of suffering. Thus it is stated (in vs. 3): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE UNCLEANNESS</small> {<small>FROM</small>} [<small>IN</small>] <small>HIS DISCHARGE, WHETHER HIS FLESH RUNS WITH HIS DISCHARGE OR WHETHER HIS FLESH IS SEALED FROM HIS DISCHARGE</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The next verses (4–12) stress just how contagious his discharge really is.</i> &lt; i.e. &gt; something which is sealed and closed. Previously the men saw blood, until Rachel arose [and said] (in Gen. 31:35): <small>FOR THE PERIOD OF WOMEN IS UPON ME</small>. Then it was given to her. Therefore (in Exod. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>.

Siman 17

(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>…. Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 2:6): <small>WOMEN DIE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CHILDBIRTH FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS</small>:<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 2:1; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 2:1; Lev. 5:9.</i> <small>&lt; BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CAREFUL IN REGARD TO MENSTRUATION, IN REGARD TO THE</small> <i><small>HALLAH</small></i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priest’s share of the dough.</i> <small>AND IN REGARD TO THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMP</small>. <small>&gt;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Sabbath lamp.</i> Why? Because the Adversary (<i>Satan</i>) only makes accusations<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kategorein.</i></i> in time of danger. Now the three of them are from the Torah. Where is it shown about menstruation? (Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>. Where is it shown about the <i>hallah</i>? (Numb. 15:20:) <small>&lt; YOU SHALL SET ASIDE &gt; THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH AS A <i>HALLAH</i> OFFERING</small>…. [Where is it shown] in regard to the lighting of the &lt; Sabbath &gt; lamp? Thus have our masters taught: Where is it shown that a person is to be zealous and diligent in the lighting of the &lt; Sabbath &gt; lamp? Where it is stated (in Is. 58:13): <small>AND YOU CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>. This refers to the lighting of the lamp. And why were &lt; these commandments &gt; transmitted to the woman?<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 17:8; <i>yShab</i>. 2:4 (5b).</i> The Holy One said: She cut off the lamp of the world, since it is written (in Prov. 20:27): <small>THE LAMP OF GOD IS THE BREATH OF ADAM</small>. Therefore, she shall observe the commandments of the lamp. [In regard to <i>Hallah</i>,] the Holy One said: She defiled the <i>hallah</i> of the world. This was the first Adam, who was the <i>hallah</i> of the world; for R. Jose ben Qetsartah has said: Just as the woman moistens her dough with water and after that takes out <i>hallah</i>, so it was with the first Adam (in Gen. 2:6): <small>AND A MIST</small> ('<i><small>D</small></i>) <small>WENT UP FROM THE EARTH</small>, and after that (in vs. 7): [<small>THE LORD GOD</small>] <small>FORMED THE HUMAN</small> ('<i><small>DM</small></i>) <small>OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND &gt;</small> [….] In regard to menstruation, the Holy One said: She shed the blood of the first Adam, and she was sentenced to have her own blood shed, since it is stated (in Gen. 9:6): <small>WHOEVER SHEDS HUMAN BLOOD, &lt; BY A HUMAN WILL HIS BLOOD BE SHED &gt;</small>. She shall observe her menstrual period to atone for the blood that she shed. Ergo (in Lev. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>…. Therefore, the Holy One compares the uncleanness of Israel to the uncleanness of the menstrual period, when &lt; a woman &gt; is unclean and &lt; then &gt; purified. So the Holy One is going to purify Israel, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE</small>….

Siman 18

Another interpretation: (Ezek. 36:17:) <small>THEIR WAY BEFORE ME WAS LIKE THE UNCLEANNESS OF A MENSTRUOUS WOMAN</small>, and not like the uncleanness of a corpse. With a corpse in the house, a high priest does not enter there; but in the case of a menstruous woman, a high priest enters into the house with her and sits with her on the couch,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">‘<i><small>YSTWW</small></i>’, probably from the Gk.: <i>histion</i>, which means “something woven.”</i> but on condition that it not be shaken (when they sit on it). So if Israel were compared to the impurity of death, the Divine Presence would never return upon them; however, they are compared to the menstruant, because there is cleansing for her in a <i>mikveh</i>, so that the priest may be with her in the house and not be afraid. Thus the Divine Presence dwells with Israel, even though they are more unclean than those who serve stars, as stated (in Lev. 16:16): <small>&lt; THE TENT OF MEETING &gt; THAT DWELLS WITH THEM IN THE MIDST OF THEIR UNCLEANNESSES</small>. Our masters have said: When Israel was in Egypt, the women did not see menstrual blood, because the fear of Egypt was upon them. And also after Israel left Egypt, they did not see menstruation in the desert, because the Divine Presence was among them. Moreover, at first the women accepted the Torah. It is so stated (in Exod. 19:3): <small>THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB</small>. These are the women.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 28:2. Cf. <i>Shab.</i> 118b: “R. Jose said:…, but my wife &lt; I called &gt; my house.”</i> (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND DECLARE TO THE SONS OF ISRAEL</small>. These are the men. And so it says (in Cant. 6:10): <small>TERRIBLE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Buber, n. 91, points out that ‘<i>ayummah</i> (<small>TERRIBLE</small>) is seen as related to ‘<i>emah</i> (“fear”), in that the fear of the Divine Presence was upon them.</i> <small>LIKE BANNERED HOSTS</small>. Now about them it is stated (in Cant. 4:12): <small>A LOCKED GARDEN</small> [<small>IS MY SISTER, MY BRIDE</small>], <small>A LOCKED FOUNTAIN</small>, [<small>A SEALED SPRING</small>]. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you were clean and have returned to uncleanness; but in the world to come I myself will cleanse [you] so that you shall not ever become unclean. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE; I WILL PURIFY YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS</small>.

(Vs. 2:) <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &lt; HAPPENS &gt; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &lt; FALLS &gt; TO THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.

(Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>&lt; AND &gt; TO THE WICKED</small>. This refers to Nimrod, who incited all the whole world against the Holy One. The former is dead, and the latter is dead. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO THE GOOD, TO THE CLEAN</small>, [<small>AND TO THE UNCLEAN. TO THE GOOD</small>] refers to David, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 16:12): <small>&lt; WITH &gt; BEAUTIFUL EYES AND GOOD APPEARANCE TO THE UNCLEAN</small> refers to Nebuchadnezzar. The former laid the foundation of the Temple, and the latter destroyed it. The former reigned forty years, and the latter reigned forty years. (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) <small>TO THE ONE WHO SACRIFICES</small>.

(Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND TO THE ONE WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE</small>. This refers to Jeroboam, who stopped Israel from going up &lt; to Jerusalem &gt; on pilgrimage, as stated (in I Kings 12:28): <small>ENOUGH OF YOUR GOING UP TO JERUSALEM</small>…. The latter one reigned after the former one. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD</small>. This refers to Moses, of whom it is stated (in Exod. 2:2): <small>AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>. This refers to the spies (in Numb. 13–14)), of whom it is stated (in Prov. 13:21): <small>EVIL PURSUES SINNERS</small>. Moses did not enter the land, neither did those &lt; spies &gt; enter the land. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND THE ONE WHO TAKES AN OATH</small> (without keeping it). This refers to Zedekiah, of whom it is stated (in II Chron 36:13): <small>&lt; AND &gt; HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR, WHO HAD MADE HIM TAKE AN OATH</small> [<small>BY</small>] <small>GOD</small>.

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2): <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD</small>. This refers to the children of Aaron. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>.

(Lev. 10:2:) <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM</small>. The former offered sacrifice and were consumed by fire, and the latter offered sacrifice and were consumed by fire. So Solomon laments (in Eccl. 9:2): <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD, SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>. When the children of Aaron were consumed by fire, he sat and complained, saying: What sin has befallen my children that this should happen to them? Immediately the Holy One appeared to Moses and said to him: Go &lt; and &gt; console him. Where is it shown? Where it is so written (in Lev. 16:2) after the death of Aaron's two sons. And what did he say to him? <small>SPEAK</small> (<i><small>DBR</small></i>) <small>UNTO YOUR BROTHER AARON</small>…. Now speaking (rt.: <i><small>DBR</small></i>) can only mean consolation, even as you say (in Is. 40:2): <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: <small>DBR</small>) <small>TENDERLY TO JERUSALEM</small>….

When he came to his mother, she said to him: What did your father do to you. He told her: Daddy took me, brought me up mountains, brought me down valleys, brought me up to the top of a particular mountain, and built an altar. So he told the whole story.

Eleazar of Modim said: Go out and see how grievous the death of Aaron's sons was for the Holy One, for in every place that &lt; Scripture &gt; mentions their death, it mentions their transgression. And why all this? So as not to give those who come into the world a pretext for saying: Disgraceful acts were secretly &lt; reckoned &gt; to their &lt; account &gt;, because of which they died.

Johanan said: &lt; There was &gt; actual eating [and drinking], since it is written (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING'S FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>. R. Tanhuma said: &lt; Exod. 24:11 &gt; teaches that they became bold in their hearts and stood on their feet, &lt; while &gt; they feasted their eyes on the Divine Presence. R.

And in addition, &lt; the boldness of Aaron's sons may be inferred &gt; from this (i.e., from Numb. 3:4): <small>BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Was it <small>BEFORE THE LORD</small> that they died? &lt; The verse &gt; simply teaches that it is grievous for the Omnipresent when children of righteous people pass away during their &lt; parents' &gt; lifetime.

(Ibid.:) <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. [R. Meir said:] Did they die <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>?

R.

[Judan] said: For what reason is the death of Aaron (Deut. 10:6) near the breaking of the tablets (Deut. 9:17)?

What is written there (in Numb. 17:21 [6])? <small>THEN MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL; AND THEIR PRINCES GAVE HIM A STAFF, A STAFF FOR EACH PRINCE</small>…. So he wrote the name of each and every tribe on its staff. He also wrote the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi and put it in the middle. Moses said &lt; It was &gt; lest the children of Israel say: It smelled the Divine Presence and bore fruit. [Moses said: See, I am putting it in the middle so as not to give a pretext, as stated (in Numb. 17:21 [6], cont.): <small>AND THE STAFF OF AARON WAS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR STAFFS</small>.] What is written there (in vs. 22–23 [7–8])? <small>THEN MOSES PLACED THE STAFFS &lt; BEFORE THE LORD IN THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY &gt;</small>…. <small>AND THERE THE STAFF OF AARON &lt; OF THE HOUSE OF LEVI &gt; HAD SPROUTED; IT &lt; HAD PUT FORTH SPROUTS, PRODUCED BLOSSOMS, &gt; AND HAD BORNE ALMONDS</small>.

[From where did the sin come, for which they received [their &lt; repayment &gt;?]<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to putting all of section 13 within square brackets, Buber has also set individual words and phrases within this section in square brackets.</i> R. Hosha'ya said: When Moses along with the elders of Israel went up from the desert; Aaron, Hur, seventy elders, Nadab, and Abihu went up with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Lev. 6:7.</i> Moses and Aaron walked first, Nadab and Abihu walked after them, and all the elders of Israel walked after them. Now Nadab and Abihu reflected in their hearts and said: When will these two elders pass away so that we may receive authority and become first in everything: The Holy One said to them (in Prov. 27:1): <small>DO NOT BOAST OF TOMORROW</small>. A lot of colts have died, and their skins have been made into coverings for their mother's backs. He said to them: From that time you should have gotten your &lt; just deserts &gt;, but what shall I do? See, I shall wait for you until the Tabernacle goes up, and after that I shall judge them. Therefore, when the Tabernacle was standing they received their sentence <sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>apophasis.</i></i> and died. (Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON'S TWO SONS</small>.
R. Aha said: From where did they receive their &lt; just deserts &gt;? &lt; It was &gt; simply that they were not coming together for being fruitful and multiplying.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Lev. 6:7.</i> They were saying: We are apprentices for the high priesthood; so should we take wives who are not worthy of us? R. Aha said (in the words of Ps. 78:63): <small>FIRE DEVOURED THEIR YOUNG MEN</small>. Why? Because (ibid., cont.) <small>THEIR MAIDENS HAD NO NUPTIAL SONG</small>.
Our masters say: &lt; It was &gt; because their eyes strayed away from the Divine Presence. They (i.e., Nadab and Abihu) said: Moses did not do so, when (according to Exod. 24:9–10) he went into the firmament and beheld the Divine Presence; for he had no need of either eating or drinking. With us also, when we behold the Divine Presence, we shall have no need of either eating or drinking. Even so, (according to vs. 11): <small>THEY BEHELD GOD</small>, but they did need to eat and drink, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THEY ATE AND DRANK</small>. From that time the Holy One sought to stretch out his hand against them. The Holy One said: I shall wait until the Tabernacle is made. Then when they enter to sacrifice (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>), I shall carry out the divine judgment upon them. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 16:1, cont.): <small>WHEN THEY DREW NEAR</small> (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>) <small>BEFORE THE LORD, THEY DIED. BEFORE THE LORD</small> is written two times (in Numb. 3:4): <small>BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED BEFORE THE LORD, WHEN THEY OFFERED ALIEN FIRE</small> [<small>BEFORE THE LORD</small>]. Why two times? The Holy One said: Bring out the dead from before me, for so it is written (in Lev. 10:4): <small>DRAW NEAR AND CARRY YOUR BROTHERS AWAY FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY</small>. When Israel, as it were, is in trouble, he also is with them; for so it is written (in Is. 63:9): <small>IN ALL THEIR TROUBLE, IT TROUBLED HIM</small>. R. Meir said (concerning Exod. 14:30): <small>SO THE LORD SAVED</small> (<i><small>WYWSh</small></i>', voweled as <i>wayyosha</i>') <small>&lt; ISRAEL &gt; ON THAT DAY</small>: The written text (<i>ketiv</i>) &lt; reads &gt; <small>SO &lt; THE LORD &gt; WAS SAVED</small> (<i><small>WYWSh</small></i>', voweled <i>wayyiwwasha</i>') <small>&lt; ON THAT DAY WITH ISRAEL &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 6:18; below, Numb. 1:10; <i>Tanh</i>.

(Lev. 17:1 &amp; 3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING</small>…. <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB, OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP</small>.

Because every hour that it is traveling, it is praising the Holy One; and as long as it praises &lt; the Holy One &gt;, it has the power to travel &lt; its course &gt;. Joshua therefore told it to be silent, as stated (ibid.): <small>O SUN, BE QUIET AT GIBEON</small>. The sun said to Joshua: Is someone younger saying, <small>BE QUIET</small>, to someone older? I was created on the fourth &lt; day &gt;, while human beings were created on the sixth; so are you saying, <small>BE QUIET</small>, to me? Joshua said to &lt; the sun &gt;: When a young free person has an elderly slave, does he not say to him: Be silent? In the case of our father Abraham, the Holy One delivered (rt.: <i><small>PNH</small></i>) heaven and earth to him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19): <small>THEN HE BLESSED HIM, AND SAID: BLESSED BE ABRAM OF GOD MOST HIGH, ACQUIRER</small> (rt.: <i><small>PNH</small></i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Apart from the context in the midrash, a traditional biblical translation would read: <small>CREATOR</small>.</i> <small>OF HEAVEN AND EARTH</small>.

[Another interpretation (of Lev. 17:3): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>.

THEN YOU SHALL DELIGHT IN SACRIFICES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, BURNT OFFERINGS, AND WHOLE OFFERINGS</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 6:10.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a rich and noble bachelor, who has no wife. His house was not &lt; really &gt; a house. Why? When the tenants came, he said to them: Go to the store. Why? Because he had neither house nor wife. He took a wife. He said to them: Whatever you bring me, from now on bring them up to the house. Thus all the days before Moses erected the tent of meeting, they offered sacrifices {from} [in] any place, as stated (in Exod. 24:5): <small>THEN HE SENT YOUTHS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THEY OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS</small>….

[(Lev. 17:2:) <small>THIS IS THE THING</small>.] The Holy One foresaw that the Temple was going to be destroyed; so the Holy One said: As long as the Temple exists, you shall sacrifice within it, &lt; and &gt; there will be atonement for you; but when the Temple does not exist, how will there be atonement for you? Occupy yourselves with the words of Torah, because they are comparable with offerings, and they will atone for you. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>THIS IS THE THING</small> (literally:<small>WORD</small>). So also the prophet says (in Hos. 14:3 [2]): <small>TAKE YOUR WORDS WITH YOU, &lt; AND RETURN UNTO THE LORD</small>…; <small>LET US RENDER AS BULLOCKS THE OFFERING OF OUR LIPS &gt;</small>. The words of Torah resemble all the offerings. One offers wine as a libation upon the altar, as stated (in Numb. 15:5): <small>AND A QUARTER HIN OF WINE FOR A LIBATION</small>; and Torah resembles wine, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>AND DRINK OF THE WINE I HAVE MIXED</small>. {And Torah resembles bread, as stated} [One offers bread upon the altar, as stated (in Numb. 28:2): <small>MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING</small>; and so it says] (in Exod. 25:30): <small>AND YOU SHALL SET THE</small> [<small>SHOW</small>] <small>BREAD UPON THE TABLE</small> [<small>BEFORE ME ALWAYS</small>]; and Torah resembles bread, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. One offers oil upon the altar, as stated (in Lev. 2:5): <small>FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH OIL</small>; and Torah resembles oil, as stated (in Eccl. 9:8): <small>ALWAYS LET YOUR CLOTHES BE WHITE, AND LET THERE BE NO LACK OF OIL UPON YOUR HEAD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

(Lev. 17:3–4:) <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS</small>…, <small>AND DOES NOT BRING IT UNTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING &lt; TO OFFER IT AS A SACRIFICE &gt;</small>…, <small>&lt; BLOODGUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED TO THAT PERSON &gt;</small>. Isaiah has said (in Is. 66:3): <small>ONE WHO SLAUGHTERS THE BULL SLAYS A HUMAN</small>. Whenever anyone steals his comrade's bull and slaughters it, it is as if he slays its owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 6:12.</i> Another interpretation of <small>ONE WHO SLAUGHTERS</small> (<i>shohet</i>) <small>THE BULL SLAYS A HUMAN</small>.

[It is as though he has taken (<i>shohet</i>) a life.] Thus it is stated (in Lev. 17:4): <small>BLOODGUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED</small> [<small>TO THAT PERSON: HE HAS SHED BLOOD</small>]. So whoever slaughters (<i>shohet</i>) at the Tabernacle [honors me, as stated (in Ps. 50:23): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES A THANK OFFERING</small>] <small>HONORS ME</small>. Now what reward shall I repay to him? When I bring salvation to Israel, he will have the right to see it, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND TO THE ONE WHO SETS HIS WAY ARIGHT I WILL SHOW THE SALVATION OF GOD</small>. R. Abbahu said: All salvation that comes to Israel is of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 91:15–16): <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small> […, <small>AND SHOW HIM MY SALVATION</small>]. Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as you said, <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small>, he is saved, as it were; &lt; therefore &gt; (in the words of Ps. 60:7 [5]), <small>SAVE WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ANSWER ME</small>. Thus if you answer us, salvation is yours, as stated (in Ps. 80:2–3 [1–2]) <small>&lt; GIVE EAR, O SHEPHERD OF ISRAEL</small>,… &gt; <small>AND COME TO SAVE US</small>. R.

"Your savior" is not written here, but <small>YOUR SALVATION</small>. [He, as it were, was saved.] R.

"A people the Lord saved" is not written here, but <small>A PEOPLE SAVED THROUGH THE LORD</small>. It is comparable to a person who had a seah of wheat for a second tithe. What does he do? He gives coins to redeem it. So &lt; it was &gt; in the case of Israel. Through what were they redeemed? Through the Holy One, as it were: <small>A PEOPLE SAVED THROUGH THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you are saved by means of flesh and blood: in Egypt by means of Moses and Aaron, in the days of Sisera by means of Barak and Deborah; among the Midianites by means of Shamgar ben Anath,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">According to Jud. 3:31, Shamgar delivered Israel, not from Midianites, but from Philistines.</i> and so on through the Judges.

Siman 1

(Lev. 19:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>, [<small>BECAUSE I, THE LORD YOUR GOD, AM HOLY</small>]. This text is related (to Is. 5:16): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS BEEN EXALTED THROUGH JUSTICE, AND THE HOLY GOD HAS BEEN SANCTIFIED THROUGH HOLINESS</small>. When did the Holy One become exalted in his world?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:1.</i> When he brought about judgment and justice among the peoples of the world. It is so stated (in Is. 3:13): <small>THE LORD STANDS UP TO PLEAD A CAUSE, AND RISES TO JUDGE PEOPLES</small>. It also says (in Dan. 7:9): <small>I LOOKED UNTIL THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE</small> &lt; or <small>THROWN DOWN &gt;</small> (<i>remiw</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Aramaic word can mean both <small>WERE SET IN PLACE</small> and <small>WERE THROWN DOWN</small>. The former meaning better fits the biblical context; but one of the midrashic interpretations given here requires the latter meaning.</i> What is the meaning of <small>THRONES</small> (in the plural)? Were there a lot of thrones, when &lt; there is &gt; that which is written (in Is. 6:1): <small>I SAW THE LORD SEATED UPON A THRONE</small> (in the singular)? What is the meaning of <small>THRONES</small>? R. Jose the Galilean and R. Aqiva differed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hag</i>. 14a.</i> One said: <small>THRONES</small> denotes the throne plus its <i>hypopodion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Greek word means “footstool.”</i> {i.e., its footstool}; and the other said: These are thrones that belong to the nations of the world, since the Holy One is going to throw them down, as stated (in Hag. 2:22): <small>THEN I WILL THROW DOWN THE THRONE</small>&lt; S &gt; <small>OF KINGDOMS, AND DESTROY THE KINGDOMS OF THE GENTILES</small>. You know [for yourself] that this is so. "Thrones were set up," is not written here (in Dan. 7:9), but <small>THRONES WERE THROWN DOWN</small>. Thus it is written (in Exod. 15:1 or 21): <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN</small> (rt.: <i><small>RMH</small></i>) <small>INTO THE SEA</small>. &lt; Our &gt; masters say: What is the meaning of <small>THRONES</small>? In the age to come the Holy One will sit down, and the angels will place thrones for the great ones of Israel for them to sit down, so that the Holy One will be sitting with them like the president of the court (<i>av bet din</i>). Then they shall judge the peoples of the world, as stated (in Is. 3:14): <small>THE LORD WILL COME IN JUDGMENT ALONG WITH THE ELDERS OF HIS PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 5:12; see Wisdom 3:8; I Enoch 38:5; 48:9; I Corinthians 6:2.</i> "Against the elders of his people" is not written here, but <small>ALONG WITH THE ELDERS &lt; OF HIS PEOPLE &gt;</small>. &lt; Scripture &gt; is teaching that the Holy One will sit along with the elders and princes of Israel to judge the nations of the world. And which &lt; thrones &gt; are they? These are the thrones of the house of David and the elders of Israel, as stated (in Ps. 122:5): <small>THERE STOOD THE THRONES OF JUDGMENT, THRONES OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>. R. Pinhas said in the name of R. Hilqiyah the Southerner (i.e., from Judah), &lt; who spoke &gt; in the name of R. Reuben: If you say: When thrones stand there for judgment, they are thrones of the house of David. Then what is &lt; the meaning of &gt; (Dan. 7:9): <small>AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT</small>? That he sits among them like the president of the court, and with them he judges the nations. It is therefore written (ibid.): <small>UNTIL THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKE CLEAN WOOL</small>? When the Holy One cleanses himself from the nations of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in the traditional <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, Lev. 6:11 (Jerusalem: Eshkol, n.d.), which reads: “The Holy One cleanses himself from the worshipers of idols.”</i> he gives them compensation for the easy commandments which they have observed in this world. &lt; He does so &gt; in order to judge them and convict them in the world to come, so that they will have no excuse and have no merit found for them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 14:32): <small>AND WHAT WILL HE ANSWER THE ANGELS OF</small><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>mal’akhe.</i> In the biblical context, the word should be rendered as “messengers of,” but the midrash interprets the passage eschatologically.</i> A <small>&lt; GIVEN &gt; NATION? THAT THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED ZION, AND IN IT THERE SHALL THE AFFLICTED OF HIS PEOPLE TAKE REFUGE</small>. Then he immediately renders the judgment against them. At that time the Holy One becomes exalted in his world, as stated (in Is. 5:16): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS IS EXALTED IN JUDGMENT</small>, [<small>AND THE HOLY GOD IS SANCTIFIED IN JUSTICE</small>]. What is the meaning of (ibid.): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS IS EXALTED IN JUDGMENT</small>? That he is sanctified in his world in justice, because he teaches concerning Israel what is stated (in Is. 63:1): <small>I SPEAK IN JUSTICE</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: I am sanctified in you, as stated (in Is. 29:23): <small>FOR WHEN &lt; JACOB &gt; SEES HIS CHILDREN IN HIS MIDST, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, THEY SHALL SANCTIFY MY NAME; YES, THEY SHALL SANCTIFY THE HOLY ONE OF JACOB</small>…. And so it says (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>. So you are sanctified in me, and I am sanctified in you, as stated (in Lev. 11:44; cf. 19:2): [<small>SO YOU SHALL SANCTIFY YOURSELVES</small>] <small>AND BE HOLY, BECAUSE I AM HOLY</small>.

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Before I created my world, the ministering angels praised my name through you and sanctified me through you by saying (in I Chron. 16:36): <small>BLESSED IS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:2.</i> When the first Adam was created, the angels said: Sovereign of the World, is this the one in whose name we are praising you? He told them, [No]. This person is a thief, since it is stated (of him in Gen. 3:17): <small>&lt; BECAUSE YOU OBEYED YOUR WIFE AND &gt; ATE OF THE TREE ABOUT WHICH I COMMANDED YOU, &lt; SAYING: DO NOT EAT OF IT. CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU &gt;</small>. &lt; When &gt; Noah came, they said to him (i.e., to the Holy One): Is this the one? He told them, [No]. This person is a drunkard, since it is stated (of him in Gen. 9:21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK</small>…. &lt; When &gt; Abraham came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them: This is a stranger (<i>ger</i>). &lt; When &gt; Isaac came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them: This one loves my enemy, as stated (in Gen. 25:28): <small>NOW ISAAC LOVED ESAU</small>. When Jacob came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them, Yes, for so it says (in Gen. 35:10): <small>GOD SAID TO HIM: YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE JACOB, BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ISRAEL</small>…. So all Israel was called by his name. At that time the Holy One, Blessed be He, sanctified them because of his name, as stated (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>. The Holy One said to him: Since you were sanctified for my name before I created my world, Be holy as I am holy. It is so stated (in Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY, BECAUSE I, THE LORD YOUR GOD, AM HOLY</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who betrothed a wife. He said to her because you have been betrothed (literally: sanctified) to my name, I am a king and you, a queen. Just as it (i.e., my name) is an honor for me, so it is an honor for you. Why? Because you are my wife. Thus the Holy One said to Moses. Go and sanctify (i.e., go and betroth) Israel, as stated (in Exod. 19:10): <small>GO UNTO THE PEOPLE AND SANCTIFY</small> (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>) <small>THEM TODAY AND TOMORROW</small>. {The Holy One sanctified them} [He sanctified them. The Holy One came] and said to them (in Exod. 19:6): <small>BUT YOU SHALL BE FOR ME A KINGDOM OF PRIESTS, A HOLY</small> (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>) <small>NATION</small>. Why? (Lev. 19:2:) <small>BECAUSE</small>… <small>I AM HOLY</small>. And you also shall be sanctified (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>) just as you have sanctified me, as stated (in Lev. 19:2) <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small> (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>)…. The Holy One said unto them: If you are worthy, you shall be called a congregation of saints (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>); &lt; if &gt; you are unworthy, you shall be called an evil congregation. (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small>…?

Siman 3

(Lev. 19:2:) <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. What reason did he have to speak this parashah in an assembly?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:3; Lev. R. 24:5.</i> Why did he not say: <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, as in the rest of the parashiot,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in Exod. 14:2, 15; 25:2; 31:13 Lev. 1:2; 4:2; 7:23, 29; 12:2; 15:2; 18:2; 23:2, 10, 24, 34; 25:2; 27:2; Numb. 5:6, 12; 6:2; 9:10; 15:2, 18, 38; 17:17 (2); 19:2; 33:51; 35:10.</i> rather than <small>&lt; SPEAK &gt; UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION &lt; OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &gt;</small>? Because all of the &lt; Ten &gt; Commandments are included within it. How?

        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:2 = Deut. 5:6): I <small>&lt; AM &gt; THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:2): I <small>&lt; AM &gt; THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:3 = Deut. 5:7): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO &lt; OTHER GODS BESIDE ME &gt;</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:4): <small>DO NOT TURN UNTO IDOLS</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:7 = Deut. 5:11): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE &lt; THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN &gt;</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:12): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SWEAR FALSELY BY MY NAME</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:8; cf. Deut. 5:12): <small>REMEMBER</small> [<small>THE SABBATH DAY</small>]; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:3): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:12 = Deut. 5:16); <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:3, cont.): <small>YOU EACH SHALL FEAR HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 = Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MURDER</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:16): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STAND OVER THE BLOOD OF YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [14] = Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:2): <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [15] = Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:11): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [16] = Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT BEAR &lt; FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:16): <small>YOU SHALL NOT GO AROUND AS A SLANDERER AMONG YOUR PEOPLE</small>.
        <br>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:14 [17] = Deut. 5:18): <small>YOU SHALL NOT COVET</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:13): <small>YOU SHALL NOT OPPRESS YOUR NEIGHBOR, AND YOU SHALL NOT ROB HIM</small>.
    
Here is [why the Holy One told him to speak this parashah in an assembly.] Because all of the &lt; Ten &gt; Commandments are included within it. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 19:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.

His way is in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 77:14 [13]): <small>YOUR WAY, O GOD, IS IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place). He is seen in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 63:3 [2]): <small>SO I HAVE BEHELD YOU IN HOLINESS</small>, (i.e., in the Holy Place). His praise<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalos</i> (“beautifully”).</i> is in holiness, as stated (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU, GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS</small>? The uncovering of his arm is in holiness, as stated (in Is. 52:10): <small>THE LORD HAS UNCOVERED &lt; HIS ARM OF HOLINESS &gt;</small>. Ergo (in Josh. 24:19) <small>HE IS A HOLY GOD</small> (with <small>HOLY</small> in the plural), because he is holy in all categories of holiness.

He is called holy, as stated (in Is. 6:3): <small>HOLY, HOLY, HOLY IS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>; and he has called Israel holy, [as stated (in Lev. 19:2): <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>.] The Holy One said: In this world you have been called holy, but in the world to come (according to Is. 4:3): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE ONE WHO IS LEFT IN ZION AND WHO REMAINS IN JERUSALEM SHALL BE CALLED HOLY</small>.

(Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: R.

So did David say (in Ps. 17:4): <small>KEEP ME AS THE PUPIL OF AN EYE</small>? The Holy One said to him (in Prov. 4:4): <small>KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE</small>.

(Lev. 19:23:) <small>NOW WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD</small>. This text is related (to Zech. 8:11–12): <small>BUT NOW &lt; I WILL NOT TREAT THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE &gt; AS IN THE FORMER DAYS</small>…; <small>FOR AS THE SEED OF PEACE, THE VINE SHALL YIELD ITS FRUIT, THE EARTH SHALL YIELD ITS HARVEST</small>…. What is the meaning of <small>NOT</small>… <small>AS IN THE FORMER DAYS</small>? When Israel went forth from Egypt and was walking in the desert, he brought down manna for them, brought over quails for them, and raised up the well for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The well in question is the well of Numb. 21:16–20, which according to traditional interpretations was movable and followed the children of Israel during the forty-year wanderings. See below, Numb. 1:2; 6:35, 47–50; <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:2; Numb. R. 1:2; 9:14; 13:20; 19:26; <i>Seder ‘Olam Rabbah</i> 5, 9–10; <i>TSuk.</i> 3:11–13; Pseudo-Philo 10:7; 11:15; also <i>TSot</i>. 11:1; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Wayassa</i>‘ 6; <i>Sifre Deut</i>. 32:14(305); <i>Shab.</i> 35a; <i>Ta‘an.</i> 9a; Eccl. R. 1:2; M. Prov. 14; the various targums to Numb. 21:16–20; and I Corinthians 10:4.</i> Then each and every tribe made itself a conduit for water, which [drew &lt; the water &gt; from the well and] brought it in to them. Moreover, [each and every one] planted fig trees, vines, and pomegranates, which yielded fruit on the same day, just as it was from the beginning at the creation of the world (according to Gen. 1:11): <small>FRUIT TREE BEARING FRUIT ACCORDING TO ITS KIND</small>. If the children of Adam had been worthy, it would have remained so until now. A person would plant a tree, and it would bear fruit immediately. When Adam sinned, the ground was cursed (according to Gen. 3:17): <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>. From now on (ibid., cont.:) <small>IN TOIL YOU SHALL YOU EAT OF IT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE</small>. He sowed wheat and it sprouted thistles, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>THORNS AND THISTLES SHALL IT SPROUT FOR YOU</small>. When they went forth from Egypt, [the Holy One] raised up the well for them. Then they made plantings beside its water, and the trees bore fruit on the same day. When the well disappeared, [all the bounty disappeared.] What is written there (in Numb. 20:5)? <small>A PLACE WITH NO SEEDS, FIGS, VINES, OR POMEGRANATES</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: Say to these Israelites: When you enter the land of Israel, I am restoring all the bounty to you, as stated (in Deut. 8:7–9): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND, &lt; A LAND WITH STREAMS OF WATER &gt;</small>…; <small>A LAND OF WHEAT AND BARLEY, OF VINES, FIGS, AND POMEGRANATES</small>…; <small>A LAND &lt; IN &gt; WHICH &lt; YOU SHALL EAT BREAD &gt; WITHOUT STINT</small>. When they came into the land of Israel they began sinning (rt.: <i><small>HT</small></i>'), as stated (in Jer. 2:7): <small>BUT YOU CAME AND DEFILED</small> (rt.: <i><small>HT</small></i>') <small>MY LAND</small>. So it did not bear fruits as was appropriate. They planted much and brought in little, as stated (in Hag. 1:6): <small>YOU HAVE SOWN MUCH AND BROUGHT IN LITTLE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 8:10.</i> Why? Because they ceased &lt; offering &gt; the firstfruits. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE EATEN WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>, after {the first fruits} [the shewbread] ceased. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE DRUNK WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>, after the libation of wine ceased.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WAGE EARNER HAS EARNED WAGES FOR A BAG WITH HOLES</small>, after almsgiving ceased. (Zech. 8:10:) <small>A PERSON HAD NO EARNINGS</small>, after pilgrims (going up to Jerusalem) ceased. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE CATTLE EARNED NOTHING</small>, after the offerings ceased. But in the age to come, the Holy One will not act so. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 8:11–12): <small>BUT NOW I WILL NOT TREAT THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE AS IN THE FORMER DAYS, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS; FOR AS THE SEED OF PEACE, THE VINE SHALL YIELD ITS FRUIT, THE EARTH SHALL YIELD ITS HARVEST, THE HEAVENS SHALL YIELD THEIR DEW, AND I WILL BEQUEATH ALL THESE THINGS TO THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE</small>….

(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Even though you find it (i.e., the land) full of all bounty, you shall not say: Let us settle down and not plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:8.</i> Rather, be careful in planting, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD</small>. Just as you came in and found plantings which others had planted, so you shall plant for your children, lest someone say: Since I am old and tomorrow I shall die, why should I toil for others. Solomon said (in Eccl. 3:11): <small>HE HAS MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME. HE ALSO HAS PUT ETERNITY INTO THEIR HEART. ETERNITY</small> ('<i><small>LM</small></i>) is what is written (without the <i>W</i> of the normal spelling, i.e., '<i><small>WLM</small></i>.) Why? If the Holy One had not hidden (rt.: '<i><small>LM</small></i>) the day of &lt; one's &gt; death from the children of Adam, a person would neither build nor plant; for he would have said: Tomorrow I shall die. Why should I persist in toiling for the sake of others? The Holy One, therefore, shut off (rt.: '<i><small>LM</small></i>) human hearts from death, so that one would build and plant. &lt; If &gt; he is worthy, [it will be] for himself; &lt; if &gt; unworthy, &lt; it will be &gt; for others. There is a story about the emperor Hadrian, that he was going to war and traveling with his troops to fight with a certain country for having rebelled against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 25:5; Eccl. R. 2:20:1.</i> Now he found a certain old man who was planting fig saplings. Hadrian said to him: You are an old man. &lt; Why are you &gt; persisting in taking the trouble to toil for others? He said to Hadrian: My Lord Emperor, here I am planting. If I am worthy, I shall eat of the fruit of my saplings; but if not, my children will eat. &lt; The emperor &gt; spent three years at war, and after three years he returned. What did that old man do? He took a fruit basket, filled it with the firstfruits of beautiful figs, and drew near to Hadrian. He said to him: My Lord Emperor: Take these figs, for I am the same old man whom you found when you were on your way &lt; to the war &gt;, when you said: You are an old man. Why are you taking the trouble to toil for others? See, the Holy One has already found me worthy to eat some fruit from my saplings. Now this &lt; fruit &gt; in my fruit basket is from those &lt; saplings &gt;. Hadrian said to his servants: Take it from him and fill it with gold coins. And so they did. The old man took the fruit basket full of gold coins and began to go about his house boasting to his wife and children. So he told them the story. Now a woman neighbor of his was there. She heard what the old man had said. She said to her husband: When all the children of Adam go &lt; through life &gt;, the Holy One gives to them and prepares bounty for them. But you dwell in your dark house in dark misfortune. See, our [neighbor] honored the emperor with a fruit basket of figs; and he filled it with gold coins for him. Now you get up, take a large basket, and fill it with varieties of choice fruit, with apples, figs, and the other varieties of beautiful fruit, since he loves them a lot. Go and honor him with them. Perhaps he will fill it with gold for you, as he did for our old neighbor. He went and heeded his wife. So he took a large basket, filled it with apples and figs, and loaded it on his shoulder. Then he approached the emperor on a side road<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>compendairia.</i></i> and said to him: My Lord Emperor, I heard that you love fruit, I have come to honor you with figs and apples. The Emperor said to his officers:<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>stratiotai</i> (“soldiers”).</i> Take the basket and hit<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">rt.: <i><small>TPH</small></i>. This root is similar to the root for “apples,” and both are transliterated identically. The only difference is that the root for “apples” is spelled with a <i>tav</i>, while the root for “hit” is spelled with a <i>tet</i>.</i> him on his face. And so they did. They hit him on his face, until his face swelled up; smashed his eyes; and made an example<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>deigma.</i></i> of him. So he went home as one of whom an example had been made and crying. Now she (i.e., his wife) thought that he was coming with a basket full of gold coins. So when she saw him with his face swollen and with his body shattered and beaten, she said to him: What is the matter with you? He said to her: When I heeded you and went to honor him with this gift,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i> they hit me on my face. If I had listened to you and put varieties of hard fruit in the basket, they would already have pelted my face and my whole body with them. And why all this? In order to teach you that evil women destroy their husbands. Therefore one should not cease from planting. Rather, just as he found, one should still continue to plant even though he is old. The Holy One said to Israel: Learn from me. He spoke &lt; by example &gt;, as it were. (Gen. 2:8): <small>AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN IN EDEN, IN THE EAST</small>.

There was also there a certain saint whose name was Jose the man of Zaythor. The first spirit appeared to him. It said to him: Rabbi, look at how many years I have been situated here; yet neither at noon nor at night have I harmed &lt; any &gt; mortal. {Also not during the day.} But now this spirit has come upon me from another place and wants to get me away from here in order to harm mortals. He said to it: What shall we do? It said to him: Take your staves and your scythes, and go out against it at the noon hour. Then say: Ours is winning! Ours is winning! And it will run away. They did so and drove it away from there. They used to say: They did not move from here until they saw, as it were, a clot of blood floating on the water. When the sages heard about the matter, they said: If something which was not created with a need for assistance needs assistance, how much the more so in the case of the children of Adam. David, therefore, said (in Ps. 20:3 [2]): <small>MAY HE SEND YOU HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY</small>.

(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 2:5): <small>I MADE GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR MYSELF, AND IN THEM I PLANTED EVERY KIND OF FRUIT TREE</small>. Do not all the children of Adam plant whatever they want?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:10.</i> Whatever someone plants in the earth, it produces either pepper or something &lt; else &gt;. If someone plants, they produce, except that no one knows the place of every plant, &lt; i.e. &gt; where to plant it. However, because Solomon was wise, he planted all the species of trees, [as stated (ibid.): <small>I MADE GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR MYSELF, IN WHICH I PLANTED EVERY KIND OF FRUIT TREE</small>.] R. Jannay said: Solomon even planted peppers, but how did he plant them? It is simply that Solomon was wise and knew the root of the foundation of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See Eccl. R. 2:5:1.</i> Where is it shown? (Ps. 50:2): <small>OUT OF ZION GOD HAS SHINED FORTH AS THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY</small>. Out of Zion has all of the whole world been perfected. Why is it called &lt; Foundation &gt; Stone?

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:5): <small>AND IN THEM I PLANTED</small>…. Just as a navel is set in the middle of a person, so the land of Israel is the navel of the world. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 38:12): <small>WHO DWELL ON THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH</small>. The land of Israel sits at the center of the world; Jerusalem is in the center of the land of Israel; the sanctuary is in the center of Jerusalem; the Temple building is in the center of the sanctuary; the ark is in the center of the Temple building; and the foundation stone, out of which the world was founded, is before the Temple building.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Another interpretation (of Lev. 19:23): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>.

Whatever the Holy One took from the peoples of the world he gave to Israel: lands of silver and gold, fields, vineyards, and cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev.7:11.</i> But he gave &lt; these &gt; to them only so that they would occupy themselves with the Torah, as stated (vs. 45): <small>IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP HIS STATUTES</small>…. But they did not do so. Instead (according to Ezek. 36:17): <small>AND THEY DEFILED</small> {<small>THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR WAY</small>} [<small>IT</small> (i.e., the land) <small>BY THEIR WAY AND BY THEIR DEEDS</small>].

(Ibid. cont.): <small>AND YOU MADE MY HERITAGE AN ABOMINATION</small>, by the image of Micah (in Jud. 17–18). So what did the Holy One do to them? He exiled them from it, as stated (in Deut. 29:27): <small>SO THE LORD UPROOTED THEM FROM THEIR LAND</small>.

They planted and toiled, but the peoples of the world came and took.

The son sent and said to his father: To the children of the concubines you have given fields and vineyards, but to me you have given one garden. The king said to him: By your life, all my food (<i>cellaria</i>) comes to me from this garden; and because I love you more than your brothers, I have given it to you. Similarly the Holy One created the peoples of the world, just as it is stated (in Cant. 6:8): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS</small>: These are the peoples. (Vs. 9): <small>&lt; ONLY &gt; ONE IS MY DOVE, &lt; MY PERFECT ONE &gt;</small>: This is the congregation of Israel. Now the Holy One has distributed [fields and vineyards] to the peoples of the world, as stated (in Deut. 32:8): <small>WHEN THE MOST HIGH GAVE THE GENTILES AN INHERITANCE</small>; but to Israel he has given the land of Israel, the larder (<i>cellaria</i>) of the Holy One. The offerings come from it; the shewbread comes from it; the first fruits come from it; the omer comes from it; all the good things in the world [come from it]. Why all this? In order to made a distinction between the son of the matron and the children of the concubines, as stated (in Jer. 3:19): <small>BUT I SAID: HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN &lt; AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND &gt;</small>… ! There was great love between the Holy One and Israel; so how did they bring in the enmity.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 6:10; below, Numb. 4a: 15.</i> The Holy One said (ibid.): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT</small> (<i>ashit</i>) <small>YOU</small>, and this language can only be the language of enmity. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:15): <small>I WILL PUT</small> (<i>ashit</i>) <small>ENMITY BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN</small>.
Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>.

Abraham said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the World, you have given me permission to say to you (in vs. 8): <small>HOW SHALL I KNOW &lt; THAT I SHALL POSSESS IT &gt;</small>?

(Lev. 19:23:) <small>&lt; WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &gt; AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD, YOU SHALL COUNT</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RL</small></i>) <small>ITS FRUIT AS FORBIDDEN</small> (literally: <small>AS FORESKIN</small>, rt.: '<i><small>RL</small></i>)…. &lt; This verse &gt; is teaching about an infant.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:14.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THREE YEARS IT SHALL BE FORBIDDEN</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RL</small></i>) <small>FOR YOU</small>, when &lt; an infant &gt; can neither talk nor speak. (vs. 24:) <small>IN THE FOURTH YEAR ALL ITS FRUIT SHALL BE</small> [<small>SET ASIDE</small> (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>)], when his father dedicates (rt.: <i><small>QDSh</small></i>) him to the Torah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR PRAISES TO THE LORD</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>PRAISES</small> (with reference to an infant)?] &lt; Those offered &gt; from the time that he praises the Holy One. (Vs. 25:) <small>BUT IN THE FIFTH YEAR YOU MAY EAT ITS FRUIT</small>, &lt; i.e. &gt; from the time that he begins to read in the Torah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO INCREASE ITS YIELD FOR YOU</small>. Hence our masters have taught (in <i>Avot</i> 5:21): <small>AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE &lt; HE IS READY &gt; FOR &lt; THE STUDY OF &gt; SCRIPTURE; AT TEN, FOR MISHNAH</small>. While in this world, one begets a son for himself, brings him to the elementary school, labors with him, and teaches him Torah. Then in the midst of troubles he dies. So he derives no happiness from him. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world, because the evil drive is found in you, you sin and your children die; but in the world to come I will remove the [evil] drive from among you.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 7:1.</i> Then you shall beget and be happy, as stated (in Is. 65:23): <small>THEY SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, NOR BEAR CHILDREN IN TERROR, BECAUSE THEY ARE A SEED BLESSED OF THE LORD, AND THEIR OFFSPRING ALONG WITH THEM</small>.

Siman 15

(Lev. 20:9:) <small>FOR ANYONE WHATEVER WHO CURSES HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Solomon said (in Prov. 20:20): <small>&lt; IF SOMEONE &gt; CURSES HIS FATHER OR MOTHER, HIS LIGHT WILL GO OUT AT THE APPROACH OF DARKNESS</small>. Our Masters have said: Because Ham saw his father's nakedness, yet did not utter a curse at him, he and his descendants have &lt; only &gt; been alienated until the end of the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:15.</i> How much worse it is for one who does curse his father! The Scripture says (in Prov. 24:20): <small>FOR THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE FOR THE EVIL ONE, &lt; THE LAMP OF THE WICKED GOES OUT &gt;</small>. Come and see the honoring of father and mother, how dear it is before the Holy One; for the Holy One does not withhold his reward, either from the righteous or from the wicked. Where is it shown? From Esau the Wicked. Because he honored his father, the Holy One gave him all this honor. R. Eleazar says: Esau the Wicked shed three tears, [one] from his right eye, one from his left eye, and the third was attached in his eye and did not run down. When? When Isaac blessed Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:38): <small>AND ESAU LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:15, which adds here: “Come and see how much prosperity the Holy One gave him. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 80:6 [5]): <small>YOU HAVE FED THEM THE BREAD OF TEARS AND HAVE HAD THEM DRINK A <i>SHALISH</i> OF TEARS</small>. <i>Shalosh</i> is not written but <i>shalish</i>, because there were not three (<i>shalosh</i>) whole ones.”</i> So if the Holy One recompensed this wicked one, because he honored his father, how much the more &lt; will he do so &gt; in the case of one who honors his fathers. &lt; The Holy One &gt; said (in Job 41:3 [11]): <small>WHO HAS WELCOMED</small> (<i>hiqdim</i>) <small>ME THAT I SHOULD REPAY HIM</small>? [<small>EVERYTHING UNDER THE HEAVENS IS MINE</small>.] The Holy One said: Who is this one who has advanced (<i>hiqdim</i>) honor to his father, and I have not given him children? And so it says in Job (11:5–7): <small>O THAT GOD WOULD SPEAK</small>…; <small>AND THAT HE WOULD TELL YOU THE SECRETS OF WISDOM</small>… ! <small>WOULD YOU DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GOD</small>…? To what is Job comparable? To whoever is put in a <i>collare</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word denotes a band or chain, in particular one put around the neck of a prisoner.</i> and said: I know what is within the palace<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: palatium.</i> of the king.

He also says: I have reached the end of the works of the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Job 23:5): <small>I WOULD KNOW</small> {<small>WHAT</small>} <small>WORDS HE WOULD ANSWER ME</small> [<small>AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO ME</small>]. His companions said to him (in Job 11:7): <small>WOULD YOU DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GOD</small>…?

Who, after he had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and had overthrown them, who has rebuilt them? No creature can stand on his own works, as stated (in Eccl. 7:13): <small>SEE THE WORK OF GOD; FOR WHO CAN MAKE STRAIGHT WHAT HE HAS MADE CROOKED</small>? The Holy One said: In this world the children of Adam are afflicted because of the evil drive, but in the world to come I will remove the evil drive from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:14.</i> It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:26–27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU</small>….

Siman 1

(Lev. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS, THE SONS OF AARON, &lt; AND SAY UNTO THEM: LET NO ONE DEFILE HIMSELF FOR A DEAD SOUL AMONG HIS PEOPLE &gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 12:7 [6]): <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>…. Everything &lt; against &gt; which the Holy One warned Israel is for the sake of their holiness and their purity.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:1.</i> (Ibid.:) <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>. (Lev. 21:1:) <small>SPEAK</small> (literally: <small>SAY</small>) <small>UNTO THE PRIESTS, THE SONS OF AARON, AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>. Note that "say" &lt; occurs &gt; two times. To what is the matter comparable? To a cook who would go in and out before the king. The king said: I am commanding you not to look at a dead person all your days, since you come in and out before me, lest you defile my palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>praetorium</i>, Gk.: <i>praitorion.</i></i> Similarly, the Holy One had commanded the priests who enter the Temple not to be defiled for a dead person. It therefore says (in Lev. 21:1): <small>LET NO ONE DEFILE HIMSELF FOR A DEAD SOUL AMONG HIS PEOPLE</small>.

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Lev. 21:1): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 19:3–4 [2–3]): <small>ONE DAY POURS OUT SPEECH TO ANOTHER</small>…; <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>. You find that in the days of autumn the day lends to the night, while in the days of summer the night lends to the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. R. 26:4; M. Pss. 19:10.</i> (Vs. 4:) <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>. No creature hears &lt; about any difference &gt; between them, as stated (in Ps. 19:4 [3]): <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>, [<small>NOR IS THEIR VOICE HEARD</small>]. Down below, however, when the children of Adam lend to each other, how many quarrels they generate! Thus it is stated (in Ps. 19:4–5 [3–4]): <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>…. [<small>THEIR LINE GOES OUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD</small>]. The heavenly creatures need neither talk nor speech, but earthly creatures need talk (rt.: '<i><small>MR</small></i>), speech, and words (rt.: '<i><small>MR</small></i>). (Lev. 21:1:) <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: '<i><small>MR</small></i>)… <small>AND SAY</small> (rt.: '<i><small>MR</small></i>). Perhaps they will attend to them (i.e., the double command). Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>, [<small>AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>].

Siman 3

Another interpretation (of Lev. 21:1): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 20:27)? <small>WHEN A MAN OR A WOMAN HAS A GHOST OR A FAMILIAR SPIRIT</small>…. This text is related (to Is. 8:19): <small>AND WHEN THEY SAY UNTO YOU: INQUIRE OF GHOSTS AND FAMILIAR SPIRITS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:2; Lev. R. 6:6.</i> The Holy One said to Israel: If they say unto you: <small>INQUIRE OF GHOSTS</small>, and forsake the God who is in the heavens, say to them (ibid. cont.): <small>SHOULD NOT A PEOPLE INQUIRE OF ITS GOD</small>? Just as Elijah said to Ahaziah (in II Kings 1:3): <small>IS IT FOR LACK OF A GOD IN ISRAEL &lt; THAT YOU ARE SENDING TO INQUIRE OF BAAL-ZEBUB &gt;</small>…? Why should we forsake the everlasting God? (Jer. 10:10:) <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD</small>; [<small>HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>]. It is also written (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE &lt; ALL &gt; ALIVE &lt; TODAY &gt;</small>. We therefore seek a living God; however, [the god&lt; s &gt; of] the nations of the world are dead, &lt; and &gt; (according to Ps. 115:8:) <small>THOSE WHO MAKE THEM SHALL BE LIKE THEM</small>. What is written after &lt; Is. 8:19 &gt;, (in vs. 20)? <small>FOR INSTRUCTION</small> (<i>Torah</i>) <small>AND FOR TESTIMONY</small>: [<small>IF THEY DO NOT SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD, SUCH A ONE SHALL HAVE NO DAWN</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly in the 1985 JPS translation: <small>FOR ONE WHO SPEAKS THUS THERE SHALL BE NO DAWN</small>. So understood, the clause means that a necromancer will not live to see the dawn. Such a translation fits the immediate context of the midrash. The clause can also mean: <small>SUCH A ONE HAS NO LIGHT</small>, i.e., a necromancer cannot enlighten. This translation better fits the interpretations that follow.</i> R. Johanan and R. Laqish differed. R. Johanan said: The Holy One said: <small>IF THEY DO NOT SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD</small> to the nations of the world <small>THEY</small> (sic) <small>HAVE NO LIGHT</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous note.</i> [but R. Laqish says: <small>IT</small> (i.e., the word of a necromancer) <small>HAS NO LIGHT</small>.] The ghosts and the familiar spirits do not enlighten (literally: raise up the dawn) on their own, since they are &lt; themselves &gt; set in darkness; and all the more does this &lt; principle &gt; hold true for the nations of the world. So if you should say: Of whom shall we inquire? see, it says (in Deut. 17:9–11): <small>AND YOU SHALL COME UNTO THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS AND UNTO THE JUDGE</small>…. <small>&lt; YOU SHALL ACT &gt; ACCORDING TO THE TORAH WHICH THEY SHALL TEACH YOU</small>.

Siman 4

(Lev. 20:27:) <small>WHEN A MAN OR A WOMAN HAS A GHOST OR A FAMILIAR SPIRIT</small>. What is written after that (in Lev. 21:1)? <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. What relation does the one have to the other? It is simply that the Holy One foresaw that Saul was going to be king over Israel and kill the priests; then inquire of a ghost and a familiar spirit. It is so stated (in I Sam. 28:7): <small>THEN SAUL SAID</small> {<small>UNTO</small>} [<small>TO</small>] <small>HIS SERVANTS: SEEK ME OUT A WOMAN WHO CONTROLS A GHOST</small>. Resh Laqish said: To what is Saul comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:2; Lev. R. 26:7; M.

They said to him: Did you not order them to be killed? Here also (in I Sam. 28:3) Saul had put away the ghosts and the familiar spirits; so Saul said (in vs. 7) <small>SEEK ME OUT A WOMAN WHO CONTROLS A GHOST</small> &lt; …. &gt; (Vs. 8:) <small>THEN SAUL DISGUISED HIMSELF</small>. What is the meaning of <small>DISGUISED HIMSELF</small> (rt.: <i><small>HPSh</small></i>)? That he had become divested (rt.: <i><small>HPSh</small></i>) of the kingship. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HE WENT WITH TWO MEN. WHO WERE THEY</small>? Abner and Amasai.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The parallels in the traditional <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:2, in Lev. R. 26:7, and in M. Sam. 24 all read, “Abner and Amasa.”</i> Torah has taught proper protocol, that one does not leave on a journey (at night) by oneself; and our father Abraham acted accordingly (in Gen. 22:3): <small>AND HE</small> (i.e., Abraham) <small>TOOK WITH HIM TWO OF HIS SERVANTS</small> {<small>AND HIS SON ISAAC</small>}. And so (in I Sam. 28:8): <small>AND HE</small> (Saul) <small>WENT WITH TWO OF HIS SERVANTS</small> (sic). (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THEY CAME UNTO THE WOMAN AT NIGHT</small>. Was it at Night? It is simply that this time was for them as black as night. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN HE SAID: PLEASE DIVINE FOR ME THROUGH A GHOST</small>…. (Vs. 9:) <small>BUT SHE SAID UNTO</small> {<small>SAUL</small>} [<small>HIM</small>]: <small>SEE HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT SAUL HAS DONE, HOW HE HAS ROOTED OUT THE GHOSTS AND THE FAMILIAR</small> {<small>SPIRIT</small>} [<small>SPIRITS</small>] <small>&lt; FROM THE LAND &gt;</small>. Immediately (in vs. 10): <small>SAUL SWORE TO HER BY THE LORD, SAYING</small>: [<small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>,] <small>NO PUNISHMENT SHALL BEFALL YOU OVER THIS MATTER</small>. Resh Laqish said: To what is Saul comparable? To a woman who was situated with her lover and swore by the life of her husband. (Vs. 11:) <small>THEN THE WOMAN SAID: WHOM</small> (<i>mi</i>) <small>SHALL I BRING UP FOR YOU</small>?

He said to her (in I Sam. 28:11, cont.:) <small>BRING UP SAMUEL FOR ME</small>. She did what she did and brought him up. (Vs. 12:) <small>WHEN THE WOMAN SAW SAMUEL, SHE CRIED OUT</small> [<small>WITH</small>] <small>A LOUD VOICE, AND &lt; THE WOMAN &gt; SPOKE &lt; UNTO SAUL, SAYING &gt;: WHY HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME? FOR YOU ARE SAUL</small>. How did she know? Our masters have said: &lt; A ghost &gt; does not come up for a king as it comes up for a commoner.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> For the king its face is up and its feet down, just like everyone &lt; on earth &gt;; but for the commoner its feet are up and its face down. (Vs. 13:) <small>THEN THE KING SAID TO HER</small>: [<small>DO NOT BE AFRAID; FOR</small>] <small>WHAT DO YOU SEE? AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO SAUL: I SEE A GOD COMING UP FROM THE EARTH. COMING UP</small> (here in the plural form) implies two. So who were they? Moses and Samuel. When Saul heard this, he was afraid, because he had called one, but two had arisen. (Vs. 14:) <small>THEN HE SAID TO HER: WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? AND SHE SAID: AN OLD MAN IS COMING UP, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>. They have said three things about bringing up a ghost. 1. The one bringing it up sees it but does not hear its voice. 2. The one asking for it hears its voice but does not see it. 3. Those standing there neither see it nor hear its voice. (Ibid.:) <small>AN OLD MAN IS COMING UP, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>. And elsewhere it says (in I Sam. 2:19): <small>HIS MOTHER WOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROBE FOR HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, Gen. 11:9.</i> &lt; This verse &gt; teaches that the robe grew on him.

Some say: <small>WHY HAVE YOU DISTURBED ME</small>? What he said to him was: I was disturbed lest it be the day of judgment, and I was afraid. Now here is an argument a fortiori (<i>qal wahomer</i>); for if Samuel, [the greatest] of all the prophets, was afraid of the day of judgment, how much the more does the rest of humanity &lt; have to fear &gt;?

Now, however, I am in the world of truth, you will only hear words of truth from me. He did not do this thing to you for no reason.

Abner and Amasa said to him: What did Samuel say to you? He said to them: He said to me: Tomorrow you will go down to battle and be victorious. In addition, your sons will be appointed their superiors. Resh Laqish said: At that time the Holy One called the ministering angels. He said to them: Come and see the creature that I have created in my world. By universal custom when one goes to a banquet house, he does not take his children with him for fear of the evil eye; but this one, when he is going down to battle and knows that he will be killed, takes his sons with him, and is happy over the divine justice that is striking him.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">M.

So now, if he is missing, (according to vs. 42) <small>IT WILL BE YOUR LIFE FOR HIS LIFE AND YOUR PEOPLE FOR HIS PEOPLE</small>. [Similarly] (in Ezek. 10:2): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO THE PERSON CLOTHED IN LINEN, AND SAID: GO IN AMONG THE WHEEL WORK, &lt; UNDER THE CHERUB &gt;</small>. &lt; The Holy One &gt; said unto the angel, and the angel said to the cherub. He said to him: The Holy One has commanded me, but I do not have the authority to enter your section &lt; of heaven &gt;; so do me a favor and give me two burning coals. Immediately (in vs. 7), <small>HE TOOK SOME AND PUT THEM INTO THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHO WAS CLOTHED IN LINEN</small>. R. Pinhas said: He cooled them and gave them to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yoma.</i> 77a.</i> R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Two burning coals were being quenched in Gabriel's hand for two years and a half. He was thinking that Israel would repent. When they did not do so, he sought to hurl them and destroy them. The Holy One said to him: Gabriel, do not act. There are among the children of Adam those who are repenting and doing acts of righteousness with each other. Thus it is stated (in vs. 8): <small>AND THERE THE CHERUBIM APPEARED TO HAVE THE FORM OF A HUMAN HAND</small><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A symbol of the almsgiving.</i> <small>&lt; UNDER THEIR WINGS &gt;</small>. Ergo (in vs. 2): <small>SAID</small> &lt; …, &gt; <small>AND SAID</small>. So also here (in Lev. 21:1:) <small>SAY UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>…, <small>AND SAY</small>. The first saying is for the unclaimed corpse, for which &lt; a priest &gt; may become unclean; and the second is for other &lt; corpses &gt;, for which he may not become unclean.

[(Lev. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES: SAY UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>.] What is written after this passage (in vs. 10)? <small>AND THE PRIEST THAT IS HIGHEST AMONG HIS BROTHERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:4; Lev. R. 26:9.</i> Why is he called by the name <small>HIGH</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><small>THE PRIEST THAT IS HIGHEST</small>, without the addition, <small>AMONG HIS BROTHERS</small>, would normally be translated, <small>HIGH PRIEST</small>.</i> Because he was highest (literally: greatest) in five areas: In beauty, in strength, in wealth, in wisdom, and in age.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>TYoma</i> 1:6; <i>Yoma</i> 18a; see <i>yYoma</i> 1:3 (39a); cf. ‘<i>Eduy.</i> 2:9; <i>Avot</i>. 6:8.</i> In regard to beauty, because he was more handsome than his brothers. In regard to strength, because he was heroic in strength. Come and consider Aaron. When he waved the Levites (as in a wave offering), he waved twenty-two thousand in one day. How did he wave them? Back and forth, up and down. Ergo: He was highest in strength. Also in regard to wealth, because if he had not been wealthy, his brother priests would have made him wealthy. There is a story about Pinhas the Stone Cutter. When they appointed him high priest, his brother priests went out and saw him cutting stone. So they would not permit him to continue, but filled the quarry before him with gold dinars.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>denarii.</i></i> [And where is it shown] that, if he had nothing, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <i><small>GDL</small></i>) him? Where it is stated (in an alternate translation of Lev. 21:10): <small>AND THE PRIEST THAT IS HIGHEST</small> (rt.: <i><small>GDL</small></i>) <small>BECAUSE OF HIS BROTHERS</small>. And &lt; this rule applies &gt; not to the high priest alone, but to the king as well. And so you find in the case of David, when he went to fight with Goliath the Philistine, Saul said to him (in I Sam. 17:33): <small>YOU CANNOT GO UNTO &lt; THIS &gt; PHILISTINE</small> … David said to him (in vs. 34–36): <small>YOUR SERVANT TENDED HIS</small> [<small>FATHER'S</small>] <small>SHEEP</small>; &lt; <small>AND WHEN A LION OR A BEAR CAME AND CARRIED OFF A LAMB FROM THE FLOCK, &gt; I WOULD GO OUT AFTER IT, SMITE IT, &lt; AND DELIVER IT OUT OF ITS MOUTH &gt;</small>…. <small>&lt; YOUR SERVANT &gt; SMOTE BOTH THE LION AND THE BEAR</small>, <small>&lt; AND THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE SHALL BE AS ONE OF THEM &gt;</small>…. Saul said to him: And who told you that you could slay him? David replied: Hunting<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kynegia.</i></i> has trained me, Papa. (Vs. 37:) <small>THE LORD WHO DELIVERED FROM THE PAW OF THE LION</small>… <small>&lt; WILL DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF THIS PHILISTINE &gt;</small>. Immediately (we read in vs. 38): <small>SAUL CLOTHED DAVID WITH HIS MILITARY GARMENTS</small>…. Now it is written (in I Sam. 9:2): <small>HE WAS A HEAD TALLER</small><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">More literally: <small>TALLER FROM HIS SHOULDERS ON UP</small>.</i> <small>THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE</small>. When he had clothed him in his garments and seen that they were made for him, he immediately cast a jaundiced eye at him. When David saw that he had offended Saul, he said to him (in I Sam. 17:39): <small>I CANNOT</small> {<small>GO FORTH</small>} [<small>GO</small>] <small>IN THESE, FOR I AM NOT USED TO THEM</small>. Here you learn that even though a person may be short, when he is appointed king, he becomes tall. Why? Because as soon as he is anointed with the anointing oil, he becomes superior to his brothers. David said: I rejoiced over the anointing oil with which I was anointed, in that I shall never move away from my glory. It is so stated (in Ps. 16:9): <small>SO MY HEART REJOICES, AND MY GLORY EXALTS; MY FLESH ALSO DWELLS IN SAFETY</small>.

(Lev. 22:27:) <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT IS BORN</small>….

(Ps. 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked, since it is stated (in Ps. 136:15): <small>BUT OVERTHREW PHARAOH AND HIS HOST IN THE REED SEA</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. These are the righteous. Just as these mountains grow herbs, so the righteous possess good works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked. Just as the deep does not grow herbs, so the wicked do not possess good works.]
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Just as the mountains are suitable for sowing and producing fruit; so do the righteous produce fruit, in that they do good for themselves and do good for others.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 27:1.</i> Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:10): <small>TELL THE RIGHTEOUS THAT &lt; ALL IS &gt; WELL FOR THEM, FOR THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WORKS</small>.

To a gold bell with a pearl<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>margarites, margaritis, margaritarion</i>, or <i>margellion.</i></i> clapper. Similarly the righteous do good for themselves and do good for others. (Ps. 36:7 [6] cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked. Just as the deep is unable to sow and grow fruit, so the wicked to not possess good works. Instead they are distressing for themselves and for others.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS &lt; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &gt;</small>.

Just as these mountains hold down the deep, so that it does not rise up and inundate the earth, so the works of the righteous hold back the divine retributions, so that they will not come into the world.
Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Just as these mountains have no end, so there is no end to the reward of the righteous in the world to come. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. Just as the deep has no limit, so there is no limit to the divine retributions of the wicked in the world to come.

But since the wicked do not carry out the Torah, which was given from <small>THE MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>,] the Holy One deals strictly with them, even unto the great deep.

Buber has filled in the following bracketed section from parallel texts, mainly from <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:5.</i> [R. Aqiva says: The Holy One is as strict with the former as with the latter.

Moreover, the deep is darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>.

[Another interpretation] (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; &lt; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &gt;</small>. R.

Alexander of Macedon went off [to the king of Qatsia] beyond the Mountains of Darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:6; Lev.

Then you will never again stand up to &lt; another &gt; kingdom. When he went away, he wrote over the entrance<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pylai.</i></i> gate: I, King Alexander of Macedon, was a fool until I came to the province of Carthage and learned &lt; to take &gt; counsel from women. He went to another province named Africa. They came out to meet him [with golden apples], with golden pomegranates, and with golden bread. He said to them: Is gold eaten in your land?

Rather I have come to see your laws. While they were sitting &lt; there &gt;, two men came before the king for judgment. One said: Your majesty, I bought a deserted building from this man; and when I cleaned it out, I found a treasure in it. So I said to him: Take your treasure, because I &lt; only &gt; bought a deserted building. I did not buy a treasure. But the other said: Just as you are afraid of a punishment for robbery, so likewise am I afraid of punishment for robbery; for when I sold you the deserted building, I sold you whatever was in it from under the ground up to the heavens. The king summoned one of them. He said to him: Do you have a son? He said: &lt; Yes, &gt; I do. He called the other one. He said to him: Do you have a daughter? He told him: Yes. &lt; The king &gt; said to them: {So let them marry} [Let them go and marry] one another. Then both of them will use up the treasure. Now Alexander began to be amazed. The king said to him: What reason do you have to be amazed? For did I not judge well? He told him: Yes. He said to him: If this case had arisen in your land, what would you have done about it? He said to him: We would have killed this one and the other one. Then the treasure would go to the house of the king. He said to him: But does the sun shine upon you? He told him: Yes. And does the rain come down upon you? He told him: Yes. Are there perhaps &lt; some &gt; small cattle in your land? He told him: Yes. He said to him: Woe to that man! It is for the sake of small cattle that the sun shines for you and that the rain comes down upon you.

We have been taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh</i>. 7:4.</i> (Lev. 20:16): <small>YOU SHALL KILL THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST</small>. If a woman sins with a beast, how does it sin? It is simply because a stumbling block came to the woman on account of &lt; the beast &gt;. Therefore (in vs. 15): <small>AND YOU SHALL KILL THE BEAST</small>. {Another interpretation:} So that the beast will not pass through the market, where they will say: This is the beast on account of which such and such a woman was killed. And this is &lt; why it is written &gt; (in Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small>.

Was a bull brought forth (rt.: <i><small>YLD</small></i>)? Was not a &lt; golden &gt; calf brought forth (rt.: <i><small>YLD</small></i>)?

Concerning the human (in Lev. 20:16): <small>YOU SHALL KILL THE WOMAN</small>; and concerning the beast (in vs. 15): <small>AND YOU SHALL KILL THE BEAST</small>. (Eccl. 3:21:) {<small>AND</small>} <small>WHO KNOWS THE LIFEBREATH OF A HUMAN THAT RISES UPWARD AND THE LIFEBREATH OF A BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is required by the midrash. A more traditional translation in the biblical context would be this: <small>WHO KNOWS WHETHER IT IS THE LIFEBREATH OF A HUMAN THAT RISES UPWARD, WHILE IT IS THE LIFEBREATH OF A BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH</small>?</i> Because the lifebreath of the human is given from above, concerning it a rising up is written. And because the beast is given from below, concerning it a going down is written. (Eccl. 3:19, cont.:) <small>BUT THE SUPERIORITY OF THE HUMAN OVER THE BEAST IS</small> '<i><small>YN</small></i> (i.e., <small>NIL</small>).

[Another interpretation (of Lev. 22:27): <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT &lt; IS BORN &gt;</small>….] This text is related (to Ps. 27:6): <small>AND NOW SHALL MY HEAD BE LIFTED UP OVER MY ENEMIES ROUND ABOUT ME</small>; [<small>I WILL OFFER SACRIFICE IN HIS TENT WITH A LOUD CRY</small>;] <small>&lt; I WILL SING AND CHANT PRAISE TO THE LORD &gt;</small>.

Then they said: Now we know that the Holy One has been reconciled to us. They began a song. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL OFFER SACRIFICE IN HIS TENT WITH A LOUD CRY; I WILL SING AND CHANT PRAISE TO THE LORD</small>.

Siman 23

[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT</small>. Why did the Holy One say to sacrifice a bull. To atone for the image of the bull, as stated (in Ps. 103:3): <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. You should know this on your own. See what is written (in Ezek. 1:6): <small>EACH HAD FOUR FACES, AND EACH OF THEM HAD FOUR WINGS</small>. What is written there (in vs. 7): <small>AND THEIR LEGS BECAME A STRAIGHT LEG, AND THE SOLE OF THEIR FEET WAS LIKE THE SOLE OF A CALF'S FOOT. Now</small> it was for the atonement of Israel that he added two [more] wings to them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 6:2): <small>&lt; ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM</small>. &gt; [<small>EACH</small>] <small>OF THEM HAD SIX WINGS</small>: [<small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FACE, WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET</small>,] <small>&lt; AND WITH TWO HE DID FLY &gt;</small>. Why? So that their feet would be covered, because they resembled the calf. &lt; It was &gt; so that he would not see them and recall the incident of the calf. <small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET</small>. And why all this? Simply to atone for Israel. (Ps. 103:3:) <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. You have no larger fowl than the eagle, so it became a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10): <small>AND THE FOUR OF THEM HAD THE FACE OF AN EAGLE</small>. The largest among the beasts is the lion, so it &lt; also &gt; became a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 10:14): <small>AND THE</small> {<small>FACE OF THE ONE</small>} [<small>THIRD</small>] <small>WAS THE FACE OF A LION</small>. And the bull is the largest among the cattle, so that he made it a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10): <small>AND THE FOUR OF THEM HAD THE FACE OF A BULL</small> [<small>ON THE LEFT</small>]. {(Ibid.:) <small>AND THE FACE OF A HUMAN</small>.} But for the sake of Israel, the Holy One blotted out the bull and put a cherub in its place. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 10:14): <small>THE FACE OF THE ONE WAS THE FACE OF A CHERUB</small>. And why all this? To atone for Israel. Ergo, &lt; Scripture &gt; says it well (in Ps. 103:3:) <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. Why did the Holy One remove the calf? So that Israel would be innocent before him. And not only that, but when Israel thinks about a transgression or something evil in its heart, {the Holy One purifies it.} [does not the Holy One purify it?] Therefore David says (in Ps. 66:18 [17]): <small>IF I HAD PERCEIVED INIQUITY IN MY HEART, THE LORD WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED</small>. Now what does the Holy One hear? &lt; What is thought &gt; when a person stands up to meditate in prayer. It is so stated (in vs. 19 [18]): <small>TRULY GOD HAS LISTENED; HE HAS HEARKENED TO THE SOUND OF MY PRAYER</small>. And not only that, but when two children of Adam sit and occupy themselves with the Torah, the Holy One hearkens and listens, as stated (in Mal. 3:16): <small>THEN THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD SPOKE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE LORD HAS HEARKENED AND LISTENED, AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 3:2, 6; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Bahodesh</i> 1; <i>Ber.</i> 62; <i>ARN</i>, A, 8; Matthew 18:20.</i> The Holy One said: Through the merit of the Torah, when you occupy yourselves with it, I am hearkening and listening to your prayers; but in the world to come, before you utter a prayer before me and cry aloud before me, I will listen to your prayers. It is so stated (in Is. 65:24): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, BEFORE THEY CRY OUT, I WILL ANSWER</small>; [<small>WHILE THEY ARE YET SPEAKING, I WILL LISTEN</small>].

He said: It is customary for the king to eat warm bread. Would &lt; he eat it &gt; cold? It is like that which we learn there (in the latter part of Men. 11:9): <small>THE SHEWBREAD WAS EATEN NO EARLIER THAN THE NINTH DAY &lt; AFTER BAKING &gt; AND NO LATER THAN THE ELEVENTH DAY. HOW SO? IT WAS BAKED ON THE EVE OF THE SABBATH AND EATEN ON THE SABBATH &lt; OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I.E., &gt; ON THE NINTH DAY. &lt; IF &gt; A HOLIDAY HAPPENED TO FALL ON THE EVE OF THE SABBATH, IT WAS EATEN ON THE TENTH. &lt; IN THE CASE OF &gt; THE TWO-DAY HOLIDAY OF THE NEW YEAR, IT WAS EATEN ON THE ELEVENTH, FOR &lt; THE BAKING &gt; OVERRIDES NEITHER THE SABBATH NOR A HOLIDAY.

(Lev. 24:10:) <small>NOW THERE WENT OUT THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN, &lt; WHOSE FATHER WAS EGYPTIAN &gt;</small>. From where did he go out? R. Hiyya bar Abba said: he went out (i.e., became excluded from Israel) because of (literally: from) the parashah on genealogies.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 8:24; Lev. R. 32:3; <i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 14:10 (242: <i>Emor</i>, parashah 14).</i> When he came to pitch his tent in the camp of Dan, they rejected him. Now they said to him: You have an Egyptian father, but it is written (in Numb. 2:2): <small>&lt; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL CAMP, &gt; EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS OF THEIR FATHERS</small>' <small>HOUSES</small>, and not of their mothers' houses. [Immediately,] (according to Lev. 24:11) he began to utter the Name and curse it. R. Levi said: He was a bastard. How so? Taskmasters were from Egypt, and the officers were from Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 1:28; Lev.

On one occasion a taskmaster met an officer. He said to him: Go gather your groups of ten. When he had gone, he entered his house and seduced Shelomith, the officer's wife. &lt; When &gt; her husband returned, he found him leaving his house. When &lt; the taskmaster &gt; knew that &lt; her husband &gt; noticed him, he beat him every day. The Holy Spirit was kindled in Moses. He raised his eyes to the sky. He said: Was it not enough for this wicked man to rape his wife, but that he should return and beat him? Immediately (according to Exod. 2:12) <small>HE SMOTE THE EGYPTIAN AND HID HIM IN THE SAND</small>. The Holy One said: In this world you are delivered through sins into the hands of the nations of the world. However, in the world to come (according to Is. 49:23): <small>KINGS SHALL BE YOUR GUARDIANS; THEIR LADIES, YOUR WET NURSES</small>; [<small>THEY SHALL BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU, NOSE TO THE GROUND, AND LICK THE DUST OF YOUR FEET.

(Lev. 25:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI, SAYING</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>, [<small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>]. This verse speaks about a lot of Adam's children: {about Cain, about Ephron, and about one who lends at interest}.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 9:1.</i> [<small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This was Cain, since he killed his brother so that he would inherit the world for himself. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>.] The Holy One said: You moved quickly to become rich and inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>. And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12): <small>YOU SHALL BECOME A CEASELESS WANDERER ON THE EARTH</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>: This is Cain.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This was Ephron the Hittite.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; below, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.</i> When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him: Give me its price. He said to him (in Gen. 23:15): <small>WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? SO BURY YOUR DEAD</small>. Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16): <small>SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON</small>…. Ben Ma'ma said: Although R. Hanina has said: All the shekels in the Torah are <i>sela'im</i>, these &lt; shekels &gt; are an exception, since they are <i>centenaria.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Latin. One <i>centenarium</i> was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a <i>centenarium</i> was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A <i>Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D.</i> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957). s.v.</i></i> &lt; It was &gt; four hundred centenaria &lt; that &gt; Abraham piled up before Ephron. When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and was persuaded, as stated (in Gen. 23:6): <small>BURY YOUR DEAD IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR TOMBS</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have moved quickly after money. (Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. (Prov. 28:22, cont.): <small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY</small> (<small>HSR</small>) <small>WILL COME TO HIM</small>. And what was his loss (rt.: <i><small>HSR</small></i>)? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Every <small>EPHRON</small> which is written here &lt; in Scripture &gt;, before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as '<i><small>PRWN</small></i> (i.e., with the vowel <i>O</i> represented by the Hebrew consonant <i>W</i>); but this &lt; usage &gt; (in Gen. 23:6) is deficient (<small><i>HSR</i></small>): <small>AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON</small> ('<i><small>PRN</small></i>). It is written with the <i>W</i> missing (<i><small>HSR</small></i>).
Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): [<small>&lt; AN EVIL-EYED PERSON &gt; MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>…. ] This represents those who engage in business in the Sabbatical Year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the Sabbatical Year but are intent on becoming rich. The Holy One said to them: You have moved quickly to become rich from the Sabbatical Year. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. But he only acted when he did not observe the Sabbatical Year. The curse began entering into his money, and he sold all that he had. What is written elsewhere on the matter (in Lev. 25:2): <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE A SABBATH FOR THE LORD</small>. And after that it is written (in vs. 14): <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE</small>.

R. Eleazar haQappar said: It is written (in Cant. 5:15): <small>HIS LEGS ARE PILLARS OF MARBLE, SET UPON SOCKETS OF FINE GOLD</small>….

R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.</i> What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1–2:)? <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [….] <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE &lt; A SABBATH FOR THE LORD &gt;</small>. Then after that &lt; comes &gt; the section on the Jubilee (in vs. 8): <small>AND YOU SHALL COUNT SEVEN SABBATHS OF YEARS</small>. If one has not observed the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee, he will end up selling his chattels, [as stated] (in vs. 14): <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE</small>….<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T’Arakh</i>. 5:9; below, 9:8.</i> &lt; If &gt; he repents, &lt; all &gt; is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, [as stated] (in vs. 25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small> &lt; …. &gt; &lt; If &gt; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. &lt; If &gt; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around &lt; begging &gt; at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35): <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>…, <small>&lt; YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU &gt;</small>. &lt; If &gt; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39): [<small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>] <small>NEAR YOU AND IS SOLD TO YOU</small> &lt; …. &gt; &lt; If &gt; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47): <small>AND WHEN A FOREIGNER AND A SOJOURNER NEAR YOU BECOMES WEALTHY, &lt; WHILE YOUR RELATIVE NEAR HIM BECOMES POOR AND IS SOLD TO A SOJOURNING FOREIGNER NEAR YOU</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> Now it is not merely the individual himself &lt; at issue here &gt;, but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the Sabbatical Year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17–18): <small>SO HE BROUGHT UP THE KING OF THE CHALDEANS UPON THEM</small> [….] <small>AND ALL THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</small> […,] <small>AND THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small> […,] <small>&lt; ALL THESE HE BROUGHT TO BABYLON &gt;</small>. Consider the case of Israel. The Holy One said to Moses: See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the Sabbatical Year. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, did you not say this (in Lev. 25:35): <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>, [<small>AND HIS STRENGTH FAILS NEAR YOU</small>], <small>&lt; YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU &gt;</small>? Fulfill what you said. [Israel is your brother (<i>ah</i>), as stated (in Ps. 122:8): <small>FOR THE SAKE</small>] <small>OF MY RELATIVES</small> (<i>ah</i>) <small>AND FRIENDS</small>. (Lev. 25:35:) <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR, AND HIS STRENGTH FAILS NEAR YOU</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14): <small>FOR YOUR SAKE I HAVE SENT TO BABYLON</small>. (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM</small>. Take them (i.e., Israel) by the hand, lest they perish by his (Babylon's) hand. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) <small>AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU</small>. Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, just <small>LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU</small>. The Holy One said to him: Because of their sins I have sold my house to the Chaldeans, as stated (in Lev. 25:29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. This is the house of the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 132:13): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN ZION; HE HAS DESIRED IT FOR HIS DWELLING</small>. And what happened to it? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) <small>AND HE BURNED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small>. (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) <small>&lt; IN &gt; A WALLED CITY</small>. [This is the city of the Holy One, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19): <small>AND THEY BROKE DOWN THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM</small>…. That is what the Holy One says (in Lev. 25:47): <small>AND WHEN A FOREIGNER AND A SOJOURNER &lt; NEAR YOU &gt; BECOMES WEALTHY</small>. This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median empire. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>&lt; WHILE YOUR RELATIVE NEAR HIM BECOMES POOR &gt; AND IS SOLD TO A SOJOURNING FOREIGNER NEAR YOU</small>. This &lt; sojourning foreigner] is the Greek empire. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR TO AN OFFSHOOT OF A FOREIGNER'S FAMILY</small>. This is the fourth empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World: Why were they sold to these empires? He said to him: Because they profaned the Sabbatical Year. It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21): <small>THEN HE CARRIED OFF UNTO BABYLON THOSE LEFT FROM THE SWORD, AND THEY BECAME SLAVES TO HIM AND HIS CHILDREN, UNTIL THE RULE OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE, IN ORDER TO FULFILL THE WORD OF THE LORD IN THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH, UNTIL THE LAND MADE UP ITS SABBATHS. AS LONG AS IT LAYDESOLATE, IT OBSERVED SABBATH, TO FULFILL SEVENTY YEARS</small>. Therefore the Holy One said to Moses: Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? &lt; Then &gt; warn them concerning the Sabbatical Years and the Jubilees. That is what he has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2): <small>YOU SHALL OBSERVE MY SABBATHS AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. I AM THE LORD</small>. I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the empires. Therefore, warn them about the Sabbatical Year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2): <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE A SABBATH FOR THE LORD</small>, so that they do not attain &lt; the punishments in &gt; those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14–45).

(Lev. 25:14:) <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE TO YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>, [<small>OR BUY FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HAND</small>,] <small>LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW</small>. Thus you shall not deceive one another, for I also have sold. When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One. Before the Torah was given, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra: Abraham even observed the <i>eruvim</i> of cooked foods.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE</small> ('<i><small>QB</small></i> '<i><small>ShR</small></i>) <small>ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE AND KEPT MY CHARGE: &lt; MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS &gt;</small>. What is the meaning of '<i><small>QB</small></i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; <i>PR</i> 21:12; cf. <i>Ned.</i> 32a.</i> R. Simeon ben Laqish said: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (<i>PR</i> 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).</i> '<i><small>QB</small></i> is a number. ' (i.e., '<i>ayin</i>) is seventy, <i>Q</i> (i.e., <i>Qof</i>) is one hundred, &lt; and &gt; <i>B</i> (i.e., <i>bet</i>) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five &lt; years &gt;. Deduct from them. &lt; The result is &gt; three, when he was little. Ergo: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One.] When the Holy One saw how Abraham loved the commandments, he began buying heavenly and earthly &lt; places &gt; for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19): <small>BLESSED BE ABRAM OF GOD MOST HIGH</small>, [<small>BUYER</small><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qoneh.</i> A more traditional rendering of this word here would be <small>MAKER</small>.</i> <small>OF HEAVEN AND EARTH</small>. So also it says (Gen. 13:15): <small>FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, TO YOU I WILL GIVE IT</small>.] The Holy One said: All the world is wholly mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed my commandments. But you [through your sins] have cause me to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8): <small>WHY ARE YOU LIKE A FOREIGNER IN THE LAND</small>? When you sinned before me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13 [12]): <small>YOU SHALL SELL YOUR PEOPLE FOR NO MONEY</small>…. For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or &lt; some &gt; article, you shall not deceive one another. It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14): <small>LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW</small>. (Ibid., vs. 17) <small>AND LET NO ONE DECEIVE HIS NEIGHBOR</small>.

Siman 4

(Lev. 25:18, 23:) <small>SO YOU SHALL CARRY OUT MY STATUTES</small>…. [<small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY</small>.] The Holy One said to him: Similarly I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14:) <small>TURN BACK, FAITHLESS CHILDREN, SAYS THE LORD; FOR I AM A MASTER TO YOU</small>. It is also written (in Is. 52:3): [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU WERE SOLD FOR FREE, AND YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED FOR NO MONEY</small>. You shall therefore not sell the land absolutely, since it is stated (in Lev. 25:23): <small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY, FOR THE LAND BELONGS TO ME</small>. The land of Israel is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the &lt; other &gt; lands. You yourself know, when the land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. So look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One gave thanks for their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7): <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>…. (Numb. 36:9:) <small>THUS NO INHERITANCE SHALL BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE TRIBE TO ANOTHER</small>. Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever takes it acquires it until the Jubilee. Then on the Jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41): <small>THEN HE SHALL DEPART</small> {<small>IN THE JUBILEE</small>} [<small>FROM YOU</small>], <small>HE AND HIS CHILDREN WITH HIM</small>. The Holy One said: When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4): <small>FOR A DAY OF VENGEANCE WAS IN MY HEART, BUT THERE CAME MY YEAR OF REDEMPTION</small>.

Simeon ben Levi said: With blasphemies and with curses,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 2:4, and the note there.</i> just as you say (in Mal. 3:13): <small>YOUR WORDS HAVE BEEN MIGHTY AGAINST ME</small>. When they repented, he raised up Barak and Deborah as redeemers for them; [and they were redeemed at their hands]. Ergo (in Ps. 106:43): <small>MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM…; SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>? That they became impoverished in the midst of the nations, as stated (in Jud. 6:6): <small>AND ISRAEL BECAME VERY IMPOVERISHED</small>…. What is the meaning of <small>AND &lt; … &gt; BECAME &lt; … &gt; IMPOVERISHED</small>? R. Isaac and R. Levi differed. One said that they were impoverished (rt.: <i><small>DLL</small></i>) from good works, and the other said that they did not have &lt; enough &gt; to bring even a poor person's (rt.: <i><small>DLL</small></i>) offering, as stated (in Lev. 14:21): <small>IF, HOWEVER, HE IS POOR</small> (rt.: <i><small>DLL</small></i>) [<small>AND DOES NOT HAVE THE MEANS</small>…. ] Ergo (in Ps. 106:43): <small>SO THEY BECAME POOR</small>, because they had become impoverished (rt.: <i><small>DLL</small></i>).

Another interpretation (of Ps. 106:43): <small>MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM</small>. &lt; These words &gt; speak about the children of Adam.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 9:3.</i> When trouble comes to one &lt; of them &gt;, he immediately repents, and the Holy One delivers him. So it is the first time and the second. &lt; If &gt; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, &lt; the Holy One &gt; brings trouble upon him. Why? Because it is difficult for the Holy One to raise his hand against a human being. So what does he do to him? When he sins, he begins by raising his hand against his assets. From whom have you learned it? From Naomi, her sons, and Elimelech, who was the head of &lt; his &gt; generation. When famine came, what did he do? He left the land of Israel and went to the land of Moab. Now the Holy One was angry with him because he was prince (<i>nasi</i>) of &lt; his &gt; generation. The Holy One said to him: If my children had acted like this, they would have left the land of Israel a wilderness. What is written there (in Ruth 1:3)? <small>THEN NAOMI'S HUSBAND ELIMELECH DIED</small>, but his sons were unable to learn from their father to return to the land of Israel. And what did they do in addition? (According to vs. 4) <small>THEY TOOK MOABITE WIVES FOR THEMSELVES</small>, whom they neither baptized nor proselytized.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth R. 2:9.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ORPAH</small> ('<i><small>RPH</small></i>) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE SECOND WAS RUTH: ORPAH</small> ('<i><small>RPH</small></i>), because she turned her back ('<i><small>RP</small></i>) on her mother-in-law; <small>RUTH</small>, because she regarded (<i><small>R'TH</small></i>) the words of her mother-in-law. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THEY LIVED THERE ABOUT TEN YEARS</small>. All those ten years (in Moab) the Holy One had been warning them. When he saw that they did not repent, he began to raise his hand against their camels and against their cattle; but they did not return.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 17:4; Ruth R. 2:10; <i>PRK</i> 7:10; <i>PR</i> 17:6.</i> When he saw that they did not repent (literally: return in repentance), immediately (in vs. 5): <small>BOTH OF THEM, MAHLON AND CHILION, ALSO DIED</small>. Thus &lt; you may infer &gt; that it is difficult for the Holy One to raise his hand against a human being. So what does he do to them? He deprives them of their assets, and they sell them.
When someone sins, what does the Holy One do to him first? He brings poverty upon him so that he sells his field, as stated (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T‘Arakh.</i> 5:9; above, 9:2.</i> If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells his house, as stated (in Lev. 25:29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells his daughter, as stated (in Exod. 21:7): <small>AND IF SOMEONE SELLS HIS DAUGHTER AS A SLAVE</small>. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells himself, as stated (in Deut. 15:12): <small>IF THERE IS SOLD TO YOU A FELLOW HEBREW</small>. Why all this? Because they became poor through &lt; their &gt; iniquities. (Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>.
(Lev. 25:25:) <small>&lt; WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, &gt; THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, &lt; THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM, AND REDEEM</small>…. <small>&gt;</small> Who was this? Boaz. When? When Naomi sold the field, as stated (in Ruth 4:3): <small>NAOMI IS SELLING THE PARCEL OF LAND WHICH BELONGED TO OUR KINSMAN ELIMELECH</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 25:25): <small>AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: Elimelech, Salmon, So-and-So,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Peloni Almoni.</i> According to Ruth 4:1, this was the “name” of Ruth’s most closely related redeemer.</i> and Naomi's father were all descendants of Nahshon ben Amminadab.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BB</i> 91a.

Cf. the Gk.: <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> of the generation. So for what reason were they punished? Because they went abroad from the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ruth 1:19): <small>&lt; WHEN THEY CAME TO BETHLEHEM, &gt; THE WHOLE CITY WAS EXCITED OVER THEM, AND THE WOMEN SAID: IS THIS NAOMI</small>? What is the meaning of <small>IS THIS NAOMI</small>? You saw Naomi when she went abroad from the land of Israel. What has happened to her? (Lev. 25:25:) <small>THEN HIS REDEEMER</small> (<i>go'el</i>) <small>SHALL COME, &lt; THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED</small> (<i>qarov) &gt;.</i> This is Boaz, since it is stated (in Ruth 2:20): <small>THE MAN IS OUR RELATIVE</small> (<i>qarov</i>), <small>HE IS ONE OF OUR REDEEMING KIN</small> (<i>go'el</i>). At that time Ruth went to Boaz. Her mother-in-law said to her (in Ruth 3:2): <small>SEE, HE IS WINNOWING BARLEY ON THE THRESHING FLOOR TONIGHT</small>. &lt; If &gt; he was a prince (<i>nasi</i>), would he have been winnowing on a threshing floor?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 3:16.</i> It is simply because his generation was dissolute in sexual matters, that he went out to guard his threshing floor.

"And I shall go down" is {not written} [the actual written text (<i>ketiv</i>)]. She said to her: My merit will go down with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth R. 5:12.</i> She did not do as her mother-in-law had told her. What did Ruth do? After she went down to the threshing floor, she did &lt; what she was told &gt;, as stated (in vs. 6): <small>SHE WENT DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR AND DID JUST AS HER MOTHER-IN-LAW HAD COMMANDED HER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since she only obeyed Naomi after she had arrived at the threshing floor, she must have neglected to wash and anoint herself.</i> Why? It is simply that she said: The generation was dissolute in sexual matters. What if they see me made up and say: Perhaps she is a harlot? (Vs. 7:) <small>THEN, WHEN BOAZ HAD EATEN AND DRUNK, AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>? That he was busy at the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth R. 5:15.</i> Thus it is stated (by wisdom in Prov. 9:5): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. (Ruth 3:7, cont.:) <small>AND WHEN HE CAME TO LIE DOWN BESIDE THE GRAIN PILE, THEN SHE CAME IN SECRET</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>IN SECRET</small> (<small><i>LT</i></small>; rt.: <i><small>LWT</small></i>)?

That he seized her head, because he thought that it was a spirit.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Exod. 3:16; Ruth R. 6:1, both of which explain further that he felt her head for hair, because demons have no hair.</i> &lt; It is &gt; just as you say (in Jud. 16:29): <small>AND SAMSON EMBRACED</small> (rt.: <i><small>LPT</small></i>) <small>THE TWO MIDDLE PILLARS</small>. (Ruth <i>3:9:</i>) <small>THEN HE SAID: WHO ARE YOU? AND SHE SAID: I AM YOUR HANDMAID RUTH</small>. He said to her: what have you come here to do? She said to him: To fulfill the Torah (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>…, [<small>THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME</small>]. Arise and fulfill the Torah. He said to her: Since you have come to fulfill the Torah, (Ruth 3:13:) <small>SPEND THE NIGHT. THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT, IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU, GOOD</small> (<i>tov</i>); for he had a kinsman older than he, whose name was Tov. R.

(Ruth 4:1:) <small>THEN BOAZ WENT UP TO THE GATE AND SAT DOWN THERE, &lt; AND BEHOLD, THE REDEEMER OF WHOM BOAZ HAD SPOKEN WAS PASSING BY &gt;</small>. He said to him: Sit down, and we shall look into the Torah.

(Vs. 4, cont.:) <small>IF YOU WILL REDEEM IT, REDEEM IT</small>. (Vs. 6:) <small>THEN THE REDEEMER SAID</small> {<small>TO BOAZ</small>}: <small>&lt; YOU &gt; TAKE OVER &lt; MY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION &gt; FOR YOURSELF</small>. At that time Boaz redeemed what Naomi had sold. Now from where did Boaz learn &lt; what to do &gt;? From this section (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, &lt; THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM, AND REDEEM</small>…. <small>&gt;</small>

(Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small> (<i>huqqim</i>)…. This text is related (to Job 14:5): <small>IF HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED</small>, [<small>THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS IS WITH YOU; YOU HAVE SET LIMITS</small> (<i>huqqim</i>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>IF HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Lev. 10:1.</i> When the Holy One created the world, he determined the days of each and every one, as stated (in Gen. 1:14): <small>AND LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS, SEASONS</small>, [<small>DAYS, AND YEARS</small>]. Now to whom did he give them? To Israel, as stated (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB</small>, [<small>HIS STATUTES</small> (<i>huqqim</i>) <small>AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL</small>]. (Job 14:5, cont.:) <small>THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS IS WITH YOU; YOU HAVE SET HIS LIMITS</small> (<i>huqqim</i>). The Holy One said to Israel: If you have carried out {his} [my] statutes (<i>huqqim</i>), the Adversary (<i>Satan</i>) shall not touch you, although it is stated (of Death in Is. 28:19): <small>AS OFTEN AS HE TRANSGRESSES, HE SHALL SEIZE YOU</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Buber has noted the amplified, more understandable parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 10:1: The Holy One said to Israel: “If you have carried out my statutes (<i>huqqim</i>), the Adversary shall not touch you, as stated (in Job 14:5): <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>. But if you do not carry out my statutes (<i>huqqim</i>), then the Adversary shall touch you, as stated (in Is. 28:19): <small>AS OFTEN AS HE TRANSGRESSES, HE SHALL SEIZE YOU</small>.” In other words, Israel is safe from the death-dealing Adversary as long as the statutory limits (<i>huqqim</i>) remain intact through Israel’s observance of them.</i> (Job 14:5, cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE SET HIS LIMITS</small> (<i>huqqim</i>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>. I said so to Solomon, when he asked for wisdom. And what did I say to him? (I Kings 3:13:) <small>I HAVE ALSO GRANTED YOU WHAT YOU DID NOT ASK, BOTH RICHES AND HONOR</small>. So if you fulfill the Torah, the angel of death shall not touch you, as stated to him (in I Kings 3:14): <small>THEN I WILL LENGTHEN YOUR DAYS</small>. (Job 14:5:) <small>YOU HAVE SET LIMITS</small> (<i>huqqim</i>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>…. If the first Adam had observed the Torah, the ordinances that I gave him, he would not have died. Therefore, it is written (in Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small> (<i>huqqim</i>)….

Instead (according to II Kings 17:9): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ATTRIBUTED THINGS WHICH WERE NOT RIGHT &lt; TO THE LORD THEIR GOD: THEY BUILT THEMSELVES HIGH PLACES IN ALL THEIR CITIES &gt;</small>…. I have also set upon you things which I did not write in the Torah.

Now surely [if] you have set [things] on me which were not &lt; right &gt; by me, just as Isaiah said (in Is. 1:4): <small>THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD</small>; do not say: <small>THEY HAVE FORSAKEN</small> ('<i><small>ZBW</small></i>) <small>&lt; ME &gt;</small>, but: They, as it were, have made me worth forsaking ('<i><small>YZBW</small></i>) (i.e., caused me to be cruel).

It also says (in Is. 63:10): <small>SO HE WAS TURNED INTO THEIR ENEMY</small>. Therefore, Hosea says: Who has brought this about for you? &lt; It was &gt; because you did not heed him, as stated (in Hos. 9:17): {<small>GOD</small>} [<small>MY GOD</small>] <small>WILL REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HEED HIM</small>.

It also says so (in Hag. 1:10): <small>FOR THAT REASON THE HEAVENS OVER YOU HAVE WITHHELD DEW, AND THE EARTH HAS WITHHELD ITS PRODUCE</small>. Because of your sins, the nations are also afflicted. R.

Thus because Israel sins, all the whole world is afflicted, as stated (in Hag. 1:10): <small>FOR THAT REASON THE HEAVENS OVER YOU HAVE WITHHELD DEW</small>. But if &lt; the Israelites &gt; do not sin, all the world is blessed on their account, as stated (in Gen. 26:4): <small>AND THROUGH YOUR SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED</small>. The Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 20:19–20 [22–23]): <small>YOU YOURSELVES HAVE SEEN THAT I SPOKE WITH YOU FROM THE HEAVENS. ALONG WITH ME YOU SHALL NOT MAKE GODS OF SILVER, NOR SHALL YOU MAKE FOR YOURSELVES GODS OF GOLD</small>.

(Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>…. This text is related (to Prov. 1:20): <small>WISDOM SHOUTS FOR JOY IN THE STREET; IN THE SQUARES SHE RAISES HER VOICE</small>. R.

He said to him: You do not know how to read (Scripture), nor you do know how to recite (Mishnah). What is the meaning of <small>WISDOM SHOUTS FOR JOY IN THE STREET? IN THE STREET</small> of Torah. In the case of a pearl,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>margelis.</i></i> where is it sold? In the street (under the daylight). Similarly Torah is <small>IN THE STREET</small> &lt; of Torah &gt;, where she (i.e., wisdom &gt; was said to be. And what is the meaning of (Prov. 1:20, cont.:) <small>IN THE SQUARES</small> (rt.: <i><small>RHB</small></i>)? In the place where one amplifies (rt.: <i><small>RHB</small></i>) it. And where do they amplify it? In the synagogues and in the secondary schools (literally: in the houses of midrash). Therefore it is stated (in Prov. 1:20): <small>IN THE SQUARES SHE RAISES HER VOICE</small>.

(Prov. 1:21, cont.:) <small>IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITY GATES SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>.

Another interpretation (of Prov. 1:21): <small>SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>. R. Aha said: She speaks what is good and she speaks what is evil. If you do not heed me, (according to Deut. 28:24): <small>THE LORD WILL MAKE THE RAINFALL OF YOUR LAND POWDER &lt; AND DUST &gt;</small>…. Here is the evil.

So they came forth from Egypt on this condition: That they build the dwelling place, so that the Divine Presence might dwell among them, as stated (in vs. 46): <small>AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD WHO BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT, SO THAT I MIGHT DWELL IN THEIR MIDST</small>. Now if they have done my will, my Divine Presence shall not move from their midst. Why? R. Samuel bar Abba said: The Holy One desired that, just as he has an abode above, so he would have an abode below, for so he said to the first Adam: If you are worthy, just as I am king over the heavenly beings, so I will make you king over the lower beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:16; Gen. R. 3:19.</i> It is so stated (in Gen. 2:15): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD TOOK THE HUMAN BEING &lt; AND PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO WORK IT AND PRESERVE IT &gt;</small>. Now the word <small>TOOK</small> can only be a word of exaltation, just as you say (in Gen. 12:15): <small>AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH'S HOUSE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 16:5.</i> And it also says (in Esth. 2:16): <small>SO ESTHER WAS TAKEN UNTO KING AHASUERUS, UNTO HIS ROYAL PALACE</small>. But he (the Holy One) did not do so. Rather, when Adam sinned, he removed his Divine Presence from him. Then when Israel arose, the Holy One said to them: You shall only go forth from Egypt on condition that you make a dwelling place for me, so that my Divine Presence may dwell among you, as stated (in Exod. 25:8): <small>LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &lt; THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM &gt;</small>. So also he said to Solomon (in I Kings 6:12–13): <small>WITH REGARD TO THIS HOUSE WHICH YOU ARE BUILDING, IF YOU WALK IN MY TORAHS</small>, {<small>IF YOU</small>} <small>CARRY OUT MY ORDINANCES, AND OBSERVE ALL MY COMMANDMENTS TO WALK IN THEM, THEN I WILL</small> {<small>ESTABLISH YOU, AS</small>} [<small>FULFILL MY WORD WITH YOU, WHICH</small>] <small>I SPOKE UNTO YOUR FATHER DAVID. THEN I WILL DWELL IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND WILL NEVER ABANDON &lt; MY PEOPLE ISRAEL &gt;</small>. (I Kings 9:6:) <small>IF YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN TURN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING ME</small>…, what will I do? (Vs. 7:) <small>THEN I WILL CUT OFF ISRAEL FROM UPON</small> [<small>THE FACE OF</small>] <small>THE LAND WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THEM, AND I WILL CAST</small> {<small>THIS HOUSE</small>} [<small>THE HOUSE WHICH I HAVE CONSECRATED FOR MY NAME &lt; FROM MY PRESENCE &gt;</small>…. ] Why? &lt; Because &gt; those are &lt; the &gt; terms which are stated (in Lev. 26:3): <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES…. THEN I WILL SET MY DWELLING PLACE IN YOUR MIDST</small>…. (Vs. 14:) <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT HEED ME</small>, what is written there (in vs. 31)? <small>THEN I WILL MAKE YOUR SANCTUARIES DESOLATE</small>. What did Solomon do? He had a lot of wives and horses; and it is written (in I Kings 11:4): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN SOLOMON'S OLD AGE THAT HIS WIVES LED HIS HEART ASTRAY &lt; AFTER OTHER GODS &gt;</small>. The Holy One said to him: I have given you the Torah &lt; for you &gt; to carry out its commandments, and you have seen the terms which I prescribed to you in it, as stated (in Ps. 72:1): <small>TO SOLOMON. O GOD, GIVE YOUR ORDINANCES TO THE KING, AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE KING'S SON</small>. It is also written (in I Kings 11:11): <small>BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN WITH YOU, AND YOU DID NOT KEEP MY COVENANT AND MY STATUTES WHICH I COMMANDED YOU, I WILL SURELY REND THE</small> {<small>KINGDOMS</small>} [<small>KINGDOM</small>] <small>FROM YOU AND GIVE</small> {<small>THEM</small>} [<small>IT</small>] <small>TO YOUR SERVANT</small>. So what do I do? (According to Is. 55:11) <small>SO SHALL MY WORD BE WHICH GOES FORTH FROM MY MOUTH: IT SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO ME EMPTY</small>. Manasseh arose to make the image and bring it into the Holy of Holies, as stated (in II Chron. 33:7; cf. II Kings 21:7): <small>AND HE SET UP A SCULPTURED IMAGE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, OF WHICH GOD HAD SAID UNTO DAVID AND UNTO HIS SON SOLOMON: IN THIS HOUSE AND IN JERUSALEM, WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, I SHALL SET MY NAME FOREVER</small>. Then the Holy One called unto Jeremiah and said to him (in Lam. 4:3): <small>EVEN DRAGONS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash follows the ketiv (<i>tannin</i>). The qere reads <i>tannim</i> (“jackals”).</i> <small>EXTEND A BREAST TO NURSE THEIR YOUNG; &lt; THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE HAS BECOME CRUEL &gt;</small>. When the dragon (<i>tannin</i>) comes to nurse from its mother, she sees it from afar and extends her breasts for it to nurse; for it would not see her breasts, &lt; if &gt; covered, and would not nurse. Now my children do not act like this. Instead, when they saw me entering the house, Manasseh came and brought in the image in order to force me out of it. [At<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This immediate bracketed section is added from <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 10:3, and from Buber’s 5th Oxford ms (Hunt 74 Uri Hch NC No. 2337).</i> first they made a single face,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>prosopon.</i></i> and set it up to the west. The Divine Presence went, as it were, to another corner, a place where the image would not be seen. When Manasseh saw that, he made four faces so that the Divine Presence would see them and depart. Thus it is stated (in Is. 28:20): <small>FOR THE COACH IS TOO SHORT FOR STRETCHING OUT, AND THE MOLTEN IMAGE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Massekhah.</i> Most biblical translations render the word as denoting a kind of covering here and in Is. 25:7, but <i>massekhah</i> generally refers to an image. In any case, the image concept must have suggested the use of the verse in this context.</i> <small>TOO NARROW</small> (<i>tsar</i>) <small>FOR CURLING UP</small>.] Also, unlike the dragons (in Lam. 4:3) they did not <small>EXTEND A BREAST TO NURSE THEIR YOUNG</small>. The Holy One said: What am I doing here? (Hos. 5:15:) <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN TO MY PLACE</small>. "I will go and return" is not written here, but <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN</small>. Now if had been written: "I will go and return (to the heavenly abode)," there would have been no hope; however, the Holy One said: Although I am going, let him repent, and I will return. It is therefore written: <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN TO MY PLACE, UNTIL THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR GUILT AND SEEK MY FACE. IN THEIR DISTRESS</small> (<i>tsar</i>) <small>THEY WILL SEARCH DILIGENTLY FOR ME</small>. Out of the midst of distress, when it comes upon them, they shall repent, and I will restore my Divine Presence. R. Eliezer says: If Israel repents, they will be redeemed; but if Israel does not repent, they will not be redeemed, since it is stated (in Is. 30:15): <small>IN STILLNESS AND CALM YOU SHALL BE SAVED; &lt; IN QUIET AND CONFIDENCE SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH. BUT YOU WERE UNWILLING &gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yTa‘an.</i> 1:1 (63d-64a); <i>Sanh</i>. 97b.</i> R. Joshua says: Whether they repent or do not repent, when the end arrives, they will be redeemed immediately, since it is stated (in Is. 60:22): <small>I THE LORD WILL HASTEN IT IN ITS TIME</small>. R. Eleazar said: The Holy One will raise over them someone as evil as Haman. Then he shall enslave them, and for that reason they shall repent, since it is stated (in Is. 59:19): <small>FOR DISTRESS SHALL COME LIKE A STREAM, WITH THE WIND OF THE LORD DRIVING IT ONWARD</small>. At that time (according to vs. 20): <small>THEN A REDEEMER SHALL COME TO ZION AND TO THOSE IN JACOB WHO TURN BACK FROM TRANSGRESSION, SAYS THE LORD</small>…. So did R. Tanhuma Berabbi interpret.]

The Holy One said: Whoever makes &lt; lights &gt; like these shall be equal to me. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <i>'<small>RK</small></i>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>? These words can only be words &lt; referring to &gt; light, since it is stated (in Lev. 24:4): <small>HE SHALL SET</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RK</small></i>) <small>UP &lt; THE LAMPS &gt; UPON THE UNALLOYED LAMPSTAND</small>.

Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? R. Abbin said: Who like you sets battles in order? <small>IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <i>'<small>RK</small></i>) can only refer to warfare, since it is stated (in Gen. 14:8): <small>AND THEY ENGAGED</small> (rt.: <i>'<small>RK</small></i>) <small>THEM IN WARFARE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small> (in warfare)?

Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? When the Holy One wanted to create Adam, the ministering angels said to the Holy One (in Ps. 8:5 [4]): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM, AND A CHILD OF ADAM THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF HIM</small>? What do you want from this human? The Holy One said to them: Who is to fulfill my Torah and my commandments? They said to him: We will fulfill your Torah. He said to them: You are unable.

It is written in &lt; Torah &gt; (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>, but there are none among you who bear &lt; children &gt;. It is written in &lt; Torah &gt; (in Lev. 11:21): <small>THESE YOU MAY EAT</small>, but in your case there is no eating among you. Ergo, the Torah is not going forth to you, as stated (in Job 28:13): <small>NOR IS &lt; WISDOM &gt; FOUND IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Rather when the Holy One said to Israel that they should make a tabernacle for him and &lt; when &gt; they had made it, they began to build the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and to offer sacrifice within it. &lt; Then &gt; the Holy One began to give them several commandments. These commands concerned every single thing, and they carried them out.

Another interpretation (of Lev. 27:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>…. This text is related (to Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>, [<small>BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small> (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>)]. This refers to the Torah, because when one is a Torah scholar (literally: child of Torah), he learns how one acquires lives (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>), as stated (ibid.): <small>BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Lev. 10:5.</i> And so you find in the case of Jephthah the Gileadite, because he was not a Torah scholar, he forfeited his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 60:5; Lev. R. 37:4.</i> When? In the time that he fought with the children of Ammon and made a vow, as stated (in Jud. 11:30–31): <small>THEN JEPHTHAH MADE A VOW TO THE LORD, &lt; AND SAID: IF YOU INDEED GIVE THE CHILDREN OF AMMON INTO MY HAND, &gt; THEN IT SHALL BE THAT WHATEVER COMES FORTH</small>…, <small>&lt; SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD, AND I WILL OFFER IT UP AS A BURNT OFFERING &gt;</small>. At that time the Holy One was angry with him. The Holy One said: If there had come out from his house a dog, a pig, or a camel, he would have offered it to me. The Holy One summoned his daughter to him, as stated (in Jud. 11:34–35): <small>AND THERE WAS HIS DAUGHTER COMING OUT TO MEET HIM &lt;</small>….<small> &gt; AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN HE SAW HER, &lt; THAT HE RENT HIS CLOTHES…. &gt;</small> But was not Phinehas there?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">As a high priest he could have annulled the vow, as explained in Eccl.

However, Phinehas had said: I am a high priest and the son of a high priest. Shall I humble myself and go to an ignoramus <i>'am ha'arets</i>)? But Jephthah said: I am head of the tribes of Israel and head of the magistrates. Shall I humble myself and go to a commoner?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> Between the two of them that poor woman perished; so the two of them were liable for her blood. In the case of Phinehas, the Holy Spirit left him. In the case of Jephthah, his bones were scattered, as stated (in Jud. 12:7): <small>AND HE WAS BURIED IN THE CITIES OF GILEAD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Translations tend to emend the text and have Jephthah buried in a single city.</i> His daughter had said to him: My Father, is it ever written in the Torah: They offer the lives (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>) of their sons upon the alter? And is it not written (in Lev. 1:2): [<small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD FROM THE CATTLE</small>], <small>&lt; YOU SHALL PRESENT YOUR OFFERING &gt; FROM THE HERD OR FROM THE FLOCK</small>, &lt; i.e., &gt; from the cattle and not from the children of Adam? He said to her: My daughter, I made a vow (in Jud. 11:31): <small>THEN IT SHALL BE THAT WHATEVER COMES FORTH</small>…. [She said to him:] When our father Jacob made a vow (in Gen. 28:22): <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>, and when the Holy One gave him twelve tribes, did he ever offer up one of them as a sacrifice? [Moreover, does not Hannah &lt; do likewise &gt;, when she makes a vow and says (in I Sam. 1:11): <small>THEN I WILL GIVE HIM TO THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE</small>. Did she ever offer up her son as a sacrifice to the Holy One?] All these things she said to him, but he did not heed her. She said to him: Let me go to a court of law. Perhaps one of them will find a loophole for your words. Thus it is stated (in Jud. 11:37): <small>LEAVE ME ALONE FOR TWO MONTHS</small>, [<small>SO THAT I MAY GO AND COME DOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS</small>]. R. Levi ben Berekhyah said: Is there anyone who comes down to the mountains? Does not one go up to the mountains? So what is the meaning of <small>AND COME DOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS</small>?

So it is with reference to him that the Scripture has said (in Prov. 28:3): <small>A POOR MAN WHO EXPLOITS THE INDIGENT IS A TORRENTIAL RAIN WHICH LEAVES NO BREAD. A POOR MAN</small>: This is Jephthah, since he was poor in the Torah. He was a &lt; mere &gt; sycamore shoot.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The metaphor designates one who is poor.</i> (Prov. 28:3, cont.:) <small>WHO EXPLOITS THE INDIGENT</small>, since he exploited the indigent, when he said (in Jud. 12:6): <small>SAY: <i>SHIBBOLETH</i>; AND HE SAID</small> <i><small>SIBBOLETH</small></i>. Then he slaughtered him. Therefore, he is (according to Prov. 28:3, cont.) <small>A TORRENTIAL RAIN, AND THERE IS NO BREAD</small>, in that he had someone who would undo his vow; however (ibid., cont.): <small>THERE IS NO BREAD</small>, in that the Holy One had taken away the halakhah from them, so that they would not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow. When they did not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow, he went up and slaughtered her before the Holy One. Then the Holy Spirit proclaimed: Did I desire you to sacrifice lives (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>) to me, &lt; lives &gt; (according to Jer. 19:5), <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED, NEVER SPOKE FOR, AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND. WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Abraham, that he slaughter his son. Instead I said to him (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>…. &lt; It was &gt; in order to make known to you how Abraham carried out my will, when the nations of the world were saying: Why does the Holy One love Abraham so much? For that reason he said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>…. Ergo (in Jer. 19:5): <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Abraham, certainly not to slaughter his son, <small>NEVER SPOKE FOR</small> to Jephthah to offer up his daughter as a sacrifice to me, <small>AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small>, that the king of Moab would fall into the hand of the King of Israel and offer up his firstborn son to me as a sacrifice, as stated (in II Kings 3:27): <small>SO HE TOOK HIS FIRSTBORN SON, WHO WOULD BECOME KING IN HIS STEAD, AND OFFERED HIM UP AS A BURNT OFFERING UPON THE WALL</small>.] Who caused Jephthah to forfeit his daughter? &lt; He himself &gt; because he had not studied the Torah; for if he had studied the Torah, he would not had forfeited his daughter, since it is written (in Lev. 27:2, 4): <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS &lt; TO THE LORD THE VALUE OF HUMAN BEINGS</small> (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>)<small> &gt;</small>…. <small>AND IF IT IS A FEMALE &lt; …. &gt;</small> Ergo (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE, &lt; BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small> (<i><small>NPShWT</small></i>) <small> &gt;</small>.

[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 27:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>. The nations say (in Micah 6:6–7): <small>WITH WHAT SHALL I COME BEFORE THE LORD, BOW MYSELF BEFORE GOD ON HIGH</small>? [….] <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS</small> […? <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRSTBORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION, THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL</small>?] The Holy One said to them: Do you want to offer your children to me? Neither your children nor your sacrifices do I want. For my children I have given a parashah on values (in Lev. 27:1–8) and a parashah on sacrifices, &lt; i.e. &gt; which of your offerings are acceptable to me (in Lev. 1). And so it says (in Ps. 37:16): <small>BETTER IS THE LITTLE THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE HAS</small>. You yourself know what is at the beginning of the book (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, [<small>AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>]: <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>, &lt; i.e. &gt; <small>OF YOU</small>, and not "of the nations." Then at the end of the book &lt; one finds &gt; (in Lev. 27:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>…. It also says (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB</small>…. The Holy One said to Israel: If you bring before me your value equivalents, I will ascribe it to you as if you had offered up your lives before me. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 27:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS TO THE LORD THE VALUE OF HUMAN BEINGS</small>…. The Holy One said: By virtue of the value equivalents (rt.: '<i><small>RK</small></i>) I am saving you from the &lt; fiery &gt; preparation (rt.: '<i><small>RK</small></i>) of Gehinnom,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

However, when you were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and when I brought you out from there, I had you lie down under clouds of glory and raised up three redeemers for you to serve you, [as stated] (in (Micah 6:4): <small>AND I SENT MOSES, AARON, AND MIRIAM BEFORE YOU</small>. [Through the merit of Moses you ate manna, &lt;a food&gt; which &lt;even&gt; the holy ancestors had not seen, as stated (in Deut. 8:3): <small>SO HE AFFLICTED YOU WITH HUNGER BUT FED YOU WITH MANNA, &lt;WHICH NEITHER YOU HAD KNOWN NOR HAD YOUR ANCESTORS KNOWN….&gt;</small> Through the merit of Aaron I surrounded you in clouds of glory, as stated (in Ps. 105:39): <small>HE SPREAD A CLOUD FOR A COVER AND A FIRE TO GIVE LIGHT AT NIGHT</small>. There were seven clouds: one from above, one from below, one from each of the four winds, and one before you. He smote snakes and scorpions, leveled the mountains and valleys for them, and burned the thornbushes so that they sent up smoke. When all the kings of the East and West saw this, the peoples of the world said (in Cant. 3:6): <small>WHO IS THIS THAT COMES UP FROM THE DESERT LIKE COLUMNS OF SMOKE</small>? It is also written (in Deut. 29:4): <small>I LED YOU FORTY YEARS IN THE DESERT</small>; [<small>YOUR CLOTHES DID NOT WEAR OUT…</small>.] In the case of a baby, all the time that it was growing, its garments and clothes were growing along with it.

Do not the people of the province have to be responsible for their maintenance? But the Holy One did not act like that. Instead he sent out Moses, Aaron, [and Miriam], as stated (in Micah 6:4): <small>AND I SENT MOSES, AARON, AND MIRIAM BEFORE YOU</small>. Thus through their merit, Israel was sustained. The manna was through the merit of Moses. [You yourself know that it is so.

The midrash understands <i>MMHRT</i> (“on the next day”) as two words, <i>MHR</i> and <i>MT</i>, which can be translated: “On the day after he died.” In adopting this interpretation the midrash goes against the weight of Rabbinic and other traditions that Moses died sometime during the month of Adar, usually on the seventh of that month (as in <i>Qid.</i> 38a; etc.), since (according Josh. 5:12) the manna did not cease until the sixteenth of Nisan. The interpretation here and in Numb. R. 1:2 may result from the simple assertion commonly found in Rabbinic sources (e.g., in <i>TSot</i>. 11:8 [10]; <i>Ta‘an</i> 9a.) that, when Moses died, the manna ceased.</i> The clouds of glory &lt;came&gt; through the merit of Aaron. You yourself know that it is so. When Aaron passed away, what is written (in Numb. 21:4)? <small>BUT THE TEMPER OF THE PEOPLE GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>, because the sun was shining down upon them (without a cloud cover).

Then the princes would stand beside it and say (in the words of Numb. 21:17): <small>RISE UP, O WELL</small>; and the well would rise up. After that, I brought them quails (cf. Numb. 11:31).

In a similar vein, see Wolf Einhorn’s commentary, <i>Perush Maharzaw,</i> on Numb. R. 1:2.

After that he spoke with him in Sinai, as stated (in Lev. 25:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI</small>.

This is Moses, who was king of Torah, which is called <small>STRENGTH</small>, where it is stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING'S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>.

Hence, our masters have said: Every bride who conceals herself (because of humility, i.e., modesty), even though she be an &lt;ordinary&gt; Israelite woman, is worthy of being married to a priest and to raise up high priests, since it is stated (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1-2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small> […: <small>TAKE A CENSUS OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL…</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL.

It is simply that just as the navel is situated in the middle of the body, so the Sanhedrin of Israel was situated in the middle of the Temple. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>? That there was never one less than a third of them &lt;present&gt;. <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. Whoever mixes it properly mixes a third of a cup of wine with two parts water. Thus the Sanhedrin would sit from &lt;the time of&gt; the morning sacrifice until the sacrifice at twilight. But did not one of them turn away for the needs of nature? So what did they do when one wanted to leave? He would count. If twenty three were present, he would leave; if not, he would not leave. Why? Because it is written (ibid.): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. Thus there was never less than a third of them &lt;present&gt;.

It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. The stubble and the straw, however, are not numbered. Instead they are measured.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Buber’s Spanish MS (described on p. 150 on his “<i>Mavo</i>”) plus the parallel texts read: “Nor are they measured.”</i> Thus the peoples of the world are compared with stubble and straw, as stated (in Ps. 35:5): <small>THEY SHALL BE LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD OVERTHROWING THEM</small>.

But in the case of Israel, the Holy One does have pleasure from them. They read the <i>Shema</i>', pray, and bless the name of the Holy One every day; therefore, they are numbered all the time. For that reason they were compared with the wheat, as stated (in Cant. 7:3) <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>.

Simply that when our father Jacob departed from this world, he said to them (in Gen. 47:30): <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS, YOU ARE TO TAKE ME UP FROM EGYPT AND BURY ME IN THEIR GRAVE</small>. He went around to all his sons, blessed them, and gave them a charge. He said to them: When you take me, you are to take me with reverence and honor. Let no other person, neither one of the Egyptians nor one of your children, touch my bier, because there are some among them who have taken &lt;wives&gt; from the daughters of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

His children, but not his grandchildren (who were forbidden to touch the bier)! {(Gen. 50:13): <small>IN THAT HIS CHILDREN BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>.} How did he charge them? He said to them: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun shall carry my bier on the east; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, on the west; Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, on the north. Joseph is not to carry &lt;at all&gt;, because he is a king; but you must impart honor to him. Nor is Levi to carry. Why? Because he carries the ark (<i>aron</i>), and whoever carries the ark of the One who Lives Forever is not to carry a coffin (<i>aron</i>) of the dead. If you do this and carry my bier, just as I have charged you, the Holy One is going to have you encamp by the various standards. When he passed away, they carried him just as he had charged them. It is so stated (in Numb. 5:12): <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM JUST AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>. What is written next (in vs. 13)? <small>HIS CHILDREN BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>, when Israel went forth from Egypt. The Holy One said: Now is the time for them to make standards, just as their father had proclaimed to them that they were going to make standards. Immediately the Holy One said to Moses: Make those standards for my name. Immediately Moses began to be concerned. He said: There is going to be dissension among the tribes. If I tell the tribe of Judah to encamp in the east, they will say: It is impossible for us to encamp anywhere but in the south. And so each and every tribe &lt;would act&gt; like that one. The Holy One said to him: [What concern is that to you?] They do not need you in this matter. They will recognize their dwellings by themselves. Why? Because their father's will was in their hand on how to encamp by the standards. I am not establishing something new. They already have their father's arrangements<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>taxeis.</i></i> in their hands.

Hence they say: Woe to the wicked person; and woe to his neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Suk</i>. 56b; Numb. R. 18:5; <i>ARN</i>, A, 9:1; see <i>Avot</i> 1:7.</i> These are the three tribes which were neighbors of Korah (the grandson of Kohath) and his community in the South. These were destroyed with him in his dissension (as stated in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, &lt;EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY&gt;</small>…. On the west were the children of Gershom (i.e., Gershon ben Levi), with Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin being adjacent to them; and on the North also were the children of Merari (ben Levi), with Dan, Naphtali, and Asher being adjacent to them. [Seven] clouds of glory were surrounding them, and this was their &lt;method&gt; of travel. There was a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion.</i></i> for Moses in the cloud when it departed. When it departed, he would say (in Numb. 10:35): <small>RISE UP, O LORD, AND MAY YOUR ENEMIES BE SCATTERED</small>. Then the cloud would depart. When the cloud departed, they all prepared to travel and put away their implements. Whoever had a domestic beast &lt;put them on it&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed words are from the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:12.</i>; and if &lt;a person&gt; had none, the cloud took the remainder. When they were settled, they blew the trumpets. Then Judah and its standard moved out, first its prince and his tribe after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">CF. Numb.

Each and every tribe had its flag dyed like the color of its stone. Then over them were the clouds. {Until they were settled, they blew the trumpets. They traveled, and likewise &lt;the clouds&gt; traveled over them.} Moreover, something like a kind of beam came out of the cloud, so that they would know in which direction they would be traveling. So was the journey of each and every standard. &lt;When&gt; they finished going to where it wanted them to camp, &lt;since&gt; that cloud which appeared like a kind of beam had, as it were, been traveling independently, they knew that they would camp in that place. &lt;When&gt; clouds of glory stood still for them, they began putting &lt;things&gt; away in their tents where they were to rest. Then the cloud which was over the Tabernacle, moved over the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps. First it stood still. When it stood still, the children of Kohath and the children of Levi set up the Tabernacle in the presence of all the camps before they came, as stated (in Numb. 10:21): <small>AND THEY WOULD SET UP THE TABERNACLE BEFORE THEY CAME</small>. When they had set up the Tabernacle, each and every one set up &lt;camp&gt; in his &lt;proper&gt; place. Then the clouds of glory stood over them. This was grandeur in the hands of Moses, for the cloud of the glorious Divine Presence did not come down to the Tabernacle, until Moses had said (in Numb. 10:36): <small>RETURN, O LORD, TO THE MYRIAD THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL</small>. Then the clouds of glory encompassed them. Moreover, the Holy Spirit says through Solomon (in Cant. 6:4): <small>YOU ARE AS BEAUTIFUL, MY DARLING, AS TIRZAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AS TIRZAH</small> (<i><small>KTRT</small>s<small>H</small></i>, rt.: <i><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></i>)?

Another interpretation (of Cant. 6:4). <small>AS TIRZAH</small> (rt.: <i><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></i>) &lt;means&gt; just as you are pleasing (rt.: <i><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></i>) to me in the sacrifices. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:4): <small>AND IT SHALL BE PLEASING</small> (rt.: <i><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></i>) <small>FOR HIM TO ATONE FOR HIM</small>. (Cant. 6:4, cont.:) <small>AS COMELY AS JERUSALEM</small> (<i><small>YRUS</small>h<small>LYM</small></i>) &lt;means&gt; like these ministering Angels, in that they feared (rt.: <i><small>YR</small></i>') &lt;me&gt; and were reconciled (rt.: <i><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></i>) to me. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AWESOME AS &lt;HOSTS&gt; WITH STANDARDS</small>, like the standards which I gave you.

It is therefore stated (in Deut. 32:10): <small>HE FOUND HIM IN A DESERT LAND</small>. The world was a desert, before Israel came forth from Egypt. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND IN THE VOID WAS A WAILING DESOLATION</small>. The world was void and wailing, before Israel received the Torah. {He did nothing, but when] [When] Israel came forth from Egypt and received the Torah, &lt;the Holy One&gt; enlightened the world, as stated (in Prov. 6:23): <small>FOR THE COMMANDMENT IS A LAMP, AND TORAH IS A LIGHT</small>. [(Deut. 32:10, cont.:) <small>HE ENCIRCLED HIM, HE WATCHED OVER HIM, AND HE PROTECTED HIM AS THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>HE ENCIRCLED HIM</small>?

Blessed are the ears that have heard. To what extent did he cherish them? To what extent did he keep them? To what extent did he protect them? As much, as it were, as the pupil of his eye. See how he cherished them, kept them, and protected them. It is as the Holy One said to Moses: Tell them to make a tabernacle, and I will dwell among them. [I am, as it were, leaving the heavenly beings and coming down to dwell among them.] And not only that, but I will make them standards for my name. Why? Because they are my children, as stated (in Deut. 14:1): <small>YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. Also they are my hosts, as stated (in Exod. 7:4): <small>AND I WILL BRING FORTH MY HOSTS</small>, [<small>MY PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. And so it says (in Numb. 2:3): {<small>YOU SHALL RECKON</small>} <small>THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF JUDAH BY THEIR HOSTS</small>. Therefore, he made those standards for my name, as stated (in Numb. 2:2): <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD</small>,….

When Israel saw them, as they were arrayed by standards (rt.: <i><small>DGL</small></i>), they yearned for standards. They said: O that we might be arrayed with standards like them!

Ergo (in Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE HOUSE OF WINE</small>, namely to Sinai. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. They said: O that he may raise the standard of love over me! And so it says (in Ps. 20:6 [5]): <small>LET US SHOUT FOR JOY IN YOUR SALVATION, AND IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LET US SET UP OUR STANDARDS</small>. The Holy One said to them: Do you yearn for standards? By your life, I will fulfill your petition. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>MAY THE LORD FULFILL ALL YOUR PETITIONS</small>. Immediately the Holy One made known his love to Israel and said to Moses: Go and make those standards like the ones for which they have yearned.

Just as the palm has within it unripenable dates, which never enter the storehouse, yet produces ripe dates, and these do enter the store house; so it was with Israel in the wilderness.

[Another interpretation] (of Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM</small>. &lt;The passage&gt; speaks about the tribe of Levi, in that the Holy One set them apart because of their good works.

When Israel had committed that act (of the golden calf). It is so stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP</small> [<small>AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, &lt;COME&gt; TO ME.

Moreover, you find that the whole tribe of Levi was diminished (in number). And why were they diminished? Because they had seen the Divine Presence. So also when Israel came up from the captivity, they did not find any of them, because they had been diminished, as stated (in Ezra 8:15): <small>SO I VIEWED THE PEOPLE AND THE PRIESTS, BUT I FOUND THERE NONE OF THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. The Holy One said: In this world they were destroyed, because they had seen the Divine Presence, since it is stated (in Exod. 33:20): <small>FOR NO HUMAN SHALL SEE ME AND LIVE</small>. In the world to come, however, when I restore my Divine Presence to Zion, I will be revealed in my glory over all Israel. Then they shall see me and live forever. Thus it is stated (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY SHALL SEE &lt;THE RETURN OF HE LORD TO ZION&gt;</small>. And not only that, but they shall point out my glory to each other with the finger while saying (in the words of Ps. 48:15): <small>FOR THIS GOD, OUR GOD</small>. It also says (In Is. 25:9): <small>AND IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM</small> [<small>AND HE DELIVERED US</small>]. <small>THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.

(Numb. 3:40:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: ENROLL EVERY</small> [<small>FIRST-BORN</small>] <small>MALE…</small>. Let our master instruct us: When an infant is born at eight months, does one profane the Sabbath for it?<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:18; Numb. R. 4:3.</i> Thus have our masters taught: When an infant is born at eight months one does not profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, or move it from place to place; however, its mother does lean over it to suckle it.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>TShab</i>. 15[16]:5; <i>Shab</i>. 135a.</i> And in the case of one moving it on the Sabbath, it is as though he were moving a stone. &lt;When there is&gt; doubt &lt;whether it is&gt; an eight-month infant or a seven-month infant, one does not profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, or move it from place to place. But if it is a sure thing that it is &lt;an infant of&gt; seven months, one does profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, and move it from place to place. And why does one profane the Sabbath for one born, when it is born at seven &lt;months from conception&gt;? Because it is capable of life. However, in the case of one born at eight &lt;months&gt;, it has not &lt;completed&gt; its months and is not capable of life. For that reason one does not profane the Sabbath for it. They asked R. Abbahu: Where is it shown that one born at seven months will live?<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yYev.</i> 4:2 (5d); Gen. R. 14:2; 20:6.</i> He said to them: In the Greek<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YWNYT</i>. Cf.

Now which is &lt;an infant&gt; of eight months? Anyone whose hair and nails are undeveloped. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: whoever does not live thirty days has not &lt;completed&gt; his months, but is a miscarriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shab.</i> 135b; <i>Yev.</i> 36b, 80b.</i> And on what did the knowledge of Rabban [Simeon ben] Gamaliel depend? On the word of Torah, because the first-born were only redeemed after thirty days, [as stated] (in Numb. 18:16): <small>AND THEIR REDEMPTION MONEY — FROM A MONTH OF AGE &lt;AND OLDER&gt; YOU SHALL REDEEM THEM</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses that the first-born should only be redeemed <small>FROM A MONTH OF AGE &lt;AND OLDER&gt;</small>. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Numb. 3:40): <small>AND THE &lt;LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: &gt; ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL A MONTH OF AGE AND OLDER…</small>.

Siman 22

[(Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED, AND I LOVE YOU</small>. The Holy One said to Jacob: Jacob, you are exceedingly precious in my eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:19; Numb. R. 4:1.</i> Why? Because I, as it were, have installed your image<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eikonion</i>.</i> on my glorious throne, and in your name the angels praise me and say (in Ps. 41:14 [13]): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Israel here is the patriarch Jacob, not the people.</i> <small>&lt;FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTINGS</small> Ergo (in Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED</small>.
Another interpretation (of Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS</small>. The Holy One said: Jacob, you are precious in my eyes because I and my angels were, as it were, standing over you when you set out for Paddan-Aram and when you came back. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:10-13): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT…. WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A CERTAIN PLACE…. &lt;THEN HE DREAMED THAT THERE WAS A LADDER PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS; AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON IT.&gt; AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM…</small>. R. Hosha'ya said: Blessed is the one born of woman who has seen the King and his household<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>familia.</i></i> standing over him and ministering to him. But where is it shown in reference to his coming back? Where it is stated (in Gen. 32:2 [1]): <small>SO JACOB WENT ON HIS WAY, AND THE ANGELS OF GOD MET HIM</small>. So much for the angels, but where is it shown for the Divine Presence? (Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN…</small>. It is therefore stated (in Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES</small>.
[Another interpretation (of Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED</small>.] The Holy One said: You are precious in my eyes, because to all the those nations I gave no numbering (<i>minyan</i>), but to you I did give a numbering. It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who had a lot of granaries, but all of them were dirty and full of darnel; so he was not meticulous about numbering. &lt;There was,&gt; however, this granary &lt;which had&gt; beautiful wheat. I therefore want to be meticulous in numbering how many kors<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">One kor is equivalent to somewhat under 400 liters.</i> there are, how many sacks there are in it, &lt;and&gt; how many measures there are in it. Similarly this king is the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One; and this granary (<i>goren</i>) is Israel, since it is stated (in Is. 21:10): <small>MY THRESHING, AND THE PRODUCT</small> (literally: <small>THE CHILD</small>) <small>OF MY THRESHING FLOOR</small> (<i>goren</i>). It also says (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS THE LORD'S SANCTUARY</small>, [<small>THE BEGINNING OF HIS HARVEST</small>]. The child of his house is Moses, as stated (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT MOSES</small>; [<small>HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE</small>]. The Holy One said to him: The nations are comparable to thorns, as stated (in Is. 33:12): <small>AND THE PEOPLES SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN &lt;THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE&gt;</small>. Therefore, you shall not be meticulous about numbering them, but Israel is righteous, as stated (in Is. 60:21): <small>AND ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE RIGHTEOUS</small>. It also says (in Cant. 4:7): <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED</small>, [<small>AND THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>]. Therefore, be meticulous in counting Israel. Moses did so. He numbered them &lt;to determine&gt; how many kors there were, as stated (in Numb. 1:2): <small>TAKE A CENSUS…</small>.; how many sacks there were, as stated (in Numb. 2:4): <small>HIS HOST AND THOSE OF THEM ENROLLED</small>; and how many measures there were, as stated (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.

Siman 23

Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 6:8-9): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS, EIGHTY CONCUBINES, AND MAIDENS WITHOUT NUMBER; &lt;BUT ONLY&gt; ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE…</small>. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a certain merchant,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateutes</i> (“business representative”).</i> who had glass beads,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 1:20; Numb. R. 4:2.</i> which he would bring to market; but he paid no attention to their number (<i>minyan</i>), because he had brought them out without counting (<i>minyan</i>) &lt;them&gt;. So when he came in to put them away, he put them away without counting. Because they were &lt;made&gt; of glass, he did not pay attention to them. However, he had a certain string<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>linea.</i></i> of fine pearls;<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. <i>margelis.</i></i> and this he would take and bring out with a count, then put away with a count. Similarly, as it were, the Holy One said &lt;in regard&gt; to the nations of the world: I have not given them a count, because none of them is important to me, as stated (in Is. 40:17): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM; THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY HIM AS LESS THAN NOTHING AND VOID</small>. But as for you, you are my children, as stated (in Is. 46:3): <small>THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN BORNE BY ME FROM BIRTH, CARRIED FROM THE WOMB</small>. I therefore count you on every occasion. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 6:8-9): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS</small> […, <small>AND MAIDENS WITHOUT NUMBER</small>]; <small>&lt;BUT ONLY&gt; ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE…</small>. This is Israel.

Siman 24

Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. The Holy One said: Because of the love for Israel I have altered the &lt;natural&gt; order of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:20, cont.: Numb. R. 4:5.</i> How? I had written in my Torah that an ass should be redeemed with a lamb, as stated (in Exod. 34:20): <small>BUT THE FIRSTLING OF AN ASS YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB</small> (<i>seh</i>). But I did not do so. Instead I redeemed a lamb (<i>seh</i>) with an ass. The Egyptians are likened to an ass, where it is stated (in Ezek. 23:20): <small>WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>; and Israel is called a lamb (<i>seh</i>), where it is stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED FLOCK</small> (<i>seh</i>). Then I slew the first-born of the Egyptians and sanctified the first-of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 8:17): <small>FOR EVERY FIRST-BORN AMONG</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>] <small>BELONGS TO ME</small>, [<small>HUMAN AND BEAST; ON THE DAY THAT I SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT I SANCTIFIED THEM FOR MYSELF</small>. He therefore said to him (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.]

[(Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.] But look, I brought out two hundred and seventy-three first-born, who were found to be in excess of the &lt;number of&gt; the Levites at the time that Moses numbered them.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:21; Numb. R. 4:7. According to Numb. 3:43, there were 22,273 first-born, while Numb. 3:39 put the number of Levites at 22,000. The problem for Moses was that he had been commanded (in Numb. 3:44-45) to replace all the first-born with Levites.</i> R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 4:10; <i>ySanh.</i> 1:4 (19c).</i> R. Judah says: This is what Moses did: He took {two hundred and seventy-three} [twenty-two thousand] lots<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pittakia</i> (“tickets”); Lat.: <i>pittacia</i> (“ticket”).</i> and wrote "Levi," on each of them. Then he took two hundred and seventy-three more lots and wrote "five <i>sela'im</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>sela</i>‘ equals one sacred or two common shekels. Thus five <i>sela‘im</i> matches the payment of five shekels required in Numb. 3:46-47.</i> &lt;on each of them&gt;. He mixed them up and put them in an urn.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalpe.</i> For more details about such an urn, see <i>Yoma</i> 39a.</i> Then the father of a first-born would put his hand into the urn. If there came up in his hand a lot on which was written "Levite," he was redeemed (by a Levite) and exempted from the five <i>sela'im</i>; but if there came up in his hand a lot on which was written "five <i>sela'im</i>," he handed over five <i>sela'im.</i> These are the words of R. Judah. R. Nehemiah says: There is still a difference of opinion on the matter, because one could say to him: There is no lot here on which "Levite" is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 17a.</i> That is the reason it did not come up in my hand. Instead this is what Moses did: He took lots according to the number of all the first-born, and wrote "Levite" on them. Then again he took other chits according to their number and wrote "five <i>sela'im</i> on them. He mixed them up and put them in an urn. Then the father of a first-born would reach into the urn. If a lot with "Levite" came up in his hand, he knew that a Levite had redeemed him, and had exempted him from the five <i>sela'im;</i> but if a lot with "five <i>sela'im</i>" came up in his hand, [he handed over five <i>sela'im</i>]. Then the officer said to him: Was there not another lot there on which "Levite" was written? So you are not worthy of being redeemed by a Levite.

Siman 27

(Numb. 4:17-48:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &lt;FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said:<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:22.</i> R. Levi said: <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. This refers to the lupine<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>thermos</i> (“hot”).</i> which arrives with the dessert. One should not say: There are nuts and dates before me. I will say &lt;the blessing&gt; over them and leave the lupine alone. The Holy One said (ibid.): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. R. Hezekiah and R. Jeremiah bar Abba said in the name of R. Johanan: It is with reference to everyone who does not say something in the name of the one who said it that the text says (ibid.): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avot</i> 6:3.</i> So when a person hears something, it is necessary to cite it in the name of the one who &lt;originally&gt; said it, even though &lt;doing so takes up&gt; more than a third of a law (<i>halakhah</i>). Thus our masters have taught (in <i>Pe'ah</i> 2:6): R. <small>NAHUM THE SCRIBE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Livlar.</i> Cf. Lat.: <i>libellaris</i> (“documentary”); <i>libellarius</i> (“relating to a written rental contract”); <i>librarius</i> (“scribe,” “copyist”).</i> <small>SAID: I HAVE RECEIVED FROM R. MAY'ASHA, WHO RECEIVED</small> [<small>FROM ABBA, WHO RECEIVED FROM THE PAIRS</small> (<i>zugot</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zuga</i> (“yokes”); cf. Lat.: <i>juga.</i></i> <small>WHO RECEIVED</small>] <small>FROM THE ELDERS, A LAW</small> (<i>halakhah</i>) <small>OF MOSES FROM SINAI</small>. So it is with reference to whoever does not say something in the name of the one who said it that the text (of Prov. 22:22) says: <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED</small>. But everyone who does say something in the name of the one who said it brings redemption into the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meg</i>. 15a.</i> From whom have you learned it? From Esther. When she heard of the matter from Mordecai, she said to Ahasuerus according to what is stated (in Esth. 2:22): <small>AND ESTHER SPOKE TO THE KING IN THE NAME OF MORDECAI</small>. For that reason she was worthy of having Israel be redeemed at her hands. Ergo: If you hear something, cite it in the name of the one who said it.
Another interpretation (of Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED</small>. It speaks about the tribe of Levi, and it is calling the tribe of Levi poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. R. 5:2.</i> Were &lt;the Levites&gt; poor? R. Judah bar Simon and our masters differ. One of them says: Why were they called poor? Because they were poor from &lt;lack of&gt; inheritance, as stated (in Josh. 13:33): <small>BUT MOSES GAVE NO INHERITANCE TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. Therefore, do not rob them of the donations, which I have told you &lt;to give&gt;. But the other (i.e., our masters) said that they were poor in number. Why so? Because the ark was destroying them. Therefore the Holy One commanded Moses and said (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &lt;FROM THE LEVITES</small> &gt;.

Siman 28

[(Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>.] Let our master instruct us: In the case of one who commits a transgression punishable with excision according to the Torah, how do they receive pardon &lt;and&gt; become freed from their excision?<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:23; see Numb. R. 5:4.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in Mak. 3:15): <small>ALL WHO ARE LIABLE TO EXCISION, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SCOURGED, ARE EXEMPT FROM THEIR EXCISION, AS STATED</small> (in Deut. 25:2-3): <small>THEN THE JUDGE SHALL HAVE HIM LIE DOWN…. HE MAY GIVE HIM FORTY LASHES BUT NO MORE…; THEN YOUR BROTHER WOULD BE DEGRADED. WHEN HE HAS BEEN SCOURGED, THEN HE IS &lt;AGAIN&gt; YOUR BROTHER</small>. And why forty lashes? It is simply that, because this <i>adam</i> was forty days in creation<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis believed that the fetus takes forty days to develop into a human shape. See <i>Nid.</i> 3:7; <i>Ber.</i> 60a; <i>Men</i>. 99b; also Philo, <i>Quaestiones,</i> Gen. 1:25.</i> and transgressed against the Torah, which was forty days in the giving, he will be given forty lashes and be exempt from his punishment (i.e., from excision). And so you find in the case of the first Adam. When he was commanded and told (in Gen. 2:17): <small>BUT FROM THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE</small> [<small>OF GOOD AND EVIL YOU SHALL NOT EAT</small> …], he incurred the sentence of death; and the world was scourged with forty punishments: ten for Adam, ten for Eve, ten for the serpent, ten for the land. Therefore, when a person commits one of the transgressions &lt;punishable by death&gt;, he is scourged with forty lashes. And so you find with each and every thing that the Holy One commanded Moses, &lt; there were&gt; warnings and punishments. It is written concerning the Sabbath (Exod. 20:8): <small>REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY</small>, as a warning; and as a punishment (there is Exod. 31:14): <small>WHOEVER PROFANES IT SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. They came to the desert and (according to Numb. 15:32) found one gathering &lt;wood on the Sabbath&gt;, but Moses did not know by what death he should be killed. However, {(according to Lev. 24:12) <small>THEY LEFT HIM IN CUSTODY &lt;WHILE WAITING&gt; FOR A CLARIFICATION TO THEM FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LORD</small>.} [(according to Numb. 15:34) <small>AND THEY LEFT HIM IN CUSTODY &lt;BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO HIM.&gt;</small>] The Holy One said (in vs. 35): <small>THE PERSON SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH; &lt;ALL THE CONGREGATION&gt; SHALL STONE HIM WITH STONES &lt;OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP&gt;</small>. Immediately Moses rose in prayer and said: Sovereign of the World, if someone from Israel should so sin, should he &lt;really&gt; be stoned? Behold, &lt;Israel&gt; would be destroyed. Make &lt;another&gt; arrangement for them. He said to him: Let them be scourged with forty lashes, and they will be exempt from excision. Similarly when the children of Aaron died, the tribe of Kohath saw them. They began yelling at Moses, saying: Are we to die like that? The Holy One said to Moses: Just as I have made an &lt;alternate&gt; arrangement for Aaron, as stated (in 16:3): <small>&lt;ONLY&gt; IN THIS WAY SHALL AARON COME &lt;INTO THE SANCTUARY&gt;: …;</small> so also for the Kohathite families I am making a similar arrangement, lest they die when they come unto the Holy of Holies. (Numb. 4:19): <small>DO THIS FOR THEM</small> (i.e., for the Kohathites) <small>THAT THEY MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE….</small> Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &lt;FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>.

[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &lt;FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>. The Holy One foresaw that Korah was going to arise and be opposed to the priesthood.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. R. 5:5.</i> The Holy One said: We will not destroy the Levites because of Korah. (Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &lt;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 48:9): <small>FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME I WILL DELAY MY ANGER, AND FOR MY PRAISE I WILL HOLD BACK FOR YOU SO AS NOT TO CUT YOU OFF</small>. To what is the matter comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 5:6.</i> To a king who had a son that was associated with bandits;<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> and when they were captured, his son was captured with them. The king said: What shall I do? Shall I execute the robbers? Possibly my son is with them. Instead, for the sake of my son, I will free them for now. Similarly, the Levites carried the Tabernacle. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:9): [<small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>KOHATH HE GAVE NO &lt;WAGONS&gt;</small>, [<small>BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THE SHOULDER</small>], When the Holy One saw that Korah and his assembly were going to be opposed to Moses and Aaron, the Holy One said: What shall I do with these? To kill them is not possible. Why? Because the Holy One had taken half of his name and bestowed it upon them, the <i><small>YH</small></i> (of <i><small>YHWH</small></i>) in <small>THE KOHATHITE</small> (<i><small>HQHTY</small></i> in Numb. 4:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>. See how well the text has said (in <small>II</small> Kings 14:27): <small>AND THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One does not wish that anyone from Israel would die.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:25; Numb.

Now if in the case of a foreigner I have promised not to reject him, how much the more so with my &lt;own&gt; children. Ergo (in I Kings 14:27): <small>THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL</small>. And so &lt;it was with&gt; the Gibeonites, who were not true proselytes but were forced proselytes<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gerim gerurim</i>, literally: “dragged-in proselytes.” See <i>AZ</i> 3b.</i> [in that they were proselytized] out of fear. &lt;Still&gt; I accepted them.

Now surely if I did not reject the Gibeonites who came to be with you, shall I reject my own children? Ergo (in <small>II</small> Kings 14:27): <small>AND THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF ISRAEL FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>]. And how much the more so in the case of the Levites, who minister before me? Ergo (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &lt;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>.

Siman 32

(Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>. This text is related (to Nahum 1:7): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER</small> [<small>IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE</small>]. The nature of the Holy One is unlike the nature of flesh and blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:26; Numb. R. 5:3.</i> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, when a province rebels against him, he acts against it with an indiscriminate punishment<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>androlempsia</i> or <i>androlepsia</i> (“seizure of foreigners” in reprisal for murder committed abroad).</i> and kills the good along with the bad without considering: This one has sinned, and this one has not sinned. Instead he kills the whole of it (i.e., the province). Now the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when a generation provokes him, he saves the righteous and destroys the wicked. The generation of Enosh sinned. He destroyed them but rescued Enoch, as stated (in Gen. 5:24): <small>AND ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. Why? (Nahum 1:7:) <small>&lt;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&gt; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. The generation of the flood provoked him. So he destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT ALL EXISTENCE</small>; but he rescued Noah, as stated (in Gen. 6:8): <small>AND NOAH FOUND FAVOR &lt;IN THE EYES OF THE LORD&gt;</small>. And similarly with the Sodomites, he destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>; but he rescued Lot, as stated (in vs. 29): <small>AND SENT LOT AWAY</small>. He brought darkness upon the Egyptians, <small>BUT</small> (according to Exod. 10:23) <small>ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LIGHT IN THEIR DWELLINGS</small>. Why? (Nahum 1:7:) <small>&lt;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&gt; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. They went forth from Egypt and came to the desert. &lt;There&gt; they committed that deed (i.e., the incident of the golden calf), &lt;all&gt; except for the tribe of Levi. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>&lt;SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP&gt; AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, COME TO ME</small> &lt;….&gt; What is the meaning of <small>WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD</small>? R. Simeon ben Johay says: Whoever (in Exod. 32:3) has not given a ring for idolatry, let him come unto me. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM</small>. The Holy One said (in Nahum 1:7): <small>&lt;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&gt; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. &lt;Moses was asking:&gt; Who took part in the deed of the calf, and who did not take part? What did &lt;the Holy One&gt; do? He killed the sinners, as stated (in Exod. 32:35): <small>THEN THE LORD SMOTE THE PEOPLE…</small>. With reference to the tribe of Levi, however, which gave their lives for the Name of the Holy One, he said to Moses and Aaron (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF…</small>.

Siman 33

[Another interpretation (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>.] And so he says in another place (i.e., in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. But he has also said (in Numb. 1:49): <small>HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. But he only spoke to him &lt;with reference to numbering them in&gt; the midst of the children of Israel and did not tell him to exempt them from the decree &lt;itself&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 26, cont.; Numb. R. 1:12; 3:7.</i> The Holy One &lt;did so&gt; because he foresaw that Israel was going to provoke him and said to them (in Numb. 14:29): <small>IN THIS DESERT SHALL YOUR CARCASSES DROP</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said: The children of Levi shall not be &lt;part of&gt; this decree, as stated (in Numb. 1:49, cont.): <small>NOR SHALL YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF THEM AS PART OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Why? Because they are mine (according to Numb. 3:12): <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE</small>. Thus when anyone offers (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>) a little of himself, they advance (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>) him a lot. Now they had offered (rt.: <i><small>QRB</small></i>) themselves, when Moses said (in Exod. 32:26): <small>WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, &lt;COME TO ME&gt;</small>. And not only that, <small>BUT</small> (according to Numb. 1:50) <small>YOU SHALL ENROLL THE LEVITES TO BE OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small>. Thus when someone is tested in &lt;one&gt; area and found trustworthy, the Holy One trusts him forever; for so you find in the case of Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 1:12.</i> When he was tested with Amalek, he prevailed against him according to the law and according to the commandment. It is so stated (in Exod. 17:13): <small>AND JOSHUA DEFEATED &lt;AMALEK AND HIS PEOPLE&gt;….</small> The Holy One said to him: From your tribe (Ephraim) I am raising up one to exact punishment from Amalek, as stated (in Jud. 5:14): <small>OUT OF EPHRAIM CAME THOSE WHOSE ROOT IS IN AMALEK…</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>OUT OF</small> (<i><small>MNY</small></i>) <small>EPHRAIM</small>?] He appointed (<i><small>MNH</small></i>) Ephraim in his heart<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:26, which reads, “Ephraim alone….”</i> to destroy the seed of Amalek. The Holy One said to him (ibid., cont.): [<small>AFTER YOU</small>,] <small>BENJAMIN WITH YOUR PEOPLES</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; leave him for Saul ben Kish, the Benjamite; he will serve him.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:26, which reads, “He will uproot him.”</i>
Another interpretation (of Jud. 5:14): <small>OUT OF EPHRAIM</small>. Saul was tested and found untrustworthy in his commission. Rather (according to I Sam. 15:9): <small>BUT SAUL AND THE PEOPLE SPARED AGAG</small>. He put him back after him (i.e., behind Ephraim, the tribe of Joshua and Samuel) and the kingdom was taken from him, as stated (in Jud. 5:14): <small>AFTER YOU</small> (i.e., Ephraim), <small>BENJAMIN WITH YOUR PEOPLES</small>. And I have also tested this tribe (of Levi), and they have been found to be preserving my honor; for they have given their life for the sanctification of my name (in Exod. 32:27-28): <small>LET EACH ONE PUT HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH &lt;….&gt; SO THE CHILDREN OF LEVI ACTED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES</small>, and they did not show mercy to them. Therefore, Moses blesses them and says to them (in Deut. 33:9): <small>WHO SAYS OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER: I DO NOT CONSIDER THEM</small> [….] And I am also advancing him and making him my imperial agent.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>frumentarius</i> (“grain dealer”).</i> And I am entrusting him with my house and my sanctity, as stated (in Numb. 1:50): <small>BUT YOU SHALL ENROLL THE LEVITES &lt;TO BE OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY&gt;….</small> And what was it that I told you (in vs. 49)? <small>HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. &lt;This prohibition&gt; was to exempt them from the decree which I was going to pronounce over Israel. It is simply that I am allotting them great honor. When you number them, &lt;number them&gt; by themselves through the divine utterance (in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. Now if I have honored the Levites, who bear the Tabernacle, how much the more so in the case of the children of Kohath, who bear the ark, [as stated (in Numb. 3:31): <small>AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDED THE ARK, THE TABLE, THE LAMPSTAND, THE ALTARS, AND THE SACRED UTENSILS…</small>.] He therefore said to them (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &lt;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&gt;</small>. The Holy One said: [If] because [the children of Kohath] have feared me, I have allotted glory to them [and to their children]; then [I will honor] whoever stands in awe of me and not cut off his name from the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

From the Jonadab ben Rechab, as stated (in Jer. 35:19): <small>SOMEONE BELONGING TO JONADAB BEN RECHAB SHALL NOT BE CUT OFF &lt;FROM STANDING BEFORE ME FOREVER&gt;</small>. And if in the case of those who are proselytes, because they have done my will, I have done likewise for them (i.e., what they want); in the case of Israel, when they are doing my will, how much the more shall they neither be cut off nor have their name be erased from before me? Rather, they shall live and abide forever and ever and ever, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.

        <br>(Exod. 20:2 = Deut. 5:7:) <small>&lt;YOU&gt; SHALL HAVE NO &lt;OTHER GODS&gt;</small>, since it is written of him (in Exod. 20:5 = Deut. 5:9): <small>FOR</small> [<small>I</small>] <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD</small>. Also it is stated two times concerning the adulteress (in Numb. 5:14): <small>IF THE SPIRIT OF JEALOUSY CAME OVER HIM, AND HE IS JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE</small>. But why two times? Because it (i.e., the meal offering of the next verse)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So Rashi on Numb. 5:15.</i> excites jealousy for the Holy One and for her husband, as stated (in Numb. 5:15): <small>FOR IT IS A MEAL OFFERING OF JEALOUSY</small>. Thus it is a case of two jealousies.
        <br>(Exod. 20:7 = Deut. 5:11:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD &lt;IN VAIN&gt;</small>. &lt;One breaks this commandment&gt; because he commits adultery and swears in vain that he has not done so.
        <br>(On this commandment, see the end of the paragraph.)
        <br>(Exod. 20:12 = Deut. 5:16:) <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER</small>. When one commits adultery with the adulteress, she becomes pregnant from him. Then she says to her husband: I am pregnant from you. When the fetus is grown, it honors her husband, &lt;since it&gt; thinks that he is its father. Moreover, &lt;the grown child&gt; passes through the market and scorns the adulterer, since he thinks that he is not his father.
        <br>(Exod. 20:13 = Deut. 5:17:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT MURDER</small>. The adulterer goes in on condition that, if he is caught, he will kill or be killed.
        <br>(Exod. 20:13, cont. = Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small>. Obviously &lt;this commandment is broken&gt;, because he is committing adultery.
        <br>(Exod. 20:13, cont. = Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>. &lt;This commandment is broken&gt; because he is stealing his neighbor's spring (i.e., his wife's womb), and so it says (in Prov. 9:17): <small>STOLEN WATERS ARE SWEET…</small>.
        <br>(Exod. 20:13, cont. // Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT BEAR &lt;FALSE WITNESS&gt; AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>. &lt;The commandment is broken&gt; in that &lt;the adulteress&gt; bears false witness [to her husband] and says: I am pregnant from you.
        <br>(Exod. 20:14; cf. Deut. 5:18:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'</small>s <small>HOUSE, AND YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'</small>s <small>WIFE</small>. &lt;The commandment is broken&gt; because whoever covets his friend's wife and commits adultery with her, covets everything that belongs to his friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. R. 23:12; Matthew 5:28.</i> How? When he continues committing adultery with her and she bears &lt;a child&gt; from him, her husband thinks that it came from himself. When he comes to depart from the world, he thinks that this son is his and writes him a will<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>diatheke.</i></i> of all his assets. So he bequeaths to him whatever he has without knowing that he is not his son. It turns out that the adulterer covets whatever belongs to his friend.
    
They said to R. Hanina: Here we have told you nine &lt;commandments&gt;. In regard to&gt; (Exod. 20:8; cf. Deut. 5:12:) [<small>REMEMBER</small>] <small>THE SABBATH</small> [<small>DAY</small>]. How does he transgress against it? He said to them: I will tell you: Sometimes when a priest has a priestly wife, and a &lt;lay&gt; Israelite adulterer has sexual intercourse with her, so that she bears &lt;a child&gt; from him, they consider him (i.e., the child) to be the son of a priest. Then when the baby goes on to minister in the Temple, arrange wood, and sacrifice on the Sabbath, he is found to be profaning the Sabbath. Hence there are ten commandments which the adulteress breaks with the adulterer. Solomon also has said concerning her (in Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND</small> [<small>THE WOMAN</small>] <small>MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>, [<small>&lt;THE WOMAN&gt; WHO HAS SNARES AND NETS &lt;IN HER HEART&gt;</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>SNARES</small> (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>WD</small></i>)? She lies in wait (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>WD</small></i>) in this world and for the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The inference is from the fact that <small>SNARES</small> is plural and implies a minimum of two.</i> <small>AND NETS</small>?

The woman, however, catches &lt;her prey&gt; in the sea and on the dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. R. 7:26:3.</i>
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND &lt;THE WOMAN&gt; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. If a person is worthy, (according to Prov. 18:22) <small>THE ONE WHO HAS FOUND A WIFE HAS FOUND HAPPINESS</small>; but if not, (Eccl. 7:26:) <small>AND I FIND &lt;THE WOMAN&gt; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>.

When she is good, (Prov. 31:10:) <small>WHAT A FIND IS A GALLANT WIFE</small> (from '<i><small>S</small>h<small>H</small></i>)! When she is bad, (Eccl. 7:26:) <small>AND I FIND &lt;THE WOMAN&gt; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. (Eccl. 7:26, cont.:) <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. This refers to Joseph. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers ot Zimri (of Numb. 25:6–15). Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): [<small>ONE WHO IS GOOD</small>.] This refers to Boaz, when he says to Ruth (in Ruth 3:13): <small>SPEND THE NIGHT</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers to Samson. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. This refers to Palti (of I Sam. 25:44).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">On Palti, see Lev. R. 23:10; but cf. <i>Sanh.</i> 19b, which regards Palti’s marriage to Michal as unlawful.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers to Absalom.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. &lt;These words refer to&gt; whoever sees an adulterous woman and flees from her. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. &lt;These words refer to&gt; whoever is captivated by her. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 5:12): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND &lt;THE WOMAN &gt; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. Not to be loud, arrogant of gait, or bawdy in laughter: This is the way of the daughters of Israel. But if &lt;a woman&gt; was bawdy in the presence of one of them, one would warn her on the evidence of two [witnesses and say to her]: Why should you be laughing with so and so? Why should you be speaking with him? If she has &lt;merely&gt; spoken &lt;with him&gt; up to now, she is allowed into her house and may eat the <i>Terumah.</i> [&lt;If&gt; she has entered with him in secret and lingered to be defiled, she is forbidden her house and eating the <i>Terumah</i>.]

(Numb. 5:15:) <small>THEN HE SHALL BRING THE OFFERING FOR HER, ONE-TENTH AN EPHAH OF BARLEY MEAL</small>. Why does she bring barley meal?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:3; <i>Sot</i>. 2:1; cf. <i>Sifre</i>, to Numb. 5:15 (8).</i> Because she behaved in the manner of a beast with him, she therefore brings the food of a beast as her offering. [(Ibid. cont.:) <small>HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT</small>.: Why does he not pour oil upon it?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

Therefore (in Numb. 5:15): <small>HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT</small>. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOR SHALL HE PUT FRANKINCENSE UPON IT</small>.] Why does he not put frankincense upon it? Because the frankincense is a remembrance of the matriarchs, [as stated] (in Cant. 4:6): <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE</small>, while this woman has withdrawn from their ways. She would therefore be a reminder of iniquity and not a reminder of merit.

Because they are her witnesses. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 30:19): <small>I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY</small>.
Another interpretation: Why is she tested with water [and with dust]? Because a person who {knows} [sows] some seeds in the dust does not know what they are, until the water comes down upon them and makes known whether they belong to the owner of the field, or &lt;whether they are&gt; what others have sown.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 5:12): <small>IF</small> [<small>ANY</small>]<small>ONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. This text is related (to Job 24:15): <small>ALSO THE EYE OF AN ADULTERER WATCHES FOR TWILIGHT, SAYING: NO EYE SHALL SEE ME</small>. And so the adulterer says: No human being knows about me; but the Holy One has his eyes ranging over all the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:4, cont.; Numb. R. 9:1.</i> So it says (in Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small>? Such is the way of those who commit transgression. They wait for a time of darkness, so that no one will see them. It is therefore stated (in Job 24:15): <small>THE EYE OF THE ADULTERER WATCHES FOR TWILIGHT</small>. So also thieves watch for an hour of darkness, as stated (in vs. 16): <small>HE BREAKS INTO HOUSES IN THE DARK</small>. And so it says (in Is. 29:15): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO DELVE DEEPLY TO HIDE A PLAN FROM THE LORD, FOR THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>. [<small>SO THEY SAY: WHO SEES US? AND WHO KNOWS ABOUT US?</small>] The thief and the adulterer are obdurate, because they dismiss the Divine Presence. The Holy One fills, as it were, the realms above and the realms below, as stated (in Jer. 23:24): <small>DO I NOT FILL HEAVEN AND EARTH, SAYS THE LORD</small>? Also in regard to the place where adulterer comes to commit adultery, is not the Holy One there in his glory? It is so stated (in Is. 6:3): <small>THE WHOLE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS GLORY</small>. Now the adulterer says to the Holy One: Remove yourself, and give way to me for a while. The matter is exceedingly difficult, as it were. Since he is full of mercy, slow to anger, he gives way to him; <small>FOR</small> (according to Job 11:11) <small>HE KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE WORTHLESS</small>; [<small>SO WHEN HE SEES INIQUITY, DOES HE NOT DISCERN IT</small>?] It also says (in Job 24:15, cont.): <small>HE</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This rendering fits the context of what follows in the midrash.

He puts the face of &lt;the&gt; adulterer on that fetus.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Lev.

Ergo: <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>, so that the people may know &lt;about him&gt; and say: Surely this one's face resembles the face of &lt;the&gt; adulterer; for &lt;the Holy One&gt; has formed formed the image of the fetus in the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (ibid.): <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>. It is therefore called whoredom (<i>zimmah</i>); for when they both deny and say: We do not know what you are saying, the people say: If so, what is this (<i>zeh mah</i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “This is what?” The Hebrew uses the unusual word order to make the parallel with “whoredom” (<i>zimmah</i>).</i> R. Isaac said: The power of the adulterer is strong, because it weakens the power of the Divine Presence. How? When the fetus is conceived from the husband, the Holy One forms its image in forty days, for thus have our masters taught: In forty days the image of the fetus is recognizable. After forty days, when the adulterer comes into her, the Holy One stands dumfounded and says: After whom shall I form &lt;the fetus&gt;? The image (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></i>) of the husband or the image [of the adulterer]? (According to Deut. 32:18): <small>YOU</small>, as it were, <small>WERE UNMINDFUL OF</small> (<i><small>TS</small>h<small>Y</small></i>) <small>THE ROCK</small> (<i><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></i>) <small>THAT BORE YOU</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the adulterer forgot that the Holy One would expose him.</i> The <i>yod</i> (= <i><small>Y</small></i>) is tiny (the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet). &lt;Thus, you&gt; weaken (<i><small>TS</small>h</i>, without the <i>yod</i>) the hands (<i>yad</i> in the dual) of the Creator (<i>tsayyar</i>). R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To an sculptor (<i>tsayyar</i>, rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>YR</small></i>), who was fashioning (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>YR</small></i>) an image<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eikonion.</i></i> of a king. When he came to finish the face,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>prosopon.</i></i> they said to him: The king is dead, and another king has arisen.

Shall I fashion &lt;them&gt; in the form of the former king or in the form of the second king? He began to be bewildered. Now similarly, when the husband performs his marital duty with his wife, the Holy One forms the fetus in the likeness of its father. &lt;Then&gt; in turn the adulterer comes into her. Ergo, the colors are mingled. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 4:2): <small>SWEARING, LYING, MURDERING, STEALING, COMMITTING ADULTERY BREAK OUT; BLOODSHED FOLLOWS BLOODSHED</small>. What does the Holy One do? He returns, as it were, and changes the face into the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (in Job 24:15) <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>.

Our masters have said: When a woman is alone with her husband and he is having sexual intercourse with her, if she sets her eyes on another at the time of &lt;their&gt; sexual intercourse, no adultery for her is greater than this.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:7, cont.; Numb. R. 9:34; cf. Matthew 5:28.</i> Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 16:32): <small>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN</small> [<small>RECEIVES STRANGERS</small>] <small>INSTEAD OF HER HUSBAND</small> (literally: <small>UNDER HER HUSBAND</small>). Is there a woman who commits adultery &lt;while&gt; under her husband?<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. 5:19.</i> It is simply that this is &lt;the kind of woman&gt; who encounters a certain man and sets her eyes on him. Then she has sexual intercourse with her husband while her heart is on him. The king of the Arabs asked R. Aqiva: I am black and my wife is black, but she has borne me a white son. Shall I kill her because she has played the harlot while under me? He said to him: Do you have images within your house? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Are your household images white or black? He said to him: White. He said to him: When you were busy with her, she set her eyes on the images and bore &lt;a child&gt; like them. Now if you are surprised over this matter, learn from the Jacob's flock. They were conceived from the sticks, as stated (in Gen. 30:39): <small>SINCE THE FLOCK CONCEIVED BY THE STICKS, &lt;THE FLOCK BORE STREAKED, SPECKLED, AND SPOTTED YOUNG&gt;</small>. Then the king of the Arabs thanked R. Aqiva. Thus, when any woman is alone with her husband in holiness, in the end he produces righteous children from her. Thus we find it so in the case of Hannah. When she was alone with her husband in holiness, the Holy One did not deprive her of her reward. Rather he gave her a righteous son like Moses, as stated (in Jer. 15:1): <small>EVEN IF MOSES AND SAMUEL STOOD BEFORE ME</small>. It also says (in Ps. 99:6): <small>MOSES AND AARON WERE AMONG HIS PRIESTS, AND SAMUEL WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALL UPON HIS NAME</small>. So also did Hannah say (in I Sam. 1:27): <small>FOR THIS CHILD DID I PRAY, AND THE LORD HAS GRANTED ME MY PETITION</small>. Why? Because he was sown in holiness. The Holy One said: In this world I abhor all those peoples, because they are from unclean seed; but I have chosen you, because you are from true seed, as stated (in Jer. 2:21): <small>AND I PLANTED YOU AS A CHOICE VINE, ALL OF IT FROM TRUE SEED</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 7:6): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU</small>. And also in the age to come I am choosing only you, because you are a holy seed, as stated (in Is. 65:23): <small>THEY SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, NOR BEAR CHILDREN IN TERROR&gt;</small>, [<small>BECAUSE THEY ARE A SEED BLESSED OF THE LORD</small>,] <small>&lt;AND THEIR OFFSPRING ALONG WITH THEM&gt;</small>.

Let our master instruct us: In the case of priest with a blemish, it is right for him to raise his hands (in the priestly blessing)?<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 2:8.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Meg</i>. 4:7): <small>A PRIEST WHOSE HANDS ARE BLEMISHED MAY NOT RAISE HIS HANDS</small>, but Rabbi taught: A priest whose has any blemishes at all may not raise his hands.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR PEOPLE TO BE LOOKING AT HIM</small>. R.

(Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>. The Holy One said: From the beginning I have blessed my people; from now on the blessings are transmitted to you. You were to bless my children; therefore the Holy One told Moses to caution Aaron and his children to bless Israel. {Thus it is stated} [From where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter] (in Numb. 6:23): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON AND UNTO HIS CHILDREN, SAYING</small>:] <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.

[(Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.] This text is related (to Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, FROM THE HEAVENS, AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE</small>. And in the same vein David says (in II Sam. 7:29): <small>SO NOW MAY YOU BE PLEASED TO BLESS YOUR SERVANT'S HOUSE, THAT IT ABIDE BEFORE YOU FOREVER…. AND MAY YOUR SERVANT</small>'s <small>HOUSE BE BLESSED FOR EVER WITH YOUR BLESSING</small>{<small>S</small>}. The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, you tell your priests to bless us.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:8, cont.; Numb. R. 11:2.</i> We only need you to bless us. (Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, FROM THE HEAVENS, &lt;AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to them: Although I have told the priests to bless you, I am standing along with them and blessing you. For that reason the priests spread their hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sot.</i> 7:6 for details about how the priests were to hold their hands.</i> &lt;They do so&gt; to say: The Holy One is standing behind us. So also it says (with reference to the Holy One in Cant. 2:9) <small>THERE HE STANDS BEHIND OUR WALL, GAZING THROUGH THE WINDOWS, PEERING THROUGH THE LATTICE</small>, &lt;i.e.&gt; <small>GAZING THROUGH THE WINDOWS</small>, from between the fingers of the priests; <small>PEERING THROUGH THE LATTICE</small>, when they extend their hands. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 3:7): <small>THERE IS HIS BED, THE ONE BELONGING TO SOLOMON</small> (rt.: <i><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></i>), <small>WITH SIXTY WARRIORS AROUND IT</small>. What reason did &lt;the author of Canticles, i.e.,&gt; Solomon (rt.: <i><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></i>), have to be concerned with a with a bed?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:9; Cant. R. 3:7:2, 4.</i> When it said: <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>, it is simply that &lt;the verse&gt; was only concerned with the king to whom peace (rt.: <i><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></i>) belonged. (Ibid.:) <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>. This is the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 11:3.</i> But why was the Temple compared to a bed? It is simply that just as a bed is only for being fruitful and multiplying, so it was with the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying, as stated (in I Kings 8:8 = II Chron. 5:9): <small>THE POLES GREW SO LONG</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This literal interpretation of the Hebrew text was seen to imply that the poles miraculously lengthened while within the Temple. See <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 7:11.</i> It also says (in II Chron. 3:6): <small>THE GOLD WAS GOLD FROM PARVAIM</small> (as if from <i><small>PRH</small></i>), which produced fruit (rt.: <i><small>PRH</small></i>). And so it says (in I Kings 7:2): <small>AND HE BUILT THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON</small>. Why was it compared to a forest? Just as a forest is fruitful and multiplies, so it is in the case of the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying. It is therefore stated (in Cant. 3:7): <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WITH SIXTY WARRIORS</small>. These are the sixty letters that are in the priestly blessing (in Numb. 6:24–26). (Cant. 3:8:) <small>ALL OF THEM EQUIPPED WITH A SWORD</small>, because in each and every &lt;verse of the priestly blessing&gt; the name of the Holy One is mentioned: <small>THE LORD</small><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows the common practice of substituting <small>THE LORD</small> for the Divine Name.</i> <small>BLESS YOU &lt;…&gt;; THE LORD MAKE &lt;HIS FACE&gt; SHINE&lt; … &gt;; THE LORD LIFT UP HIS &lt;FACE … &gt;</small>. (Cant. 3:8, cont.:) <small>EACH WITH HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH</small>. What is the reason for the thigh to be mentioned here? simply that, even if one sees in his dream a sword being drawn, placed over his neck, and &lt;then&gt; cutting off his thigh, he rises early in the morning and goes to the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">There may be an allusion here to circumcision.

On the symbolic use of the sword, cf. also Ephesians 6:17.</i> (Cant. 3:8, cont.:) <small>BECAUSE OF FEAR AT NIGHT</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; because of a fear which he saw in his dream at night. Then &lt;when&gt; he sees the priests raising their hands, the bad dream passes away from him. It is therefore stated: <small>BECAUSE OF FEAR AT NIGHT</small>. Therefore the holy one told moses to caution Aaron and his children to bless my children, as stated (in numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>].

[Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.] The Holy One said: In the past I needed to bless my creatures.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Gen. 3:5; <i>Tanh</i>., Gen. 3:4; Numb. 2:9, cont.; Numb.

I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. I blessed Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>. &lt;Then&gt; the Holy One said: From now on behold, the blessings are being delivered to you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING</small>. What did Abraham do? He begot two &lt;children&gt;, Ishmael and Isaac, but he did not bless them. A parable:<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 61:6.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pardes.</i> Cf. the Gk.: <i>paradeisos.</i></i> &lt;and&gt; gave it to a tenant. Now in the midst of that orchard was a one tree with an elixir of life and another tree with the elixir of death grafted upon it. The tenant said: If I water the tree with the elixir of life, the tree with the elixir of death will drink. The tenant said: I shall work and finish my time. Then whatever the king wants to do in his garden he may do.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 13:24–30.</i> The king is the Holy One, and the garden is the world. The Holy One delivered it to Abraham. He said to him (in Gen. 12:2): <small>AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING</small>. What did Abraham do? He had two children, one righteous and one wicked, Ishmael and Isaac. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will want me to bless him, and he is wicked. I am only flesh and blood. When I depart from the world, the Holy One will do his will. When Abraham did depart, the Holy One revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. Then Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 49:28): <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, TWELVE IN NUMBER, &lt;AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM WHEN HE BLESSED THEM … &gt;</small>. From now on, said the Holy One, behold, the blessings are being delivered to you; and the priests will bless my children.

Thus it is stated (in Numb. 28:3): <small>NOW YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM: THIS IS THE BURNT OFFERING WHICH YOU SHALL OFFER TO THE LORD: &lt;TWO YEARLING LAMBS WITHOUT BLEMISH… &gt;</small> And not both of them at once, but (according to vs. 4): <small>THE ONE LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER IN THE MORNING AND THE SECOND LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER AT TWILIGHT</small>.

It also says (in Jer. 23:24): <small>DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? SAYS THE LORD</small>.

Moreover, when they had made the Tabernacle, it was filled with his glory, as stated (in Exod. 40:35): <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING, &lt;BECAUSE … THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TABERNACLE&gt;</small>. The princes said: Now is the time for us to offer sacrifices with joy, because the Divine Presence is dwelling among us.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.

The Holy One does not deprive any creature of a reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:13; Numb.

Do you want to understand? Solomon built the Temple, as stated (in I Kings 6:14): <small>SO SOLOMON FINISHED BUILDING THE HOUSE</small>; but because David had devoted his life to the Temple which would be built, as stated (in Ps. 132:1–5: <small>LORD REMEMBER DAVID AND ALL HIS HARDSHIPS, HOW HE SWORE TO THE LORD, VOWED TO THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB: SURELY I WILL NOT COME INTO THE SHELTER OF MY HOUSE, NOR WILL I GO UP UPON THE BED THAT IS SPREAD FOR ME</small>, [… ] <small>UNTIL I FIND A PLACE FOR THE LORD</small>, the Holy One did not deprive him of his reward. Rather he had it written in his name, as stated (in Ps. 30:1 [introduction]): <small>A PSALM. A SONG OF THE DEDICATION OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>. [It does not say, "of Solomon," but, <small>OF DAVID</small>.] Solomon said it well (in Prov. 27:18): <small>THE ONE WHO TENDS A FIG TREE SHALL EAT ITS FRUIT</small>. So also you find in the case of the Tabernacle, when everyone devoted their lives &lt;to it&gt; and made the Tabernacle. All Israel volunteered. The women spun the goat's hair; and similarly (in Exod. 36:8): <small>THEN ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES &lt;AMONG THE WORKERS MADE THE TABERNACLE&gt;</small>. And likewise (according to Exod. 36:1): <small>THEN LET BEZALEL AND OHOLIAB &lt;AND ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES … &gt; DO &lt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED&gt;</small>. &lt; However, they only did so&gt; because Moses devoted his life to &lt;the Tabernacle&gt;, so that it would be made just as the Holy One has shown him on the Mountain, as stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> {<small>LIKE</small>} [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN…</small>. Thus Moses went and devoted his life, so that they would not go astray. It is therefore written (in Exod. 39:1, 5, 7, 21, 26, 29, 31, cf. 42): <small>AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES</small>. And so it says (in vs. 43): <small>WHEN MOSES SAW ALL THE WORK, &lt;AND BEHOLD, THEY HAD DONE IT&gt; …; THEN MOSES BLESSED THEM</small>. And with what blessing did he bless them? He said to them: May the Divine Presence dwell in the work of your hands. The Holy One said: Because Moses has devoted his life to the Tabernacle, I will only write about it in his name. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, although others had worked on the Tabernacle, it says only of Moses that he finished it.

Resh Laqish said: If the heretics (<i>minim</i>) should say to you that the Holy One does not enliven the dead, say to them: See here, Elijah (of Gilead) [bears witness] that he has enlivened the dead [through his hand].<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:28; cf.

Another interpretation (of Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>GILEAD IS MINE</small>. Suppose someone says to you: Why did Elijah build an altar up on Mount Carmel and sacrifice on it, when the Temple existed at that time? For Moses has said (in Lev. 17:3–4): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB &lt;OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP&gt; …, AND DOES NOT BRING IT UNTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small> [<small>TO OFFER A SACRIFICE TO THE LORD BEFORE THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD, BLOOD GUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED TO THAT PERSON</small> ….: Say to him: What Elijah did, he did for the name of the Holy One and by divine command.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yTa‘an.</i> 2:8 (65d); Lev.

R. Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: He treated it like a city condemned (for idolatry), and in the case of a city condemned (for idolatry) it is forbidden &lt;to derive&gt; benefit &lt;from it&gt;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 13:17 [16]): <small>AND YOU SHALL BURN WITH FIRE THE CITY</small> {<small>AND</small>} [<small>WITH</small>] <small>ALL ITS PLUNDER AS A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said. &lt;Joshua&gt; taught Israel what the Holy One said to Israel (in Numb. 15:20): [<small>YOU SHALL SET ASIDE</small>] <small>THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH</small> [<small>AS <i>A HALLAH</i> OFFERING</small>.] Joshua said: In as much as we conquered it first, we shall make it a <i>hallah</i> to the Holy One.

[(Numb. 7:48:) <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM</small>. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R.

[Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:48:) <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM, ELISHAMA BEN AMMIHUD</small>.] R. Meir and R.

(Numb. 8:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES SAYING: SPEAK UNTO AARON AND SAY UNTO HIM: WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. Let our master instruct us. Is it legal to light &lt;a Sabbath lamp&gt; with oil for burning<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. defiled oil from the <i>terumah</i> (the priestly tithe on produce). So <i>Shab.</i> 23b.</i> on a festival?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:1.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 2:2): <small>ONE MAY NOT LIGHT &lt;A SABBATH LAMP&gt;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shab.</i> 2:1 for the context.</i> <small>WITH OIL FOR BURNING ON A FESTIVAL</small>. [<small>R. ISHMAEL SAYS: ONE MAY NOT LIGHT &lt;IT&gt; WITH TAR</small>] <small>OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH. BUT THE SAGES PERMIT ALL KINDS OF OIL: SESAME OIL, NUT OIL, RADISH OIL</small>, [<small>FISH OIL</small>], <small>COLOCYNTH OIL, TAR, OR MINERAL OIL. R. TARFON SAYS: ONE MAY ONLY MAKE A LIGHT WITH OLIVE OIL ALONE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly <i><small>TS</small>hab.</i> 2:1-4; <i>Shab.</i> 26a.</i> R. Johanan ben Nuri rose to his feet and said: What will the people of Babylon do, who have nothing but sesame oil? What will the people of Media do, who have nothing but nut oil? [What will the people of Alexandria do, who have nothing but radish oil?] And what will the people of Cappadocia do, who have neither the one or the other but only mineral oil? R. Tarafon said to them: See we have found that the Holy One loves olive oil in a lamp more than all the other oils and more than all the gifts which are offered. You know that &lt;it is so&gt;: See, with reference to all the &lt;other&gt; gifts it is only said of them (as in Lev. 2:15): <small>AND YOU SHALL PUT OIL UPON IT</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 2:1, 6 where the same command is expressed with a different verb i.e. <small>POUR</small>.</i> but with reference to the lighting of the lamp, it is written (in Exod. 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF &lt;BEATEN&gt; OLIVES</small>. [Therefore R. Tarafon said: <small>ONE MAY ONLY MAKE A LIGHT WITH OLIVE OIL ALONE</small>.] We also find that in several places the Holy One warned about lighting the lamps <small>WITH CLEAR OIL OF &lt; BEATEN &gt; OLIVES</small> and so it says (in Exod. 27:20): <small>&lt;AND YOU SHALL COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt; TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF &lt;BEATEN&gt; OLIVES</small>. So also it says (in Lev. 24:2, 4): [<small>&lt;COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt; TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF &lt;BEATEN OLIVES….:</small>] <small>HE SHALL SET UP THE LAMPS UPON THE UNALLOYED LAMPSTAND</small>. And here also it warns about the lamps. Where? From what we have read about the matter (in Numb. 8:2): <small>&lt;SPEAK UNTO AARON AND SAY UNTO HIM:&gt; WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS….</small>

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): [<small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &lt;SERVANT'S&gt; RIGHTEOUSNESS TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH</small>. The Holy One, as it were, said to Moses: Say to Israel: It was not because I need your light that I am telling you to light a lamp.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Below Numb. 3:7; <i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:2; Numb. R. 15:2.</i> Rather &lt;I am doing so&gt; in order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment), and so it says (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &lt;SERVANT'S&gt; RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. It is written about him, as it were, (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>; and similarly it says (in Ps. 139:12): <small>EVEN DARKNESS IS NOT DARK TO YOU</small>; [<small>FOR NIGHT SHINES AS THE</small> {<small>LIGHT</small>} [<small>DAY</small>], <small>AND DARKNESS BECOMES LIKE THE LIGHT</small>]. &lt;Scripture says these things&gt; to inform you that I do not need you. You yourself know &lt;this truth&gt;. Come and see. When a person builds a house and makes windows within [his house], he wants the light to enter. &lt;So&gt; he makes windows narrow on the outside and broad on the inside. Why? So that the light will enter from the outside and shine on the inside. But when Solomon built the Temple, he did not make the windows like that.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See above Exod. 8:5; <i>PRK</i> 21:5; Lev. R. 31:7.</i> Rather they were narrow on the inside and broad on the outside so that the light would go out from the Temple and shine outside. It is so stated (in I Kings 6:4): <small>AND FOR THE HOUSE HE MADE WINDOWS BROAD AND NARROW</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: <small>CLEAR</small> and <small>CLOSED</small>. While the Hebrew is obscure the translation here follows the Targum in order to fit the midrashic context.</i> &lt;This text&gt; is to inform you that all light is his and that he has no need for some of your &lt;light&gt;. So why did I command you &lt;to set up the lamps&gt;? In order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment). It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beha‘aloteka et-hanerot.</i> These words can also mean: <small>IN ELEVATING YOU WITH THE LAMPS</small>.</i> Ergo (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &lt;SERVANT'S&gt; RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. And not only that, but if you are careful to light lamps for my sake, I will shine a great light for you in the world to come, as stated (in Is. 60:1, 3): <small>ARISE SHINE FOR YOUR LIGHT IS COME</small> [….] <small>AND NATIONS SHALL WALK BY YOUR LIGHT, EVEN KINGS BY THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR RISING</small>.

Siman 3

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:3; Numb. R. 15:3.</i> You find that, when twelve tribes presented offerings at the dedication of the altar, the tribe of Levi did not offer anything, and they were depressed. &lt;They said:&gt; Why did he keep us from making an offering at the dedication of the altar? A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who made a banquet and each day invited various artisans. Now he had a certain friend who loved him exceedingly, but he did not invite him along with them. So he was depressed saying: Perhaps the king harbors &lt;some grievance&gt; against me in his heart. &lt;Perhaps&gt; it is for this reason that the king has not invited me to any of the feasts. When the days of the feast has passed &lt;the king&gt; called the friend &lt;and&gt; said to him: For all the people of the province I made &lt;that&gt; feast, but for you only I am making one single feast for yourself. Why? Because you are my friend. So it is with this king, the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. [You find that the twelve tribes brought offerings for the dedication of the altar] and the Holy One accepted them, as stated (in Numb. 7:5): <small>TAKE IT FROM THEM</small>. But the tribe of Levi did not bring an offering. When the dedication of the altar had passed, the Holy One said to Aaron and his sons: All the tribes have made a dedication. Now you make a dedication by yourselves. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON &lt;AND SAY UNTO HIM&gt; WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 6)? <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>.

Siman 4

[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 8:2, 4): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small> […. <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH</small>]. You find that Moses experienced more difficulty in making the menorah then for all the &lt;other&gt; vessels of the Tabernacle until the Holy One showed him with his finger.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Above Lev. 3:11 and the parallels listed there; <i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:3 cont.; Numb. R. 15:4.</i> It was the same concerning the hoofs of a clean animal, as it is stated (in Lev. 11:2, 4): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE CREATURES</small> [<small>THAT YOU MAY EAT…. HOWEVER THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.] And it was the same concerning the &lt;new&gt; moon. The Holy One had said to him (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH</small>. So it was the same concerning the making of the menorah, where it is stated (in Numb. 8:4): <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH, HAMMERED WORK OF GOLD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HAMMERED WORK</small> (<i><small>MQS</small>hh</i>)? It is like saying: How difficult (<i><small>MH QS</small>hh</i>) it is to make; for Moses spent a lot of effort before the menorah was made, since it says so (in Exod. 25:31): <small>WITH DIFFICULTY</small> (<i><small>MQS</small>hh</i> revoweled as <i>miqqashah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A typical translation of the Masoretic pointing would be: <small>OF HAMMERED WORK</small>.</i> <small>SHALL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. [&lt;The situation is&gt; like a person who says: How difficult (<i><small>MHQS</small>hh</i>) this task is for me!] When it became difficult for him, the Holy One said to him: Moses, take a talent of gold and cast it into the fire. Then take it out, and it will have been made automatically. [Thus it is stated] (ibid. cont.): {<small>ITS KNOBS, ITS BLOSSOMS, ITS CUPS, AND ITS SHAFTS</small>} [<small>ITS BASE, ITS SHAFT, ITS CUPS, ITS KNOBS, AND ITS FLOWERS SHALL COME OUT OF IT</small>.]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">English translations usually render the end of this verse: …<small>SHALL BE OF ONE PIECE</small> or something similar; however, the midrash follows the interpretation given here.</i> There was a blow with a hammer, and it was made automatically. It was therefore stated (in Exod. 25:31): <small>OF HAMMERED WORK</small> (i.e. with difficulty) <small>SHALL &lt;THE MENORAH&gt; BE MADE</small> (<i><small>TY</small>'<small>SH</small></i>). &lt;The verb is spelled&gt; fully with a <i><small>Y</small></i> (<i>yod</i> in Hebrew) and not written &lt;with the normal spelling&gt; as <i><small>T</small>'<small>SH</small></i> (which could be translated, "you shall make"). &lt;It is written with the extra letter&gt; so as to say: It <small>SHALL BE MADE</small> automatically. What did Moses do? He took a talent of gold and threw it into the fire. Then Moses said: Sovereign of the World here is the talent; [it is cast into the midst of the fire]. Let it be made (<i><small>TY</small>'<small>SH</small></i>) for you just as you wish. Immediately the menorah came forth made as it should be. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:4 end): <small>ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH THE LORD HAD SHOWN MOSES, SO DID HE MAKE THE MENORAH</small>. "Moses made" is not written here, but merely <small>HE MADE</small>. So who did make it? The Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One told Moses to warn Aaron to [light &lt;the lamps&gt; as stated] (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS</small> &gt;. The Holy One said to Israel: If you light &lt;the lamps &gt; before me, I also will preserve your souls from everything evil, so that nothing touches you. Thus their souls are likened to a lamp as stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>A PERSON</small>'s <small>BREATH IS THE LAMP OF</small> {<small>GOD</small>} [<small>THE LORD SEARCHING ALL THE CHAMBERS OF THE BELLY</small>.

Siman 5

(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP; &lt;THE LORD MY GOD LIGHTS UP MY DARKNESS&gt;….</small> Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, are you saying that we should give light before you?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:4; Numb. R. 15:5; Exod. R. 36:2.</i> You are the light of the world and the light [dwells] with you, as it is written (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE REVEALS THE DEEP AND SECRET THINGS, HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>. Now you are saying (in Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>LET &lt;THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP</small>. The Holy One said to them: It is not because I have need of your light. Rather it is so that you may give light to me just as I have given light to you in order to exalt you in the presence of all the nations. Then they say: See how Israel is giving light to the one who gives light to everyone! To what is the matter comparable? To a sighted person and a blind person who were walking on a road. The sighted person said to the blind person: Come and I will support you. So he supported him as he walked. When they entered the city and came into the house, the sighted person said to the blind person: Go out and light this lamp for me in order to give me light. The blind person said to him: When I was on the road you supported me until I entered the house, and you accompanied me. But now you are saying to me: Go out and light this lamp for me in order to give me light! The sighted person said to him: &lt;It was&gt; so that you would not be under obligation to me for accompanying you on the road. I therefore said to you: Light &lt;this lamp&gt; for me. Now the sighted person is the Holy One, as stated (in Zech. 4:10 cf. II Chron. 16:9): <small>&lt;THESE SEVEN&gt; ARE THE EYES OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. And the blind person is Israel, as stated (in Is. 59:10): <small>WE GROPE LIKE BLIND PEOPLE ALONG A WALL</small>. Moreover the Holy One was leading them and giving them light, as stated (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY &lt;IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT&gt;….</small> When the tabernacle was set up, the Holy One called to Moses and said to him: Tell them to give me light. It is so stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO</small> the children of Israel &lt;…&gt;: <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS&gt;…</small>, Israel said to the Holy One (in Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP</small>. Now you say that we are to give you light. The Holy one said to them: It was in order to exalt you that I told you to give light to me, just as I had given light to you. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS&gt;</small>.

Siman 6

[(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 7:1–2)? <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small> [ … ] <small>THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL, &lt;THE HEADS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL HOUSES, NAMELY THE PRINCES OF THE TRIBES, THE ONES IN CHARGE OF THOSE BEING NUMBERED, &gt; MADE THEIR OFFERINGS</small>. Then afterwards (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON</small> [<small>AND SAY UNTO HIM</small>]: <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:5; Numb. R. 15:6.</i> This text is related (to Ps. 34:10 [9]): <small>FEAR THE LORD, O YOU HIS HOLY ONES, FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM LACK NOTHING</small>. You find above (in Numb. 7) that eleven tribes made offerings. So while the tribe of Ephraim made offerings, the tribe of Levi made no offering. Moreover all the princes made offerings except for the prince of Levi. Now who was the prince of Levi? This was Aaron, as stated (in Numb. 17:18 [3]):<small>AND YOU SHALL WRITE THE NAME OF AARON UPON THE ROD OF LEVI</small>. So Aaron did not make an offering with the princes for he said: Woe to me! Perhaps it is because of me that the Holy One is not accepting the tribe of Levi. The Holy One said to him: Go, say unto Aaron: Do not be afraid. You are ordained for something greater than this. It is therefore written (in Numb. 7:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON…</small>. The offerings remain in force as long as the Temple exists, but the lamps are forever. (According to Numb. 8:2 cont:) <small>LET &lt;THE SEVEN LAMPS&gt; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, and all the blessings which I have given you to bless my children shall never pass away.

Siman 7

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, so that you will not despise this menorah. It is so stated (in Zech. 4:10): <small>FOR WHOEVER HAS DESPISED THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS SHALL REJOICE TO SEE THE PLUMMET IN THE HAND OF ZERUBBABEL, &lt;EVEN&gt; THESE SEVEN</small>. What are <small>&lt;THESE&gt; SEVEN</small>? These are the seven planets, in that (ibid. cont.:) <small>THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:5 cont.; Numb. R. 15:7.</i> (Numb. 8:2:) <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT</small>. These seven likewise are dear to him. Thus you may not despise them. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:2:) <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, lest your &lt;evil&gt; drive lead you astray into saying that he (i.e. the Holy One) has need of light. See what written about light, &lt;i.e.&gt; about the windows of the temple (in Ezek. 40:16, 25): <small>NOW THERE WERE NARROW WINDOWS INTO THE CELLS</small> […. <small>LIKE THE WINDOWS</small> (<i>kehahallonot</i>) <small>MENTIONED ABOVE</small>]. "<i>Behallonot</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The traditional <i>Tanhuma</i> Numb. 3:5 reads <i>kahallonot,</i> which is probably the correct reading. The midrash is explaining an extra <i>he</i> (h) which does not belong there.</i> is not written here but "<i>kehahallonot</i>" (understood here as <i>kehah halonot</i> which means "dim windows"), in that they were wide on the outside and narrow on the inside in order to send forth light to the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 3:2.</i> R. Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: This lightning is the result of fire from on high. When it goes forth it brightens up the whole world, as stated (in Ezek. 1:13): <small>AS FOR THE LIKENESS OF THE LIVING CREATURES</small>, [<small>THEIR APPEARANCE WAS LIKE COALS OF FIRE BURNING WITH THE APPEARANCE OF TORCHES … AND FROM THE FIRE THERE WENT FORTH LIGHTNING</small>]. The Holy One said: I have no need of your light. [So why did I tell to you &lt;to give me light&gt;]? Simply in order to exalt you (<i>ha'alotekha</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. 8:2: <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small> (<i>ha‘alotekha</i>).</i>
R. Hanina said: Concerning your own eyes they have within them both black and white. Still you see not out of the white but out of the black. {So would I} [Now if in the case of your eyes, which have within them both black and white, but with you seeing only out of the black, would the Holy One who is all light] need light from anything of yours?

Siman 8

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. Flesh and blood lights a lamp from a burning lamp. Could one &lt;ever&gt; light a lamp from the darkness? The Holy One, however, did make a lamp give light from the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 3)? <small>THEN GOD SAID: LET THERE BE LIGHT</small>. Since I have brought light out of the darkness, do I have need for your light? So why did he say &lt;to light lamps&gt;? Simply for the sake of your exaltation (<i>rt</i>.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>), (in the words of Exod. 27:20) <small>TO SET UP</small> (<i>rt</i>.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>) <small>AN EVERBURNING LAMP</small>.

Siman 9

(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:12): <small>EVEN DARKNESS IS NOT DARK TO YOU</small>; [<small>FOR NIGHT SHINES AS THE DAY, AND DARKNESS BECOMES LIKE THE LIGHT</small>]. But you are saying to us (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>!<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:6; Numb. R. 15:8.</i> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend. The king said to him: You should know that I am dining with you; so make ready for me. His friend went &lt;and&gt; prepared a commoner's<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> coach, a commoner's lamp (<i>menorah</i>), &lt;and&gt; a commoner's<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> table. When the king arrived, attendants came with him. They set around<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Buber text reads <i>SWBQYN,</i> but the translation follows parallel texts and manuscripts and reads <i><small>SBB</small></i> as the verb root here.</i> menorahs of gold before him on either side. When his friend saw all the splendor, he felt ashamed and concealed everything that he had prepared, because everything was &lt;of the type used by&gt; commoners. The king said to him: What is this? Did I not tell you that I was dining with you? Why did you prepare nothing for me? His friend said to him: My Lord King when I saw all this splendor that came with you, I felt ashamed and concealed everything that I had prepared for you, because it consisted of commoner's utensils. The king said to him: By your life I am rejecting all my utensils which I have brought with me, and out of love for you I only wish to use yours. So it was with the Holy One. He is all light, as stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>. When he says to Israel: Prepare a menorah and lamps for me, what is written there (in Exod. 25:8, 31)? <small>AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &lt;…&gt;, AND MAKE A MENORAH OF PURE GOLD</small>. When they had done so, the Divine presence arrived. What is written there (in Exod. 40:35)? <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING …, &lt;BECAUSE THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TABERNACLE&gt;</small>. Immediately he called to Moses, {&lt;as stated (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &lt;THE LORD&gt; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>.} (Numb. 7:89:) <small>WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH HIM</small>. But what did he say unto him? (Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &lt;THE LAMPS&gt;</small>. By your life out of regard for you I am rejecting everything &lt;of mine&gt; and using yours. (Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.

Siman 10

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. Israel said (in Ps. 43:3): <small>SEND OUT YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR TRUTH; THEY WILL LEAD ME</small>. Great is the light of the Holy One!<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:6 cont.; Numb. R. 15:9.</i> The sun and the moon give Light to the world, but from where do they derive their light? They snatch some sparks of celestial light. It is so stated (in Hab. 3:11): <small>&lt;SUN AND MOON REMAIN ON HIGH.&gt; THEY GO FOR THE LIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS, FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR SHINING SPEAR</small>. Great is the celestial light, of which only one part in a hundred has been given to mortals. It is so stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MH</i> read as <i>M’H</i> which means “a hundred.”</i> <small>IS IN THE DARKNESS, &lt;AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM&gt;</small>. Therefore &lt;the Holy One says:&gt; I made Sun and Moon so that they would give you light, as stated (in Gen. 1:17): <small>GOD SET THEM IN THE FIRMAMENT OF THE HEAVENS TO GIVE LIGHT UPON THE EARTH</small>.

Siman 11

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>&lt;LET THE SEVEN LAMPS&gt; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. {David} [Solomon] said (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING</small>'s <small>FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 8:2; Numb. R. 15:9.</i> R. Jacob bar Jose said: Joy was withheld from the wicked and given to Israel, because the Holy One was obliged to dwell among flesh and blood in the light. Thus he said to them (in Numb. 8:2): <small>&lt;LET THE SEVEN LAMPS&gt; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. R. Levi said: A pure menorah descended from the heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 15:9.</i> Why? Because the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 25:31): <small>YOU SHALL ALSO MAKE A MENORAH OF PURE GOLD</small>. He said to him: How shall we make &lt;it&gt;? He said to him (ibid. cont.): <small>OF HAMMERED WORK SHALL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. Nevertheless Moses had difficulty; for when he descended he had forgotten its construction.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Above, Lev. 3:33; <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:8; Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmail, Pisha 2; <i>PRK</i> 15; <i>PR</i> 15:21; 20:4; Exod. R. 15:28.</i> He went up and said: Sovereign of the World I have forgotten &lt;it&gt;. He said to him (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE &lt;IT&gt;</small>. Thus he took a pattern of fire and showed him its construction,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Men</i>. 29a Bar.; <i>Sifre</i> Numb. 8:4 (61); Numb. R. 15:4, 10.</i> but it was still difficult for Moses. The Holy One said to him: Go to Bezalel and he will make it. &lt;So&gt; Moses went down to talk to Bezalel, &lt;and&gt; he made it immediately. Moses began to be wonder and say: In my case, how many times did the Holy one show it to me; yet I had difficulty in making it. Now without seeing it you have made it from your own knowledge. Bezalel (<small>BT</small>s<small>L'L</small>), were you perhaps standing in (<i><small>B</small></i>) the shadow (<i><small>T</small>s<small>L</small></i>) of God ('<i><small>L</small></i>) when the Holy One showed it to me? Therefore when the temple was destroyed, the menorah was stored away. Now this was one of the five things that were stored away: The ark, the menorah, the fire, the Holy Spirit, and the cherubim.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, these five things were lacking from the Second Temple.

(Numb. 8:5-6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt;UNTO MOSES SAYING&gt;: TAKE THE LEVITES</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many strings were on the harp which the Levites played?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:7; Numb. R. 15:11}</i> Thus did R. Judah teach:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T‘Arakh</i>. 2:7; ‘<i>Arakh.</i> 13b.</i> There were seven (<i>shB'</i>) strings on that harp, as stated (in Ps. 16:11): <small>IN YOUR PRESENCE THERE IS FULLNESS</small> (rt.: <i><small>SB</small></i>')<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>S</i> here is a Hebrew <i>sin</i> in the unpointed text <i>SB</i>‘ is identical with <i>ShB</i>‘.</i> <small>OF JOY</small>. Do not read &lt;the word pointed as&gt; <i>sova</i>' ("fullness") but &lt;as&gt; <i>sheva</i>' ("seven"). So also did David say (in Ps. 119:164): <small>WITH SEVEN A DAY DO I PRAISE YOU</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 81:3; <i>PR</i> 21:1. A more traditional translation of Ps. 119:164 would read: <small>SEVEN TIMES A DAY DO I PRAISE YOU</small>.</i> Moreover, in the days of the Messiah it will be made with eight &lt;strings&gt;. Therefore David has stated concerning the instrumental music (in Ps. 6:1): <small>FOR THE LEADER; WITH INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ON THE EIGHT-STRINGED HARP</small>. Furthermore in the age to come it will be made of ten &lt;strings&gt; as stated {<small>SING TO GOD A NEW SONG…</small>. }<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">No Psalm has exactly these words but <small>SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG…</small>. appears in Pss. 96:1; 98:1; and 149:1; as well as in Is. 42:10.</i> [(in Ps. 144:9): <small>O GOD, LET ME SING TO YOU A NEW SONG; LET ME PLAY FOR YOU ON A TEN-STRINGED HARP</small>.] And who ordained them? Samuel and David. It is so stated (in I Chron. 9:22): <small>DAVID AND SAMUEL THE SEER ORDAINED THEM IN THEIR OFFICE OF TRUST</small>. Moreover, they &lt;were the ones who&gt; set up the divisions for singing. Now the Levites would stand on their platform and sing before the one who spoke for the world to come into being. See the love with which the Holy One loved the Levites. So from the beginning the Holy One chose them to serve him. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses. Levites are extremely dear to me. Take them in my name for a position of authority. {Thus it is stated:} [From where is it shown? From what they read on the matter] (in Numb. 8:6): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>.

Siman 13

Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:6): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. The Holy One does not elevate a person to an office until &lt;first&gt; he tests and examines him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:8; Numb. R. 15:12.</i> When he withstands his test, he elevates him to the office. And so you find in the case of our father Abraham, when the Holy One tested him with ten temptations, he withstood his trial. Then after that he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS</small>. So also in the case of Isaac, when he tested him in the days of Abimelech, he withstood the trial. Then after that he blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND</small> [ … <small>FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM</small>]. So also in the case of Jacob, when he tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau with Dinah, with Joseph, and &lt;with the tribulation of&gt; how he departed from the house of his father and his mother (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH &lt;ONLY MY STAFF DID I CROSS &lt;THIS JORDAN&gt;</small> …, he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>, [<small>WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDAN-ARAM, AND BLESSED HIM</small>]. So also in the case of Joseph, he tested him with the wife of Potiphar, and he was imprisoned for twelve years. Then after that he came out and became king because he had withstood his trial. Ergo (in Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. So also in the case of the tribe of Levi, they laid down their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One (i.e. for martyrdom), so that the Torah would not be set aside. Now when Israel was in Egypt, they had rejected the Torah and circumcision and all of them had become worshipers of idols as Ezekiel has demonstrated where it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5): <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY UNTO THEM: THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD, IN THE DAY THAT I CHOSE ISRAEL…</small>. Then what is written at the end (in vs. 8)? <small>BUT THEY REBELLED AGAINST ME AND DID NOT COME TO HEARKEN UNTO ME</small>. [<small>INDIVIDUALLY THEY DID NOT CAST AWAY THE ABOMINATIONS OF THEIR EYES NOR DID THEY FORSAKE THE IDOLS OF EGYPT</small>]. What did the Holy One do? He brought darkness upon Egypt for three days, and during those &lt;days&gt; he killed all the wicked ones of Israel. For this reason it says (in Ezek. 20:36, 38): <small>AS I BROUGHT YOUR ANCESTORS TO JUDGMENT IN THE DESERT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT…</small>.] <small>SO WILL I REMOVE FROM YOU &lt;THOSE WHO REBEL AND TRANSGRESS AGAINST ME&gt;</small>. So also it says (in Cant. 2:13): <small>AND THE FIG TREE SHEDS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>hanetah.</i> Although the biblical context suggests a translation such as “puts forth” or “ripens” the context understands this rare verb in a more negative sense. See above vol. 2, p. 62 <i>Tanh. (Buber); Exod. 3:7)</i>.</i> <small>ITS GREEN FIGS…</small>. These are the wicked who are in Israel. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>AND THE VINES IN BLOSSOM GIVE OFF FRAGRANCE</small>. These are the rest who have repented and been accepted. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>ARISE, MY BELOVED, MY FAIR ONE, AND COME AWAY</small>, for behold the time of redemption has arrived. However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9): <small>FOR THEY OBSERVED YOUR WORD</small>, i.e., the Torah; <small>AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT</small>, i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there as stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>SO MOSES STOOD UP ON THE GATE OF THE CAMP AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD COME TO ME. THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM</small>. When Moses said (in vs. 27): <small>EACH &lt;OF YOU&gt;</small> [<small>PUT HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH</small>, they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them, &lt;namely&gt; the one (according Deut. 33:9) <small>WHO SAYS OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER: I DO NOT CONSIDER THEM …, FOR THEY</small> (the Levites) <small>OBSERVED YOUR WORD AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT</small>. When the Holy One saw that they all were righteous, that he had tested them and they had withstood their trial, as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8): <small>&lt;YOUR FAITHFUL ONE,&gt; WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH</small>, the Holy One immediately said (in Numb. 8:14): <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BELONG TO ME</small> to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.:) <small>BUT HIS SOUL</small> (i.e. the soul of the Holy One) <small>HATES THE WICKED AND THE LOVER OF INJUSTICE</small>. David said (in Ps. 128:1): <small>BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO FEARS THE LORD AND WALKS IN HIS WAYS</small>.

(Numb. 10:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt;UNTO MOSES SAYING&gt;: MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small> (<i>hatsotserot</i>). This text is related (to Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>, [<small>BE LIFTED UP, YOU EVERLASTING DOORS</small>,] <small>&lt;THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN&gt;</small>. When Solomon was bringing the ark into the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:9; Numb. R. 15:13; above Exod. 2:6 and the note there.</i> he began to say: <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>, because the openings were &lt;too&gt; low. [Then he said:] <small>BE LIFTED UP YOU EVERLASTING DOORS, THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN</small>. The gates said to him (in vss. 8 and 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? The gates immediately wanted to devour him &lt;and would have done so,&gt; if he had not said (in vs. 10): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY. SELAH</small>. Again he said (in vs. 8): <small>THE LORD STRONG AND MIGHTY</small>. He said to them: Expand yourselves, for the king of glory is coming upon you. They immediately paid him homage (<i>kavod</i>), raised up honor (<i>kavod</i>) for him, and raised themselves up.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. R. 2:9 (13).</i> So the ark entered. The Holy One said to them: You have paid me homage. When I destroy my house, no one will prevail against you. You know that all the implements of the Temple went into exile in Babylon as stated (in Dan. 1:2): <small>THEN THE LORD GAVE KING JEHOIAKIM OF JUDAH INTO HIS HAND</small>, [<small>WITH SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTS FROM THE HOUSE OF THE GOD; AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE LAND OF SHINAR</small>]. But the temple gates were hidden in situ, as stated (in Lam. 2:9): <small>HER GATES HAVE SUNK INTO THE GROUND</small>.

Siman 15

[Another interpretation:] What is the meaning (of Ps. 24:10): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY</small>? That he imparts some of his glory to those who fear him as befits his glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanhuma</i> Numb. 3:9 cont.; Numb. R.15:13; see <i>PRK</i> 32:9 (= Suppl. 1:9); M. Pss. 90:1.</i> How? He is called "god" (<i>elohim</i>), and he called Moses "god," as stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. He (the Holy One) causes the dead to live, and he imparted some of his glory to Elijah. Thus he (i.e., Elijah) caused the dead to live, as stated (in I Kings 17:23): <small>AND ELIJAH SAID: SEE YOUR SON IS ALIVE</small>. Because the Holy One imparts some of his glory to those who fear him, he put his own clothing on the Messianic King, as stated (in Ps. 21:6 [5]): <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY YOU SHALL LAY UPON HIM</small>. Our masters have taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 2:5; see also <i>TSanh.</i> 4:2.</i> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one rides upon his horse, no one puts on his clothes, no one uses his crown, and no one sits upon his throne; but in all these &lt;instances&gt; the Holy One shared &lt;his glory&gt; with those who feared him and gave to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Above Exod. 2:7; Numb. 2:34.</i> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Nahum 1:3): <small>THE LORD IS IN THE WHIRLWIND, AND THE STORM IS HIS ROAD</small>. But he gave it (i.e., the divine whirlwind horse) to Elijah, as stated (in II Kings. 2:11): <small>AND</small> [<small>ELIJAH</small>] <small>WENT UP IN A WHIRLWIND INTO THE HEAVENS</small>. No one puts on his clothes. What is written (in Ps. 104:1)? {<small>AND</small>} <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>. Also with reference to the Messianic King, it is written (in Ps. 21:6 [5]): <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY YOU BESTOWED UPON HIM</small>. No one uses his crown. What is written concerning Moses (in Exod. 34:29)? <small>AND MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE WAS SHINING</small>. And no one sits upon his throne. Now it is written (in I Chron. 29:23): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD AS KING</small>. (<i>Sanh.</i> 2:5:) <small>AND NO ONE USES HIS SCEPTER</small>. But he gave it to Moses as stated (in Exod. 4:17): <small>YOU SHALL TAKE IN YOUR HAND THIS ROD &lt;WITH WHICH YOU SHALL PERFORM THE SIGNS&gt;</small>. What is written about the Holy One (in Ps. 47:6 [5])? <small>GOD HAS ASCENDED AMID ACCLAMATION; THE LORD WITH THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET</small> (<i>shofar</i>). The Holy One said to Moses: I have made you a king. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:5): <small>THEN HE BECAME KING IN JESHURUN</small>. Just as when the king goes forth, they sound trumpets before him, so also will they sound trumpets before you when you go forth. (Numb. 10:2:) <small>MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small> (<i>hatsotserot</i>).

Siman 17

[Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD, AND THE KING</small>.] Whoever is in fear of the Holy One becomes a king. From whom did you learn &lt;that&gt;? From Abraham because he was in fear of the Holy One and became a king. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>. But where is it shown that he became a king? [R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said in the name of R. Helbo:] It is written (in Gen. 14:17): <small>&lt;AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT TO MEET HIM … &gt; AT THE VALLEY OF SHAVEH</small>, i.e., <small>THE VALLEY OF THE KING</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>THE VALLEY OF SHAVEH</small> (rt.: <i>Sh<small>WH</small></i>?] That they all became equal (rt.: <i><small>S</small>h<small>WH</small></i>). So taking counsel (or taking wood),<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">‘<i>Etsah.</i> The word can mean either “counsel” or “wood”.</i> they cut cedars, made a throne, and set him over them as king. And you should not say &lt;this&gt; only &lt;in the case of&gt; Abraham alone. In the case of Moses &lt;as well&gt;, because he was in fear of the Holy One, he became a king. [Now where is it stated that he feared &lt;the Holy One&gt;? Where it is stated (in Exod. 3:6): <small>THEN MOSES HID HIS FACE, FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT GOD</small>.

Siman 18

Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2 translated literally): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small> (<i>lekha</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; at your own expense (literally: from what belongs to you [<i>lekha</i>]).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:10 cont., Numb. R. 15:16.</i> (Ibid.:) <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF. FOR YOURSELF</small> you shall make &lt;them&gt; and not for others. You are to use them, and no one else is to use them. You yourself know that, in the case of his disciple Joshua, he did not use those &lt;trumpets&gt; but horns. When they came to fight against Jericho, there gathered in Jericho seven peoples. It is so stated (in Josh. 14:11): <small>WHEN YOU CROSSED THE JORDAN AND CAME UNTO JERICHO, THE CITIZENS OF JERICHO: THE AMORITES, THE PERIZZITES</small>, [<small>THE CANAANITES, THE HITTITES, THE GIRGASHITES</small>,] <small>THE HIVITES, AND THE JEBUSITES FOUGHT AGAINST YOU</small>. Did seven peoples make up the citizens of Jericho? After all it says &lt;here&gt;: <small>THE CITIZENS OF JERICHO: THE AMORITES…</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: Jericho was the door bolt &lt;for unlocking&gt; the land of Israel. They said: If Jericho is conquered, the whole land will be conquered. For that reason seven peoples gathered within it. What is written (in Josh. 6:20)? <small>SO THE PEOPLE SHOUTED WHEN &lt;THE PRIESTS&gt; BLEW ON THE HORNS</small>. &lt;This&gt; teaches that even though Joshua was &lt;Moses'&gt; disciple, he did not use them (i.e. the silver trumpets). Moreover you should not say &lt;this only&gt; about Joshua but even &lt;about&gt; our master Moses, &lt;since the trumpets&gt; were hidden while he was &lt;still&gt; alive. R. Isaac said: Note that when Moses was going to depart this world, he said (in Deut. 31:28): <small>GATHER UNTO ME</small> [<small>ALL THE ELDERS OF YOUR TRIBES AND YOUR OFFICIALS</small>]. But where were the trumpets? After all he did not say: Blow on them for &lt;those people&gt; to gather. It is simply that while he was alive they were hidden. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: &lt;It was to fulfill what was said (in Eccl. 8:8): <small>&lt;NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND, TO CONTAIN THE WIND &gt; NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>… Ergo (in Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small>, and no one else is to use them all your days.

Siman 19

Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small>. You are to use them because you are a king, but another is not to use them except King David, as stated (in II Chron. 29:26, 28): <small>AND THE LEVITES STOOD</small> {<small>IN THEIR PLACE</small>} [….: <small>THE SONG WAS SUNG AND THEY BLEW THE TRUMPETS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 3:10, cont., Numb.

Immediately David and the students would arise to occupy themselves with the Torah; and driving sleep from their eyes, they would meditate on the Torah until the dawn arose. Therefore, David said (ibid.): <small>AWAKE, MY GLORY</small>. It is customary for the dawn to awaken the children of Adam, but (ibid. cont.:) <small>I WILL AWAKEN THE DAWN</small>.

It is customary for kings to arise at three hours [into the day]; so why are you arising at midnight? Then he said to him: <small>EMPTY WAS MY GLORY. MY GLORY</small> is nothing before the glory of my creator. It is therefore stated: <small>AWAKE</small> (or <small>EMPTY WAS</small>) <small>MY GLORY</small>. So he would arise at midnight and praise the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 119:62): <small>AT MIDNIGHT I WILL ARISE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS STATUTES</small>. David said: It is my duty to arise at midnight and to praise you for the wonders that you have done with my ancestor (Ruth) at midnight, as stated (in Ruth 3:8–9): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT MIDNIGHT THAT THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO HE TURNED ASIDE, &lt;AND HERE WAS A WOMAN LYING AT HIS FEET&gt;. THEN HE SAID: WHO ARE YOU? AND SHE SAID: I AM YOUR HANDMAID RUTH</small>. So he said to her (in vs. 13): <small>SPEND THE NIGHT</small>. [<small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT</small>,] <small>IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU GOOD…</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum [the Levite] said: She said to him: Are you sending me away with &lt;mere&gt; words? He said to her (ibid. cont.): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small> I am not sending you away with &lt;mere&gt; words. [Another interpretation] (of Ruth 3:13): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>. &lt;This oath&gt; teaches that he had imposed an oath on his &lt;evil&gt; drive, which was inciting him by saying to him: You are an unmarried man and she is an unmarried woman. Now is the time to seduce her. Immediately this righteous man swore: <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small> I am not touching her tonight. And not only Boaz, but all the righteous impose an oath on their &lt;evil&gt; drive. Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? <small>AND DAVID SAID: AS THE LORD LIVES</small>, [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>SHALL SMITE HIM. EITHER HE WILL DIE WHEN HIS DAY COMES &lt;OR HE WILL GO DOWN AND PERISH IN BATTLE. THE LORD FORBID THAT I LAY MY HAND ON THE LORD'S ANOINTED&gt;</small>. Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said: His &lt;evil&gt; drive came and said to him: If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. Moreover according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him, since here he is pursuing &lt;you&gt;. He therefore hastened to swear two times: As he lives I will not kill him. Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, you know the power of the evil drive, how strong it is. The Holy One said to them: Remove<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The imperative here follows the parallel in <i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:10. The Buber text renders: “They removed.”</i> it little by little, and I will take it away. Thus it is stated (in Is. 62:10): <small>BUILD UP, COMPLETE THE HIGHWAY</small><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical text renders: <small>BUILD UP, BUILD UP THE HIGHWAY</small>.</i> <small>&lt;TAKE AWAY SOME STONE&gt;</small> (i.e. the evil drive)! It also says (in Is. 57:14): <small>BUILD UP, BUILD UP</small>! <small>CLEAR OUT A WAY</small>! <small>&lt;REMOVE AN OBSTACLE</small> (i.e. the evil drive) <small>FROM THE WAY OF MY PEOPLE</small>! &gt; Then in the world to come I will root it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH</small>. Thus has R. Tanhuma bar Abba interpreted.

(Numb. 11:16:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL….</small> Let our master instruct us: Within how many cubits is one obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder when he sees him?<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:11; Numb. R. 15:17.</i> Thus have our masters taught: Within four cubits one is obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qid</i> 33b; cf also <i>yBik.</i> 3:3 (65c).</i> Thus it is stated (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF</small><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">To be in one’s presence is to be within four cubits.</i> <small>A GRAY HEAD</small>. One also bows down before him and asks after his welfare, &lt;when&gt; within four cubits. And about which honor did Torah say (ibid. cont.): <small>YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER</small>? That one should not stand in his place, sit in his place, or contradict his words. Also when one asks &lt;about&gt; a law (<i>halakhah</i>), one should ask with reverence and not rush to respond or interrupt his words. Whoever does not behave toward his teacher (<i>rav</i>) according to all these rules is labeled a wicked person before the Omnipresent, his learning is forgotten, his years are shortened, and in the end he comes into the hands of {transgressions} [poverty], as stated (in Eccl. 8:13): <small>IT SHALL NOT GO WELL WITH THE WICKED ONE, NOR SHALL HE PROLONG HIS DAYS. &lt;THEY ARE&gt; LIKE A SHADOW, BECAUSE HE IS NOT IN FEAR BEFORE GOD</small>. In regard to this fear I do not know &lt;exactly&gt; what it is; &lt;but&gt; when it says (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GRAY HEAD, &lt;YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER, &gt; AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>, note that it is &lt;really&gt; saying: This is the fear of students toward sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since <small>GRAY HEAD</small> and <small>ELDER</small> are understood to refer to the sages.</i> But I might say: This is a fear of usury and a fear of &lt;false&gt; weights.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 25:36; 19:36. So why say that it refers to a sage?</i> It is simply that R. Eleazar has said: It is stated here: <small>&lt;YOU SHALL HONOR&gt; THE PRESENCE</small> (<i><small>PNY</small></i>) <small>OF THE ELDER, AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>; while it is stated in the other passage (in Eccl. 8:13): <small>HE IS NOT IN FEAR BEFORE</small> (<i><small>PNY</small></i>) <small>GOD</small>. Moreover, one is obligated to &lt;have him&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The sense of bracketed words appears in the parallel texts of <i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:11 and Numb. R. 15:17, although the exact Hebrew wordings of the two parallels differ from each other.</i> precede everyone when entering and leaving and to treat him with fear and honor. It is so stated (in Deut. 6:13):<small>YOU SHALL FEAR</small> (<i>et</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This word generally denotes that what follows is a direct object but at times the word means “along with.” In this latter sense the <i>et</i> implies that one should honor someone along with the Lord your god. For an example of <i>et</i> indicating further inclusions, see above <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber) Gen. 1:8.</i> <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. &lt;The <i>et</i> must refer&gt; to the master scholars of Torah since you have no other guide like it. And so it says (in Deut. 1:15): <small>&lt;SO I TOOK THE HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES, WISE AND WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE, &gt; AND APPOINTED THEM HEADS OVER</small> {<small>THE PEOPLE</small>} [<small>YOU</small>]. From here you learn that you should treat him in a princely manner, &lt;i.e.,&gt; stand in his presence, and give him precedence in every matter of dignity. So let no one on his own refrain from standing in the presence of an elder. R. Abba bar Pappa the Priest said: When I saw a certain group of people, I would walk by another route so as not to be a bother for them, lest they see me and stand for me. When I told of the matter to R. Jose bar Zevida, he said to me: You must pass before them, so that they will see you and stand in your presence. Then you will bring them to the point of fearing Heaven, as stated (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GRAY HEAD, &lt;YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER,&gt; AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>. Why? Because the rise of the righteous is a rise in which there is no decline. But the rise of Esau<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Esau stands for any Roman.</i> the Wicked is a rise which is wholly decline. Today he is a governor;<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eparchos.</i></i> tomorrow a commoner;<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>paganus</i> (“peasant”).</i> the next day an imperial cabinet member<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>comes</i>.</i> the day after that a captain.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>stratiotes</i> (“citizen soldier”).</i> And thus it is with all their great ones. So also the Prophet says (in Obad. vs. 4): <small>THOUGH YOU MAKE YOUR ABODE AS HIGH AS THE EAGLE, AND THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS, I WILL BRING YOU DOWN FROM THERE, SAYS THE LORD</small>. The rise of Jacob, however, is a rise which has no decline, and their holiness is never desecrated. And so you find that the elders are one of thirteen things which are written down as belonging to the name of the Holy One. These &lt;thirteen&gt; are the following: (1) The silver and gold, (2) the priests, (3) the Levites, (4) Israel, (5) the first-born, (6) the altar, (7) the priestly share, (8) the oil for anointing, (9) the tent of meeting, (10) the Davidic dynasty, (11) the offerings, (12) the land of Israel, and (13) the elders.

[(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &lt;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>.] This text is related (to Amos. 9:6): <small>WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS AND FOUNDS HIS CELESTIAL VAULT</small> (<i>aguddah</i>) <small>UPON EARTH</small>.

Therefore the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>. Why? Because a gathering of righteous people is enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but a gathering of wicked people is an offense to them and an offense to the world.

Siman 22

Another Interpretation (of Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE &lt;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. When the Holy one said to Moses: <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>, Moses said: How shall I manage to get &lt;them&gt; from all the tribes?<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. Numb. 3:12; Numb. R. 15:19; <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:24-26 (95).</i> If I get five each from every tribe, they will not add up to the number seventy. [There will only be sixty.] And if we get six each from every tribe, they will add up to the number seventy-two. But if we get five from one tribe and six from another, I shall be imposing jealousy among the tribes. What did Moses do? R. Judah says: He took seventy pieces of paper<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Petaqim</i>; cf. Gk.: <i>pittikia</i> (“notes”).</i> and wrote "Elder" on them. Then he took another {seventy} [two] blank pieces of paper, mixed them up, put them in an urn,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kalpis.</i></i> and said to them: Come and take your pieces of paper. Whoever took a paper with "elder" written on it knew that he had been appointed an elder. Whoever came up with a blank paper in his hand knew that he had not been appointed an elder. R. Nehemiah said to him: There would still have been a controversy, since &lt;a loser&gt; could have said to him: Where is a paper with "elder" written on it? If it had been there, it would have come up in my hand. Therefore, how did he manage for them? R. Nehemiah said: He took seventy-two pieces of paper and wrote "Elder" on them plus seventy two other blank pieces of paper. Then he mixed them up and put them in the urn. He said to them: Come and take your papers. If a paper with "elder" written on it came up in &lt;a person's&gt; hand he knew that he had been appointed an elder, but if a blank one came up in his hand he knew that he had not been not appointed. Then the officer-in-charge would say to him: Look there is another paper there with "elder" written upon it. If you had been worthy of being appointed, &lt;a paper with "elder"&gt; would have come up in your hand. When Moses had followed this &lt;procedure&gt; the elders were appointed. Eldad and Medad were there, but they excluded themselves. They said: We are not worthy to be in the number (<i>minyan</i>) of the elders. Now because they excluded themselves, they were found superior to the elders in five respects.

        <br>The elders only prophesied for the morrow as stated (in Numb. 11:18): <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THE PEOPLE</small>: [<small>PURIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE MORROW</small>], but these men prophesied what was going to happen at the end of forty years as stated (in Numb. 11:26–27): <small>BUT TWO MEN HAD REMAINED IN THE CAMP</small>. [<small>THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ELDAD AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER WAS MEDAD …; &lt;AND THEY WERE … &gt; PROPHESYING IN THE CAMP</small>.] But what were they prophesying? Some say &lt;they were prophesying&gt; about the downfall of Gog and Magog, while others say they were prophesying that Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the land. You yourself know that they so prophesied, since it is stated (in vs. 28): <small>THEN JOSHUA BEN NUN, MOSES' ATTENDANT FROM HIS YOUTH, ANSWERED AND SAID: MY LORD MOSES RESTRAIN THEM</small>. (vs. 27): <small>BUT A LAD RAN AND TOLD MOSES…</small>. And who was it? It was Moses' son Gershom.
        <br>The elders did not enter the land, but these did enter the land. Eldad is &lt;so listed&gt; (in Numb. 34:21) &lt;as&gt; <small>ELIDAD BEN CHISLON</small>. Medad is &lt;so listed&gt; (in Numb. 34:24) &lt;as&gt; <small>KEMUEL BEN SHIPHTAN</small>.
        <br>The elders were not designated by their names, but these were designated by their names.
        <br>The elders had their prophecy cease, but these did not have their prophecy cease. It is so stated (of the seventy in Numb. 11:25): <small>THEY PROPHESIED BUT DID NOT CONTINUE</small>.
        <br>In the case of the elders, their prophecy was from what belonged to Moses, even as the Scripture has said (in Numb. 11:17): <small>AND I WILL SET ASIDE SOME OF THE SPIRIT &lt;WHICH IS UPON YOU AND PUT IT ON THEM&gt;</small>; but these &lt;two&gt; had their prophecy from that which belonged to the Holy One, as stated (in Numb. 11:26): <small>AND THE SPIRIT RESTED UPON THEM</small>.
    
Now if you say: Since the elders had their prophecy from what belonged to Moses, might it not have lessened his prophecy somewhat? &lt;The answer is&gt; No. To what may Moses be compared? To a lamp which was burning.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:17 (93).</i> Everyone lights up from it, but its light is in no way diminished. So also in the case of Moses. Although the prophets took of his prophecy, the prophecy of Moses was in no way diminished. [It is so stated] (in Deut. 34:10): <small>AND NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES</small>.

Did they not have elders in the past?<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:13; Numb.

So for what reason had the Holy One said (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME</small> …? &lt;It was&gt; to teach you that when Pharaoh had said (in Exod. 1:10): <small>COME LET US ACT SHREWDLY</small>, Pharaoh gathered all Israel. He said to them: Please work with me as a favor today. This is what is written (in vs. 13): <small>SO THE EGYPTIANS MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL LABOR WITH RUTHLESSNESS</small> (<i>befarekh</i>). At first it was with with gentle speech (<i>befeh rakh</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting Exod. 1:13 to mean: <small>SO THE EGYPTIANS MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL LABOR WITH GENTLE SPEECH</small>. So <i>Sot</i>. 11ab; Exod. R. 1:11.</i> Pharaoh took a basket and trowel, and whoever [saw Pharaoh] taking basket and trowel and working with bricks worked too. Israel immediately went quickly, and vigorously applied their skill along with him all the day, because they were strong and mighty. When it grew dark, he posted taskmasters over them. He said to them: Reckon the &lt; number of&gt; bricks. They immediately arose and counted them. He said to them: This many you shall produce for me each and every day. He assigned Egyptian taskmasters over the officers of Israel, and the officers were assigned over the rest of the people. Moreover when he said to them (in Exod. 5:7): <small>YOU SHALL NO LONGER GIVE THE PEOPLE STRAW</small>, the taskmasters came and counted the bricks. &lt;If&gt; they were found &lt;the bricks&gt; deficient, the taskmasters beat the officers, as stated (in Exod. 5:14): <small>AND THE OFFICERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WHOM &lt;THE TASKMASTERS OF PHARAOH&gt; HAD SET OVER THEM, WERE BEATEN…</small>. When the officers were beaten for the rest of the people, they did not hand them over into the hands of the taskmasters, for they said: It is better for us to be beaten that the rest of the people may not be weakened. Therefore when the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME &lt;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>, Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe I do not know who is worthy and who is not worthy. He said to him (in Numb. 11:16 cont.:) <small>WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>. These are the officers who had handed themselves over to be beaten on their behalf in Egypt because of the required amount of bricks. Let them come and receive this dignity. It therefore says (ibid.): <small>WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE</small> [<small>ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>]. From here you learn that whoever hands himself over for the sake of Israel merits glory and dignity. It is therefore written (ibid.): <small>WHOM YOU KNOW</small> [<small>TO BE ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>. Who are they? The ones of whom it is written] (in Exod. 5:14): <small>AND THE OFFICERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &lt;WHOM THE TASKMASTERS OF PHARAOH HAD SET OVER THEM&gt; WERE BEATEN</small>.

When the princes (i.e. the people of Israel) were in Egypt, they had seventy elders as stated (in Exod. 3:16): <small>GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>; and with them they went out of Egypt. Moreover when Moses went up &lt;on Sinai&gt; to receive the Torah, they were &lt;still&gt; with him, as stated (in Exod. 24:9): <small>THEN THERE WENT UP MOSES AND AARON, NADAB, ABIHU, AND THE SEVENTY ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.

When they heard that, they said to them: Why are you making him angry, you for whom he performed all the miracles and wonders? They rose up against them and killed them.

Siman 27

(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &lt;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. But did you not have elders before?<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:16 cont.; Numb. R. 15:24.</i> Here now it is written concerning Mount Sinai (in Exod. 24:9): <small>THEN THERE WENT UP MOSES … AND THE SEVENTY ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>; and this parashah (with Numb. 11:16) comes after that. So where were the&lt;se earlier&gt; elders? It is simply that, when Israel did those things which are stated (in Numb. 11:1): <small>NOW THE PEOPLE WERE AS MURMURERS</small> […. <small>THEN THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AGAINST THEM</small>], they were all destroyed by fire at that time. It is simply that their burning was like the burning of Nadab and Abihu, for they also had acted with disrespect on ascending Sinai, when they saw the Divine Presence. It is so stated (in Exod. 24:11): <small>THEY BEHELD GOD, AND THEY ATE AND DRANK</small>. Was there eating and drinking there? To what is the matter comparable? To a servant who attended his master while &lt;holding&gt; a slice of bread in his hand and taking bites from it. Similarly had they acted with disrespect as though eating and drinking. So the elders along with Nadab and Abihu deserved to be destroyed by fire on that day; but because the giving of Torah was dear to the Holy One, he therefore did not want to harm them and bring calamity to them on that day. This is what is written (ibid.): <small>BUT HE</small> (the Holy One) <small>STILL DID NOT RAISE HIS HAND AGAINST THE NOBLES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. From this you may infer that they deserved to have a hand raised &lt;against them&gt;. After a time, however, they were destroyed by fire. Nadab and Abihu were destroyed by fire as they entered the tent of meeting, while the elders were destroyed by fire when they were filled with lusting, as stated (in Numb. 11:4): <small>THEN THE RABBLE WHICH WAS IN THEIR MIDST &lt;BECAME FILLED WITH LUST&gt;</small>. Who were <small>THE RABBLE</small> (<i>ha'safsuf</i>)? R. Simeon ben Menasya and R. Simeon bar Abba &lt;differed&gt;. One said: These were the proselytes who came up with them from Egypt and who were gathered (<i>ne'esafim</i>) together with them as stated (in Exod. 12:38): <small>AND A MIXED MULTITUDE &lt;WENT UP WITH THEM&gt;…</small>. But the other said: <small>RABBLE</small> can only be a sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME</small> [<small>SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>] <small>&lt;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. What &lt;else&gt; is written there (in vs. 1)? <small>THEN THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AGAINST THEM AND CONSUMED THEM IN THE OUTSKIRTS</small> (<i>qetseh</i>) <small>OF THE CAMP</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; among the officers (<i>qetsinim</i>) in the camp. And where is it shown that those elders who went up onto the mountain were destroyed by fire? Where it is stated (in Ps. 106:18): <small>AND FIRE BROKE OUT IN THEIR COMPANY</small> ('<i>edah</i>), since <small>COMPANY</small> ('<i>edah</i>) can only be a sanhedrin as stated (in Numb. 15:24): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT IF IT WAS DONE &lt;BY MISTAKE&gt; AWAY FROM THE EYES OF THE CONGREGATION</small> ('<i>edah</i>)….<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the leaders of the congregation. So Rashi on Numb. 15:24.</i> It is also written (in Lev. 4:13): <small>AND IF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small> ('<i>edah</i>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">This expression was often interpreted as denoting the Sanhedrin. So <i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 4:13 (42: <i>Wayyiqra</i> parashah 4); R. Meir in <i>Hor</i>. 5a; Rashi on Lev. 4:13.</i> <small>SHOULD ERR</small>? Then they wept again and demanded meat. Now if you should say: What they wanted was flesh (not manna), did it not come about that the manna became whatever they wanted inside of their mouths. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 106:15): <small>SO HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY ASKED FOR</small>. Again in case you should say that they did not have oxen and cattle in the desert, he caused to be written (in Exod. 12:38): <small>AND A MIXED MULTITUDE WENT UP WITH THEM WITH FLOCKS AND HERDS</small>. And in case you should say they ate them in the desert, is it not written (in Numb. 32:1): <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>? From here R. Simeon said: It was not flesh for which they lusted, since it says so (in Ps. 78:27): <small>AND HE RAINED DOWN MEAT</small> (<i>she'er</i>) <small>UPON THEM LIKE DUST</small>. Now <i>she'er</i> must denote illicit intercourse since it is stated (in Lev. 18:6): <small>NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH ANY CLOSE</small> (<i>she'er</i>) <small>RELATION TO HIM</small>. Ergo, it &lt;really&gt; says that they desired to permit illicit intercourse for themselves; and so it says (in Numb. 11:10): <small>NOW MOSES HEARD THE PEOPLE WEEPING FOR THEIR FAMILIES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 75a according to which they were weeping here because of the family relations with whom they were forbidden to have intercourse.</i> Thus when they desired such &lt;relations&gt; (ibid. cont.:) <small>THE LORD WAS VERY ANGRY…</small>. At that time Moses said to the Holy One (in vs. 11): <small>WHY HAVE YOU MISTREATED YOUR SERVANT</small> …? In the past there was one with me who would bear the burden of Israel, but now I am alone. Thus it is written (in vs. 14—15): <small>I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR &lt;ALL THIS PEOPLE ALONE … SO IF YOU ARE DEALING LIKE THIS WITH ME…</small>. At that time the Holy One said to him: Appoint other elders instead of those elders. [It is so stated] (in vs. 16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE &lt;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>.

(Numb. 11:17:) <small>THEN I WILL COME DOWN AND SPEAK WITH YOU THERE</small>. &lt;This verse is&gt; to inform you that the day for appointing elders was as dear to the Holy One as the day for the giving of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> Numb. 3:16, cont.; Numb. R. 15:25.</i> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:11): <small>FOR ON THE THIRD DAY THE LORD WILL COME DOWN … &lt;UPON MOUNT SINAI&gt;</small>; and also (in Numb. 11:17) with reference to appointing the elders, <small>I WILL COME DOWN</small> is written. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and hired a guard for it. Then he gave him the payment of a guard for him to guard to orchard. After a time the guard said to him: I cannot guard all of it myself. Rather give me others to guard it with me. The king said to him: I have given the entire orchard into your keeping, and I have given you all the payment for guarding it; but now you would say to me: Go and bring others to guard it with me. See I am bringing others to guard with you, but observe that I am not giving them their payment from what belongs to me. Rather it is from your payment which I have given you that they are receiving their payment. Similarly did the Holy One speak to Moses. When &lt;Moses&gt; said to him: I cannot &lt;do everything&gt; alone; the Holy One said to him: I have given you understanding and knowledge to sustain<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRNS</i>. Cf. Gk.: <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> my children. Moreover, I did not want others, merely so that you would have strength and knowledge and so that you would stand alone in that greatness. But now you are the one who wants others. Be aware that they will receive &lt;payment&gt;, not from what is mine, but from what is yours. It is so stated (in Numb. 11:17.): <small>AND I WILL SET ASIDE SOME OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS UPON YOU &lt;AND PUT IT ON THEM&gt;</small>. Nevertheless Moses did not lack anything. You should know that after forty years he said to Moses (in Numb. 27:18, 20): <small>TAKE JOSHUA BEN NUN … AND PUT SOME OF YOUR GLORY UPON HIM</small>. Then what is written about Joshua (in Deut. 34:9)? <small>NOW JOSHUA BEN NUN WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM</small>. Why? (Ibid. cont.:) <small>BECAUSE MOSES HAD LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIM</small>. The Holy One said: In this world individuals have prophesied, but in the world to come all Israel shall become prophets. It is so stated (in Joel 3:1 [2:28]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS AFTERWARD THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH SO THAT YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">See also above Gen. 10:4; cf.

Siman 1

(Numb. 13:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&gt;: SEND MEN TO EXPLORE THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>. Thus did Rabbi Tanhuma bar Abba interpret. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 4:1; Numb. R. 16:1.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in Shab. 19a [bar.]): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go &lt;there&gt; while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for &lt;carrying out&gt; a commandment, it is permitted for &lt;such a&gt; one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for &lt; carrying out&gt; a commandment, and an agent for &lt;carrying out&gt; a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the Sukkah that they have taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:4): <small>AGENTS FOR &lt;CARRYING OUT&gt; A RELIGIOUS DUTY ARE EXEMPTED FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF&gt; THE SUKKAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Suk.</i> 25a (bar).</i> You have no one so dear to the Holy One as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. [Thus it is stated (in Josh. 2:1): <small>THEN &lt;JOSHUA BEN NUN&gt; SENT TWO SPIES &lt;FROM SHITTIM&gt; SECRETLY, SAYING:</small> &lt;….&gt; Who were they? Our masters have taught: These were Phinehas and Caleb. They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of <small>SECRETLY</small> (<i>heresh</i>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried: Here are pots. Whoever wants &lt;some&gt;, let him come and buy. &lt;Their disguise was&gt; so that no one would notice them. Do &lt;not&gt; read <small>&lt;SECRETLY</small> (<i>heresh</i>)&gt; in this &lt;verse but&gt; <small>POTS</small> (<i>heres</i>). &lt;They had made themselves out to be potters&gt; lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO THEY WENT AND CAME</small> {<small>UN</small>}<small>TO THE HOUSE OF A WOMAN WHO WAS A HARLOT</small> &lt; <small>WHOSE NAME WAS RAHAB&gt;</small>. She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to explore the land, as stated (in vs. 2): <small>BUT IT WAS TOLD THE KING OF JERICHO</small> [….] When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her: I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7): {<small>MOREOVER</small>} [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE, AND THEY SEEK TORAH FROM HIS MOUTH, BECAUSE HE IS A MESSENGER</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>OF THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. Now an angel desiring &lt;to be visible&gt; is visible; and one desiring &lt;to be invisible&gt; is not visible. But where is it shown that the prophets were called angels? Where it is stated (in Numb. 20:16): <small>AND HE SENT A MESSENGER</small> (<i>mal'akh</i>) <small>WHO BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT</small>. And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>). Now where is it shown that &lt;Rahab&gt; had only hidden Caleb? Where it is stated (in Josh. 2:4): <small>SO</small> [<small>THE WOMAN</small>] <small>TOOK THE TWO MEN AND CONCEALED <i>HIM</i></small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>him</i> is a literal translation of the Masoretic text.</i> &lt;This is&gt; to teach you how much these two righteous men risked themselves to fulfill their mission. But the agents whom Moses sent were wicked. {Thus it is stated} [Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter] (in Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND MEN &lt;TO EXPLORE THE LAND OF CANAAN</small> &gt;.

Immediately Caleb stood up and silenced all those hosts,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> as stated (in Numb. 13:30): <small>THEN CALEB HUSHED &lt;THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES&gt;…</small>.

Then he said to them: [Has the son of Amram only done this to us?] So they became silent in order to hear from him. He said to them (in Numb. 14:7): <small>THE LAND IS VERY VERY GOOD</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: I am exceedingly grateful to Caleb, as stated (in Deut. 1:36): <small>&lt;NONE&gt; EXCEPT CALEB BEN JEPHUNNEH. &lt;HE SHALL SEE IT, AND TO HIM I WILL GIVE THE LAND…</small>. &gt; What is the meaning of <small>EXCEPT</small> (<i><small>ZWLTY</small></i>)? <small>THIS MAN JOINING ME</small> (<i><small>ZH LWH 'TY</small></i>) is &lt;worth&gt; more than sixty myriads of you.

Thus it is stated (in Ps. 76:6 [5]): <small>THE STOUT-HEARTED WERE DESPOILED; &lt;THEY WERE ASLEEP IN THEIR SLUMBER; NOR DID ANY OF THE VALIANT MEN LIFT A HAND&gt;</small>. Why all this? Because they were foolish agents.

This king is the Holy One, and the friend is Abraham, as stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>THE SEED OF MY FRIEND ABRAHAM</small>. The Holy One said to him: Come with me, as stated (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO FROM YOUR LAND</small>. He made an agreement with him to give him a present, as stated (in Gen. 13:17): <small>ARISE, WALK ABOUT THE LAND</small> […], <small>FOR I AM GIVING IT TO YOU</small>. It also says (in vs. 15): <small>FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, TO YOU WILL I GIVE IT</small>, [<small>AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER</small>]. The Holy One said to Moses: Although I had agreed with the ancestors to give them the land, and even though they have died, I am not going back on &lt;my word&gt;.

Now you are calling these &lt;spies&gt; fools (in Prov. 26:6): <small>THE ONE WHO SENDS A MESSAGE THROUGH A FOOL!</small> But these were only called fools because they had uttered malicious slander against the land, as stated (in Prov. 10:18): <small>AND THE ONE WHO UTTERS SLANDER IS A FOOL</small>. But nevertheless they had &lt;once&gt; been great human beings, although they had made themselves foolish. So it is on account of them that Moses says (in Deut. 32:20): <small>FOR THEY ARE A PERVERSE GENERATION…</small>. Thus they were chosen from all of Israel at the command of the Holy One and at the command of Moses, as stated (in Deut. 1:23): <small>NOW THE PLAN SEEMED GOOD IN MY EYES; SO I TOOK &lt;TWELVE MEN</small> (<i>anashim</i>)&gt; <small>FROM YOU, &lt;ONE FOR EACH TRIBE&gt;</small>. {Where is it shown?} [Hence] you &lt;can&gt; say that they were righteous in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of Moses.

Because when they were chosen, &lt;they were&gt; righteous. [Then they changed.] It is therefore stated (in Numb. 13:2): <small>SEND PEOPLE</small> (<i>anashim</i>).

For that reason he put this &lt;story&gt; next to the one &lt;in which&gt; Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, because she had spoken &lt;slander&gt; against her brother. &lt;This affliction happened&gt; so that everyone would know the punishment for slander. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:1–16, which ends): <small>THEN AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE JOURNEYED FROM HAZEROTH</small><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Where they had waited seven days for Miriam to be cleansed from leprosy.</i> <small>AND ENCAMPED IN THE DESERT OF PARAN</small>. &lt;It was a warning&gt; so that if they came to speak slander, they would consider the episode of Miriam; but even so, they did not desire to learn. It is therefore stated (in Is. 44:18): <small>THEY NEITHER KNOW NOR UNDERSTAND</small>. Therefore the Holy One wrote &lt;about&gt; the sending out of the spies after the episode of Miriam.

Another interpetation (of Numb. 13:2:) <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND</small><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Again the midrash requires this more literal translation.</i> <small>&lt;MEN&gt;</small>. Even though the Holy One had said: <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &lt;MEN&gt;</small>, it was not &lt;the wish&gt; of the Holy One for them to go.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 4:5, cont.; see Numb. R. 16:7.</i> Why? Because the Holy One had already told them &lt;about&gt; the superiority of the land of Israel. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:7): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND</small>. And so it says (in Deut. 11:10–11): <small>FOR THE LAND INTO WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO POSSESS…. &lt;BUT THE LAND INTO WHICH YOU ARE CROSSING TO POSSESS IS A LAND OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS. IT DRINKS WATER FROM THE RAIN OF HEAVEN</small>.&gt; Moreover, while they had been in Egypt, he had said to them (in Exod. 3:8): <small>I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM &lt;OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP OUT OF THAT LAND&gt;</small> [<small>UNTO A GOOD &lt;AND SPACIOUS&gt; LAND….</small>] So what is the point of &lt;saying&gt; (in Numb. 13:2): <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &lt;MEN&gt;</small>? It is simply that they wanted these words. When they reached &lt;Israel's&gt; borders, Moses had said to them (in Deut. 1:21): <small>SEE, THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS SET THE LAND BEFORE YOU</small>. At that time Israel approached Moses, as stated (in vs. 22): <small>THEN YOU ALL DREW NEAR UNTO ME AND SAID: LET US SEND MEN &lt;AHEAD OF US TO EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US</small>&gt;…. This is what Ezra<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh.</i> 93b, which also alludes to the book of Nehemiah under the name of Ezra.</i> said (in Neh. 9:17): <small>SO THEY REFUSED TO LISTEN AND WERE UNMINDFUL OF</small> {<small>HIS</small>} [<small>YOUR</small>] <small>WONDERS…</small>. Now it says (in Numb. 10:33): <small>AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TRAVELED AHEAD OF THEM … TO SEEK OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM</small>. {However} [And] they said (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &lt;AHEAD OF US TO EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US&gt;…</small>. {Is it not that they did not believe in his Torah?} [It is simply that they did not believe in his Torah.] And similarly David said (in Ps. 78:22): <small>THEY DID NOT BELIEVE</small> {<small>IN HIS TORAH</small>} [<small>IN GOD</small>]…. R. Joshua says: To what were they comparable: To a king who secured for his son a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. The king said to him: I have secured you a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. There is no one like her in the whole world. The son said to him: Let me go to see her, for he did not believe in his father. Immediately the situation became ever more difficult for his father. His father said: What shall I do? If I say to him: I am not showing her to you, then he will say: She is ugly. For that reason he did not want to show her. Finally he said to him: Look at her, so that you may know that I have not deceived you. But because you did not believe in me, I swear that you shall not see her in your house. Instead I am giving her to your son. Now similarly did the Holy One say to Israel: &lt;The land&gt; is good, but they did not believe in him. They said (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &lt;AHEAD OF US&gt;</small>. The Holy One said: If I prevent them, they will say: The land is no good. For &lt;that reason&gt; he has not shown it to us. The Holy One said: They will only see it, for I swear that not one of them shall enter within it. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:23): <small>SURELY THEY SHALL NOT SEE THE LAND….</small> Instead I am giving it to their children.

[(Numb. 13:2:) <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND MEN</small>.] When they said to Moses (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &lt;AHEAD OF US&gt;</small>, Moses began to wonder. He said: It is impossible for me to do something before I consult with the Holy One. He went and consulted. He said to him: Your children want thus and so. The Holy One said to him: This is not the first time for them. While they were in Egypt, they jeered at me, as stated (in Hos. 7:16): <small>THIS WAS THEIR DERISION IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. They are accustomed to such &lt;behavior&gt;, needless to say.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. R. 16:8: “I have no need to test them.”</i> Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, &lt;AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: I know what they are [saying]; but if you want, [<small>YOU YOURSELF</small>] <small>SEND</small> [<small>MEN</small> on your] own. Where is it shown? Where it is written (in Numb. 13:16): <small>THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHOM MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND</small>.

The father is obligated to redeem his son. Similarly the Holy One did so for Israel.

OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL SET ASIDE A LOAF</small> (<i>hallah</i>) <small>AS AN OFFERING…</small>. Thus <i>hallah</i> &lt;is mentioned&gt; last, and libations first. For this reason R.

[The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>.] Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, did you tell me (in vs. 2): <small>PLEASE TAKE</small>, for no reason?

See, <small>&lt;YOUR SON&gt;</small> has already specified Isaac. &lt;So&gt; what is the meaning of <small>YOUR ONLY ONE</small>? Simply Abraham's life. Thus the soul is called <small>ONLY ONE</small>, where it is stated (in Ps. 22:21 [20]): <small>DELIVER MY LIFE FROM THE SWORD, MY ONLY ONE FROM THE POWER OF THE DOG</small>. Abraham said to the Holy One: Is it possible for me to go from here with no sacrifice? The Holy One said to Abraham: Here is your sacrifice. &lt;It has been&gt; prepared for you from the six days of creation.

At that time Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World: I am not moving from here until you swear to me that you will never test me again; for if, heaven forbid, I had not obeyed you, I should have destroyed whatever I had accomplished during my lifetime. R. Hanan said: The Holy One said to him: By your life, so it shall be; for if you had not obeyed me, you would have possessed nothing. At that time the Holy One swore to him that he would never test him again. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:16): <small>AND HE SAID: I BY MYSELF HAVE SWORN, SAYS THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life severe afflictions and other trials had been designated to come upon you, but now they shall not come.

R. 15, in Numb. 17:5, and in Buber’s “Spanish” manuscript (described on p. 150 of his “<i>Mavo</i>”), all of which speak here of Israel seeing the masculine “throne of glory, which is blue in appearance.” Cf. also <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 15:39 (115), where the argument is that the pronoun is <small>IT</small> (in the singular) and not <small>THEM</small> (in the plural) with reference to tassels.</i> (Vss. 39–40:) <small>THAT YOU MAY SEE…. SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER</small>. The seeing leads to remembering &lt;the commandments&gt;, and remembering leads to performing &lt;them&gt;. Thus it is stated (in vs. 40): <small>SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND PERFORM &lt;ALL MY COMMANDMENTS…</small>. &gt; Why? (Deut. 32:47): <small>BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TRIFLING THING FOR YOU</small>.

(Numb. 15:39:) <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT GO ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN HEART</small> [<small>AND YOUR OWN EYES THROUGH WHICH YOU LUST</small> (rt.: <i><small>ZNH</small></i>)]. The heart and the eyes are procurers for the body, in that they prostitute (rt.: <i><small>ZNH</small></i>) the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 4:15, cont.; Numb. R. 17:6.</i> [(vs. 40:) <small>SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND PERFORM ALL MY COMMANDMENTS:</small> &lt;The situation&gt; is comparable to a certain person who was thrown into the midst of the water. The helmsman<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kybernetes.</i></i> extended a rope to him. He said to him: Grab this rope with your hand, and do not let go of it; for if you do let go of it, you will lose your life. So also did the Holy One say to Israel. As long as you adhere to the commandments, &lt;the following holds true&gt; (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. And so it says (in Prov. 4:13): <small>HOLD ONTO DISCIPLINE; DO NOT SLACK OFF. KEEP IT FOR, IT IS YOUR LIFE</small>.
(Numb. 15:40, cont.:) <small>AND THAT YOU MAY BE HOLY</small>. When you perform the commandments, you are made holy, and fear of you &lt;comes&gt; over the nations. &lt;If&gt; you withdraw from the Torah, you become profaned. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world because of the evil drive, you withdraw from the commandments; in the age to come I am rooting it out of you. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:26–27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU. THEN I WILL MAKE YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES; AND YOU WILL OBSERVE MY ORDINANCES BY PERFORMING THEM</small>.

(Numb. 14:11:)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This supplement comes from <i>Codex Vaticanus, Ebr.</i> 34. It is found neither in Buber’s primary Oxford manuscript nor in the traditional version of the <i>Tanhuma.</i></i> <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME, AND HOW LONG WILL THEY HAVE NO FAITH IN ME</small> …? This text is related (to Prov. 1:25, 30): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT MY REBUKE</small> [….] <small>THEY HAVE DESPISED ALL MY REBUKE</small>. What is the implication of <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>? Simply that all the good which I planned for you, you have spoiled and spurned.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 16:24.</i> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED</small> (rt.: <i><small>PR</small></i>') <small>ALL MY PLAN</small>? At the beginning I said to Moses (in Exod. 3:8): <small>I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP &lt;OUT OF THAT LAND UNTO A GOOD AND SPACIOUS LAND&gt;….</small> But you did not act in the way &lt;I intended&gt;. Instead you came to the sea and immediately spoiled my plan, as stated (in Ps. 106:7): <small>THEY REBELLED AT THE SEA, AT THE REED SEA</small>. When you came to Mount Sinai, I descended and spoke with you. I brought down on your behalf thousands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads of angels, and I passed on two angels to each and every person in Israel. R. Johanan said: One to gird him with his weapons<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zone</i> (“<i>girdle</i>”).</i> and one to put a crown on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 2:9 and 8:7 (with the notes in those sections); also Lam. R. 2:13 (17); Cant. R. 4:4:1 PRK 16:3; <i>PR</i> 21:7; 33:10; M. Ps. 103:8.</i> R. Huna of Sepphoris said: He bound their weapons to them, while R. Simoy said: He clothed them in purple, as stated (in Ezek. 16:10): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERED GARMENTS</small>. R. Simeon b. Johay says: He clothed them with an instrument of weaponry with the Ineffable Name written upon it. Moreover, as long as it was in their hand, nothing evil had power against them, neither the angel of death nor anything else.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Exod. 9:12; Exod. R. 32:1; 41:7; 51:8; Lev. R. 18:3; cf. ‘<i>AZ</i> 5a.</i> But when they sinned, Moses had said to them (in Exod. 33:5): <small>NOW THEN, REMOVE YOUR ORNAMENTS</small> (i.e., your weapons) <small>FROM YOURSELVES, THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO TO YOU</small>. At that time (according to vs. 4): <small>WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS BAD NEWS, THEY WENT INTO MOURNING, &lt;AND NO ONE PUT HIS ORNAMENTS ON HIMSELF&gt;</small>. And what is written (in vs. 6)? <small>SO</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF ORNAMENTS…</small>. What had the Holy One done (at the giving of Torah)?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Exod. R. 32:1.</i> He had brought the angel of death and said to him: All the world is under your authority, except this people whom I have chosen for myself. R. Eleazar the Son of R. Jose the Galilean said: The angel of death said to the Holy One: Have I been created in the world for nothing?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 27.</i> The Holy One said to him: I created you so that you would destroy &lt;all&gt; the peoples of the world except this people, over whom you have no authority to take a single one of them. Look at the plan which the Holy One had devised concerning them for them to live and endure! Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. So also it says (in Exod. 32:16): <small>AND THE WRITING WAS THE WRITING OF GOD INSCRIBED</small> (<i>harut</i>) <small>ON THE TABLETS</small>. What is the meaning of <i>harut?</i> R. Judah says: <small>FREEDOM</small> (<i>herut</i>) from the empires; but R. Nehemiah says: <small>FREEDOM</small> (<i>herut</i>) from the angel of death; and our masters say: <small>FREEDOM</small> from afflictions. Look at the plan which the Holy One had devised for them! Then they immediately spoiled this plan after &lt;only&gt; forty days. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>.

Siman 2

[Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: The Holy One said to them: I had said that you would not sin. Instead you would live and endure like me, just as I live and endure forever and forevermore. (According to Ps. 82:6:) <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS; EVEN ALL OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH</small>. &lt;You are&gt; like the ministering angels who never taste death. Yet after this greatness you wanted to die (according to vs. 7): <small>INDEED YOU SHALL DIE LIKE A HUMAN</small> (<i>Adam</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; like the first Adam, to whom I decreed one commandment which he was to do, that he might live and endure forever, as stated (in Gen. 3:22): <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small> (<i>adam</i>) <small>HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US</small>. Similarly also (in Gen. 1:27): <small>AND GOD CREATED THE HUMAN</small> (<i>adam</i>) <small>IN HIS OWN IMAGE</small>, so that he would live and endure like himself. Yet he corrupted his works and nullified his decree, for he ate of the tree. Then I said to him (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. So also in your case (in Ps. 82:6), <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS</small>, but you corrupted your works as &lt;did&gt; Adam. Surely you shall die like Adam! And who made this happen to them? &lt;You, for&gt; (according to Prov. 1:25) <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>. (According to vs. 30:) <small>THEY HAVE DESPISED ALL MY REBUKE</small>. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small> …?

[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: This text is related (to Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR IT</small>? <small>WHEN I HOPED FOR IT TO PRODUCE GRAPES, WHY DID IT PRODUCE SOUR GRAPES</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The beginning of this section is not found in Numb. R.</i> The Holy One said: &lt;Consider&gt; what good things I have created within my world! Did I not make them for you? Yet with the very good that I made for you, you provoked me. I brought you out of Egypt. Then when I came to the sea, I made it as if it were full of clay.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 24:1; cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 4:13.</i> Thus it is stated (in Hab. 3:15): <small>YOU TROD THE SEA WITH YOUR HORSES, THE MORTAR OF MANY WATERS</small>. They walked in it and talked to each other. A certain Reubenite said: Where are we? Do you not know that he has brought us away from clay and bricks and returned us to clay? Thus it is stated (in Exod. 1:14): <small>AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER WITH HARD LABOR AT MORTAR AND BRICKS</small>. So similarly (in Hab. 3:15): <small>YOU TROD THE SEA WITH YOUR HORSES, THE MORTAR OF MANY WATERS</small>. The Holy One said to them: Yet with the good that I brought upon you, you provoked me. When they came to the desert, I brought the manna down to you for forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">With this sentence, the text again parallels Numb. R. 16:24.</i> Moreover, none of them had to ease nature for those forty years. Rather when they ate the manna, it &lt;simply&gt; became flesh for them, as stated (in Ps. 78:25, 27) <small>EACH ONE ATE THE BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small> (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>); [….<small>AND HE RAINED DOWN MEAT UPON THEM LIKE DUST…</small>.] When &lt;the manna&gt; became body members (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>) and flesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

Seeing for themselves that they did not have to go out &lt;to ease nature&gt; like &lt;other&gt; humans, they began saying to each other: Do you not know that we have had twenty days, even thirty [days], without easing nature? What is this? When a person does not ease nature for four or five days, does he not die or burst open? Now as for us, (according to Numb. 21:5), <small>OUR SOUL LOATHES THIS MISERABLE FOOD</small>. Why was it said to be <small>MISERABLE</small> (rt.: <i><small>QLL</small></i>)? Because it was light (rt.: <i><small>QLL</small></i>) within their bowels.
The Holy One said: In whatever &lt;way&gt; I did well for them, in &lt;that way&gt; they provoked me. It is so stated (in Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR &lt;IT</small>?&gt;…. The spies went and looked at the land. Now you find that wherever Israel goes they are recognized. It is so stated (in Is. 61:9): <small>ALL WHO SEE THEM SHALL RECOGNIZE THEM…</small>. However (in the case of the spies), the Holy One said: If they see them they will kill them. So what shall I do? In the case of each and every province into which the spies entered, the head of a province was afflicted with plague, or its king [was smitten with plague], in order that they would be occupied with bringing out their dead and not pay attention to the spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 4:13; below, Numb. 4a:10.</i> Thus they would not kill them. When they entered and looked at the land, they explored it &lt;and found&gt; that it was beautiful. Look at how well I treated them! Yet by this &lt;very land&gt; they provoked me. When they came to Moses and to Israel, What did they say (in Numb. 13:32)? <small>THE LAND THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED, IN ORDER TO EXPLORE IT, IS A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS…</small>. The Holy One began to cry out (in Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR IT</small>?….

Siman 4

[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: The Holy One said: I thought and hoped that you would become like the ancestors, of whom it is written (in Hos. 9:10): <small>I FOUND ISRAEL LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT; I SAW YOUR ANCESTORS AS THE FIRST FRUIT ON A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON</small>. I did not think that you would become like &lt;the inhabitants of&gt; Sodom, who were burned with fire. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:32): <small>FOR THEIR VINE IS FROM THE VINE OF SODOM, EVEN FROM THE FIELDS OF GOMORRAH</small>. [<small>THEIR GRAPES ARE GRAPES OF POISON…</small>.] (Is. 5:4:) <small>WHEN I HOPED FOR IT TO PRODUCE GRAPES, WHY DID IT PRODUCE SOUR GRAPES</small>? &lt;You have become&gt; like &lt;the inhabitants of&gt; Sodom, who were burned with fire. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?

Siman 5

[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?] Moses said to the Holy One: So what do you want? He said to him (in vs. 12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM. THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A NATION THAT IS GREATER AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN THEY</small>. Moses said to him (in vss. 13–14, 16): <small>WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HEAR &lt;WHAT HAPPENED&gt;, FOR YOU DID BRING THIS PEOPLE UP THROUGH YOUR POWER FROM THEIR MIDST, THEY WILL SAY UNTO THE INHABITANTS OF &lt;THIS&gt; LAND…. BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE &lt;INTO THE LAND&gt;…</small>. So would not the nations of the world say: The gods of Canaan are stronger than the gods of Egypt?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 16:25; cf. above, Numb. 4:24 and the note there; below, Numb. 4a:19.</i> Why? The gods of Egypt are of irrigated land, but those of Canaan are of &lt;land&gt; watered by rain (i.e., of <i>Ba'al</i>). (Numb. 14:14, 16:) <small>THEY WILL SAY UNTO THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND….. BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING &lt;THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND&gt;….</small> (Numb. 14:16:) <small>BECAUSE HE WAS NOT ABLE</small> (<i>yekholet</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; because he did not have the means to supply enough food, he brought them out to have them die in the desert. Now the word, <i>yekholet</i> can only refer to food, since it is stated (in I Kings 5:25 [11]): <small>AND SOLOMON GAVE HIRAM TWENTY THOUSAND MEASURES OF WHEAT AS FOOD</small> (<i>makkolet</i>) <small>FOR HIS HOUSEHOLD</small>.

Siman 6

Another interpretation: Lest the nations of the world say: He behaves like a brute with you. That is to say: When the generation of the flood came, he destroyed them with water, as stated (in Gen. 7:6): <small>WHEN THE FLOODWATERS CAME UPON THE EARTH</small>. And similarly, when the generation of the dispersion came, he destroyed them. And similarly, when the Egyptians came, he drowned them in water. And also in the case of these whom he has called (in Exod. 4:22) <small>ISRAEL, MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>, here he is destroying (<i>mekhalleh</i>) them! &lt;He is&gt; like that Lilith (<i>keLilit</i>). When she does not find anything else, she turns on children. So (in Numb. 14:16): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND WHICH HE HAS SWORN &lt;TO GIVE&gt; THEM, HE HAS SLAUGHTERED THEM IN THE DESERT</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the World, (according to vs. 14) <small>THAT YOU, O LORD, ARE SEEN FACE TO FACE</small> (literally: <small>EYE TO EYE</small>). What is the meaning of <small>THAT &lt;YOU&gt; … ARE SEEN EYE TO EYE</small> ('<i><small>YN B</small></i>'<i><small>YN</small></i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly Deut. R. 5:13.</i> R. Simeon ben Laqish said: See, the scales are balanced (rt.: '<i><small>YN</small></i>). You say (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>; but I am saying (in vs. 19): <small>PLEASE PARDON</small>. We shall see whose &lt;utterance&gt; will stand. The Holy One said to him: By your life, Moses, yours shall stand, while mine is null &lt;and void&gt;. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:20): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>. But nevertheless, the decree of the Holy One which he had uttered to Moses (in Numb. 14:12): <small>THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A NATION THAT IS GREATER AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN THEY</small>, &lt;that decree&gt; was not repealed. He raised up from him sixty myriads, and in the world to come the Holy One shall gather them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 49:12): <small>LOOK</small>! <small>THESE ARE COMING FROM AFAR. AND LOOK</small>! <small>THESE ARE FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE SEA</small> (i.e., <small>FROM THE WEST</small>), <small>AND THESE FROM THE LAND OF SINIM</small>. Moreover, the exiles shall come with them, also the tribes who are located beyond &lt;the River&gt; Sambatyon<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Sabbatikos</i> (“Sabbatical”).

R. 2:5 (9); <i>PR 31:10</i>; above, Gen. 10:17, it was beyond, or on an island in, this legendary river that at least some of the ten tribes were exiled. See also <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 9:33; Gen. R. 11:5, <i>PR</i> 23:8; according to which the river carried stones in its current during the whole week but rested on the Sabbath. See also Pliny, <i>HN</i> 31:18 (24); <i>Sanh.</i> 65b. Cf.

(Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION BE MURMURING AGAINST ME</small>? <small>&lt;I HAVE HEARD THE MURMURINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;…..</small> Let our master instruct us: When a baby has a stone in his hand on the Sabbath, is it permissible to pick him up on the Sabbath?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 16:26.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in Shab. 21:1): <small>A PERSON MAY PICK UP ONE'S CHILD, EVEN WITH A STONE IN HIS HAND, OR A BASKET</small> (of fruit), <small>EVEN WITH A STONE INSIDE IT</small>. You have learned from the generation of the wilderness that the Holy One, as it were, carried them up in the wilderness. (Deut. 1:31:) <small>AND IN THE WILDERNESS, WHERE YOU SAW HOW THE LORD YOUR GOD CARRIED YOU AS</small> {<small>THE PERSON</small>} [<small>ONE</small>] <small>CARRIES HIS CHILD</small>. Yet there was an object of idolatry in their hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Corresponding to the stone in the hand of the child.</i> Thus it is stated (in Neh. 9:18): <small>EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES A MOLTEN CALF…</small>. And so you find that, when they crossed in the sea, Micah's image (of Jud. 17:3–4) crossed with them, as stated (in Zech. 10:11): <small>AND A RIVAL WIFE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tsarah.</i> The Midrash understands the word in this sense, although most translations follow the other meaning of <i>tsarah,</i> i.e., “affliction,” “distress,” or the like.

He said to Moses: I have done a lot of good things with them; yet they are provoking me a lot. I parted the sea for them; they provoked me, as stated (in Pss. 106:7): <small>THEY REBELLED AT THE SEA</small>, [<small>AT THE</small>] <small>REED</small> [<small>SEA</small>]. I led them in the desert, but they provoked me there. And so it says (in Numb. 14:22): <small>THEY HAVE TRIED ME THESE TEN TIMES AND NOT HEARKENED TO MY VOICE</small>. Here also I told you to send them to explore the land, but they provoked me and brought a bad name upon it (i.e., upon the land). I am not able to endure. How long shall I endure them?

Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small> …?

However, through the very good which I did for them they spread slander. What did they say to Moses (in Numb. 13:32): <small>&lt;THE LAND … IS&gt; A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS…</small>. After all this good which I did for them, lest they be recognized by those on whom they were spying, with the result that they would catch them, when after all these things they spoke slander, I was tolerated them.

Siman 11

Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small> …? The Holy One said, as it were: Someone buys himself a servant, so that the servant may take the lantern<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>phanos.</i></i> and give light to the one who bought him; but I did not do so. Rather, though you are my servants, as stated (in Lev. 25:55): <small>FOR TO ME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE SERVANTS</small>, I have taken the lantern and given light to them, as stated (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT</small>.

Siman 13

Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27). By universal custom one buys himself a servant so that his servant will bake bread for him and so that his buyer may eat, but I did not do so. Rather, though you are my servants, I baked for you so that you might eat. It is so stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. And so it says (in Ps. 78:25): <small>EACH ONE ATE THE BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small>. After all these good things that I did for you, you provoke me. How long shall I endure &lt;you&gt;? (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &lt;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&gt;</small>?

[Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL &lt;THIS&gt; EVIL CONGREGATION &lt;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&gt;</small>?] The Holy One said to Moses: I am exterminating them from before me, for so it says (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Numb. 4:24.</i> Immediately Moses stood up to him by asking for mercy from the Holy One. How? When Israel made the calf, Moses stood up to him. At that time he made a plea on their behalf. He said to him: Please, make known to me by what principle you run your world. Thus it says this (in Exod. 33:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAYS KNOWN TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW YOU…</small>. The Holy One said to him: It is by the principle of mercy that I run my world, as stated (in Exod. 34:6): <small>AND THE LORD PASSED BY BEFORE HIM, AND PROCLAIMED: THE LORD, THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS AND TRUTH</small>. When Moses saw that the Holy One had said to him; <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>, he began saying to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, this is what you have said: <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>. Is this &lt;the way&gt; you are slowing your passion? The Holy One said to him: Even so, I am going to punish them. &lt;Moses&gt; did nothing, but when the Holy One wanted to destroy them here, where it is stated (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>, Moses stood up and asked for mercy before the Holy One, as he said to him: Please, are these the stipulations which you prescribed when you said: <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>? Fulfill your word here (in Numb. 14:17): <small>AND NOW, PLEASE LET THE POWER OF THE LORD INCREASE, EVEN AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN, SAYING</small>. Then what did &lt;the Holy One&gt; say (in vs. 18)? <small>THE LORD IS SLOW TO ANGER AND OF GREAT KINDNESS…</small>. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, in the case of a servant, if his deeds are good so that his master looks at him with a friendly face, one does not give his master any credit.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 16:28.</i> So when would they give him credit? When the servant's conduct is evil with his deeds being evil, and then his master looks at him with a friendly face. So also in your case, O Sovereign of the Universe, pay no attention to their stiff neck. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 9:27): <small>PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE STUBBORNNESS OF THIS PEOPLE NOR ITS WICKEDNESS NOR ITS SIN</small>. So the Holy One said to him: See, because of you I am forgiving them. It is so stated (in Numb. 14:20): <small>I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>.

Siman 1

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&gt; BETOOK HIMSELF</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED</small> (rt.: <i><small>PS</small>h</i>') <small>IS MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &lt;SUCH&gt; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. The <small>BROTHER OFFENDED</small> is Korah, in that he sided against Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:1; Numb. R. 18:1, 14.</i> So he rebelled and sank from whatever glory that he possessed. Now <small>OFFENDED</small> (rt: <i><small>PS</small>h</i>') can only imply rebellion, since it is stated (in II Kings 3:7): <small>THE KING OF MOAB HAS REBELLED</small> (<i><small>PS</small>h</i>') <small>AGAINST ME</small>. It also says (in II Kings 8:22): <small>THEN DID LIBNAH REBEL</small> (rt.: <i><small>PS</small>h</i>'). (Prov. 18:19:) <small>&lt;SUCH&gt; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. &lt;These words also refer to Korah,&gt; who sided (<i><small>PS</small>h</i>') against the Holy One and against Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary of Enoch Zundel on the parallel text in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:1. He would have the text read: “The earth raised its bars against him as &lt;if it were&gt; a castle.” This explanation is also given by Issachar Berman Ashkenazi in his commentary, <i>Mattenot Kehunnah,</i> on Numb. R. 18:1.</i>

Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:1): <small>&lt;NOW KORAH … &gt; TOOK</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this and some of the following sections, the midrash is explaining the fact that the transitive verb, <small>TOOK</small>, has no object. Biblical translations offer solutions such as translating the verb intransitively, e.g., <small>BETOOK HIMSELF</small>, or by supplying an object, e.g., <small>TOOK MEN</small>.</i> <small>TOOK</small> can only be a word for "attracting with persuasive words," in that he attracted all the leaders of Israel and the sanhedria &lt;to follow&gt; after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:1, cont.; Numb. R. 18:2.</i> Concerning Moses it is written (in Numb. 1:17): <small>SO MOSES AND AARON TOOK THESE MEN…</small>. And similarly it is written (in Numb. 20:25): <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SON &lt;ELEAZAR&gt;…</small>. Ergo (in Numb. 16:1) <small>NOW KORAH</small> &lt; … &gt; <small>TOOK</small>, in that he drew (i.e., took) their hearts with persuasive words.

Siman 3

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt; … &gt; BETOOK HIMSELF &lt;….&gt;</small> {Over} [Because of] what did he dissent? {Over} [Because of] Elizaphan, the son of his father's brother, who had been appointed prince (<i>nasi</i>) over his clan. So it says (in Numb. 3:30): <small>AND THE PRINCE OF THE ANCESTRAL HOUSE FOR THE KOHATHITE CLAN WAS ELIZAPHAN BEN UZZIEL</small>. Korah said: [Daddy was &lt;one of&gt;] four brothers. (According to Exod. 6:18:) <small>AND THE SONS OF KOHATH: AMRAM, IZHAR, HEBRON, AND UZZIEL</small>. As for Amram, the first-born, his son, Aaron attained the high priesthood; and his brother, Moses, &lt;attained&gt; the kingship. So who deserves to get second &lt;place&gt;? Should it not be the second &lt;son&gt;. (Exod. 6:18:) <small>AND THE SONS OF KOHATH: AMRAM, IZHAR, &lt;HEBRON, AND UZZIEL&gt;</small>. Now I am Izhar's son. I deserved to be prince of my clan, but he has appointed the son of Uzziel. Should the youngest of father's brothers become superior to me? See, I am dissenting and declaring everything invalid, whatever he had done. Therefore, there was dissent.

Siman 4

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt; … &gt; TOOK</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 15:37–38)?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:2; Numb. R. 18:3.</i> <small>&lt;THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING:&gt; SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [<small>AND TELL THEM</small>] <small>TO MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES</small>. Korah said to Moses our Master: Moses, in the case of a prayer shawl (<i>tallit</i>) which is all blue, what is the rule about it being exempt from &lt;having&gt; the tassel? Moses said to him: &lt;Such a prayer shawl&gt; is required to have the tassel. Korah said to him: Would not a prayer shawl which is all blue exempt itself, when four &lt;blue&gt; threads exempt it? In the case of a house which is full of &lt;scriptural&gt; books, what is the rule about it being exempt it from &lt;having&gt; the mezuzah (which contains only two passages of Scripture)? &lt;Moses&gt; said to him: &lt;Such a house&gt; is required to have the mezuzah. &lt;Korah&gt; said to him: Since the whole Torah has two hundred and seventy-five parashot in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yShab.</i> 16:1 (15c); <i>Soferim</i> 16:10; M. Pss. 22:19, according to which there are 175 parashot in the Torah where an expression of speaking, saying, or commanding occurs. See also <i>Alfa Beta deRabbi ‘Aqiva,</i> longer recension, <i>Tsade</i> (<i>Eisenstein, p. 421</i>).</i> and they do not exempt the house &lt;from having the mezuzah&gt;, would the two parashot which are in the mezuzah exempt the house? &lt;He also&gt; said to him: These are things about which you have not been commanded. Rather you are inventing them &lt;by taking them&gt; out of your own heart. Here is what is written (in Numb. 16:1): <small>&lt;NOW KORAH … &gt; TOOK</small>.

Siman 5

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt; … &gt; TOOK. NOW … TOOK</small> (rt.: <i><small>LQH</small></i>) can only be a word of discord, in that his heart carried him away (rt.: <i><small>LQH</small></i>). Thus is &lt;the word&gt; used (in Job 15:12): <small>HOW YOUR HEART HAS CARRIED YOU AWAY</small> (rt.: <i><small>LQH</small></i>). This explains what Moses said to them (in Numb. 16:9): <small>IS IT TOO SMALL A THING FOR YOU THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SEPARATED YOU &lt;FROM THE CONGREGATION TO DRAW YOU NEAR UNTO HIMSELF, TO PERFORM THE SERVICE OF THE LORD</small>'s <small>TABERNACLE&gt;</small> …? &lt;plus&gt; that whole passage up to (vs. 29:) <small>&lt;IF THESE PEOPLE DIE&gt; THE COMMON DEATH OF EVERY PERSON</small> &lt;….&gt; The sages have said: Korah was a great sage and was one of the bearers of the Ark, as stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO &lt;WAGONS&gt;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>. Now Korah was the son of Izhar, &lt;who was&gt; the son of Kohath. When Moses said (in Numb. 15:38): <small>AND PUT ON THE TASSEL OF EACH CORNER A THREAD OF BLUE</small>, what did he do? He immediately ordered them to make two hundred and fifty blue shawls for those two hundred and fifty heads of sanhedria who rose up against Moses to wrap themselves in, just as it is stated (in Numb. 16:2): <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES</small>, [<small>TOGETHER WITH MEN FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY &lt;PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION&gt;….</small>] Korah arose and made them a banquet at which they all wrapped themselves themselves in blue prayer shawls. &lt;When&gt; Aaron's sons came to receive their dues, &lt;namely&gt; breast and right thigh,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priestly share of the animals slaughtered for the feast. See Lev.7:31-32.</i> they arose against them and said to them: Who commanded you to receive such? &lt;The priests&gt; said: Moses. &lt;Korah's group&gt; replied and said: We shall not give you anything, because the Holy One has not commanded it. They came and informed Moses. He went to placate<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rt</i>.: PYS. See the Gk.: <i>peithein, peisai</i> in the aroist.</i> them. They immediately confronted him, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES</small>. And who were they? Elizur ben Shedeur and his companions, the men (according to Numb. 1:17) <small>WHO WERE MENTIONED BY NAME</small>. Although the text has not publicized<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>PRSM</i>. Cf. Gk: <i>parresiazesthai.</i></i> their &lt;names&gt;, it has given clues<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeia.</i></i> to their &lt; identity&gt;, so that you &lt;can&gt; identify them from the scriptural context. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a scion of good parentage who stole articles from the bathhouse. The owner of what was stolen did not want to publish his &lt;name&gt;, &lt;but&gt; he began to give clues to his &lt;identity&gt;. When they said to him: Who stole your articles? He said: A scion of good parentage, a tall person with beautiful teeth and beautiful hair. After he had given his clues, they knew who he was. So also here where the text has concealed them and not specified their names, it comes and gives clues to their &lt;identity&gt;. You know who they are. It is stated elsewhere (in Numb. 1:16): <small>THESE WERE ELECTED BY THE CONGREGATION, PRINCES OF THEIR ANCESTRAL TRIBES, HEADS OF THOUSANDS WITHIN ISRAEL</small>. Then it is written (in vs. 17): <small>SO MOSES AND AARON TOOK THESE MEN WHO WERE MENTIONED BY NAME</small>. Now here it is written (in Numb. 16:2): <small>PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION, ELECTED BY THE ASSEMBLY, MEN OF RENOWN</small>.

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt; … &gt; TOOK</small>. &lt;What&gt; he took &lt;was&gt; his prayer shawl, when he went to get counsel from his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:3; Numb.R. 18:4.</i> When the Holy One said (in Numb. 8:6–7): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND PURIFY THEM. NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU SHALL DO FOR THEM TO PURIFY THEM …, AND HAVE THEM PASS A RAZOR OVER ALL OF THEIR FLESH</small>. He immediately did so to Korah. He began to go around all Israel, but they did not recognize him. They said to him: Who did this to you? He told them: Moses. And not only that but taking me by my hands and by my feet, they waved me (like an offering). Then he said to me: See, you are purified. Moreover, he brought his brother Aaron, adorned him like a bride, and had him sit in the tent of meeting. The enemies of Moses immediately began to incite Israel against him. So they said: Moses is king, his brother Aaron is high priest, and his children are deputy high priests! The priest has a priestly offering (<i>terumah</i>); the priest has a priestly offering from the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ter</i>. 4:1.</i>; the priest has twenty-four priestly gifts!<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>THal</i>. 2:7-10 for a listing.</i> Immediately (in Numb. 16:3) <small>THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON, AND THEY SAID UNTO THEM: YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR</small> (<i><small>RB</small></i>), <small>FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY, EVERY ONE OF THEM, AND THE LORD IS IN THE MIDST OF THEM. SO WHY DO YOU ELEVATE YOURSELVES OVER THE COMMUNITY OF THE LORD</small>? R. Levi said: At that very time Korah gathered his company and said to them (i.e., to Moses and Aaron): You have increased (rt.: <i><small>RBH</small></i>) the burden upon us to be more than the slavery of Egypt. We were better off under the Egyptians than under your authority, for in each and every year fifteen thousand and forty-five of us die.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As the yearly punishment for the sin of the spies amortized over forty years, during which a whole generation Israelites died in the desert (Numb. 14:20–24.)</i> Now they wished to stone him; therefore (according to vs. 4), <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS, HE FELL ON HIS FACE</small>. Moses said to them: I do not desire kingship, nor does Aaron &lt;desire&gt; high priesthood. Thus it is stated (in vs. 11): <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU SHOULD MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>? Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the world, did you not command me thus (in Exod. 28:1): <small>AND YOU SHALL BRING NEAR UNTO YOURSELF &lt;YOUR BROTHER AARON AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM,… TO SERVE ME AS PRIESTS&gt;</small>? Now they have arisen against us to kill us. He said to him (in Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN &lt;THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM….&gt;</small> {From where?} [What does this mean?] R. Nathan said: The Holy One said: If all the magicians of the world gathered together and tried to turn the morning into the evening, they would be unable &lt;to do so&gt;; but just as I &lt;formerly&gt; separated the light and the darkness (in Gen. 1:4), so have I separated out Aaron to sanctify him as most holy. Immediately (in Numb. 16:12): <small>THEN MOSES SENT TO SUMMON DATHAN AND ABIRAM, SONS OF ELIAB, BUT THEY SAID: WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. "We will not go" or "We will not come" is not written here, but <small>WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. (Prov. 18:17:) <small>A FOOL</small>'s <small>MOUTH IS HIS RUIN</small>! They opened their mouth about descending by saying that ascent was not for them. Just as they spoke, so did they die (according to Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. Moses said: In as much as they did not want to come &lt;to me&gt;, I shall go to them. Perhaps they will be ashamed and repent. It is so stated (in Numb. 16:25): <small>THEN MOSES AROSE AND WENT UNTO DATHAN AND ABIRAM</small>. When they saw him they began to reproach and revile &lt;him&gt;, as stated (in vs. 27): <small>AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM CAME OUT STANDING</small> (rt.: <i><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></i>). Does one go out sitting, kneeling, or lying prostrate?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that to mention that Dathan and Abiram were standing seems unnecessary and therefore implies some deeper meaning.</i> It is simply that they went out reproaching and reviling &lt;Moses&gt;. Going out and standing upright (rt.: <i><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) is mentioned here. Now going out and standing upright (rt.: <i><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) is mentioned below in reference to Goliath the Philistine, where it is written (in I Sam. 17:4, 16): <small>AND THERE WENT OUT A CHAMPION &lt;FROM THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES</small> [….] <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING, AND HE TOOK HIS STAND</small> (rt.: <i><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) <small>FOR FORTY DAYS</small>. Just as going out and standing upright (rt.: <i><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) involved reproaching and reviling in that case,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The reproaching and reviling is specifically mentioned in I Sam.17:8-10.</i> so also in this case did going out and standing upright (rt.: <i><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) involve reproaching and reviling. Moses therefore began by saying (in Numb. 16:29, 32): <small>IF &lt;THESE PEOPLE DIE&gt; THE COMMON DEATH OF EVERY PERSON…. AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH &lt;AND SWALLOWED THEM&gt;….</small> Come and see how harmful dissension must be! Whenever anyone foments dissension, the Holy One eradicates his memory. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:35): <small>AND A FIRE WENT FORTH FROM THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN &lt;COFFERING THE INCENSE&gt;</small>. R. Berekhyah said: How harmful dissension must be! An emissary of the court on high only imposes a penalty<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>QNS</i>; cf. Lat.: <i>censere</i>, which can mean “to tax.”</i> &lt;on people&gt; from the age of twenty years, while the court below &lt;only imposes a penalty &gt; from the age of thirteen years. In the case of Korah's dissension, however, one-day-old babies were burned and swallowed up in nethermost Sheol. Thus it is written (in Numb. 16:27, 33): <small>&lt;AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM CAME OUT STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR TENTS &lt;WITH THEIR WIVES, THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR LITTLE ONES &lt;….&gt; SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. It is therefore stated (Numb. 16:1): <small>NOW KORAH &lt; … &gt; TOOK</small>.

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BETOOK HIMSELF</small>. But there is not written "ben Jacob" &lt;or&gt; "ben Israel."<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:4; Numb.R. 18:5; cf.Gen.R. 98:5.</i> This text is related (to Gen. 49:6): <small>LET NOT MY SOUL COME INTO THEIR COUNCIL</small>, i.e., that of the spies. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND LET NOT MY GLORY BE JOINED WITH THEIR CONGREGATION</small>, i.e., that of Korah. Jacob said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, with reference to the spies and with reference to the dissension of Korah, let not my name be mentioned [in connection with] those evil men, who are going to cause provocation. So when should my name (Israel) be joined &lt;with these rebels&gt;? When they are joined together to stand on the dais (as Levitical singers). (I Chron. 6:16, 22–23 [31, 37–38]:) <small>&lt;THESE ARE THE ONES WHOM DAVID PUT IN CHARGE OF SONG IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD…. &gt; BEN ASSIR BEN EBIASAPH BEN KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BEN ISRAEL</small>.

(Numb. 16:1, cont.:) <small>ALONG WITH DATHAN AND ABIRAM</small>. From here they derived the saying: Woe to the wicked one, &lt;and&gt; woe to his neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:4, cont.; Numb.R. 18:5, cont.; see <i>Neg.</i> 12:6; <i>Sifra</i> to Lev.14:40 (157: <i>Metsora</i>‘, pereq 4); <i>ARN</i>, A, 9; cf. <i>ARN</i>, B, 16; Numb.R. 3:12; <i>Suk.</i> 56b; above, Numb.1:13.</i> &lt;What is&gt; good for a righteous person is good for his neighbor. Because Dathan and Abiram were neighbors of Korah, who was dwelling to the south (of the Tabernacle), as stated (in Numb. 3:29): <small>THE FAMILIES OF THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH WERE TO CAMP &lt; ALONG THE SIDE OF THE TABERNACLE TO THE SOUTH&gt;</small>. The standard of Reuben was near them, [as stated] (in Numb. 2:10): <small>THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF REUBEN SHALL BE TO THE SOUTH</small>. However, the standard of Judah was in the east, and with him were Issachar and Zebulun, [as stated] (in Numb. 2:3): <small>NOW THESE CAMPING IN FRONT TO THE EAST SHALL BE &lt;THOSE UNDER&gt; THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF JUDAH</small>. And near them were Moses, Aaron, and his children, [as stated (in Numb. 3:38): <small>THOSE WHO CAMPED BEFORE THE TABERNACLE, IN FRONT BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING TO THE EAST, WERE MOSES, AARON, AND HIS CHILDREN</small>.] Because these were near the Torah, they were therefore worthy to be Torah scholars, as written (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>JUDAH IS MY LAWGIVER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mehoqeq.</i> Most translations render the word as scepter, since kingship was what Judah actually attained.</i> [It is also written] (in I Chron. 12:33 [32]): <small>AND FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISSACHAR, THOSE WHO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES</small>. [And it is written] (in Jud. 5:14): <small>AND FROM ZEBULON THOSE WHO WIELD THE SCRIBAL PEN</small>. But because Dathan and Abiram were neighbors to Korah, a master of dissension, they received &lt;their due&gt; and perished from the world.

Siman 9

(Numb. 16:19): <small>AND KORAH GATHERED &lt;THE WHOLE COMMUNITY&gt; AGAINST THEM</small>. He said to them (in Numb. 16:3): <small>&lt;YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR,&gt; FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY, EVERY ONE OF THEM</small>, [<small>AND THE LORD IS IN THE MIDST OF THEM</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:4, cont.; Numb.R. 18:6.</i> Moreover, every one of them heard on Sinai (in Exod. 20:2 = Deut. 5:6): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. (Numb. 16:3, cont.:) <small>SO WHY DO YOU ELEVATE YOURSELVES</small>? Immediately Moses trembled, because it was already the fourth transgression on their hands. It is comparable to a king's son who had transgressed against his father. Now his friend effected a reconciliation with him once,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PSY</i>. See the Gk.: <i>peithein, peisai</i> in the aorist.</i> twice, and three times. When he transgressed a fourth time, the king's friend became discouraged. He said: How many times shall I bother the king. So also &lt;it was with&gt; Moses. They had sinned with the calf, <small>AND</small> (according to Exod. 32:11) <small>MOSES IMPLORED &lt;THE LORD HIS GOD&gt;</small>. In the case of the murmurers, (according to Numb. 11:2) <small>MOSES PRAYED UNTO THE LORD</small>. [In the case of the spies, (according to Numb. 14:13): <small>MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD</small>:] <small>WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HEAR &lt;WHAT HAPPENED&gt;….:</small> In the case of Korah's dissension, he became discouraged. He said: How often can I bother the Omnipresent? Therefore (in Numb. 16:4): <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS, HE FELL ON HIS FACE</small>.

Siman 10

(Numb. 16:5:) <small>THEN HE SPOKE UNTO KORAH AND UNTO HIS WHOLE COMPANY, SAYING: IN THE MORNING</small> [<small>THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM</small>]. What reason did he have for saying: <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:5; Numb.R. 18:7.</i> Moses said: Perhaps they said this thing because they had been eating and drinking. He therefore said: <small>IN THE MORNING</small>. Perhaps between now and then they will repent. He said to them: [I] have no authority to enter &lt;the Tabernacle &gt; now. In his presence there is no eating and no drinking. It is simply that &lt;we are forbidden to enter&gt; because we have taken food and drink.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING</small>. Moses said: the Holy One has distinguished boundaries for those in his world. Can you confuse morning with evening? And that is what is written in the beginning (in Gen. 1:5): <small>THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING. AND</small> (in vs. 4) <small>GOD SEPARATED THE LIGHT AND THE DARKNESS</small>, as a service to the world. And just as he made a separation between the light and the darkness, so did he separate Israel from the nations, [as stated] (in Lev. 20:26): <small>I HAVE SEPARATED YOU FROM THE &lt;OTHER&gt; PEOPLES &lt;TO BE MINE&gt;</small>. So also did he separate Aaron, [as stated (in I Chron. 23:13): <small>AARON WAS SEPARATED</small>] <small>TO CONSECRATE THE MOST HOLY THINGS, HE AND HIS SONS &lt;FOREVER&gt;</small>. If you can confuse those distinctions in which he made a separation between the day and the night, you may be able to nullify this. For this reason he said to them (in Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM</small>. Such a one is already designated. (According to ibid., end) <small>THE ONE WHOM HE WILL CHOOSE HE WILL HAVE DRAW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>.

(Numb. 16:6–7:) <small>DO THIS: TAKE CENSERS</small>, [<small>KORAH AND ALL HIS</small> (<i>sic</i>) <small>COMPANY</small>]; <small>AND PUT FIRE IN THEM</small>. What was his reason for saying this to them?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:5, cont.; Numb.

Do they all assemble in one house?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel, <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:5, which adds a negative: “And they all do not assemble in one house.” The point here is that, because they worship different deities, which would have separate shrines, idol priests would function in these various shrines.</i> Now as for me, I only have one God, one Torah, one justice, one altar, and one high priest; but you two hundred and fifty men are seeking high priesthood! I also am willing in this regard. (Numb. 16:11:) <small>THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>. (Numb. 16:6:) <small>DO THIS: TAKE CENSERS</small>. Here you have a ministry more precious than all the others. It is the incense, the most precious of the sacrifices. But a deadly poison had been put within it, through which Nadab and Abihu were burned. He therefore warned them (in vs. 7): <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE…</small>. That one already has his sanctification. <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES</small> is already the one. Whomever <small>THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE</small>. It is simply that Moses said to them: See, I am telling you that you are not to incur guilt on your two hundred and fifty souls, because when you sacrifice, &lt;only&gt; the one to be chosen from among you shall come out alive, and all &lt;the rest&gt; of you shall perish.

Were they not fools, in that when he gave them this warning, they took it upon themselves &lt;to offer sacrifice&gt;?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The bracketed words of explanation occur in the parallel accounts of <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:12; Numb. 18:8.</i> They had sinned against their own lives, as stated (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): <small>THE CENSERS OF THESE WHO HAVE SINNED AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES</small>. Now since Korah was a clever man, how did he see fit to commit this folly? It is simply that his eyes misled him. He foresaw a great lineage stemming from himself, &lt;e.g.,&gt; Samuel, who was the equivalent of Moses and Aaron. Moreover, the twenty-four &lt;Levitical&gt; courses would stem from his sons, all of whom would prophesy by the Holy Spirit, [as stated] (in I Chron. 25:5): <small>ALL THESE WERE SONS OF HEMAN</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A descendant of Korah.</i> <small>THE KING'S SEER IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO GOD FOR HIS GREATER GLORY</small>. He said: Is is possible that, when this greatness is going to stem from me, I should perish? But he did not foresee correctly, since his children would repent, and those &lt; great ones&gt; would stem from them. Thus did he foresee.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The two parallels read: “But Moses did foresee this.”</i> He therefore acted the fool in going against that statute, when he heard from the mouth of Moses that they all would perish but one would escape. (Numb. 16:7:) <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE</small>.

Siman 13

(Numb. 16:8:) <small>SO MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH: PLEASE LISTEN, YOU CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. When you have someone speaking with Joseph, does he tell Simon to Listen?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:6; Numb.R. 18:9. The midrash is concerned with the fact that Moses addresses the children of Levi when speaking to Korah.</i> Some say that he wished him to reconsider. So he said gentle words to him. When he saw that he did not listen to him, he said (to himself): Before others associate themselves with him, they should reconsider. He began to urge them (in Numb. 16:8): <small>PLEASE LISTEN, YOU CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. Is the honor that you have too little? (Vs. 9:) <small>IS IT TOO SMALL A THING FOR YOU</small> …? He turned again to Korah (in vs. 10): <small>THAT HE HAS HAD YOU APPROACH HIM AND ALL YOUR BROTHER LEVITES ALONG WITH YOU</small>? &lt;It was&gt; because he was the head person in the tribe, that his brothers had become an extension of himself.

Siman 14

(Numb. 16:11:) <small>THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>. Is this dissension which you are creating against us? Is it not rather against the Holy One? It is comparable to a king who had a lot of slaves. He wanted to make one of them a freedman and give him the &lt;centurion's&gt; rod.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In imperial Rome the emperor’s freedmen were habitually given positions of power.</i> He went further and made him &lt;one of the&gt; senators.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sinqelitin</i>: Gk.: <i>syngkletoi.</i></i> His companions rose up against him. If he had made himself a freedman and taken this dignity for himself, it would have been well for them to rise up against him. Now that his master has acted for him, when anyone rises against him, is not such a one rising up against his master? So also did Moses say to them: If my brother Aaron had taken the priesthood for himself, it would have been well for you to murmur against him. &lt;Since&gt; the one who gave it to him was the Holy One, to whom belong royalty and high office, whenever someone rises against my brother Aaron, is he not taking sides against the Holy One? It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11): <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>? Come and see the piety of Aaron the Righteous! When Moses poured the anointing oil upon Aaron, Aaron trembled with fear. He said to his brother Moses: Perhaps I was not worthy to be anointed with the anointing oil; for I may have acted fraudulently and become liable to excision, since it is stated (in Exod. 30:32): <small>UPON HUMAN FLESH IT SHALL NOT BE POURED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 3:6; M. Pss. 133:1.</i> Therefore, the Holy One has testified over him (in Ps. 133:1–3): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND PLEASANT IT IS … ! IT IS LIKE THE PRECIOUS OIL</small> [<small>UPON THE HEAD</small>] <small>RUNNING DOWN ONTO THE BEARD, THE BEARD OF AARON …; LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON…</small>. &lt;Scripture&gt; has compared the anointing oil with the dew of Hermon. As the dew of Hermon has no &lt;rules concerning&gt; fraudulent use, nether does the anointing oil that was on the head of Aaron have &lt;rules concerning&gt; fraudulent use. It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11): <small>&lt;THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY&gt; HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>.

Siman 15

[(Numb. 16:11, cont.:) <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>?] With all these words Moses &lt;tried to&gt; appease Korah, but you do not find that he gave him any answer. Because he was clever in his wickedness, he said &lt;to himself&gt;: If I answer him, I know that, since he has great wisdom, he will now overwhelm me with his words and seduce me into being reconciled with him against my will. It is better that I not respond to him. When Moses saw that there was nothing to be gained with him, he withdrew from him. (Numb. 16:12:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT TO SUMMON DATHAN AND ABIRAM &lt;SONS OF ELIAB&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 18:10.</i> They also persisted in their wickedness and did not care to answer him. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THEY SAID: WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. Their &lt;very&gt; mouths tripped up &lt;these&gt; wicked men, for a covenant was made on &lt;their&gt; lips. So they went down to Sheol, as stated (in Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. After they had gone down alive to sheol, they died.

Siman 16

(Numb. 16:13:) <small>IS IT SO SMALL A MATTER THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT US UP &lt;FROM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY TO KILL US IN THE DESERT, THAT YOU MUST ALSO LORD IT OVER US&gt;</small>? On what basis do you assume superiority over us? What good have you done with us? You brought us out of the land of Egypt, which was (according to Gen. 13:10) <small>LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD</small>; but you have not brought us into the land of Canaan. Rather here we are dying in the desert, where the plague is sent among us every day. (Numb. 16:14:) <small>WOULD YOU PUT OUT THE EYES OF THESE PEOPLE</small>? <small>WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>.

Siman 17

(Numb. 16:15:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS VERY ANGRY</small>. Why was he upset? Because a person who argues with his companion reasons with him. When he answers him, he has peace of mind; but if he does not answer him, then this involves great anguish.

Siman 18

(Numb. 16:15, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO THE LORD: PAY NO ATTENTION UNTO THEIR MEAL OFFERING</small>. Do not receive them in repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:7; Numb. R. 18:10, cont.</i> Should Scripture have said: "Pay no attention unto their liturgical service"? What is the meaning of <small>MEAL OFFERING</small>? This is what Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, I know that these have a share in this meal offering that &lt;Israel&gt; has presented,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The singular verb that the Buber text has here is obviously a misprint, since Buber himself cites the passage with a plural verb in note 66 of his edition. “Israel,” as the implied subject, is found written in both parallel texts listed in the previous note.</i> [since it is stated] (in Numb. 29:22, 28, and 38): <small>IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING, ITS MEAL OFFERING, AND ITS DRINK OFFERING</small>; and it was presented &lt;as an offering&gt; of what belonged to all Israel (including sinners). In as much as these have withdrawn from your children, do not pay attention to their portion. The fire will leave it alone and not consume it.

Siman 19

(Numb. 16:15, cont.:) &lt;Moses continued:&gt; <small>I HAVE NOT TAKEN ONE DONKEY FROM THEM</small>. That which I had a right to take I did not take. By universal custom, one who works in the sanctuary receives wages from the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See I Corinthians 9:13.</i> &lt;In my case, however,&gt; when I went down from Midian to Egypt I had a right to take a donkey from them, since it was on behalf of their needs that I was going down &lt;there&gt;; but I did not take &lt;one&gt;. Similarly also did Samuel the Righteous say (in I Sam. 12:3): <small>HERE AM I</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the Masoretic Text. Buber’s <small>HERE ARE WE</small> is almost certainly in error.</i> <small>TESTIFY AGAINST ME BEFORE THE LORD AND BEFORE HIS ANOINTED. WHOSE OX HAVE I TAKEN</small>? <small>OR WHOSE DONKEY HAVE I TAKEN</small>? When I sacrificed an ox for their offerings to seek mercy for them and likewise for anointing a king over them, it belonged to me, as stated (in I Sam. 16:2): <small>TAKE A HEIFER WITH YOU…</small>. And similarly it says (in I Sam. 9:12): <small>BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE A SACRIFICE TODAY AT THE HIGH PLACE</small>. But I took nothing from what belonged to them. Also when I went back to handle their lawsuits and their &lt;other&gt; needs, and when I made the circuit of the cities, as stated (in I Sam. 7:16): <small>AND HE WENT &lt;ON A CIRCUIT&gt; YEAR BY YEAR &lt;TO BETHEL, GILGAL, AND MIZPAH; AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL IN ALL THOSE PLACES</small>, although&gt; by universal custom litigants go to the judge, I went around from city to city and from place to place.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is also making a point that he traveled on his own donkey.</i> Now even Moses said to Israel (in Exod. 18:16): <small>WHEN THEY HAVE A MATTER, IT COMES UNTO ME</small>. But I (Samuel) did not act in this way. Instead I took the trouble to go to them. (Numb. 16:15, cont.:) <small>AND I HAVE NOT HARMED A SINGLE ONE OF THEM</small>, in that I neither convicted the innocent nor acquitted the guilty. When Moses saw that they continued in their pride and in their rebellious acts, <small>THEN</small> (according to Numb. 16:16–18) <small>MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH: &lt;TOMORROW&gt; YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY &lt;ARE TO BE PRESENT BEFORE THE LORD: YOU, THEY, AND AARON &gt;; AND LET EACH ONE TAKE HIS CENSER…. SO EACH ONE TOOK HIS CENSER…</small>. Then Korah went about all that night and led Israel astray. Now he would say to them: What do you suppose? That I am busy obtaining greatness for myself? I wish for greatness to go the rounds to all of us, while Moses has taken greatness for himself and has given the high priesthood to his brother Aaron as an eternal statute.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Numb. 5a:2.</i> So did he go about seducing each and every tribe as it suited him, until they took his side. How is it shown? Because when (according to vs. 19) they entered and came with him, immediately (we read in Numb. 16:20–22): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &lt;UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING&gt;: SEPARATE YOURSELVES &lt;FROM THE MIDST OF THIS CONGREGATION, SO THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM IN A MOMENT&gt;. BUT THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES AND SAID: O GOD, THE GOD OF ALL HUMAN SPIRITS, &lt;SHALL ONE PERSON SIN AND YOU BECOME ANGRY WITH THE WHOLE CONGREGATION&gt;</small>? They said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:7, cont.; Numb. R. 18:11.</i> Sovereign of the World, in the case of a king, when a province rebels against him, when they persist in cursing the king or his deputies, ten or twenty of them, he sends out his legions<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legiones</i>.</i> and carries out reprisals<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>androlempsia</i> (=<i>androlepsia</i>).</i> against it. So he kills the good with the evil, because he does not know who among them has rebelled and who has not rebelled, who has honored the king and who has cursed him. You, however, know the thoughts of every person, even what the hearts and the reins counsel. So you know who has sinned and who has not sinned, for you know the spirit of each and every person. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:22): <small>O GOD, THE GOD OF ALL HUMAN SPIRITS</small>. The Holy one said to them: You have spoken well. I am making the matter known, who has sinned and who has not sinned.

Siman 20

(Numb. 16:23–24:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE</small> […:] <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CONGREGATION, SAYING: GET AWAY FROM ABOUT &lt;THE DWELLINGS OF KORAH, DATHAN, AND ABIRAM&gt;</small>. Although Moses heard it from the mouth of the Almighty,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:8; Numb. R. 18:12.</i> he did not tell them to get away until he had gone and warned them, as stated (in vs. 25): <small>THEN MOSES AROSE AND WENT &lt;UNTO DATHAN AND ABIRAM&gt;</small>. &lt;This serves&gt; to make their wickedness known, for although Moses went to them on foot, the&lt;se&gt; wicked ones were too stubborn to make amends. What did they do? They were unwilling to come out of their tents to face him. When Moses saw this, he said: This much &lt;only&gt; it was incumbent upon me to do.

Siman 21

[(Numb. 16:26:) <small>PLEASE MOVE AWAY FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED PEOPLE</small>.] Our masters have taught: Four &lt; types of people &gt; are called wicked:<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:8, cont.; Numb. R. 18:12, cont.; cf. <i>PRK</i> 30 (p.190b in Buber text; “Additional Piska” 28:2 in Braude’s translation).</i>

        <br>The one who extends his hand against his companion to strike him. Even though he did not &lt;actually&gt; strike him, he is called wicked, as stated (in Exod. 2:13): <small>SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE: WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verb in accord with post-biblical usage and is stressing the fact that the tense is future. So also <i>Sanh.</i> 58b; Rashi on Exod.2:13.</i> <small>YOUR COMRADE</small>? "&lt;Why&gt; did you strike?" is not stated here but <small>WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE</small>?
        <br>The one who borrows and does not repay, as stated (in Ps. 37:21): <small>THE WICKED PERSON BORROWS BUT DOES NOT REPAY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 2:9.</i>
        <br>[Also the one who has an insolent face but does not feel shame from someone greater than himself, as stated (Prov. 21:29): <small>A WICKED PERSON PUTS ON A BRAZEN FACE</small>.]
        <br>And the one who is the author of dissension, as stated (in Numb. 16:26): <small>PLEASE MOVE AWAY FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED</small> [<small>PEOPLE</small>].
    
Now two &lt;of these traits&gt; were in Dathan and Abiram, &lt;i.e.,&gt; an insolent face and dissension (<i><small>MHLQT</small></i>). <i><small>MHLQT</small></i> ("dissension") is interpreted through its letters. <i><small>M</small></i> is for <i>makkah</i> ("striking"); <i><small>H</small></i> is for <i>herem</i> ("destruction"); <i><small>L</small></i> is for <i>liqquy</i> ("blemish"); <i><small>Q</small></i> is for <i>qelalah</i> ("curse"); and <i><small>T</small></i> is for <i>to</i> '<i>evah</i> ("<i>abomination</i>"). <i>But some say</i> &lt;<i>that <small>T</small></i> stands for&gt; <i>takhlit</i> ("end"), &lt;since dissension&gt; brings annihilation to the world.

Siman 22

(Numb. 16:27:) <small>SO THEY GOT AWAY FROM THE DWELLINGS OF KORAH, &lt;DATHAN, AND ABIRAM&gt;</small>. When they saw this, how that Israel had moved away from round about them, they came out uttering abusive language, as stated (ibid., cont.) <small>&lt;THEY&gt; CAME OUT STANDING</small> (rt.: <i><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></i>). Now &lt;it is stated&gt; elsewhere (in I Sam 17:16): <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING; &lt;AND HE TOOK HIS STAND</small> (rt.: <i><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></i>) <small>FOR FORTY DAYS&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">On Goliath reviling Israel, see I Sam. 17:8-10.</i> Moses began by saying (in Numb. 16:28): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME…</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Below, Numb. 5a:2.</i> To the <i>shoshbin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the bridal agent who guarded her interests at the consummation of the marriage.</i> of a king's daughter in whose hands lay the testimonials of her &lt;virginity&gt;. When one of the banqueters stood up before him. He cursed the <i>shoshbin,</i> [and said:] The king's daughter has no virginity, the <i>shoshbin</i> arose in the presence of the king and said to him: [If] you do not have this person brought out in order to execute him in everyone's presence, I shall say: Of course the king's daughter has no virginity. Immediately the King said: It is better for me to kill this person, so that the <i>shoshbin</i> will not give out a bad name concerning my daughter. Similarly Korah contended with Moses and said: It was in his own heart and on his own that Moses had said all these things. He began by saying (in Numb. 16:28–29): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME &lt;….&gt; IF &lt;THESE&gt; DIE A NATURAL DEATH</small>, then I also am saying (ibid., cont.): <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>, and I have spoken from my own heart.

Siman 23

(Numb. 16:31:) <small>THEN IT CAME TO PASS, AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING</small> […], <small>THAT THE GROUND UNDER THEM WAS SPLIT APART</small>, since he causes retribution to spring up from any place that he wants.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:9; Numb. R. 18:19.</i>
(Numb. 16:33:) <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN &lt; ALIVE INTO SHEOL&gt;…</small>. Some say they are alive and being punished up to the present.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN THE EARTH CLOSED OVER THEM</small>. They perished but not their offices; indeed, other ministers were appointed in their stead.
(Numb. 16:34:) <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL, SINCE THEY WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM, FLED AT THEIR CRY</small>; so that they cried out to Moses: Moses our Master, save us!
(Numb. 16:35:) <small>AND A FIRE WENT FORTH FROM THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN OFFERING THE INCENSE</small>. The other ones had been swallowed up, but these were burned; and Korah stood among those who were burned, as Moses had said (in Numb. 16:17): <small>YOU ALSO AND AARON, EACH HIS CENSER</small>. Moreover, Korah received more &lt;punishment&gt; than all of them, in that he was &lt;both&gt; burned and swallowed up. And why were both sentences carried out against him? Because if he had been burned but not swallowed up, those who were swallowed up would have complained and said that though only Korah had brought retribution upon them, here they were being swallowed up while he escaped. But if he had been swallowed up and not burned, those who were burned would have complained and said that though only Korah had brought this retribution upon them, here they were burned while he escaped. For that reason he was condemned to both deaths. First in the sight of all who were being burned the fire set ablaze the one in whose hand was the censer with the incense in it. Then the fire rolled him up like a ball,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The translation here follows Buber’s emendation in n. 92, which reads <i>KKDWR</i> for <i>KDWR</i> in agreement with <i>Codex Vaticanus, Ebr</i>. 34; <i>Codex Michael</i> 577 No.155; <i>Tanh.</i> 5:9; and Numb. R. 18:19.</i> and the fire rolled him along until it brought him to the mouth of the earth among those being swallowed up, as stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small>.

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>AND ON BEN PELETH</small>. Why was he named On (which means "sorrow")?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:10; Numb.

The son of (<i>ben</i>) one for whom miracles (<i><small>PL</small>'<small>WT</small></i>) have been performed. Rav said: On ben Peleth had his wife save him; for she said to him: What has this dispute to do with you? If Aaron is the High priest, you are a disciple; [if Korah is high priest, you are &lt;still&gt; a disciple]. He said to her: I know that the whole community is holy, since it is written in Numb. 16:3): <small>FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY</small>. What did she do? She gave him wine to drink, got him drunk, and had him lie down in her bed. Then she sat down at the entrance [of the house] and let down her hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">It was immodest to look at a married woman’s loosened hair.</i> Everyone who came for her husband On saw her and returned. In the meanwhile they were swallowed up. It is this which is written (in Prov. 14:1): <small>THE WISDOM OF WOMEN BUILDS ITS HOUSE</small>. This refers to the wife of On. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOLLY TEARS IT DOWN WITH ITS OWN HANDS</small>. This refers to the wife of Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. 110a describes how she joined her husband in his rebellion.</i>

(Numb. 16:2:) <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES, TOGETHER WITH MEN FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION, ELECTED BY THE ASSEMBLY</small>, because they knew how to intercalate years<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., add an extra month in order to keep the lunar year in line with the solar year.</i> and fix new moons.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:10, cont.; Numb.

(Numb. 16:4:) <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS</small>. What news did he hear? That they suspected him of &lt;adultery with&gt; a married woman.

Rabba expounded [that which is written] (in Hab. 3:11): <small>SUN AND MOON REMAIN ON HIGH</small> (<i>zevul</i>). <small>&lt;THEY GO FOR THE LIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS, FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR SHINING SPEAR</small>. &gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:11; Numb.

He said to them: For my honor you did not protest,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when people dishonored the Holy One by worshiping the sun and the moon.</i> but for flesh and blood you did protest. And at the present time until they have protested, they do not come out.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash draws of the second half of Hab. 3:11 to show that the Holy One must use arrows and a spear to force the sun and moon to shine.</i>

Siman 27

Rabba expounded what is written (in Numb. 16:30): <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW, &lt;AND THE EARTH OPENS ITS MOUTH&gt;</small>. To what &lt;does the verse refer&gt;? If we say to an actual creation of something, then is it not written (in Eccl. 1:9): <small>FOR THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN</small>. Rather &lt;it refers&gt; to bringing the opening (into Gehinnom) up close (to the surface of the earth where Korah was standing).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash sees the swallowing up of Korah and his companions as the first evidence for Gehinnom. See the fuller text in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:11; Numb. R. 18:20; <i>Sanh</i>. 110a.</i> (Numb. 26:11:) <small>THE SONS OF KORAH, HOWEVER, DID NOT DIE</small>. It was taught in the name of our master: A place was set aside for them in Gehinnom where they sat [and uttered hymnody]. Rabbah bar bar Hanah said: One time it happened that we were travelling on the road, when a certain Arab merchant said to me:<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly <i>BB</i> 74a.</i> Come, I will show you chasms of Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the straits of Scylla and Charybdis. So Jastrow, s.v., <i>beli‘e.</i></i> I went and saw two fissures out of which was coming smoke. He took a ball of clipped wool, steeped it in water, placed it on a spearhead, &lt;and raised it over them&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This logical end to the sentence is found in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 5:11; Numb. R. 18:20; <i>BB</i> 74a; <i>Sanh. 110ab.</i></i> Then he said to me: Listen, what do you hear. I actually heard them saying: Moses and his Torah represent truth, but they (i.e., Korah and his companions) are liars. So in the world to come the Holy One is going to take them out &lt;of Gehinnom&gt;. Moreover, it is with reference to them that Hannah said (in I Sam. 2:6): <small>THE LORD BRINGS DEATH AND GIVES LIFE; HE BRINGS DOWN TO SHEOL AND RAISES UP</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash finds an indication that the life and raising up here refer to life in the world to come, since they follow death and the descent into Sheol.

(Numb. 16:1:)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This supplement comes from <i>Codex Vaticanus, Ebr. 34</i>. It is found neither in Buber’s primary Oxford manuscript nor in the traditional version of the <i>Tanhuma.</i></i> <small>NOW KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BETOOK HIMSELF</small> (literally: <small>TOOK</small>)…. Let our master instruct us: Is it legitimate to save the Holy Scriptures on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 16:1): <small>IN THE CASE OF ALL HOLY SCRIPTURES</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Torah, Prophets, and Writings, all three.</i> <small>ONE SHOULD SAVE THEM FROM THE FIRE WHETHER ONE READS FROM THEM OR DOES NOT READ FROM THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Sanh</i>. 115a, the Prophets are what one reads from and the Writings are what one does not read from.</i> As for the books of the <i>minim,</i> however, one does not save them from the fire on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>TShab.</i> 13(14):5 mentions <i>gilyonim</i> in this context. While <i>gilyonim</i> properly refers to the unwritten portions of a scroll, it became a term for the Christian Gospels and seems to have this meaning here and in <i>Shab.</i> 116a.</i> R. Jose the Galilean says: If I find the books of the <i>minim,</i> I cut out their Divine Names and burn the rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>yShab.</i> 16:1 (15c); <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 5:23 (16); Numb. R. 9:36; also <i>Sanh</i>. 110b.</i> R. Tarfon said to him: May I bury my children, if the books of the <i>minim</i> should fall into my hands, I should burn them together with their Divine Names. Moreover, if someone were pursuing me, I should flee into an idolatrous temple, but I should not flee to a house of the <i>minim.</i> &lt;The reason is&gt; that idolaters do not know the Holy One when they deny him, [while these do know him when they deny him]; and it is concerning them that David said (in Ps. 139:21): <small>DO I NOT HATE THOSE WHO HATE YOU O LORD</small>? <small>AND LOATHE THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST YOU</small> …? What caused Korah to disappear from the world? It could only be that he withdrew into heresy (<i>minut</i>) and sided against Moses and Aaron. Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 16:1): <small>NOW KORAH &lt;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&gt; TOOK</small> (heretical texts)….

Siman 2

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&gt; BETOOK HIMSELF…</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &lt;FORMIDABLE&gt; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &lt;SUCH&gt; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. This &lt;verse&gt; teaches about Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 18:14; cf. below, Numb. 5a:5.</i> <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &lt;FORMIDABLE&gt; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small>. This is Korah when he rebelled against the Torah, because that is the fortified city (literally: city of strength ['<i>oz</i>]) of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH</small> ('<i>oz</i>) <small>TO HIS PEOPLE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">My student, Jonthan Reich, pointed out that Psalm 29 is traditionally recited when returning the Torah scroll to the ark during the Sabbath liturgy.</i> Moreover, he started a quarrel with Moses, as stated (in Prov. 18:19, cont.): <small>&lt;SUCH&gt; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small> (<i>beriah</i>). What is the meaning of <small>BAR</small> (<i>beriah</i>)? That he removed him (as in Jonah 2:7 [6]) <small>TO THE LAND WHERE ITS BARS</small> (<i>beriheha</i>) <small>CLOSED UPON</small> him. And what caused him to come to all this disgrace? Simply the fact that he sided against Moses and Aaron. But what did he say? See what the son of Amram did! He gave the priesthood to his brother Aaron and took the kingship for himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 5:19.</i> while he made him (i.e., Korah) {a porter} a common laborer,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ergates.</i></i> as stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>&lt;BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO WAGONS&gt;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Korah and the Levites carried the Ark. Also one carries the Torah scroll on the shoulder during the liturgy.</i> When he was carrying the Ark, he began to take issue with them and say: Moses is no prophet, Aaron is no high priest, and Torah has not been given from the heavens. When Moses heard that, he began to go to the Holy One. He said to him: I will overlook my own insult and Aaron's insult, but for the insult to Torah I do make a claim, as stated (in Numb. 16:28): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME…. &lt;IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH …, THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>.&gt; Now <small>THIS</small> can only refer to Torah, since it is stated (in Deut. 4:44): <small>AND THIS IS THE TORAH WHICH MOSES SET &lt; BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. It is comparable<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 5:22; Numb. R. 18:12.</i> to the <i>shoshbin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the bridal agent who guarded her interests at the consummation of the marriage.</i> of a king's daughter, who asked a <i>bene ficium</i> [which should be read &lt;as a single word,&gt; &lt;<i>beneficium</i>&gt;]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word is Latin and means “favor”; cf. Gk.: <i>benepfikion.</i></i> from the king. He said to the King: If you do not seek my <i>bene ficium</i> [which should be read &lt;as a single word&gt;, <i>beneficium</i>], I also shall say that your daughter did not have virginity. Similarly did Moses say to the Holy One: If those die &lt;natural deaths&gt; on their beds, just as all humans &lt;normally&gt; die, with the physicians coming to visit them according to the custom that all the sick are visited, I also will make a denial and say: Surely no Torah has been given from the heavens. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:29): <small>IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH …, &lt;THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>.&gt;

Siman 3

This is one of the three prophets who spoke in this way: Elijah, Micah, and Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySahn.</i> 10:1 (28a); Numb. 18:12, cont.</i> Now in the case of Elijah, what did he say? (I Kings 18:36–37): <small>O LORD, GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND ISRAEL, LET IT BE KNOWN TODAY THAT YOU ARE GOD IN ISRAEL, THAT I AM YOUR SERVANT, AND THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AT YOUR BIDDING. ANSWER ME O LORD, ANSWER ME, SO THAT THIS PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT YOU, O LORD, ARE GOD</small>. But if you do not answer me, I will say (ibid., cont.): <small>AND YOU HAVE TURNED THEIR HEARTS BACK</small>. So also in the case of Micah (identified here with Micaiah). What did he say to Ahab (in I Kings 22:28)? <small>IF YOU RETURN IN PEACE</small>, then I will say (ibid. cont.): <small>THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN THROUGH ME</small>. And Moses also said (in Numb. 16:29): <small>IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH</small> …, then I will say (ibid. cont.): <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>. The Holy One said to him: Moses, what do you want? Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, (in Numb. 16:30): <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES &lt;SOMETHING NEW&gt;…</small>. If you have created a mouth to the earth from the beginning of the creation of the world, well and good; but if not, let the Lord create a mouth now. The Holy One said to him: But you have so spoken (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU; AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS</small>.

Siman 4

(Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH, AND SWALLOWED &lt;THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY&gt;…</small>. R. Judah says: At that time a lot of mouths into the earth were opened.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 18:13.</i> It is so stated (in Deut. 11:6): <small>&lt;THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, THEIR TENTS, AND EVERYTHING SUBSTANTIAL WHICH FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS,&gt; IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> {<small>THE EARTH</small>} [<small>ISRAEL</small>].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there were openings over all of Israel, one for each follower of Korah.</i> R. Nehemiah said to him: But note what is written (in Numb. 16:32): <small>THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small> (with <small>MOUTH</small> in the singular) <small>AND ATE</small><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Here Buber has not bothered to emend <small>ATE</small> to <small>SWALLOWED</small> in agreement with the standard biblical text.</i> <small>THEM…</small>. He said to him: Then how do you reconcile <small>IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> {<small>THE EARTH</small>} [<small>ISRAEL</small>]? It is simply that the earth became like a funnel; and from wherever &lt;any&gt; one of them was standing in relation to him (i.e., to Korah), he rolled and went down with him. You have succeeded in reconciling <small>IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> {<small>THE EARTH</small>} [<small>ISRAEL</small>]; you have succeeded in reconciling <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small>. But what is the meaning (of Deut. 11:6): <small>AND EVERYTHING SUBSTANTIAL</small> (<i>yequm</i>) <small>WHICH FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS</small> (literally: <small>WHICH WAS IN THEIR FEET</small>)? This is wealth (<i>mamon</i>), since it puts &lt;a person&gt; on &lt;one's&gt; feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>yequm</i> (“something <small>SUBSTANTIAL</small>”) comes from the root, <i>QWM</i>, which has the causative meaning, “raise up,” the word is taken to mean something which causes one to rise.</i>
Our masters say: Even if they had garments at the cleaner, they (i.e., the garments) came rolling and were swallowed up along with &lt; their owners &gt;. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: Even a needle which had been borrowed (<i><small>S</small>h'<small>WLH</small></i>) from them by an Israelite, it also was swallowed up along with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySahn.</i> 10:1 (28a).</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE INTO SHEOL</small>(<i><small>S</small>h'<small>WLH</small></i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with what had been borrowed (<i>Sh’WLH</i>).</i> Once they had been swallowed up, they cried out and said: Moses is king and prophet, Aaron is high priest, and Torah has been given from the heavens. Moreover, the sound of their voice went through the whole camp of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 16:34): <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL, SINCE THEY WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM, FLED AT THEIR CRY…</small>. Why all this? Because he had sided against the Holy One. But nevertheless, in the world to come they are going to rise.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ARN,</i> A, 36; <i>Sanh.</i> 10:3; also <i>Sanh.</i> 109b; 110b.</i> R. Judah ben Betera teaches that they do have a share in the world to come. What is written about it (in Numb. 16:33, cont.)? <small>AND THEY VANISHED FROM THE MIDST OF THE COMMUNITY</small>. It is also stated by David (in Ps. 119:176): <small>I HAVE GONE ASTRAY LIKE A LOST</small> (rt. '<i><small>BD</small></i>) <small>SHEEP; SEEK OUT YOUR SERVANT, FOR I DO NOT FORGET YOUR COMMANDMENTS</small>. Just as a loss (rt. '<i><small>BD</small></i>), which is written concerning David, is going to be searched for; so (in Numb. 16:33) this loss (rt. '<i><small>BD</small></i>) is going to be searched for. So also you find that Hannah prayed for them in a prayer,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tefillah.</i> This word suggests the Eighteen Benedictions (<i>Shemoneh ‘Esreh</i>), which is also called the <i>tefillah.</i> Moreover I Sam. 2:6 contains wording similar to the second of these prayers, which concerns the resurrection.</i> which is uttered (in I Sam. 2:6): <small>THE LORD BRINGS DEATH AND GIVES LIFE; HE BRINGS DOWN TO SHEOL AND RAISES UP</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, Numb. 5:27 at the end, and the note there.</i>

Siman 5

(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &lt;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&gt; BETOOK HIMSELF…</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &lt;FORMIDABLE&gt; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &lt;SUCH&gt; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR. A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &lt;FORMIDABLE&gt; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small>. R. Aha said: this refers to Korah, who was one of the bearers of the Ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, Numb. 5a:2; Numb. R. 18:14.</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 7:9) <small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO &lt;WAGONS&gt;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>. Now he was the greatest in the whole tribe, and yet he sinned against the Ark. (Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &lt;FORMIDABLE&gt; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small> (literally: <small>CITY OF STRENGTH</small> &lt;'<i>oz</i>&gt;), and '<i>oz</i> can only denote an Ark, as stated (in Ps. 78:61): <small>AND HE HAS DELIVERED HIS STRENGTH</small> ('<i>oz</i>) <small>TO CAPTIVITY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical context concerns the loss of the Ark from Shiloh.</i>

Siman 1

(Numb. 19:2:) <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. Blessed be the name of the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, who created the world in wisdom and understanding; for his wonders have no limit and his greatness is beyond reckoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 6:1; Numb. R. 18:22.</i> (Ps. 33:7:) <small>HE HAS GATHERED THE WATERS OF THE SEA LIKE A MOUND, AND HE HAS PUT THE DEEPS IN STOREHOUSES</small>. Now what is the meaning of <small>HE GATHERS THE WATERS OF THE SEA LIKE A MOUND</small>? When the Holy One created the world, he said to the prince of the sea: Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BB</i> 74b.</i> He said to him: Sovereign of the World, it is enough for me to continue with what is &lt;already&gt; mine. Then he began to weep. He kicked him to death, as stated (in Job 26:12): <small>IN HIS POWER HE STILLED THE SEA, AND IN HIS UNDERSTANDING HE STRUCK DOWN RAHAB</small>. [You find that the prince of the sea was named Rahab. What did the Holy One do? He subdued &lt;the waters&gt; and trampled them down;] and so it was that the sea accepted them, as stated (in Amos 4:13): <small>HE TRAMPLES ON THE HEIGHTS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 93:5. Cf. Gen. R. 23:7, according to which the sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) is higher than the whole world.</i> <small>OF THE EARTH; THE LORD</small> [<small>GOD</small>] <small>OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME</small>. So for &lt;the waters&gt; he set sand in place as bar and gates, according to what is stated (in Job 38:8): <small>AND &lt;WHO&gt; BLOCKED OFF THE SEA WITH DOORS…</small>. Moreover, it says (in Jer. 5:22): <small>DO YOU NOT FEAR ME</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD</small>. [<small>WILL YOU NOT TREMBLE BECAUSE OF ME</small>,] <small>WHEN I HAVE PLACED SAND AS A BOUNDARY FOR THE SEA</small>? And it says (in Job 38: 10–11): <small>&lt;… AND I SET BAR AND GATES IN PLACE,&gt; AND SAID: YOU MAY COME THIS FAR AND NO FARTHER</small>. Then the sea said to him: Sovereign of the World, in that case my sweet waters will be mingled with the salt &lt;waters&gt;! He said to it: No! Each and every one will have a storehouse for oneself, as stated (in Ps. 33:7): <small>AND HE HAS PUT THE DEEPS IN STOREHOUSES</small><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 4:5.</i> If you should say that this is a great wonder for their waters not to mingle, then consider the face,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRTsWP</i>, an adaptation of the Gk.: <i>prosopon.</i></i> which the Holy One created in the children of Adam. &lt;Although&gt; the &lt;size of&gt; a full <i>sit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi on <i>Shab.</i> 106a, a single <i>sit</i> was the distance between the tips of the of the middle and index fingers when held widely apart. A double <i>sit</i> was the distance between the tips of the thumb and index finger when held widely apart. For various definitions, see Jastrow, p. 977, s.v. <i><small>SYT</small></i>.</i> it has so many springs (from '<i><small>YN</small></i>); yet they do not mingle with one another. The waters of the eyes '<i><small>YN</small></i>) are salty; the waters of the ears are oily; the waters of the nose are putrid; the waters of the mouth are sweet. For what reason are the waters of the eyes salty? Because when someone weeps for the dead, &lt;doing so&gt; all the time, he would immediately become blind; however, because &lt;tears&gt; are salty, he stops and does not weep. For what reason are the waters of the ears oily? Because when a person hears bad news, if he held it in his ears, it would collect in his heart, and he would die. Because they are oily, &lt;the news&gt; goes in one ear and out the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “&lt;a person&gt; discharges &lt;bad news&gt; through one &lt;ear&gt;, while he admits it through the other.”</i> For what reason are the waters of the nose putrid? Because when a person emits a bad odor, if the waters of the nose were not putrid &lt;enough&gt; to stop it, he would soon die. And for what reason are the waters of the mouth sweet? It sometimes happens that someone eats food that does not agree with him, and he vomits. Now if the waters of the mouth were not sweet, he would not recover. Moreover, since he reads the Torah, of which it is written (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB</small>, the waters of the mouth are therefore sweet. Now here are the grounds for arguing a fortiori (<i>qal wehomer</i>), that if &lt;something&gt; &lt;the size of&gt; a full <i>sit</i> has so many springs without them mingling with one another, how much the more so in the case of the Great Sea, of which it is stated (in Ps. 104:25): <small>THERE THE</small> {<small>GREAT SEA IS ALSO WIDE</small>} [<small>SEA IS GREAT AND WIDE</small>]…. &lt;This is&gt; to teach that in everything the Holy One accomplishes his mission and that he has not created one thing in vain. Sometimes the Holy One has accomplished his mission by means of [a frog, by means of a gnat,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. R. 22:2-3; Eccl. R. 5:8:2, 4; <i>PRE</i> 49; also <i>Shab.</i> 77b; Exod. R. 10:1.</i> by means of a wasp, or by means of] a scorpion. R. Hanan of Sepphoris said:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 10:7; Lev. R. 22:4; Eccl. R. 5:8:5.</i> There is a story about a certain scorpion that went to carry out &lt;the Holy One's&gt; mission (to sting a certain person) beyond the Jordan; so the Holy One summoned a certain frog for him, and he crossed over upon it. Then that scorpion went and stung &lt;the&gt; person so that he died. &lt;There is&gt; also a story about a certain reaper who stood and reaped in the valley of Beth-Tofah. When burning heat came, he took grass &lt;and&gt; {cut} [tied] it on his head. &lt;When&gt; a certain mighty serpent came at him, he killed it. A certain &lt;snake&gt; charmer passed by him. He saw the slain serpent. He said to him: who killed that serpent? He said to him I &lt;did&gt;. He looked at the grass on his head. He said to him: Will you remove the grass from your head? He told him: Yes. When he had removed it, he said to him: Are you able to remove this snake with this staff? He told him: Yes. He did so. &lt;When&gt; he drew near to it, he had not succeeded in touching it, before he shed his body parts one by one.
R. Jannay was sitting as a judge as the gate of his city, &lt;when&gt; he saw a serpent hissing and coming toward the city. When they would secure against it in one place, it would go to another. He said: It seems to me that this &lt;serpent&gt; is on its way to carry out its mission. When it entered the city, a rumor spread in the city: &lt;Did you hear about&gt; So-and-so ben So-and-so? A serpent has bitten him, and he is dead.
There is a story about two people who were walking on the way. One who could see, and one was blind. They sat down to eat. They reached out their hands for the herbs of the field and ate. The one who could see became blind, and the one who had been blind became sighted. They did not move from there until the former was being supported by the latter whom he had been supporting.
There is a story about a certain person who was going from the land of Israel to Babylon.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 22:4.</i> While he was eating, he saw two birds fighting with each other. One of them killed its companion. Then going to get an herb, [it placed it on its mouth,] and made it live again. That person (the one who saw what had happened) went and took the very herb that had fallen from the bird. Then he went to make the dead live with it. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A well-known landing dock four hours north of Tyre. See ‘<i>Eruv.</i> 80a.</i> he found a dead lion lying in the open. He touched the herb to its mouth and made it live. The lion got up and ate him. The proverb says: Do not do good to the evil, and evil will not happen to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 22:8.</i>
There is a story of Shihin (a town near Sepphoris) about a certain blind person who went down to bathe in the waters in a cave. He happened upon the well of Miriam, immersed &lt;himself in it&gt;, and was healed. Titus the Wicked entered the interior of the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Git</i>. 56b; Lev. R. 22:3.</i> When he had reviled and blasphemed, he stood up and slashed the veil. Then he took a Torah scroll and brought it out. Next he unrolled it; and bringing two whores, he transgressed upon them. Then he drew his sword to cut up the {veil} [book]. A miracle took place in that blood began to spew forth from it. He began to boast, saying that he had killed himself (i.e. the Torah).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The author is avoiding too literal a description of the sacrilege and therefore substitutes “himself” for the sacred Torah as a euphemism.</i> He began to become bolder and bolder. When he reached the sea, the sea began to grow more and more stormy. He said: The God of these people only has power in the sea. When Pharaoh arose, he drowned him in the sea, and Sisera as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pes</i>. 118b.</i> Now if he would, let there be dry land between him and me. Then let us see who overcomes. The Holy one said: O you wicked son of wickedness, son of the Nimrod the Wicked, I am sending against you a tiny creature, the least of my creatures, to eradicate you from the world. A gnat entered his nose and he died an unnatural death. Why is it named a base creature? Because it takes in but does not excrete.
Moreover, sometimes it is by means of a hornet &lt;that God's will is carried out&gt;. Thus it is written (in Exod. 23:28): <small>I WILL SEND THE HORNET BEFORE YOU &lt;TO DRIVE OUT THE HIVITES, THE CANAANITES, AND THE HITTITES FROM BEFORE YOU&gt;</small>. Our masters have said: When the Holy One sent the hornet before Israel to kill the Amorites, see what was written about them (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES</small> [<small>BEFORE THEM, WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT AND WHO WERE AS STRONG AS THE OAKS</small>;] <small>&lt;I DESTROYED THEIR FRUIT ABOVE AND THEIR ROOTS BELOW&gt;</small>. It entered one's right eye and poured out its poison in it. Then &lt;that person&gt; burst open and dropped dead. This indeed is the way of the Holy One: to carry out his missions by means of small things against all who vaunt themselves against him. He sends them a small creature to exact punishment from them, in order to inform them that their might &lt;comes&gt; only from him. Also in the world to come the Holy One is going to exact punishment from the star-worshiping peoples by means of small things. It is so stated (in Is. 7:18–19): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THAT THE</small> [<small>LORD</small>] <small>SHALL WHISTLE FOR THE FLY THAT IS AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE RIVERS OF EGYPT AND FOR THE BEE THAT IS</small> {<small>AT THE END OF</small>} [<small>IN</small>] <small>HIS LAND OF ASSYRIA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So runs the Buber text. Buber seems to have mistakenly put a space before the letter <i>waw</i> instead of after it. Thus at the verse break he has written ’<i>ShWRW</i>. <i>B’W</i> instead of ’<i>ShWR</i>. <i>WB’W.</i></i> <small>THEY ALL SHALL COME…</small>.

Question:<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This section is taken virtually verbatim from the Aramaic text of the <i>She’eltot</i> of Ahai of Shabha (d. ca. 762), <i>Mattot,</i> 137. The section is also found in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:2.</i> Are those of the house of Israel obligated to abstain from anything unclean, as stated (in Lev. 20:25): <small>SO YOU SHALL MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CLEAN ANIMAL AND THE UNCLEAN, ALSO BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN BIRD AND THE CLEAN</small>? Now it is not a question of [something] unclean that is forbidden, but even of &lt;the&gt; utensils by which something unclean has been cooked. It is forbidden for Israel to cook with them, until each and every piece has been purged, as stated (in Numb. 31:23): <small>EVERY</small>[<small>THING</small>] <small>THAT WILL WITHSTAND THE FIRE</small> [<small>YOU SHALL PASS THROUGH THE FIRE, AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN</small>].

Rav Sheshet raised an objection for him: Even if that is so, "implement" is undefined.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">‘<i>AZ</i> 75b is more specific, and objects that under the Nahman/Abbuha ruling, even scissors, would require immersion.</i> Rabba said: Vessels for eating are the ones being spoken of in the parashah, since it is written (in Numb. 31:23): <small>EVERY</small> [<small>THING</small>] <small>THAT WILL WITHSTAND</small> (literally: <small>COME INTO</small>) <small>THE FIRE…</small>. {And so} Rav Isaac bar Joseph [bought] a certain vessel &lt;made&gt; of fresh ordure.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mirdeta.</i> The word normally denotes dung but here seems to refer to a kind of clay.</i> He planned to immerse it.

However, it is necessary to say: These are plates with a glaze,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qonya</i>; cf. the Gk.: <i>konia</i> (“dust”).</i> which they use in boiling. Is there any purging for them or not; for while they were earthen vessels originally, one coated them with glaze? That glaze seal is a shield, so that the clay does not absorb, because glaze is &lt;like&gt; metal, and purging is sufficient for it. Or if there is no shield, the clay does absorb &lt;impurities&gt;, and there is no remedy for it. Come, hear what they asked Meremar concerning leaven on Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pes</i>. 30b; ‘<i>AZ</i> 33b-34a.</i> [This is the case with glazed vessels: Is} [In the case of glazed vessels, is] there any purging for them, and is it permitted to use them on Passover or not?

In the case of green &lt;glaze&gt;, there is certainly no question for us &lt;about its absorption&gt; because it (the glaze) contains alum; while a white or black &lt;glaze&gt; certainly does present us with a question.

[Why?] It is comparable to a vessel of metal, for it is established for us as a law (<i>halakhah</i>) as Rav Zevid said: Those vessels with a white or black glaze are permitted; green ones are forbidden. Also if there are cracks in them, they are all forbidden. And this is the law (<i>halakhah</i>).

Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2):<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Buber has bracketed this whole section, because it is not found in his main Oxford MSS.

He said to himself: I shall mock &lt;these&gt; Jews. He went in, took a yoke, and let it rest on &lt;the cow&gt; neck all night. In the morning he brought it out to them. When they saw it, they knew that a yoke had been on it, for they saw that its eyes were rolling. When they would come to place a yoke upon it, its eyes would roll and stare at the yoke. When they saw its signs<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeia.</i></i> that it had had a yoke on it, they said to him: Give us &lt;the&gt; gold coins, for we are not taking it from you, even with no payment.

Then he said: Blessed be your God, who has set wisdom and knowledge within you. He gave them back the gold coins and strangled himself (at the end of a rope). &lt;This is&gt; to inform you that it is a scriptural commandment for one to bring only a red cow. Where is it shown?

He said to him: What are the names of these &lt;beings&gt;? He said: It is fitting to call this one an ox, this one a lion, this one a horse, and so on for all of them.

(I Kings 5:13 [4:33], cont.:) <small>HE ALSO SPOKE WITH</small>/<small>CONCERNING</small> ('<i>al</i>) <small>THE CATTLE AND ON THE FOWL</small>. Is it possible that &lt;a person&gt; would speak with cattle and with fowl? Rather &lt;the passage is concerned with&gt; why the cattle are permitted &lt;as food&gt; with &lt;the cutting of&gt; two organs<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeia</i> (“signs,” “omens”).</i> (the gullet and the windpipe); but the fowl, with &lt;the cutting of&gt; one organ (i.e., the gullet or the windpipe).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hul</i>. 2:1; <i>Hul.</i> 27b.</i> It is because cattle were created from the dry land, as stated (in Gen. 1:14): <small>LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE LIVING CREATURES AFTER ITS KIND, CATTLE, CREEPING THINGS, AND THE BEAST OF THE EARTH AFTER ITS KIND</small>. But in regard to fowl, one text says &lt;they came&gt; from the dry land, while another text says &lt;they came&gt; from the sea. &lt;The text stating fowls came&gt; from the dry land is what is written (in Gen. 2:19): <small>SO FROM THE GROUND THE LORD GOD FORMED EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD AND EVERY FOWL OF THE HEAVENS</small>.

(I Kings 5:13 [4:33]:) <small>AND WITH</small>/<small>CONCERNING</small> ('<i>al</i>) <small>THE FISH</small>. Is it possible that one would so speak? Solomon merely said: For what reason do cattle, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughtering, while fish do not require ritual slaughtering? Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya taught in Tyre with respect to fish, that they do require ritual slaughtering. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him: On what basis did you decide this? He said to them: From here (in Gen. 1:20): <small>LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH LIVING CREATURES, AND LET THE FOWL FLY</small>. Just as fowl require ritual slaughtering so do the fish require ritual slaughtering. He said to them (i.e., those standing by): Lay him down to receive lashes. He said to him: Shall a person who speaks the biblical word be lashed? He said to him: You did not decide well. He said to him: On what basis? He said to him: From here (in Numb. 11:22): <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FLOCKS AND HERDS TO SLAUGHTER FOR THEM</small>? <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FISH IN THE SEA TO GATHER FOR THEM</small>? The former require ritual slaughtering, while the latter &lt;is taken&gt; through gathering. He said to him: Give him your beating, for there is benefit in receiving lashes.
And again did Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya teach in Tyre, &lt;this time&gt; with respect to a son of Israel, who came upon a foreign woman and had her bear him a son, that he should be circumcised on the Sabbath. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him. On what basis do you hold this? He said to him: [From this which is written] (in Numb. 1:18) <small>THEN THEY REGISTERED THEIR LINEAGES ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES BY THEIR ANCESTRAL HOUSES</small>. He said to them (i.e., those standing by): Lay him down to receive lashes. He said to him: Shall a person who speaks the biblical word be lashed? He said to him: You did not decide well. He said to him: Where is it shown? He said to him: Lie down and listen. He said to him: If one of the gentiles came to you in order to become a proselyte on the Sabbath Day or on the Day of Atonement, would you profane the Sabbath on account of him or not? He said to him: One does not profane the Sabbath [or the Day of Atonement] for him but only for a child of Israel. He said to him: On what basis do you hold this? He said to him (in Ezra 10:3): <small>SO NOW LET US MAKE A COVENANT WITH OUR GOD TO PUT AWAY ALL</small> {<small>FOREIGN</small>} <small>WIVES AND &lt;ANYONE&gt; BORN OF THEM…</small>. He said to him: Would you lash me on the basis of a non-Mosaic text? He said to him: It is written (ibid.): <small>LET IT BE DONE</small> {<small>THROUGH</small>} [<small>ACCORDING TO</small>] <small>THE TORAH</small>. He said to him: From which &lt; piece of&gt; Torah? He said to him: From that of R. Johanan, when he said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay: It is written (in Deut. 7:3): <small>YOU SHALL NOT INTERMARRY WITH THEM: DO NOT GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THEIR SONS</small> &lt;….&gt; Why? (Deut. 7:4:) <small>BECAUSE THEY WILL TURN YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING ME…</small>. Your child that comes from an Israelite woman is called "your child"; but that which comes from a foreign woman is called, not "your child," but "her child." He said to him: Give him your beating, for there is benefit in receiving lashes. Solomon &lt;meant when he&gt; said (in Eccl. 7:23): <small>&lt;ALL THIS I TESTED WITH WISDOM&gt;:</small> About all these things I have knowledge; but in the case of the parashah on the Red Heifer, I have investigated it, inquired into it, and examined it. Still (at the end of the verse): <small>I SAID: LET ME HAVE WISDOM, FOR IT IS FAR FROM ME</small>.

And if his heel were like that, how much brighter was the countenance<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: krystallos; Lat.: crystallum (“crystal”).</i> of his face.
R. Levi said in the name of R.

Resh Laqish said: Eleven, and the Rabbis say: Ten. But they do not disagree (as to the verse, only over the number of canopies). The one who makes &lt;a total of&gt; thirteen for him makes (1) <small>EVERY STONE</small>, (2) <small>THAT IS PRECIOUS</small>, and (3) <small>YOUR COVERING</small> &lt;to be the extra&gt; three.

The one who makes &lt;a total of&gt; ten for him does not make &lt;these words&gt; to be an &lt;extra&gt; one.

When &lt;Adam&gt; said (in Gen. 3:12): <small>THE WOMAN THAT YOU PUT WITH ME, SHE GAVE ME &lt;FRUIT FROM THE TREE, AND I ATE&gt;</small>.

See, we heard about Moses, that he conversed with him in a pillar of cloud, as stated (in Exod. 34:5): <small>THE LORD DESCENDED IN THE CLOUD AND HE STOOD WITH HIM THERE</small>. So also with Aaron, he conversed with him in the cloud, where it is stated (in Numb. 12:5): <small>SO THE LORD CAME DOWN IN</small> a <small>&lt;PILLAR OF&gt; CLOUD, STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT, &lt;AND CALLED AARON AND MIRIAM&gt;</small>.

In the case of Aaron, however, I have not heard &lt;of his book&gt;. It is simply that there is a teaching that this parashah was granted to him, so that it would never budge, neither from him nor from his children, till the end of all the generations.

        <br>In regard to the scapegoat, where is it shown? Where it is written (in Lev. 16:26): <small>AND THE ONE WHO SETS THE AZAZEL-GOAT FREE &lt;SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES, BATHE HIS FLESH IN WATER, AND AFTER THAT MAY COME INTO THE CAMP&gt;</small>; yet it is &lt;the goat&gt; itself that atones for others.

Now why does &lt;Scripture&gt; call &lt;the heifer&gt; a <small>GREAT ONE'S HOUSE</small>? It is simply that this was the house of study (<i>bet midrash</i>) that belonged to R.

(Numb. 20:7–8:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES SAYING: TAKE THE ROD, AND ASSEMBLE THE CONGREGATION, &lt;YOU AND YOUR BROTHER AARON; AND SPEAK UNTO THE ROCK BEFORE THEIR EYES. THEN IT WILL GIVE ITS WATER, SO THAT YOU BRING WATER OUT OF THE ROCK FOR THEM</small>.&gt; [<small>THUS YOU SHALL PROVIDE THE CONGREGATION AND THEIR CATTLE WITH WATER</small>.] From here it is shown that the Holy One is concerned for Israel's wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:9; Numb. R. 19:9.</i> (Ibid., vs. 10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON GATHERED THE CONGREGATION BEFORE THE ROCK</small>. &lt;This verse&gt; teaches that each and every person sees himself as if he were standing at the rock. And similarly it says (in Lev. 8:3): <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. Here also all Israel was standing when they saw the miracles which happened at the rock. They began to say: Moses knows the natural properties of rock. If he wants, he will bring forth water out of this &lt;other&gt; one. Moses found himself confronted with a dilemma. If I listen to them, I am disregarding the words of the Omnipresent; and the Holy One (according to Job 5:13) <small>CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR OWN CUNNING</small>. After all, for the whole of these forty years Moses had been keeping himself from becoming angry with them, because he was afraid of the oath that the Holy One had sworn (in Deut. 1:35): <small>NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE FROM THIS EVIL GENERATION SHALL SEE &lt;THE GOOD LAND&gt;….</small> They said to him: Here is a rock. Just as you wish to bring &lt;water&gt; from another rock, you should bring it from this one. He gave a command to them (in Numb. 20:10): <small>PLEASE LISTEN, YOU REBELS, &lt;SHALL WE BRING FORTH WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK</small>.&gt;

Siman 30

(Numb. 20:11:) <small>THEN MOSES RAISED HIS HAND AND STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE WITH HIS ROD</small>. &lt;When&gt; he struck one time, the rock began dribbling a little water, as stated (in Ps. 78:20): <small>SEE, HE STRUCK A ROCK, AND WATER TRICKLED OUT</small>, like a person with a discharge, in that it dribbles &lt;in&gt; drops. They said to him: Son of Amram, is this water for nursing children or for babes weaned from milk? Immediately, he became angry with them, struck it (according to Numb. 20:11) <small>TWICE &lt;WITH HIS ROD&gt;, AND A LOT OF WATER CAME FORTH</small>. Yet for all that, Moses only made &lt;water&gt; from a rock, because the Holy One had told him.

Siman 31

(Numb. 20:12:) [&lt;<small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON:&gt; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME</small>.] Did not Moses say something worse than this?<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:10; Numb. R. 19:10.</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 11:22): <small>ARE THERE &lt;ENOUGH&gt; FLOCKS AND HERDS TO SLAUGHTER FOR THEM</small>? <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FISH IN THE SEA TO GATHER FOR THEM</small>?There also trust was lacking, and &lt;that lack of trust&gt; was greater than this one. So why did the Holy One not decree death for him there? &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a king who had a friend. Now when in private he displayed arrogance towards the king's son with harsh words, the king did not become angry with him. &lt;When, however,&gt; he arose one day and was arrogant in front of the legions,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legiones</i>.</i> he decreed death for him. So also did the Holy One say to Moses: When you acted privately with me, [I did not become angry], but now &lt;that you have acted&gt; in public, it is impossible &lt;to overlook your action&gt;. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 20:12):&lt;<small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON: BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST ME&gt; TO SHOW MY HOLINESS IN THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &lt;THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&gt;</small>.

Siman 32

(Numb. 20:12:) <small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON:&gt; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME…</small>. If Moses sinned, how did Aaron sin?<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:9, end; <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:10, just before the parallel to the previous section.</i> The matter is comparable to creditor who came to take away a debtor's barn. He took away both his &lt;barn&gt; and that of his friend. The debtor said: If I am guilty, how has my neighbor sinned? Similarly Moses said: Sovereign of the World, I did become angry, &lt;but&gt; how has Aaron sinned? Therefore the Holy One praises<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>QLS</i>; cf. Gk.: <i>kalos.</i></i> him, where it is stated (in Deut. 33:8): <small>AND OF LEVI HE SAID:</small> [<small>LET</small>] <small>YOUR THUMMIM AND URIM</small> [<small>BE WITH YOUR FAITHFUL ONE, WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH &lt;AND&gt; WITH WHOM YOU CONTENDED AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH</small>]. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:12.</i> see, you have decreed for me to die in the desert along with this wicked generation, as stated (in Ps. 78:40): <small>HOW OFTEN DID THEY DEFY HIM IN THE DESERT AND GRIEVE HIM IN THE WILDERNESS</small>. Now the &lt;future&gt; generations will say I was like them. Let it be written about me why I came to be punished. It is therefore written (in Numb. 20:12:) <small>&lt;BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON: &gt; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: With what countenance do you want to enter the land?<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:13.</i> The situation is comparable to a shepherd who went out to feed the king's flock, and the flock was carried off. &lt; When&gt; the shepherd wanted to come into the king's palace,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Lat. <i>palatium</i>; Gk.: <i>palation.</i></i> &lt;the king said to him: They will say that you caused the flock to be carried off&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">The addition in the angle brackets comes from the parallel in the traditional <i>Tanhuma</i> 6:10, near the end. A similar addition appears in Numb. R. 19:13.</i> Here also the Holy One said to Moses: Your glory is that you are the one who led sixty myriads out &lt;of bondage&gt;. However, you buried them in the desert and are bringing another generation into &lt;the land&gt;. Now they will say: the generation of the wilderness has no share in the world to come. Rather sleep with them, and come along with them. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:21): [<small>FOR THERE IS AN HONORED LAWGIVER'S PORTION</small>,] <small>WHERE HE CAME AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE. HE CARRIED OUT THE LORD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS ORDINANCES FOR ISRAEL</small>.

(Numb. 20:14:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT MESSENGERS FROM KADESH UNTO THE KING OF EDOM: THUS SAYS YOUR BROTHER ISRAEL…</small>.

By universal custom, when a person is engaged in business<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> with his friend who causes a loss, he separates himself from him and does not want to see him.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:12; Numb.

Instead (according to Numb. 20:14), <small>THEN MOSES SENT MESSENGERS</small>.
(Numb. 20:14, cont.:) <small>YOU KNOW ALL THE TROUBLE THAT HAS BEFALLEN US</small>. He said to him: You know when the Holy One said to Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN &lt;IN A LAND NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM&gt;</small>. We have been enslaved, while you are born free.

Siman 34

(Numb. 20:15:) <small>HOW OUR ANCESTORS WENT DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This whole subject is comparable to two brothers against whose grandfather a promissory note appeared. One of them arose and paid it. One day he started to ask a favor from his brother. He said to him: You know that debt was incumbent on both of us, but it was I who paid it. Do not refuse any of my favor that I am asking.

Siman 35

(Numb. 20:17:) <small>PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND. &lt;WE WILL NOT PASS THROUGH FIELD OR VINEYARD, &gt; NOR SHALL WE DRINK WATER FROM A WELL</small>. Should it have said: "Water from cisterns?" &lt;By this use of the singular, <small>A WELL&gt;</small>, Torah has taught you proper conduct, &lt;i.e.,&gt; that when one who goes to a land which is not one's own, [though he has at hand his necessities,] he should not drink from what he has on hand. Rather he should put aside what he has, and buy from the shopkeeper in order to benefit him. So also Moses said to &lt;the king of Edom&gt;: &lt;We have&gt; a well with us,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">On the tradition of Israel’s portable well for supplying them with water during their desert wanderings, see above, Lev. 7:7; Numb. 1:2; below, Numb. 6:47-50; <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 1:2; Numb.

(Numb. 21:1, cont.:) <small>HE FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL</small>. &lt;That king&gt; was Amalek. Why did &lt; Scripture &gt; call him a Canaanite? Because because Israel was forbidden to fight with the children of Esau, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 2:5): <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE</small>. When Amalek came and engaged in battle with them a first time and a second, the Holy One said to them: This &lt;nation&gt; is not forbidden like the the children of Esau. Just look. They are like Canaanites, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 20:17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM: THE HITTITES, THE AMORITES, THE CANAANITES</small>, [….] For that reason he was called a Canaanite; and from time immemorial Amalek has been a {scourge} [strap] for the punishment of Israel. You find that, when Aaron died, Amalek went out against them; and Israel retreated back seven stages &lt;of their journey&gt;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 10:6): <small>THEN FROM THE WELLS OF BENE-JAAKAN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED TO MOSERAH. THERE AARON DIED…</small>. Did Aaron die there?

(Numb. 21:4:) <small>THEN THEY JOURNEYED FROM MOUNT HOR BY WAY OF THE REED SEA IN ORDER TO GO AROUND THE LAND OF EDOM, BUT THE PEOPLE'S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>. But is it not written (of that era in Neh. 9:20): <small>AND YOU GAVE YOUR GOOD SPIRIT TO ENLIGHTEN THEM</small>? It is simply that those remnants of Israel which had came out of Egypt, over whom death had been decreed, saw neither a peaceful nor agreeable spirit in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:19; Numb. R. 19:21.</i> Thus it says (in Numb. 14:33–34): <small>AND YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE SHEPHERDS IN THE WILDERNESS</small>, &lt;….&gt; [&lt;…,&gt; <small>AND YOU SHALL KNOW MY DISPLEASURE</small>.] This was because (according to Numb. 21:4) <small>THE PEOPLE'S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>.

(Numb. 21:5:) <small>AND THE PEOPLE SPOKE AGAINST GOD AND AGAINST MOSES</small>. They made a slave comparable to his buyer.
(Numb. 21:5:) <small>OUR SOUL LOATHES THIS MISERABLE FOOD</small>, for that generation was unable to taste any of the fruits of the land. R. Aqiva said: When merchants disclosed to them [a basket] with some fruits of the land, they died. It is so stated (in Numb. 32:11): <small>SURELY NONE OF THE PEOPLE &lt;WHO CAME UP FROM EGYPT, FROM TWENTY YEARS AND UP,&gt; SHALL SEE &lt;THE LAND WHICH I PROMISED ON OATH TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB</small>, i.e.,&gt; any good that comes because of the land. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:6): <small>BUT THE PEOPLE'S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>.

Siman 45

(Numb. 21:6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SENT FIERY SERPENTS AMONG THE PEOPLE</small>. Why did the Holy One see fit to exact retribution from them through serpents?<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:22.</i> It is simply that the snake started &lt;the use of&gt; slanderous language at the beginning and was cursed, but they did not learn from it. The Holy One said: Let the serpent, which was the first &lt;to use&gt; slanderous language, come and exact retribution from the those who &lt;still&gt; speak slanderous language. This is what is written (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO BREAKS THROUGH A BARRIER</small><sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">In general “to break through a barrier” means “to say,” but here the reference may denote more specifically the barrier of one’s teeth, through which slander must pass.</i> <small>WILL HAVE A SNAKE BITE HIM</small>.
Another interpretation of why retribution was exacted from them through serpents. Even though the serpent eats all the luxury foods of the world, for him they are turned to dust in his mouth and belly. Thus it is stated (in Is. 65:25): <small>BUT THE SERPENT'S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>. Now these people ate the manna, as stated (in Ps. 106:15): <small>SO HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY ASKED FOR</small>. It also says (in Deut. 2:7): <small>THESE FORTY YEARS THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS BEEN WITH YOU; YOU HAVE LACKED NOTHING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., no luxury foods.</i> Let a serpent that eats many species and has &lt;but&gt; one taste in his mouth come and exact the retribution {from one species and those who eat it} [from those who eat one species] and taste many species.
(Numb. 21:6:) <small>FIERY</small> (<i>serafim</i>). &lt;They are called seraphim&gt; because they burn (<i>sorefim</i>) the soul.

Siman 46

(Numb. 21:7:) <small>THEN THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO MOSES AND SAID: WE HAVE SINNED</small>. They knew that they had spoken against Moses, so they fell prostrate before him and said (ibid., cont.): <small>PRAY UNTO THE LORD TO REMOVE THE SERPENT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the singular here may be suggesting to midrashic interpreter that this was the same serpent that sinned in the Garden of Eden. See the parallel in Numb. R. 19:23.</i> <small>FROM US</small>. &lt;The passage serves&gt; to make Moses' humility known to you, in that he did not hesitate to seek mercy for them and to make the power of repentance known to you. As soon as they said: We have sinned, he was immediately reconciled to them. &lt;The passage serves&gt; to teach you that there is no one who forgives that becomes cruel. And where is it shown that, if one has sinned against his companion and says to him: I have sinned, without &lt;the companion&gt; forgiving him, that &lt;the unforgiving one&gt; is called a sinner? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 12:23): {<small>AND</small>} <small>AS FOR ME ALSO, FAR BE IT FOR ME TO SIN AGAINST THE LORD BY CEASING TO PRAY ON YOUR BEHALF</small>. When? When they came and said to him: We have sinned, [as stated] (in I Sam. 12:10): <small>AND</small> [<small>THEY</small>] {<small>THE PEOPLE</small>] <small>SAID</small> {<small>UNTO SAMUEL</small>}: <small>WE HAVE SINNED…</small>.
(Numb. 21:8): <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: MAKE A SERAPH, &lt;AND PUT IT ON A POLE&gt;. THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, WHEN ANYONE BITTEN &lt;LOOKS AT IT, HE SHALL LIVE&gt;</small>, not only one bitten by a serpent, but <small>ANYONE BITTEN</small>, even one bitten by an adder, by a scorpion, a wild beast, or a dog.

(Numb. 21:10:) <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED ON AND CAMPED IN OBOTH</small> (<i>ovot,</i> rt: '<i><small>WB</small></i>), because they had become enemies (<i>oyevim,</i> rt: '<i><small>YB</small></i>) to the Omnipresent.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

(Numb. 21:12:) <small>AND THEY CAMPED IN THE WADI ZERED</small>, because the wadi was &lt;only&gt; about a full span (<i>zeret</i>) &lt;in width&gt;; but they were unable to cross it for thirty-eight years. [Thus it is stated] (in Deut. 2:13–14): <small>NOW THEN ARISE AND CROSS THE WADI ZERED….

(Numb. 21:17:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SANG THIS SONG</small>. This song (of the well) was uttered at the end of forty &lt;years&gt;, while the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty &lt;years&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:20; Numb. R. 19:25; see also above, Lev. 7:7; Numb. 1:2; 6:35, and the notes there.</i> So what was the purpose of writing &lt;it down&gt; here?. This matter has been explained from what is above (in vs. 14): <small>IT IS THEREFORE SAID IN THE BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD</small>: '<i><small>T</small></i><sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">This untranslated word is used here to indicate a direct object, but it also means “sign.”</i> <small>WAHEB IN SUPHAH</small> (<i>Sufah</i>) <small>&lt;AND</small> '<small><i>T</i> THE WADIES OF THE ARNON</small>,&gt; &lt;i.e.,&gt; the signs ('<i><small>TWT</small></i>, singular: '<i><small>T</small></i>) and miracles [which were done for them] in the Arnon Wadies were like the miracles which were done for them in the Reed (<i>Suf</i>) Sea. What were the Miracles in the Arnon Wadies? One would stand on one mountain and speak with his companion on the other mountain; yet he was seven miles<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Milim</i>. Lat.: <i>milia.</i></i> away from him. Now the road decended into the middle of the wadi and then ascended, and Israel's course was to cross through the midst of the wadies. All the nations assembled endless troops.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> Some of them took up positions in the middle of the wadi. Moreover, &lt;the slope of&gt; the wadi<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel accounts here read “mountains.”</i> above them became riddled with caves, and facing them was a mountain which correspondingly became riddled with crags in the form of breasts (<i><small>S</small>h<small>DYM</small></i>), as stated (in Numb. 21:15): <small>AND THE SLOPE</small> ('<i><small>S</small>h<small>D</small></i>) <small>OF THE WADIES</small>. The troops entered into the caves; for they said: As soon as Israel comes down into the wadi, those ahead of them who are in the wadi and those above from out of the caves will arise and kill all of them. When Israel did arrive at that place, the Holy One did not make it necessary for them to go down into the wadi. Instead, he gave a signal to the mountains, and the &lt;craggy&gt; breasts of the latter mountain entered the caves, so that they all died. Moreover, the mountains brought their summits so close to each other, that they became a highway, for there was no knowing &lt;where&gt; each one joined its neighbor. Furthermore, that wadi separates the borders between the land of Israel and the land of Moab, as stated (in Numb. 21:13 = Jud. 11:18): <small>FOR THE ARNON IS THE BORDER OF MOAB</small>. The mountain in the land of Moab, the one with the caves, was [not] shaken; but the mountain in the land of Israel, the one with the crags in the form of breasts, was shaken and joined to the mountain opposite. Why was it shaken? Because it belonged to the land of Israel. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a female slave who saw her master's son coming to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">In this illustration the female slave is the mountain, the master is God, and the son is Israel.</i> She jumped up to greet him and welcome him. The crags entered into the caves and all those warriors were crushed. Then the well descended to the wadi, where it became became a mighty &lt;torrent&gt; and destroyed the troops, just as the &lt;Reed&gt; Sea had destroyed those &lt;Egyptians&gt;. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:14): <small>WAHEB IN SUPHAH</small> (<i>Sufah</i>) <small>AND THE WADIES OF THE ARNON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that <small>WAHEB IN SUPHAH</small> (understood as <i>Yam Suf,</i> or Reed Sea) is mentioned next to the Wadi Arnon shows that the two deliverances are comparable.</i> When Israel crossed upon those mountains without knowing about all these miracles the Holy One said: Behold, I will let the children of Israel know how many troops I destroyed because of them. The well descended into the cave and brought out innumerable skulls, arms, and legs. Thus when Israel returned to seek the well, they saw it shining like the moon in the midst of the wadi, as it discharged the limbs of the troops. And where is it shown that the well informed &lt;Israel&gt; about them? Where it is stated (in Numb. 21:15–16): <small>AND THE SLOPE OF THE WADIES…. &lt;AND FROM THERE THEY CONTINUED TO BEER, I.E., THE WELL</small> (<i>beer</i>.) <small>WHERE THE LORD SAID TO MOSES….&gt;</small>
(Numb. 21:16:) <small>AND FROM THERE &lt;THEY CONTINUED&gt; TO BEER</small>. But was not &lt;the well&gt; with them from the beginning of the forty years? It is simply that it had gone down to proclaim the miracles, while Israel remained at the wadies and said to it (in Numb. 21:17, cont:) <small>RISE UP, O WELL, SING TO IT</small>.

Siman 48

(Numb. 21:17:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SANG</small>. For what reason is Moses not mentioned there?<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:21; Numb. R. 19:26.</i> For the reason that he was being punished because of the waters, and no person praises<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>QLS</i>. Cf.: Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> his executioner.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>speculator</i> (“<i>examiner</i>” <i>or</i> “<i>overseer</i>”).</i> And why is the name of the Holy One not mentioned there? &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a governor who made a banquet for the king. The King said: Will my friend so-and-so be there? They told him: No. He said: I also am not going there. [Also here the Holy One said: In as much as Moses is not mentioned, I also will not be mentioned there.]
(Numb. 21:18:) <small>THE WELL THAT THE PRINCES DUG</small>. Was it dug there? It is simply that it was given through the merit of the ancestors, since they were called princes. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 105:41–12): <small>HE OPENED A ROCK, AND WATER GUSHED OUT…</small>. [<small>FOR</small>] <small>HE REMEMBERED HIS HOLY PROMISE AND HIS SERVANT ABRAHAM</small>.
(Numb. 21:18, cont.:) <small>THAT THE NOBLES OF THE PEOPLE DUG &lt;WITH THE SCEPTER, EVEN WITH THEIR OWN STAFFS&gt;</small>. When the princes were standing by it, with each and every one drawing &lt;the water&gt; with his own staff for his own tribe and for his own family, the space between the standards was filled with a &lt;flow of&gt; water that was gathering strength. A woman who had to go to her companion went from standard to standard by ship, as stated (in Ps. 105:41): <small>THEY TRAVELED THE RIVER BY <i>TSIYYOT</i></small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">A more traditional translation would be: <small>IT FLOWED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS LIKE A RIVER</small>.</i> Now a <i>tsiyyot</i> (here understood as the plural of <i>tsi</i>) can only denote a ship, since it is stated (in Is. 33:21): <small>NOR SHALL A STATELY SHIP</small> (<i>tsi</i>) <small>PASS BY</small>. Now the waters flowed outside the camp and embraced a great strip of land. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 23:3) <small>HE LEADS ME IN PATHS</small> (literally: <small>CIRCLES</small>) <small>OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. In addition, &lt;the encircling waters&gt; cause endless varieties of green herbage and trees to grow, as stated (in Ps. 23:2): <small>HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES; HE LEADS ME BESIDE STILL WATERS</small>. All the days they were in the desert they used it (i.e., the well).<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Although the pronoun is masculine and “well” is feminine, “it” still probably denotes the well, as the parallel texts recognize by writing “it” in the feminine.</i> Therefore, they rendered praise for it &lt;with the song ending&gt;: (in Numb. 21:18): <small>THE WELL THAT THE PRINCES DUG</small>.
(Numb. 21:18, cont.:) <small>FROM THE DESERT OF MATTANAH</small>, &lt;so stated&gt; because in the desert &lt;the well&gt; was given (<i>nittenah</i>) them to use &lt;as a gift (<i>mattanah</i>)&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">The words in the angle brackets come from the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:21.</i>

Siman 49

Another interpretation: Why was &lt;the well&gt; given in the desert? Because if it had been given to them in the land, the tribe in whose border it was given would have argued and said: I have a prior claim to it. For that reason it was given in the desert where all would have an equal claim to it. And for what other reason was it given in the desert? Just as a desert is neither sown nor cultivated, so is the one who receives the words of Torah. They remove from him the yoke of the government and the yoke of earning a living. Just as a desert does not grow <i>annona</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word generally denotes, as it probably does here, a tax on farm goods paid in kind; but the word also occurs in a broader sense denoting agricultural products generally.</i> so are children of Torah (i.e., Torah scholars) children of freedom.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by accepting the yoke of Torah, such scholars are exempt from government taxes and the need to earn a living. See Numb. R. 19:26.</i>
Another interpretation &lt;of why it was given&gt; in the desert. Whoever fulfills the Torah is one who uses himself like the desert, &lt;i.e.,&gt; whoever uses himself like a desert and removes himself from everything &lt;that might distract him&gt;.

(Numb. 21:19:) <small>FROM MATTANAH TO NAHALIEL, AND FROM NAHALIEL TO BAMOTH</small>. These refer to the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synhedrion.</i></i> in the enclosure (i.e., the Temple court) beside the altar. (Numb. 21:20:) F<small>ROM BAMOTH TO THE VALLEY THAT IS IN THE PLAIN OF MOAB</small>. These refer to the Sanhedrin, when it was in the chamber of Hewn Stones, which was in region of that woman who came from the plain of Moab (i.e., Ruth), of whom it is stated (in Ruth 2:6): <small>SHE IS THE YOUNG MOABITE WOMAN WHO CAME BACK WITH NAOMI FROM THE PLAINS OF MOAB</small>.

Another interpretation (of ibid.:) <small>WHICH IS VISIBLE</small>. This is in reference to the well which accompanied them until it entered the sea of Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Lev. 7:7; Numb. 1:2; 6:35, 47-49; and the notes there; also <i>yKil.</i> 2:4 or 3 (32cd); <i>yKet.</i> 12:3 (35b); Lev.

(Numb. 21:21:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS TO SIHON</small>. This text is related (to Pss. 34:15 [14]): <small>DEPART FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT</small>.

If &lt;these situations&gt; present themselves to you, you are given a command concerning them; but &lt;you are&gt; not to go in pursuit of them. In the case of peace, however, (according to Ps. 34:15 [14]): <small>SEEK PEACE</small>, wherever you are, <small>AND PURSUE IT</small>, wherever else it may be. And this is what Israel did. Although the Holy One had said to them (in Deut. 2:24): <small>BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION, AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>, they went in pursuit of peace.

(Numb. 21:21:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS &lt;UNTO SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES&gt;</small>.

(Numb. 21:22:) <small>WE WILL GO BY THE KING</small>'s <small>HIGHWAY</small> [<small>UNTIL WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH YOUR TERRITORY</small>]. In another place it is written (in Deut. 2:29): <small>UNTIL HAVE CROSSED THE JORDAN</small>. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to one guarding a vine or fig tree. When someone comes and says: Let me pass through here, so that I may gather grapes from the vineyard, he says to him: It is only because of you that I am sitting on guard. So would you come to gather the grapes? So it was with Sihon. He received wages from all the kings of Canaan; and they would bring taxes up to him, for he had made them kings. Moreover he and Og were considered the equivalent of them all, since it is stated (in Ps. 136:19–20): <small>SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES …; AND OG, KING OF BASHAN</small>. Israel said to &lt;Sihon&gt;: Let us pass through your land<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">“Let us pass through your land” is similar but not quite equal to either Numb. 20:17 or Numb. 21:22.</i> to conquer the kings.

INSTEAD SIHON GATHERED ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WENT OUT AGAINST ISRAEL</small>. The Holy One acted with forethought to deliver him into their hand without trouble. It is written (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2): <small>TO KING SIHON OF THE AMORITES WHO DWELT IN HESHBON</small> (i.e., <small>WITH CALCULATION</small>).<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">The stress on the Holy One acting with fore-thought was suggested by the words, <small>IN HESHBON</small>, which can also be translated <small>WITH CALCULATION</small>.</i> If Heshbon had been full of mosquitos, no mortal could have prevailed against it; and it goes without saying that he was a warrior and dwelt in a fortified city. If he and his troops<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> had dwelt &lt; scattered about&gt; in his towns, Israel would have worn themselves out to prevail against him and conquer each and every town. Instead the Holy One gathered them together so as to deliver them into their hand without [trouble. And so it said (in Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON &lt;AND HIS LAND&gt; OVER TO YOU</small>. They killed all his warriors who had come out against them.

This text is related (to Is. 61:8): <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:24; Numb. R. 19:30.</i> The Holy One said to Moses (in Deut. 2:9): <small>DO NOT TROUBLE MOAB</small>. Now Heshbon had been part of Moab, since it is stated (in Numb. 21:26): <small>FOR HESHBON WAS A CITY OF KING SIHON OF THE AMORITES, BUT HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST THE FORMER KING OF MOAB &lt;AND TAKEN ALL HIS LAND AWAY FROM HIM AS FAR AS THE ARNON&gt;</small>. When Israel came, they took Heshbon away from Sihon and whatever he had taken from the king of Moab; for if they had taken it from him &lt;directly&gt;, they would have had a robbery on their hands. Instead Sihon took it from Moab, and Israel took it from Sihon. Thus they were acquitted from &lt;the charge of&gt; robbery.

Siman 54

(Numb. 21:27:) <small>THEREFORE THOSE WHO SPEAK IN PARABLES SAY</small>: This refers to Balaam and his father, whom Sihon had hired to curse Moab. It was they who had said (ibid., cont.): <small>&lt;COME TO HESHBON,&gt; LET IT BE BUILT; LET THE CITY OF SIHON BE ESTABLISHED</small>.
(Numb. 21:28:) <small>FOR A FIRE HAS COME FORTH FROM HESHBON, &lt;A FLAME FROM THE CITY OF SIHON&gt;. IT HAS DEVOURED AR OF MOAB</small>. Thus they cursed Moab so that they might deliver it into &lt;Sihon's&gt; hand.
(Numb. 21:29–31:) <small>WOE BE TO YOU, O MOAB!…. WE HAVE SHOT AT THEM; HESHBON HAS PERISHED…. THUS ISRAEL DWELT</small> {<small>IN ALL THE CITIES</small>} [<small>IN THE LAND OF</small>] <small>THE AMORITES</small>. &lt;Only&gt; Jazer survived.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:31.</i>
(Numb. 21:32:) <small>SO MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT JAZER</small>. These spies were zealous. They said: we have confidence in the prayer of Moses, and we believe in the Holy One. Then they did &lt;as they were told&gt; and slew the Amorites who were in &lt;the city&gt;.
(Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. Some say the war of Sihon took place in Elul. Then they celebrated the festival in Tishri,<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 19:32.</i> then after the festival came the war with Og. [Just as you say] (in Deut. 16:7): <small>AND IN THE MORNING YOU SHALL TURN</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">In the biblical context the turning denotes Israel turning to their tents after celebrating Passover.</i> while it is written (in Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. <i>Gezerah shawah</i> (a verbal analogy): Just as &lt;the turning comes&gt; after the festival below (in Deut. 16:7), so also here (in Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. &lt;Because of the similar use of the word <small>TURNED</small>, the contexts must have been similar; therefore the turning here in Numb. 21:33 must have taken place&gt; after the festival.
(Numb. 21:33, cont.:) <small>AND KING OG OF BASHAN CAME OUT &lt;AGAINST THEM, HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE&gt;</small>, for the Holy One had gathered &lt;Og and his people&gt; before &lt;Israel&gt; in order to deliver &lt;Gog and his people&gt; into their hand.

Siman 55

(Numb. 21:34:) <small>BUT THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO MOSES: DO NOT FEAR HIM…</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:14): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS ALWAYS AFRAID…</small>. Such is the nature of the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:25.</i> Although the Holy One assures them, they do not cast off fear. And so it is written about Jacob (in Gen. 32:8 [7]): <small>AND JACOB WAS &lt;GREATLY&gt; AFRAID</small>. Why was he afraid? He said: Perhaps I was tainted by something at Laban's, since it is written (in Deut. 23:15 [14]): <small>&lt;AND YOUR CAMP SHALL BE HOLY;&gt; SO &lt;THE LORD&gt; IS NOT TO SEE ANYTHING INDECENT AMONG YOU AND TURN AWAY FROM YOU</small>. Thus the Holy One may have forsaken me. Moses also acquired fear in the manner of his ancestor. Why was he afraid? He said perhaps Israel sinned in the war with Sihon or became tainted by a transgression. He said to him (in Numb. 34:21): <small>DO NOT FEAR HIM</small>, because a warrior more formidable than himself has never arisen in the world. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:11): <small>FOR ONLY KING OG OF BASHAN &lt;REMAINED FROM THE REPHAIM</small><sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">According to Deut. 2:11, 20-21, together with Numb. 13:33, the Rephaim were a race of giants.</i> <small>REMNANT&gt;</small>. Now he had been left from the warriors whom Amraphel and his colleagues (Gen. 14:1, 9) had slain, as stated (in Gen. 14:5): <small>&lt;CHEDORLAOMER AND THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM CAME&gt; AND SMOTE THE REPHAIM…</small>. But this man was their refuse, like hard olives that come out as survivors from the bottom of the olive waste. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:13): <small>THEN THE SURVIVOR CAME &lt;AND TOLD ABRAM THE HEBREW&gt;</small> (about Lot's capture).<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 6:15, specifically identifies the survivor by adding here: “This was Og.”</i> It was this man's intention that Abraham would go out and be killed. The Holy One gave him a reward for &lt;what&gt; his feet &lt;had earned&gt;, in that he lived all those years, until he fell at the hand of &lt; Abraham's&gt; children. When Moses came to wage war with him, he was afraid of him. He said: I am a hundred and twenty years old, while he is five hundred years old. If he did not have merit, he would not have lived all these years. The Holy One said (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2:) <small>DO NOT FEAR HIM</small>. {(Deut. 3:6:) <small>AND WE SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM….</small> } [(Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2, cont.:) <small>AND YOU SHALL DO TO HIM AS YOU DID TO SIHON…</small>.] Moreover, is it not written (in Deut. 3:7): <small>BUT ALL THE CATTLE AND THE BOOTY OF THE TOWNS WE TOOK AS BOOTY FOR OURSELVES</small>? The simple conclusion is that they utterly destroyed his body so as to leave none of it.
(Numb. 21:35:) <small>SO THEY SMOTE HIM, HIS CHILDREN &lt;AND ALL HIS PEOPLE&gt;</small>. The written text (<i>ketiv</i>) &lt;reads&gt; <small>HIS SON</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. a similar verse about Sihon, Deut. 2:33, where <small>HIS SON</small> is the undoubted reading.</i> because he had a son more formidable than himself. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you destroy the nations little by little, but in the world to come, I will remove them from the world at a single stroke. It is so stated (in Is. 33:12): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE</small>.

Appendix to Chukat



Siman 1

From the parashah of the &lt;Red&gt; Heifer:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The two sections in this supplement come from Buber’s second Oxford MS., <i>Hund Donat 20 Uri Heb CXVI</i>, No. 153; cf. A. Jellinek, <i>Bet ha-Midrasch</i> (Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853-1877), vol. 1, pp. 79f., 92ff, in midrashim entitled “Midrasch der zehn Gebote” and “Midrash vom Ableben Aharon’s” respectively. Jellinek’s versions are reprinted in J. D. Eisenstein, <i>Ozar Midrashim</i> (New York, 1915), vol. 2, p. 457ab, and vol. 1, pp. 13b-14b, respectively. See further in the Buber edition of the <i>Tanhuma</i> on Numbers, pp. 151-152, n. 1; also in his introduction to this edition, p. 123.</i> There was a story about R. Matthew bar Heresh. Now he was wealthy, feared Heaven, practiced virtuous beneficence, pursued good deeds of charity, and entertained the disciples of the sages from his own assets. Moreover, orphans and widows were always found at his table. All his paths were in uprightness, and like his master, R. Meir, he was occupied with the Torah all his days. So the radiance of his countenance shone like the brightness of the sun; and they said of him that at no time in his life had he ever looked at anyone's wife or at any other woman. On one occasion he was sitting and occupied with the Torah, when Satan passed by. Upon seeing him, he was envious of him. He said: Is it possible for a righteous person to exist in the world without sin! Immediately he went up on high, where he stood before the Holy One and said: Sovereign of the World, how does Matthew ben Heresh stand before you? He said to him: Completely righteous. He said to him: Give me permission to test him. He gave him permission. Immediately he went and found him sitting and occupied with the Torah. He became like a beautiful woman, whose beauty had not been equalled since the the days of Naamah, the sister of Tubal Cain (of Gen. 4:22), through whom the ministering angels went astray. It is so stated (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE SONS OF GOD SAW HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE &lt;AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES&gt;</small>. When &lt;Matthew ben Heresh&gt; saw her, he turned his face away. Again Satan went opposite his face. He turned his face to another side, but Satan was opposite his face. When he saw that she was turning to &lt;face him on&gt; all sides, he said in his heart: I am afraid that the evil drive may prevail against me. So what did that righteous man do? He called one of his students to attend him. He said to him: Go, my son, and get me fire and pins! When he had brought them, he ignited &lt;the pin&gt; in the fire and stuck them in his eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Matthew 5:28-29; 18:9.</i> When Satan saw that, he trembled in dismay. So he went away from him, ascended on high, where he said: Sovereign of the World, thus and such happened. Immediately the Holy One called Raphael (rt.: <i><small>RP</small>h</i>'), Prince of the Healing Arts (rt.: <i><small>RP</small>h</i>') and said to him: Go and heal (rt.: <i><small>RP</small>h</i>') the eyes of Matthew ben Heresh. The angel Raphael went and stood by him. R. Matthew ben Heresh said: Who are you? He said to him: I am Raphael, the angel of the table of the Holy One, who has sent me to heal (rt.: <i>RPh</i>') your eyes. He answered him: I do not want &lt;healing&gt;. What happened happened. Raphael returned to the Holy One and said to him: Matthew ben Heresh told me thus and such. The Holy One said to him: Go, say to him: From this day on do not fear. I am standing surety for you in this matter, that the evil drive will never prevail against you all the days of your life. When he heard this from the mouth of the angel, he accepted his healing and was not afraid. Here is the origin of what the sages have said: Whoever does not look at another woman will not have the evil drive prevailing against him. Moreover, in the world to come the Holy One will remove the evil drive from us and set his Holy Spirit within us. It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:26–27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU</small>.

Siman 2

From the parashah (in Numb. 20:25–27): <small>TAKE AARON &lt;AND HIS SON ELEAZAR&gt;</small> […,] <small>AND STRIP AARON</small> [….: <small>SO MOSES DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED</small>. &lt;This parashah&gt; has come to teach you that, even though he had spoken to him a harsh commandment against his brother, he did not hesitate.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Numb. 6:40.</i> The Holy One said to Moses: Say to your brother Aaron: Your time has arrived to pass away from the world. Immediately Moses stood before the Holy One in prayer and said: Sovereign of the World, how shall I say to my brother: Your time has arrived. The Holy One said to him: I have already decreed a decision over him, that has not been decreed over anyone else, in that I will not deliver him into the hand of the angel of death on the same day that he stopped the plague (in Numb. 17:8–13 [6:43–48]). Now their custom was this: Every day the princes would rise and come early to the doorway of Eleazar; Eleazar and the princes &lt; would go&gt; to the doorway of Aaron; and Aaron, Eleazar, and the princes would go early to the doorway of Moses. On this day, however, Moses changed the custom. He along with Eleazar and the Princes went early to the doorway of Aaron. Aaron said to him: Brother Moses, Why did you change the custom? Moses said to him: This is what the Holy One has commanded me. Now this was the order in which they went: Moses in the middle with Aaron to his right and Eleazar to this left. But when Israel saw that, they said to each other: The Holy Spirit has been taken from Moses and given to Aaron! Also Israel loved Aaron more than Moses, because Moses had said: Let justice take its course, while Aaron had brought peace between a person and his friend, also between a husband and his wife. Moreover, if he heard about anyone in the world who wanted to commit some transgression at night, he would go out on the road; and when he found him, he would say to him: My child, why are you walking on the road? People may suspect you of things that are evil. But you, my child, are a good person; and you stem from a good and distinguished family. Thus he would warn him and bring him back from an the evil way. So all Israel, men and women, loved Aaron. Therefore our masters of blessed memory have said (in <i>Avot</i> 1:12): <small>BE ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF AARON, LOVING PEACE AND PURSUING PEACE, LOVING MORTALS AND DRAWING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>. For that reason (in Numb. 20:29): <small>THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD DIED, AND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>, men and women, <small>MOURNED AARON FOR THIRTY DAYS</small>. But in reference to Moses, it is written (in Deut. 34:8): <small>AND THE SONS OF ISRAEL</small>, men only, <small>MOURNED MOSES ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB FOR THIRTY DAYS</small>. Now on that day Aaron said to Moses: Tell me, my brother, what do you need from me? He said to him: Wait until we ascend the mountain. After they had ascended, he said to him: My brother, would it be that the Holy one entrusted a deposit with you, and wants it back from you? Aaron said to him: Brother Moses, a tent of meeting and its utensils were entrusted into my hands. Might I have cut back on their liturgy? Moses said to him: The Holy One delivered to you a menorah with its seven lamps. Still, he did not take to heart that he was speaking about his &lt;life&gt; breath (as in Prov. 20:27): <small>A PERSON'</small>s <small>BREATH IS THE LAMP OF GOD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic text uses the divine name here.</i> When he was not perceptive about the matter, Moses said to him &lt;plainly&gt;: Brother Aaron, your time has arrived to pass away from the world. When he heard that, he put his hands on his head, as he sobbed and wept. Then he recited this scripture (from Ps. 66:5): <small>COME</small> {<small>LOOK AT</small>} [<small>SEE</small>] <small>THE WORKS OF GOD, WHO IS FEARSOME FOR HIS DEEDS AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. Moreover, when they wanted to enter the cave, Moses said to him: Brother Aaron, there is where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob died; but since you wear the robes of priesthood, you may defile them. You put on Eleazar's clothes, and let Eleazar put on your clothes. Then you and I will enter the cave. And so they did. When they entered, they saw a burning lamp and a made-up bed. Moses said to him: Brother Aaron, get up into this bed, and he got up. He said to him: Extend your arms, and he extended them. Close your eyes, and he closed them. Close your mouth, and he did so. And in that hour his breath left him. When Moses saw that, he longed for his own death. The Holy One said to him: By your life, like this death, even the death of this man, so shall be your own death. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:50): <small>AND YOU SHALL DIE THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN THAT YOU ARE ASCENDING AND SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR KIN, AS YOUR BROTHER AARON DIED ON MOUNT HOR AND WAS GATHERED UNTO HIS KIN</small>.

Balak



Siman 1

(Numb. 22:2:) <small>NOW BALAK BEN ZIPPOR SAW</small> (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) <small>&lt;ALL THAT ISRAEL HAD DONE TO THE AMORITES&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Deut. 32:4):<small>THE ROCK!—HIS WORK IS PERFECT, &lt;BECAUSE ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE&gt;</small>. [Thus] the Holy One did [not] leave the nations of the world a pretext for saying in the age to come: You alienated us and did not give us anything like what you gave Israel in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 7:1; Numb. R. 20:1.</i> [What] did the Holy One do? Just as he raised up kings, prophets, [and sages] for Israel, so did he raise them up from the nations of the world. Moreover, the kings, prophets, and sages [that belonged to Israel] were coupled with the kings, prophets, and sages that belonged to the nations of the world. He raised up Solomon as king over all the land, and he did the same for Nebuchadnezzar. The former built the Holy Temple, and the latter destroyed it. He gave David wealth, and he acquired the house for his name.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 30:1 [introduction]: a song at the dedication of the house (i.e., the Temple) of David. The Temple was David’s in that he acquired the materials to build it.</i> He gave wealth to Haman, and he acquired a whole nation for slaughter. Every dignity Israel received, you find that the nations of the world received. In like manner he raised up Moses for Israel, who spoke with him any time that he wanted, &lt;and&gt; he raised up Balaam for the nations of the world, in order that he might speak with him any time that he wanted. Look at (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) what a difference there is between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world! The prophets of Israel warn the nation about transgressions, and so it says (in Ezek. 3:17): <small>I HAVE APPOINTED YOU A SENTINEL FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. &lt;Any&gt; prophet who arose from the nations, however, established a breach to cut off mortals from the world to come. And not only that, but all the prophets had a merciful attitude towards both Israel and the nations of the world; for so did Isaiah say (in Is. 16:11): <small>THEREFORE MY INNER PARTS THROB LIKE A HARP FOR MOAB…</small>. And similarly has Ezekiel said (in Ezek. 27:2): <small>RAISE UP A DIRGE OVER TYRE</small>. But this cruel man rose up to uproot a whole nation without cause, for nothing. Therefore the parashah on Balaam was written to make known why the Holy One removed the Holy Spirit from the nations of the world. &lt;It was&gt; because this man arose out of them, and look (rt.: <i><small>R'H</small></i>) at what he did!

Siman 2

(Numb. 22:2:) <small>NOW BALAK &lt;BEN ZIPPOR&gt; SAW</small>. He saw retribution which Israel inflicted against the Ammonites.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 7:2; Numb. R. 20:2.</i> It would have been better for the wicked if they had been blind,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 5:29; 18:9 // Mark 9:47.</i> for their eyes bring a curse to the world. With reference to the generation of the flood, [it is written] (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE SONS OF GOD SAW &lt;HOW BEAUTIFUL&gt; THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE &lt;AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES&gt;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 9:22): <small>THEN HAM, THE FATHER OF CANAAN, SAW &lt;THE NAKEDNESS OF HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIS TWO BROTHERS OUTSIDE&gt;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 12:15): <small>SO PHARAOH'S COURTIERS SAW HER</small> (i.e., Abram's wife Sarah) <small>&lt;AND PRAISED HER TO PHARAOH, AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH'S HOUSE&gt;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 34:1–2): <small>&lt;NOW LEAH'S DAUGHTER DINAH WENT OUT….&gt; THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR &lt;THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND,&gt; SAW HER….</small> So also &lt;here&gt; (in Numb. 22:2): <small>NOW BALAK &lt;BEN ZIPPOR&gt; SAW</small>. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to someone who appointed guards to guard from an invader; and he had confidence in them, because they were warriors. When the invader came over and killed them, he trembled with fear for himself. It was the same also with Balak. When he saw what happened with Sihon and Og to whom he had been sending payment to guard him, he was afraid for himself. And in addition to that, he had seen the miracles at the wadies of Arnon.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to Numb. 21:26-31, Sihon defeated the King of Moab and captured his territory as far at the Arnon. See above, Numb. 6:47 // Numb. R. 19:25, for a description of the miracles. See also below, Numb. 7:6 // Numb. R. 20:7, according to which Sihon’s victory resulted from a curse by Balaam.</i>

(Numb. 22:3:) <i><small>WAYYAGOR MO'AV</small></i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A traditional translation of these words would be <small>NOW MOAB WAS IN GREAT DREAD</small>, or something similar.</i> What is the meaning of <i><small>WAYYAGOR</small></i> (rt.: <i><small>YGR</small></i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.,</i> Numb. 7:2, cont.; Numb. R. 20:3.</i> When &lt;Israel&gt; appeared to the Ammonites, they appeared clothed for peace. To the Moabites they appeared armed &lt;for battle&gt;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 2:19): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR THE FRONTIER OF THE CHILDREN OF AMMON, DO NOT TROUBLE THEM</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <i><small>GRH</small></i>) <small>THEM</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>DO NOT TROUBLE THEM</small>] with all kinds of trouble, <small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <i><small>GRH</small></i>) <small>THEM</small> with any kind of provocation. In regard to Moab, however, he said (in Deut. 2:9): <small>DO NOT TROUBLE MOAB</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <i><small>GRH</small></i>) <small>THEM WITH WAR</small>]. Whatever you can seize apart from &lt;war&gt;, seize. For that reason they appeared armed, and &lt;the Moabites&gt; gathered themselves (rt.: '<i><small>GR</small></i>) to their cities, as stated (in Numb. 22:3): <small>NOW MOAB <i>YAGOR</i></small> (i.e., <small>GATHERED</small>). <i><small>WAYYAGOR</small></i> (rt.: <i><small>YGR</small></i>, here understood a form of '<i><small>GR</small></i>) can only be a word for a gathering, just as it says (in Prov. 10:5): <small>A PRUDENT CHILD GATHERS</small> (rt.: '<i><small>GR</small></i>) <small>IN THE SUMMER</small>.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:3): <i><small>WAYYAGOR</small></i>. &lt;It is&gt; a word for fear, in that they were afraid because of &lt;Israel&gt;.
(Numb. 22:3, cont:) <small>AND MOAB HAD A HORROR</small> (rt.: <i><small>QWT</small>s</i>) <small>&lt;OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>, because they saw themselves as a &lt;mere&gt; thorn (<i><small>QWT</small>s</i>) over against them.

Siman 4

(Numb. 22:4:) <small>SO MOAB SAID UNTO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small>. What is the relevance of &lt;mentioning&gt; the <small>ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small> here?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:3; Numb. R. 20:4.</i> It is simply that they saw Israel conquering in a way that was not customary for conquerors. They said: Their leader (i.e., Moses) was raised in Midian. Let us learn through them what his character is like. The elders of Midian said to them: His power is only in his mouth. They said to them: We also will bring someone against them who has power in his mouth.
(Numb. 22:4:) <small>SO MOAB SAID UNTO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small>. Do you not find that the Midianites were at war with the Moabites? It is so stated (in Gen. 36:35): <small>&lt;AND HADAD BEN BEDAD,&gt; WHO SMOTE MIDIAN IN THE PLAIN OF MOAB, &lt;REIGNED IN HIS PLACE&gt;</small>. Moreover, the hatred between them had existed from time immemorial. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable [to two] dogs who were hostile to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 31:1-2 (157); <i>Sanh.</i> 105a.</i> A wolf came against one of them. His companion said: If I do not help him, &lt;the wolf&gt; will kill this &lt;dog&gt; today. &lt;Then&gt; tomorrow he will come against me. Therefore Moab formed an alliance with Midian.
(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>NOW THIS HORDE WILL LICK UP ALL THAT IS AROUND US AS THE OX LICKS UP &lt;THE GRASS OF THE FIELD&gt;</small>. Just as the ox has its power in its mouth, so do they have their strength in their mouth. Just as everything an ox licks up has no sign<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion.</i></i> of fertility, &lt;so&gt; also whatever these lick up have no sign of fertility. Just as an ox gores with its horns, &lt;so&gt; also it is with these (according to Deut. 33:17): <small>AND HIS HORNS ARE THE HORNS OF A WILD OX, &lt;AND WITH THEM HE GORES THE NATIONS&gt;</small>.
(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>NOW BALAK BEN ZIPPOR WAS KING OF MOAB</small>. But was he not formerly a prince, as stated (in Josh. 13:21): <small>EVI, REKEM, ZUR, HUR, AND REBA, PRINCES OF SIHON…</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:4. According to Enoch Zundel in his commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef,</i> on this parallel, Balak is to be identified with Zur. So also Issachar Ber Ashkenazi in his commentary, <i>Mattenot Kehunnah,</i> on the parallel in Numb. R. 20:4; Louis Ginzberg, <i>The Legends of the Jews</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1954), vol. III, p. 353; vol. VI, p. 136, n. 791.</i> It is simply that when Sihon was killed they made him king in his place.
(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>AT THAT TIME</small>. When that time was ripe for him.

(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>TO THE LAND OF HIS KINSFOLK</small>, for Balak came from there; and &lt;Balaam&gt; had told him: Your destiny is to become king.
(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>TO SUMMON HIM</small>. Thus he wrote him: Do not suppose that it is for myself alone that you are doing this and that I alone am honoring you. If you uproot them, you shall receive honor from all the nations, so that the Canaanites and the Egyptians shall all bow down to you.
(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE THAT HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT</small>. He said to him: As for you, how does it concern you? He said to him (in Numb. 22:5, cont.): <small>LOOK, THEY HAVE COVERED THE FACE</small> (literally: <small>EYE</small>) <small>OF THE EARTH</small>. &lt;There are&gt; two eyes upon which the earth depends, Sihon and Og.

(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>NOW THEY ARE DWELLING OPPOSITE ME</small> (<i><small>MMWLY</small></i>). &lt;What is actually&gt; written &lt;in the biblical text&gt; is <i><small>MMLY</small></i> (from the root, <i><small>MWL</small>,</i> which means, "cut off"), just as it says (in Ps. 118:11): <small>IN THE NAME OF THE LORD I CUT THEM OFF</small> (rt.: <i><small>MWL</small></i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">With the word rewritten in this sense, the end of Numb. 22:5 reads: <small>NOW THEY ARE DWELLING &lt;THERE&gt; CUTTING ME OFF</small>.

Siman 6

(Numb. 22:6:) <small>SO COME NOW PLEASE, CURSE</small> (<i>arah</i>) <small>&lt;THIS PEOPLE&gt; FOR ME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>CURSE</small> ('<i><small>RH</small></i>) … <small>FOR ME</small>? Perhaps I shall be able to control them little by little, like someone who picks (rt.: '<i><small>RH</small></i>) figs.
(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>FOR THEY ARE MIGHTIER THAN I</small>. &lt;It is&gt; not that they are more valiant than I, nor &lt;is it&gt; that their forces are more numerous than mine. It is simply that they conquer through their mouth, &lt;and this is&gt; something that I cannot do.
(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO SMITE THEM</small>. What reason was there for this one to engage them (i.e., Israel) in war? Did not the Holy One tell them this, that were not to take any of their land? &lt;It was&gt; simply that &lt;Balak&gt; was more of a master of sorceries and divinations than Balaam, for it is so written of him (in Numb. 22:2): <small>NOW BALAK &lt;BEN ZIPPOR&gt; SAW</small> (in a vision), except that he did not really comprehend the things &lt;he saw&gt;. And so it says (in Is. 47:13–14): <small>YOU ARE WEARIED WITH YOUR MANY DELIBERATIONS; LET THOSE WHO STUDY THE HEAVENS PLEASE STAND UP AND SAVE YOU; LET THOSE WHO GAZE AT THE STARS MAKE KNOWN MONTH BY MONTH WHATEVER WILL COME UPON YOU. SEE THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE STRAW; &lt;FIRE CONSUMES THEM&gt;….</small> When he saw that Israel would fall into his hand, he therefore gave his daughter over (to prostitution);<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. 25:1-15. Numb. 25:15 specifically identifies the sacred prostitute Cozbi as the daughter of Zur, whom the midrash (above, section 7:4) has already identified with Balak.</i> and through her twenty-four thousand fell. To this end he would have engaged them in war, but he did not know how. (Numb. 22:6:) <small>PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO SMITE</small> (<i><small>NKH</small></i>) <small>THEM</small>. As one discounts (rt.: <i><small>NKH</small></i>) one twenty-fourth of a <i>seah</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">On allowing a given species to have up to 1/24 of another species, see <i>Kil.</i> 2:1; <i>yKil</i>. 2:1 (27c); <i>BB</i> 6:2; <i>BB</i> 93b-94a, where as elsewhere a <i>rova</i>‘ is a quarter of a <i>qav</i>, which in turn is one sixth of a <i>se’ah.</i> Thus one <i>rova</i>’ equals one twenty-fourth of a <i>se’ah.</i></i> so also did there fall from Israel twenty-four thousand, one &lt;thousand&gt; less &lt;than should have fallen&gt;. {Interpretation: 24 X 20,000 = 480,000, and 24 X 5,000 = 120,000, It turns out that, if 25,000 is found to be 1/24 of 600,000 and only 24,000 fell, then 1,000 are missing.}<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In a long note Buber further explains that apart from the law of mixtures, in the removal of the <i>hallah,</i> what is taken is generally 1/24 of the dough (so <i>Hal</i>. 2:7). Buber also notes a variant reading which substitutes <i>menabber</i> (denoting one who removes the hallah) for <i>menakkah</i> (translated here as “discount”). So the Holy One cleansed Israel by removing 1/24 of the people. However, since there were 600,000 Israelites, 25,000 (=1/24 of 600,000), not 24,000, should have been removed. The thousand extra can be explained on analogy with the law of mixtures allowing 1/24 for impurities. The first part of the interpretation in the text comes from dividing 25,000 into two parts of 20,000 + 5,000 and then multiplying each separately and adding the results, instead of simply multiplying 25,000 by 24,000. Regarding the number of Israelites in the desert, Scripture gives the 600,000 figure only in Exod. 12:37. Cf. Exod. 38:26; Numb. 1:46; 2:32, which fix the figure at 603,550 adult males excluding Levites; also Numb. 26:57, which reports a census figure of 601,730 after the removal of the 24,000 in Numb. 25:9.</i>
(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>AND DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM THE LAND</small>, for he only desired to drive them away, so that they would not enter the land.
(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>FOR I KNOW THAT WHOMEVER YOU BLESS IS BLESSED AND THAT WHOMEVER YOU CURSE IS CURSED</small>. Where is it shown that he knew? When Sihon desired to fight with Moab &lt;and&gt; was afraid because they were warriors, he hired Balaam and his father to curse Moab, for it says (in Numb. 21:27–29): <small>THEREFORE THOSE WHO SPEAK IN PARABLES SAY: &lt;COME TO HESHBON, LET IT BE BUILT; LET THE CITY OF SIHON BE ESTABLISHED&gt;…. FOR A FIRE HAS COME FORTH FROM HESHBON, &lt;A FLAME FROM THE CITY OF SIHON. IT HAS DEVOURED AR OF MOAB&gt;…. WOE BE TO YOU, O MOAB!</small>…. Ergo it says (In Numb. 22:6): <small>FOR I KNOW &lt;THAT WHOMEVER YOU BLESS IS BLESSED AND THAT WHOMEVER YOU CURSE IS CURSED&gt;</small>.

(Numb. 22:7:) <small>SO THE ELDERS OF MOAB AND THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN WENT WITH &lt;THE TOOLS FOR&gt; DIVINATION IN THEIR HAND</small>, for they brought in their hands all kinds of divining instruments through which one divines, so as not to give him an excuse &lt;for not coming&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:5; Numb. R. 20:8.</i> So the divining instruments were in the hands of the elders of Midian, for they said: If he comes with us, he will succeed; but if he delays &lt;even&gt; for an hour, he will be of no use. As soon as they saw that he said (in vs. 8): Lodge here tonight, the elders of Midian went away, because they knew through their divinations that they were of no use.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sic.</i> The parallel texts have the following: “That he was of no benefit.”</i>

(Numb. 22:9:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AND SAID: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU?</small> This text is related (to Prov. 28:10): <small>ONE WHO LEADS THE UPRIGHT ASTRAY ON AN EVIL COURSE</small> [<small>WILL FALL INTO HIS OWN PIT</small>]. Thus at first mortals [behaved] with propriety, but because of his (Balaam's) words, they became unbridled in sexual matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:5, cont.; Numb. R. 20:9; also <i>Sanh</i>. 106a.</i> Thus of former &lt;generations&gt; [it is written] (in Gen. 29:9): <small>RACHEL CAME WITH THE SHEEP</small>. (Exod. 2:16): <small>NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although these seven daughters and Rachel were shepherdesses, they had no fear of being alone among males.</i> Balaam the Wicked arose and led mortals astray into unchastity; but as he led &lt;others&gt; astray, he &lt;himself&gt; was led astray. By the &lt;very&gt; counsel he gave, he &lt;himself&gt; fell. [This is what is written] (in Prov. 28:10): <small>&lt;ONE WHO LEADS THE UPRIGHT ASTRAY ON AN EVIL COURSE&gt; WILL FALL INTO HIS OWN PIT</small>. So the Holy One led him astray, as stated (in Job 12:23): <small>HE EXALTS THE NATIONS AND DESTROYS THEM. HE ENLARGES THE NATIONS AND LEADS THEM AWAY</small>. &lt;When the Holy One&gt; asked him (in Numb. 22:9): <small>WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU</small>? That Wicked one said: I know nothing about them, except that (according to vss. 10–11): <small>KING BALAK BEN ZIPPOR OF MOAB SENT &lt;THIS MESSAGE&gt; UNTO ME: BEHOLD THE</small> (<i>sic</i>) <small>PEOPLE HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT …; &lt;COME NOW, CURSE</small> (<i>qavah</i>) <small>THEM FOR ME. PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM AND DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM THE LAND&gt;</small>. &lt;This is&gt; to make known that he (Balaam) hated Israel more then Balak, because (in Numb. 22:6) Balak did not say <i>qavah</i> (as Balaam claimed he had said in Numb. 22:11) but <i>arah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Both words mean “curse,” but the former is worse than the latter, because <i>qavah</i> involves the use of the Divine Name.</i> This one (Balaam), however, explicitly said: <small>CURSE</small> (<i>qavah</i>) (in vs. 11). Moreover, while the former (Balak) said (in Numb. 22:6): <small>AND DRIVE THEM AWAY &lt;FROM THE LAND&gt;</small>, the latter (Balaam) said &lt;simply&gt; (in vs. 11): <small>AND DRIVE THEM OUT</small> &lt;i.e.,&gt; from this world and from the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">While Balak had qualified the driving away of Israel with <small>FROM THE LAND</small>, Balaam did no such thing; therefore, one must assume that Balaam wanted to drive Israel, not only from the land, but even from the world to come.</i>

Siman 9

(Numb. 22:12:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO BALAAM: YOU SHALL NOT GO WITH THEM</small>. He said to him: If that is the case, I will curse them from where I am.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:6; Numb. R. 20:10.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT CURSE THE PEOPLE</small>. He said to him: Let me bless them. He said to him: They do not need your blessing, (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR THEY ARE BLESSED</small>. Similarly one says to a hornet: None of your honey and none of your sting.
(Numb. 22:13:) <small>SO BALAAM AROSE IN THE MORNING AND SAID TO THE PRINCES OF BALAK: GO UNTO YOUR OWN LAND…</small>. Balaam did not tell them: The Holy One did not give me permission either to go or to curse. &lt;He&gt; simply &lt;said&gt; (Ibid., cont.:): <small>THE LORD REFUSED TO LET ME GO WITH YOU</small>. He said to me: It is not in accord with your honor to go with these people. Rather &lt;you must go&gt; with people greater then they, since he takes pleasure in my being honored. (Numb. 22:14:) <small>SO THE PRINCES OF MOAB AROSE AND</small> {<small>WENT</small>} [<small>CAME</small>] <small>UNTO BALAK AND SAID: BALAAM HAS REFUSED TO GO WITH US</small>. Therefore (in vs. 15): <small>ONCE AGAIN BALAK SENT PRINCES, MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE HONORABLE THAN THE FIRST ONES</small>.
(Numb. 22:16–17:) <small>THEN THEY CAME UNTO BALAAM AND SAID TO HIM: THUS HAS BALAK BEN ZIPPOR SAID: &lt; PLEASE DO NOT REFRAIN FROM COMING UNTO ME.&gt; FOR I WILL SURELY HONOR YOU GREATLY</small>. &lt;Even&gt; more than what you [wanted] formerly I will give you. Moreover, everything that you desire and whatever you ordain I will do.
(Numb. 22:18:) <small>BUT BALAAM ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THE</small> {<small>PRINCES</small>} [<small>SERVANTS</small>] <small>OF BALAK: &lt;EVEN&gt; IF BALAK SHOULD GIVE ME &lt;A HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD, I COULD NOT TRANSGRESS THE COMMAND OF THE LORD MY GOD TO DO LESS OR MORE&gt;</small>. From here you learn that he had {a haughty spirit, an evil eye} [an evil eye, a haughty spirit], a greedy soul:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avot</i> 5:19.</i> An evil eye, since it is stated (in Numb. 24:2): <small>THEN BALAAM RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ISRAEL DWELLING TRIBE BY TRIBE</small>. A haughty spirit, &lt;since&gt; (according to Numb. 22:13): <small>&lt;SO BALAAM AROSE IN THE MORNING AND SAID TO THE PRINCES OF BALAK: GO UNTO YOUR OWN LAND, FOR&gt; THE LORD REFUSED TO LET ME GO WITH YOU</small>. A greedy soul, &lt;since&gt; (according to Numb. 22:18): <small>&lt;EVEN&gt; IF BALAK SHOULD GIVE ME</small> [<small>A HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD</small>].
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>I COULD NOT TRANSGRESS</small> [<small>THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small>] <small>&lt;MY GOD&gt;</small>. &lt;He was&gt; prophesying that he could not annul the blessings with which the ancestors had been blessed by the mouth of the Divine Presence.
(Numb. 22:19:) <small>NOW YOU ALSO PLEASE STAY HERE TONIGHT</small>, because in the end you will go in disappointment like the former &lt;messengers&gt;.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT ELSE</small> (rt.: <i><small>YSP</small></i>) <small>THE LORD &lt;MAY SAY TO ME&gt;</small>. Thus he prophesied that the Holy One was going to multiply (rt.: <i><small>YSP</small></i>) blessings for them at his hands.

Siman 10

(Numb. 22:20:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AT NIGHT</small>. This text is related (to Job 33:15–17): <small>IN A DREAM</small>, {<small>IN</small>} <small>A VISION OF THE NIGHT …, THEN HE UNCOVERS A HUMAN EAR …, TO TURN AWAY</small> {<small>AN ACTION FROM A PERSON</small>} [<small>A PERSON FROM AN ACTION</small>] <small>AND CONCEAL PRIDE FROM A MAN</small>. What did he <small>CONCEAL&lt;…. &gt; FROM A MAN?</small><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:7; Numb. R. 20:11.</i> The Holy One hid from him (i.e, from Balaam) that his going (with Balak's messengers) would obliterate him from the world and bring him to the grave; for when someone is going to sin, Satan dances before him until he completes the transgression. As soon as he has obliterated him,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel passage in the traditional <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:7, reads: “As soon as he has transgressed.”</i> he returns to inform him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 7: 22–23): <small>GOING AFTER HER RIGHT AWAY, &lt;HE COMES LIKE AN OX TO THE SLAUGHTER&gt; …, UNTIL AN ARROW PIERCES HIS LIVER</small>. So did the Holy One hide &lt;obliteration from Balaam, until he had gone and destroyed his soul. After he had taken leave of his honor, had gone and destroyed his soul, and realized how he stood, he began to beg for his soul (saying in Numb. 23:10): <small>LET MY SOUL DIE THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.

Siman 11

(Numb. 22:20:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AT NIGHT</small>. This text is related (to Exod. 12:42): <small>THAT WAS FOR THE LORD A NIGHT OF VIGIL TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, THAT WAS THIS VERY NIGHT</small>. All miracles which were done for Israel and which involved exacting retribution for them from the wicked took place at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:8; Numb. R. 20:12.</i> (Gen. 31:24:) <small>AND GOD CAME UNTO LABAN THE ARAMEAN IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>. (Gen. 20:3:) <small>BUT GOD CAME UNTO ABIMELECH</small> [<small>IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>]. (Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. (Exod. 14:20:) <small>THUS THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS WHICH LIT UP THE NIGHT</small>. (Gen. 14:15:) <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is necessary to provide a miracle. A more common translation would be <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt;HIS FORCES&gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.</i> And &lt;so it was with&gt; all of them (as in Exod. 12:42): <small>A NIGHT OF VIGIL</small>.
Another interpretation: Why did he reveal himself to him (i.e., Balaam) by night? He was not worthy of &lt;receiving&gt; the Holy Spirit [except at night], because he speaks at night with all the prophets of the star worshipers. And so Eliphaz (traditionally non-Jewish) says (in Job 4:13): <small>IN OPINIONS FROM NIGHT VISIONS</small>.
(Numb. 22:20, cont.:) <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>. As soon as he had become defiant, then it is stated (in Numb. 22:22): <small>BUT GOD</small>'s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING</small>. The Holy One said: You wicked man! I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked. In as much as you want to be obliterated from the world, <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>.
(Numb. 22:20), cont.:) <small>BUT ONLY THE THING</small> [<small>THAT I TELL YOU ARE TO DO</small>]. &lt;These words are&gt; to teach you that he went with a warning. Immediately he got up early in the morning (according to vs. 21): S<small>O BALAAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, SADDLED HIS</small> {<small>HE</small>-} [<small>SHE</small>-] <small>ASS, &lt;AND WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB&gt;</small>. Did he not have a male or female slave? It was simply that hatred for Israel came first for him. So he arose quickly all by himself. The Holy One said to him: You wicked man! Their ancestor Abraham has already anticipated you at the binding of his son Isaac. (Ergo Gen. 22:3:) <small>SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, &lt;SADDLED HIS HE-ASS&gt;…</small>.
(Numb. 22:21), cont.:) <small>AND WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB</small>. &lt;These words are&gt; to teach you that he was glad at the tribulation of Israel.
(Numb. 22:22:) <small>BUT GOD</small>'s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING, AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD TOOK A STAND</small> [<small>IN THE ROAD AS HIS ADVERSARY</small> (<i>satan</i>)].<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A good example of this Hebrew word when it is not used as a proper noun.</i> He was an angel of mercy, but to &lt;Balaam&gt; he had become an adversary (<i>satan</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 20:13.</i> And so he said [unto] Balaam:You have caused me to practice a skill that is not my own, as stated (Numb. 22:32): <small>HERE I HAVE COME OUT AS AN ADVERSARY</small> (<i>satan</i>).
(Numb. 22:22, cont.:) <small>AND TWO OF HIS SERVANT BOYS WERE WITH HIM</small>. This is customary for one going out on the road. It is necessary for two to attend him. Then in turn they attend each other.
(Numb. 22:23:) <small>NOW THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD</small>. Was not the angel able to breathe on him and take away his spirit? Instead, he drew his sword. And look at what is written about Sennacherib (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21.): <small>&lt;SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THAT NIGHT&gt; THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &lt;ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND&gt; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA…</small>. It is also written (in Is. 40:24): <small>HE BLOWS ON THEM AND THEY WITHER</small>. However, he said to him: &lt;Skill with&gt; the mouth was given to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>; but the nations all live by the sword. Now you are trading off your skill and coming against them with their &lt;skill&gt;. I also am coming against you with your own &lt;skill&gt;.

Siman 12

(Numb. 22:24:) <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD IN A LANE BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS</small>. Could he not have gone after him into the field?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:8; Numb. R. 20:14.</i> It is simply that this is the nature of the Holy One. When a king of flesh and blood sends an executioner<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>speculator</i> (“examiner”).</i> to kill a particular person, he goes after him for many days, so that this person who has incurred the penalty of death &lt;continues&gt; eating and drinking, while the executioner goes after him from place to place. With the Holy One, however, it is not like that. Rather the executioner is in his place and whoever has incurred the penalty of death comes to him of his own accord. So that the angel would not be bothered with going after Balaam, he simply went ahead of him on the road, for it is so written (ibid.): <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD IN A LANE BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS…</small>. He said to him: Shall the vineyards (i.e., Israel) be sold among the foxes?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel texts. <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:8, has “to the foxes”; and Numb. R. 20:14 has “like foxes.”</i>
(Numb. 22:24, cont.:) <small>WITH A WALL ON ONE SIDE AND A WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE</small>. You cannot prevail against them, because in their hand (according to Exod. 32:15) are <small>TABLETS WRITTEN</small> [<small>ON BOTH THEIR SIDES</small>], <small>ON THE ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE WRITTEN</small>.
(Numb. 22:25–26:) <small>WHEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, SHE WAS PRESSED &lt;AGAINST THE WALL AND PRESSED BALAAM'</small>s <small>FOOT AGAINST THE WALL; SO HE STRUCK IT AGAIN&gt;. THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD MOVED FORWARD AGAIN &lt;AND STOOD IN A PLACE SO NARROW THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT&gt;</small>. What reason did he have to go ahead of him three times? He showed him here symbols of the &lt; three&gt; patriarchs. When he stood before him the first time, there was space on one side and on the other, [as stated] (in Numb. 22:23): <small>SO THE SHE-ASS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE ROAD</small>. On the second occasion she could only move to one side. On the third occasion (according to Numb. 22:26) <small>THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT</small>. So what do the symbols mean?

        <br>If he ever sought to curse the children of Abraham, he would find the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah on one side and on the other.
        <br>&lt;If&gt; he sought to curse the children of Isaac, he would find the children of Esau on one side, and (according to Numb. 22:25) <small>SHE WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE WALL</small>.
        <br>In the case of the children of Jacob, however, he found among them no defect with which to touch them. It is therefore written about the third occasion (in vs. 26): <small>IN A PLACE SO NARROW</small>.
    
(Numb. 22:27:) <small>WHEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, SHE LAY DOWN UNDER BALAAM. &lt;SO BALAAM</small>'s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED,&gt; AND HE STRUCK THE SHE-ASS WITH A STICK</small> (<i><small>MQL</small></i>), because of the shame with which she had shamed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Both the noun and verb, translated here as <small>SHAME</small>, come from the root, <i>BZH</i>; but the interpretation may have been suggested by a word with a similar meaning, namely <i>MQLH</i>, which means “putting to shame.” This word could have implied the relation between shame and <i>MQL</i> as used in Numb. 22:27.</i>

Siman 13

(Numb. 22:28:) <small>THEN THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE SHE-ASS</small>, in order to make known to you that the mouth and the tongue are under his (i.e., the Holy One's) control, so that if he desired to curse, his mouth was under his control.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:9; Numb.

(Numb. 22:29:) <small>BUT BALAAM SAID TO THE SHE-ASS: YOU HAVE TRULY MADE A FOOL OF ME!</small> Even though he was a star worshiper, he spoke in the holy tongue.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>IF I HAD A SWORD IN MY HAND, I WOULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW</small>. &lt;The situation &gt; is comparable to a physician who came to cure with his tongue a person bitten by a snake on the road. On the way he saw a lizard. He began searching for a stick to kill it. They said to him: Are you unable to get this &lt;creature&gt; (without a stick)? How do you come to cure with your tongue a person bitten by a snake? Similarly, the she-ass said to Balaam: You cannot kill me unless you have a sword in your hand. How do you intend to uproot an entire people! He was silent and could not find an answer. The princes of Moab began to express astonishment, for they had seen a miracle the like of which had never happened in the world. Now there are some who say that he said to them: She is not mine. &lt;The ass&gt; answered him (in Numb. 22:30): <small>AM I NOT YOUR SHE-ASS, UPON WHICH YOU HAVE RIDDEN ALL YOUR LIFE LONG UNTIL THIS DAY!</small> Here you learn that he was not an old man, since &lt;the ass&gt; was older than he.
(Numb. 22:30, cont.:) <small>HAVE I EVER BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING THIS TO YOU?</small> As soon as she had spoken, she died, so that the people would not say: This is the one that spoke, and make it an object of reverence.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:30): The Holy One had respect for the honor of that wicked man, lest they would say: This is the very one that removed Balaam.

(Numb. 22:31:) <small>THEN THE LORD UNCOVERED THE EYES OF BALAAM AND HE SAW &lt;THE ANGEL OF THE LORD….&gt;</small> Was he blind?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Tanh. 7:10; Numb. R. 20:15.</i> &lt;These words were&gt; simply to inform him that even the eye is under in his power.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN HE BOWED DOWN AND PROSTRATED HIMSELF ON HIS FACE</small>, because &lt;the angel&gt; had spoken with him.
(Numb. 22:32:) <small>AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM: &lt;WHY DID YOU STRIKE YOUR SHE-ASS THESE THREE TIMES &gt;</small>? Did the the angel come to seek satisfaction at his hand for the she-ass? He said to him: Now if for the she-ass, which has neither its own merit nor merit from ancestors, I have been commanded to claim satisfaction from your hand, how much the more so for an entire people that you have come to uproot!
(Numb. 22:32, cont.:) <small>HERE I HAVE COME OUT AS AN ADVERSARY</small> (<i>satan</i>), <small>BECAUSE YOUR WAY IS CONTRARY</small> (<i><small>YRT</small></i>) <small>TO ME</small>. &lt;<i><small>YRT</small></i> is interpreted as an acronym concerning the ass for&gt; <i>yare'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For this word the translation follows the parallel in the traditional <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:10, and in Numb.

(Numb. 22:33:) <small>FOR THE SHE-ASS SAW ME AND TURNED AWAY FROM ME THESE THREE TIMES. IF SHE HAD NOT TURNED AWAY FROM ME, SURELY JUST NOW I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU AND LET HER LIVE</small>. From here you have learned that he killed the ass.
(Numb. 22:34:) <small>THEN BALAAM SAID UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD: I HAVE SINNED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW</small>. &lt;These words are&gt; to teach you that he was completely evil. He knew that no one stands facing divine punishment without repentance; for whenever anyone sins and says: I have sinned, the angel has no authority to touch him.
(Ibid.:) <small>BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW</small>. Although that wicked man was praising him and had knowledge of the most high, his mouth bore witness and said (in Numb. 22:34): <small>I DID NOT KNOW</small>.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND NOW, IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES, I WILL RETURN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This verb can also be rendered as “repent.”</i> He said to him: I did not go until the Holy One said to me (in Numb. 22:20): <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>; yet you are saying that I should return! &lt;Indeed&gt; such is his practice! Similarly, did he not tell Abraham to sacrifice his son? Then after that &lt;it is stated&gt; (in Gen. 22:11–12): <small>BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED UNTO HIM &lt;OUT OF THE HEAVENS AND SAID: ABRAHAM! ABRAHAM! AND HE SAID: HERE AM I.&gt; THEN HE SAID: DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND &lt;AGAINST THE LAD&gt;</small>. He is used to saying something, then to have an angel come and reverse it. He said to me (in Numb. 22:20): <small>GO WITH THEM</small>; but now (in vs. 34), <small>IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES, I WILL RETURN</small>.
(Numb. 22:35:) <small>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID UNTO BALAAM: GO WITH THE MEN</small>; for your lot is &lt;to be&gt; with them, and your end is to be obliterated with them from the world.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO BALAAM WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF BALAK</small>. [&lt;These words&gt; teach that just as they were happy to curse &lt;Israel&gt;, so was he happy.

Then he showed him how they had broken through and crossed the border of Sihon,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel texts in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:10, and Numb.

(Numb. 22:37:) <small>THEN BALAK SAID UNTO BALAAM: DID I NOT TRULY SEND UNTO YOU &lt;TO SUMMON YOU? WHY DID YOU NOT COME UNTO ME?&gt; AM I REALLY UNABLE TO HONOR YOU&gt;?</small> He prophesied that his end would be to go in disgrace. Then did Balaam also answer him concerning the matter (in Numb. 22:38:) <small>SO BALAAM SAID UNTO BALAK: SEE, I HAVE COME UNTO YOU NOW, BUT AM I REALLY ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL?</small> for I do not have authority to say what I want.

THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD….</small> But the wicked say a lot and do little. Barak said (in Numb. 22:17): <small>FOR I WILL SURELY HONOR YOU GREATLY…</small>. When &lt;Balaam&gt; came, he only sent him an ox and a sheep. Balaam began gnashing his teeth at him, for he was greedy.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">So the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 20:17.

(Numb. 22:41:) <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT BARAK TOOK BALAAM AND BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE HIGH PLACES OF BAAL, &lt;AND FROM THERE HE SAW THE EDGE OF THE PEOPLE&gt;</small>.

(Numb. 23:1:) <small>THEN BALAAM SAID</small> [<small>UNTO BALAK</small>]: <small>BUILD &lt;SEVEN ALTARS&gt; FOR ME HERE, &lt;AND MAKE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS READY FOR ME HERE&gt;….</small> Why seven altars? &lt;They&gt; corresponded to seven righteous ones from Adam to Moses, who built seven altars and had been accepted: Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Then &lt;Balaam&gt; said: Why did you accept these? Was it not because of a liturgy which they performed before you that you accepted them? Is it not &lt;more&gt; suitable for you to be served by seventy nations and not by &lt;merely&gt; one nation? The Holy Spirit answered him (in Prov. 17:1): <small>BETTER A DRY MORSEL WITH TRANQUILITY THAN A HOUSE FULL OF QUARRELSOME FEASTING</small>. Better (in the words of Lev. 7:10) <small>A GRAIN OFFERING MIXED WITH OIL OR DRY</small> than (in Prov. 17:1) <small>A HOUSE FULL OF QUARRELSOME FEASTING</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The words <small>HOUSE</small> and <small>FEASTING</small> can also mean “temple” and “sacrifice” respectively.</i> for you want to introduce strife between me and Israel.
(Numb. 23:2–3:) <small>THEN BALAK DID AS BALAAM HAD</small> {<small>SAID</small>} [<small>COMMANDED</small>]. <small>&lt;SO BALAK AND BALAAM OFFERED A BULL AND A RAM ON EACH ALTAR&gt;. THEN BALAAM SAID &lt;TO BALAK&gt;: STAND BESIDE &lt;YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS, AND LET ME GO. PERHAPS THE LORD WILL COME TO MEET ME, AND WHATEVER HE SHOWS ME I WILL TELL YOU.&gt; SO HE WENT ALONE</small> (rt.: <i>Sh<small>PH</small></i>). &lt;Balaam&gt; had been at ease (rt.: <i>ShPH</i>) about cursing. Thus he had been at ease until that moment, but from that moment on he was troubled.
(Numb. 23:4:) <small>THEN GOD ENCOUNTERED BALAAM</small>. The Holy One said to him: You evil man! What are you doing?<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:12.</i>
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND &lt;BALAAM&gt; SAID UNTO HIM: I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &lt;AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR&gt;</small>. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a money-changer who lies about the weights. When the head of the market place came, he noticed him. He said to him: Why are you breaking the law and lying about the weights? &lt;The money changer&gt; said to him: I have already sent a gift<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i> to the house of my lord. So also it was in the case of Balaam. The Holy Spirit cried out to him. It said to him: You Evil Man! What are you doing. He said to it (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &lt;AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR&gt;</small>. It said to him (in Prov. 15:17): <small>BETTER A MEAL OF VEGETABLE GREENS</small> [<small>WHERE THERE IS LOVE THAN A FATTENED OX WITH HATRED IN IT</small>]. &lt;Better&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This word is found in the parallels of <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:12, and Numb.

For this interpretation, see n. 103 in the Buber text. Note also that this interpretation of Numb. 23:5 also occurs in <i>Sanh.</i> 105b, where the hook allusion is clearer.</i>
(Numb. 23:5–6:) <small>&lt; … &gt; AND SAID: RETURN UNTO BALAK AND SPEAK THUS. SO HE RETURNED UNTO HIM, AND THERE HE WAS STANDING BESIDE HIS BURNT OFFERINGS &lt;WITH ALL THE PRINCES OF MOAB&gt;</small>, who stood anxiously awaiting &lt;the time&gt; when he would come.

Siman 17

(Numb. 23:7:) <small>SO HE TOOK UP HIS THEME AND SAID: IT IS FROM ARAM THAT BALAK HAS BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST</small>. I was one of the exalted ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramim.</i> The midrash links this word with <small>ARAM</small> in Numb. 23:7.</i> but Balak has brought me down to the pit of corruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 20:19; also above, Lev. 5:1 and the notes there.</i>
(ibid.:) <small>BROUGHT ME</small> (<i>yanheni,</i> rt.: <i><small>NHH</small></i>) &lt;is to be understood&gt; just as you say (in Ezek. 32:18): <small>BRING</small> (rt.: <i><small>NHH</small></i>) <small>THE MASSES OF EGYPT AND CAST THEM DOWN … &lt;UNTO THE LOWEST PART OF THE NETHERWORLD ALONG WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Numb. 23:7 comes to mean that Balak <small>BROUGHT</small> (rt.: <i><small>NHH</small></i>) Balaam down to the grave. The unusual biblical translation is necessary to fit the sense of the midrash.</i>
Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7): <small>FROM ARAM</small>. I was with the highest (<i>ram</i>) of the high, and Balak has brought me down from my glory. &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to one who was walking with the king. When he saw &lt;some&gt; robbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> he left the king and toured along with the robbers. When he returned to be with the king, he said to him: Go with whomever you have toured with, because it not possible for you to walk again with me. Similarly Balaam had been bound to the Holy Spirit. When he paired himself with Balak, the Holy Spirit departed from him. So he returned to being a diviner as in the beginning. Thus it is stated (at his execution in Josh. 13:22): <small>BALAAM</small> [<small>BEN BEOR</small>] <small>THE DIVINER</small>. Therefore did he cry: I was high up (<i>ram</i>), and Balak brought me down.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7): <small>&lt;IT IS&gt; FROM ARAM &lt;THAT BALAK&gt; HAS BROUGHT ME</small>. &lt;Balaam&gt; said to &lt;Balak&gt;: We are alike, even both of us, for being ungrateful, because were it not for our father Abraham, there would have been no Balak. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN GOD DESTROYED THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN, GOD REMEMBERED ABRAHAM AND SENT LOT AWAY</small>. Except for Abraham, he would not have delivered Lot from Sodom; and you are one of the children of the children of Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">As a Moabite, Balak was descended from Moab, the son of Lot. See Gen. 19:37.</i> Moreover, if it were not for their father Jacob, I should not have been present in the world, because Laban had sons only through the merit of Jacob, since it is written at the beginning (in Gen. 29:9): <small>RACHEL CAME WITH THE SHEEP</small>. Now if he had sons, how was his daughter a shepherdess? As soon as Jacob came there, sons were given to him, as stated (in Gen. 31:1): <small>NOW HE HEARD THE THINGS THAT LABAN</small>'s <small>SONS &lt;WERE SAYING&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Jewish tradition gives three views on Balaam’s relation to Laban: That he was Laban himself, that he was Laban’s nephew, and that he was Laban’s grandson. See Ginzberg, vol. III, p. 354; vol.. V, p. 303, n. 229; vol. VI, pp. 123f., nn. 722f.; p. 130, n. 764.</i> (Gen. 30:27:) <small>BUT &lt;LABAN&gt; SAID &lt;UNTO HIM&gt; … I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE</small>. So if it were not for their ancestors, you and I would not have been present in the world.
(Numb. 23:7, cont.:) <small>COME, PLEASE</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Na.</i> The word is not found in the Masoretic Text.</i> <small>CURSE &lt;JACOB&gt; FOR ME</small>. Whoever curses them (i.e., the children of Jacob) is cursing himself, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:3): <small>AND THE ONE WHO CURSES YOU, I WILL CURSE</small>. It also says (in Gen. 27:29): <small>CURSED BE THOSE WHO CURSE YOU</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Gen. 6:16.</i> <small>AND BLESSED BE THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>.
(Numb. 23:7:) <small>COME, CURSE &lt;JACOB&gt; FOR ME</small>. If you had told me to curse another people, for example, [the children of] Abraham and Isaac, I would have been able &lt;to do so&gt;. But Jacob? When a king selects a portion for himself, and someone else gets up and speaks disparagingly about it, will he keep his life? Now these people are his heritage, his portion, and his treasure. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:9): <small>FOR THE LORD</small>'s <small>SHARE IS HIS PEOPLE; JACOB THE PORTION OF HIS HERITAGE</small>. (Exod. 19:5:) <small>AND YOU SHALL BE MY TREASURE FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES…</small>.
(Numb. 23:7, cont.:) <small>AND COME, DENOUNCE ISRAEL</small>. When a king takes a crown and puts it on his head, and someone says of it that it is nothing, will he keep his life? Now in regard to these people it is written about them (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>.

Siman 18

(Numb. 23:8:) <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small> When they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed. When Jacob went in to receive the blessings, as written (in Gen. 27:16): <small>THEN &lt;SHE CLOTHED HIS ARMS AND THE HAIRLESS PART OF HIS NECK&gt; WITH THE SKINS OF GOAT KIDS</small>. His father said to him (in Gen. 27:18): <small>WHO ARE YOU</small>? He said to him (in vs. 19): <small>I AM ESAU, YOUR FIRST-BORN</small>. Does not the one who puts forth a lie with his mouth deserve to be cursed? Yet not only &lt;was he not cursed&gt;, but he was blessed, as stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>HE SHALL ALSO BE BLESSED</small>. So how do I curse (in the words of Numb. 23:8) <small>WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED</small>?
Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8): [<small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>] According to universal custom, when a legion<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legio.</i></i> rebels against the king, it incurs the penalty of death. Now since these denied and revolted against him, when they said to the calf (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>, did they not, therefore, deserve to have him destroy them at that time? &lt;Still&gt; he did not cease to cherish them. Instead he had clouds of glory accompany them. Nor did he withhold from them the manna and the well. And so it says (in Neh. 9:18–20): <small>EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES A MOLTEN CALF …, YOU IN YOUR GREAT MERCIES DID NOT</small> {<small>UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>) [<small>ABANDON THEM IN THE DESERT…</small>. ] <small>AND YOU DID NOT WITHHOLD YOUR MANNA FROM THEIR MOUTH</small>. How can I curse them? This &lt;question&gt; is related (to Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>
[Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>] When he commanded them concerning the blessings and the curses, he mentioned them (as <small>THE PEOPLE</small>) in connection with the blessings where it is stated (in Deut. 27:12): <small>THESE SHALL STAND &lt;ON MOUNT GERIZIM&gt; FOR BLESSING THE PEOPLE</small>; but he did not claim them in connection with the curses. Thus it is stated (in vs. 13): <small>AND THESE SHALL STAND ON MOUNT EBAL FOR THE CURSE</small>. Moreover, when they sin and say they have brought a cursed state upon themselves, it is not written that he himself is bringing them (i.e., the individual curses); but with respect to the blessings, he &lt;himself&gt; is blessing them, for so it says (in Deut. 28:1): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF YOU DILIGENTLY OBEY &lt;…&gt;, THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL SET YOU HIGH &lt;OVER ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH&gt;</small>. (vs. 8:) <small>THE LORD WILL COMMAND THE BLESSING TO BE WITH YOU</small>. With respect to the curses (according to Deut. 28:15): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF YOU DO NOT OBEY</small> […], <small>THEN &lt;ALL THESE CURSES&gt; SHALL COME UPON YOU</small>, &lt;i.e.,&gt; of their own accord. Ergo (in Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>

Siman 19

(Numb. 23:9:) <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS I SEE HIM</small>, in order to make the hatred of that evil man (i.e., Balaam) known to you, from whose blessings you may know his thoughts. To what is he comparable? To someone who came to chop down a tree. One who is not an expert chops the branches off one at a time and becomes tired, but the clever one exposes the roots and &lt;then&gt; chops it down. Similarly that wicked man said: How shall I curse each and every tribe? Rather I will go to their roots. When he came to touch them, he found them hard &lt;to cut&gt;. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 23:9): <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS &lt;I SEE HIM&gt;</small>.
[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 23:9): <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS &lt;I SEE HIM&gt;</small>. These are the patriarchs. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND FROM THE HILLS I BEHOLD HIM</small>. These are the matriarchs.
(Numb. 23:9, cont.:) <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE DWELLING ALONE</small>. When he makes them rejoice, no nation rejoices along with them. Rather they are all afflicted, [as stated] (in Deut. 32:12): <small>THE LORD ALONE DID LEAD HIM</small>, [<small>AND THERE WAS NO FOREIGN GOD WITH HIM</small>]. But when the nations are rejoicing in this world, they (i.e., the children of Israel) eat with each and every kingdom, and no one is charging &lt;such pleasures&gt; against their account (rt: <i><small>HS</small>h<small>B</small></i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In other words the pleasures that Israel enjoys in this world are not to be deducted from their pleasures in the world to come.</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 23:9, cont.): <small>AND THEY SHALL NOT BE RECKONED</small> (rt.: <i><small>HS</small>h<small>B</small></i>) <small>AMONG THE NATIONS</small>.

Siman 20

(Numb. 23:10:) <small>WHO HAS COUNTED THE DUST OF JACOB?</small> Who is able to count the commandments which they carry out, &lt;the ones&gt; that concern the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>K‘PR</i>. It is also possible to translate: “Who is able to count the commands which they carry out. &lt;They are&gt; like the dust (<i>K‘PR</i>) &lt;in number&gt;.” The examples that follow, however, suggest the translation adopted in the text, if “dust” is understood to include earth and ashes. This interpretation certainly is that found in the parallels (<i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:12, and Numb. R. 20:20), both of which read <i>B‘PR</i> for <i>K‘PR</i>.</i> (Deut. 22:10:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT PLOW WITH AN OX AND AN ASS TOGETHER</small>.

He began to say: Let my life be forfeit for coming [to steal it; but observe that I have provided fodder for it. Similarly Balaam said: Let my life be forfeit for coming] to curse, but I will bless &lt;them&gt;.

(Numb. 23:14:) <small>SO HE TOOK HIM TO THE FIELD OF ZOPHIM</small> [<small>AT THE TOP OF PISGAH</small>].

When he saw that &lt;Balaam&gt; was not in control of himself to say what he wanted, &lt;Balak&gt; sat down himself and mocked him. As soon as he saw that he was mocking him, Balaam said to him: Get up from there. It is not fitting to sit while the words of the Omnipresent are being spoken. (Numb. 23:18:) <small>RISE UP BALAK AND LISTEN; GIVE EAR TO ME, YOU SON OF ZIPPOR</small> (literally: <small>HIS SON IS ZIPPOR</small>)!

He is not like flesh and blood. &lt;When a person of&gt; [flesh and blood] acquires friends and finds others nicer than they, he forsakes the former ones. But &lt;the Holy One&gt; is not like that. It is not possible for him to be false to the oath of the early ancestors.
(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAS HE PROMISED AND NOT FULFILLED</small>? When he promises to bring evils upon them, he will cancel them, if they have repented. You find it written (in Exod. 22:19 [20]): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES TO A GOD &lt;OTHER THAN GOD ALONE&gt; SHALL BE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION</small>. When they made the calf, did they not merit destruction?

But in the case of these people (according to Ps. 121:4): <small>BEHOLD, THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP</small>. So how can I harm &lt;Israel&gt;? (Numb. 23:21:) <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH HIM</small> (i.e., Moses). Balak said to him: Since you cannot touch them because of Moses, their minister, look at his successor. What will he be? He said to him: He also will be strong like him. (Numb. 23:21:) <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH HIM</small> (i.e., Joshua); <small>A ROYAL WAR CRY IS WITHIN HIM</small>.

(Numb. 23:23:) <small>SURELY THERE IS NO AUGURY IN JACOB AND NO DIVINATION IN ISRAEL</small>. Here you are (Balak) practicing augury and divining in what place you may prevail against them, but they are not like that. When they have to fight against enemies, a high priest stands up and puts on Urim and Thummim, which are asked about the &lt;will of&gt; Holy One. So all the gentiles practice divination and augury, but these (Israelites) prove them false through repentance and nullify their divinations.

(Numb. 23:23, cont:) <small>NOW IT IS SAID FOR JACOB AND FOR ISRAEL: WHAT HAS GOD DONE?</small> His (i.e., Balaam's) eye saw that Israel was sitting (<i>yoshevim</i>) before the Holy One like a pupil before his master and was hearing why each and every parashah was written; and so it says (in Is. 23:18): <small>FOR HER</small><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash reads the <small>HER</small> as referring to Torah, but in the context of Isaiah the <small>HER</small> refers to Tyre as a harlot.</i> <small>PROFITS SHALL BELONG TO THOSE WHO DWELL</small> (<small><i>YOSHEVIM</i></small>) <small>BEFORE THE LORD…</small>. It also says (in Is. 30:20): <small>AND NO MORE SHALL YOUR TEACHER HIDE HIMSELF, FOR YOUR EYES SHALL SEE YOUR TEACHER</small>. The ministering angels will ask them: What has the Holy One taught you, because they cannot enter their (i.e., Israel's) precincts, as stated (in Numb. 23:23): <small>NOW IT IS SAID FOR JACOB AND FOR ISRAEL: WHAT HAS GOD DONE</small>?
(Numb. 23:24:): <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE RISING UP LIKE A LION</small>. You have no nation in the world like them. Here they are sleeping away from the Torah and the commandments. &lt;Then&gt; having risen from their sleep, they stand up like lions. Quickly reciting the <i>Shema</i>', they proclaim the sovereignty of the Holy One. Then having become like lions, they embark on worldly business pursuits. If one of them should stumble, or if destroying demons come to touch one of them, he proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">On reciting the <i>Shema</i>‘ to be safe from demons, see <i>yBer.</i> 1:1 (2d); <i>Ber</i>. 5a; M.

(Numb. 23:24, cont.:) <small>IT</small> (a lion) <small>DOES NOT SLEEP UNTIL IT HAS EATEN ITS PREY</small>. When he (the reader) says (in the <i>Shema</i>' of Deut. 6:4): <small>THE LORD IS ONE</small>, the destroying demons are destroyed on his account, and they intone after him (as the liturgical response): <small>AND BLESSED BE THE NAME OF HIS GLORIOUS KINGDOM FOREVER AND EVER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">In reciting the proper liturgical response to the <i>Shema</i>‘, even the demons recognize the sovereignty of the Holy One.</i> Moreover, through the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>' he is sustained from the the day watch to the night watch.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his guardian angels for the morning and the night.</i> Thus when he goes to sleep, he entrusts he spirit into the hand of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 31:6[5]: <small>INTO YOUR HAND I ENTRUST MY SPIRIT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ber</i>. 5a.</i> Then when he awakens &lt;and&gt; proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One, the night watch transfers him to the day watch.

(Numb. 24:3:) <small>SO HE TOOK UP HIS THEME AND SAID</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">These words also appear in Numb. 23:7, 18; 24:15, 20, 21, 23, but the context of this verse certainly fits the sense of the midrash.</i> Let our master instruct us:<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yelammedenu rabbenu.</i> When these words appear at the beginning of a section along with the response, “Thus have our masters taught…,” they commonly introduce a new parashah.</i> In the case of one who eats without washing his hands, what penalty will he incur?<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:15; Numb. R. 20:21.</i> Thus have our masters taught: Washing hands before the meal is an option; after the meal it is an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hul</i>. 105a, but not in the Mishnah.</i> It once happened in a time of religious persecution that there was one of the Israelite shopkeepers who would cook and sell both clean meat and pork, so that they would not notice that he was a Jew. Now his custom was this: Whenever anyone came into his shop and did not wash his hands, he knew that he was a star worshiper and would set pork before him; but whenever anyone washed his hands and recited the blessing, he knew that he was a Jew and would serve him clean meat. Once a certain Jew came in to eat there but did not wash his hands. Thinking that he was a star worshiper, he set pork before him. He ate without saying the blessing (after the meal). When he came to settle the account with him for the bread and for the meat, the pork was expensively priced. He said to him: I have such and such against you over the meat which you have eaten, for the slice is worth ten minas.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>mna</i>.</i> He said to him: Yesterday you gave it to me for eight. Now today you want ten! He said to him: This which you ate is from a hog. When he said this to him, his hair stood on end, for he became terrified and afraid. He said to him privately: I am a Jew and you have given me pork. He said to him: A curse on you! When I saw that you ate without washing your hands and without a blessing, I thought that you were were a star worshiper. Hence the sages have said: The &lt;omission of&gt; the first water (before the meal) caused him to serve him pork; &lt;the neglect of&gt; the latter water (after the meal) took a life.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 83b; <i>Hul</i>. 106a.</i>
There is a story about a certain person who ate pulse without washing his hands. When he went down to the market place, his hands were filthy from the pulse. When an acquaintance of his saw him, he went and said to his wife: Your husband has mentioned as a token<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Siman.</i> Gk.: <i>semeion.</i></i> to you &lt;of my authenticity&gt; that he has just now eaten pulse.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fact that he knew what his friend had just eaten would be evidence of his having spoken with him.</i> Send him that ring. After a time her husband came. He said to her: Where is the ring? She said to him: So and so came with your tokens, and I gave it to him. Becoming filled with rage, he arose and killed her. Therefore, whoever does not wash his hands after the meal is like one who takes a life. Therefore, the Holy One has warned Israel not to transgress even insignificant commandments, as stated (in Deut. 32:47): <small>FOR IT</small> (the Torah) <small>IS NO EMPTY THING FOR YOU, IN THAT IT IS YOUR VERY LIFE</small>. Even some commandment that you consider to be empty and insignificant has within it life and length of days. The Holy One said to Israel: If you keep my commandments, I will cast down your enemies before you, as stated (in Ps. 81:14–15[13–14]): <small>O THAT MY PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN TO ME, THAT ISRAEL WOULD WALK IN MY WAYS. THEN I WOULD VIRTUALLY SUBDUE THEIR ENEMIES…</small>. When Balaam saw how Israel observed &lt;even&gt; the insignificant commandments, he said: Who can curse these people, when they observe commandments and when his name is engraved upon them. It is so stated (in Numb. 23:21: <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH THEM</small>. Whoever curses them curses himself, because his name is joined with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the name <i>El</i> (“God”) forms part of the name Isra<i>el</i>.</i> He began turning to oracles.

When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One diverted his tongue, so that he began to bless. It is so stated (in Deut. 23:6 [5]): <small>BUT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID NOT WANT TO HEED BALAAM; SO THE LORD YOUR GOD TURNED THE CURSE INTO A BLESSING FOR YOU</small>. The Holy One put power in his voice and his voice went from one end of the world to the other, so that the nations would hear that he was blessing &lt;Israel&gt;.

        <br>That they did not change their name. Thus Reuben and Simeon went down (to Egypt), and Reuben and Simeon (with no name change) came up (from Egypt).

(Numb. 25:2:) <small>AND THEY INVITED THE PEOPLE TO THE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR GODS</small>. Thus they (i.e., daughters of Moab) were going by the counsel of Balaam, as stated (in Numb. 31:16): <small>HERE THESE WOMEN &lt;AT THE BIDDING OF BALAAM&gt; MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL…</small>. <sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:13; Numb. R. 7:23, cont.; <i>ySanh.</i> 10:2 (28cd); <i>Sanh.</i> 106a; <i>PRE</i> 47.</i> They made themselves curtained stalls and installed harlots in them with every object of delight in their hands. Now a girl would have an old woman as an agent, for an old woman would be in front of the shop. During the time that Israel was passing by on the way to the market place, the woman would say to him: Surely you want objects of linen which have come from Beth-shean! Then she would show them to him; and when the old woman would tell him a high price, the girl would &lt;give him&gt; a lower one. From then on the girl would tell him: You are like one of the family. Sit down. Now a jug of Ammonite wine was placed by her, since the wine of star worshipers had not yet been forbidden. Then out comes a girl, perfumed and adorned, who seduces him and says to him: Why do you hate us, when we love you. Take for yourself this article gratis. We all are children of a single man, children of Terah, the father of Abraham. So do you not want to eat from our sacrifices and from our cooking? Here are calves and cocks for you which we have slaughtered according to your own precepts. So eat. Immediately she has him drink the wine. Then Satan (<i><small>STN</small></i>) burned within him, so that he fell madly in love (<i><small>S</small>h<small>TH</small></i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">In the unpointed Hebrew text <i>ShTH</i> appears somewhat similar to the Hebrew spelling of Satan. The <i>S</i> in Satan is a <i>sin</i> and looks exactly like the <i>Sh</i> in “fell madly in love.” (<i>ShTH</i>). Note also that the <i>T</i> in Satan and the <i>T</i> in <i>ShTH</i> are both <i>tet</i>.</i> with her.
There are also those who say: Balaam commanded them not to have them drink the wine, so that they would not be judged as those who are drunk but as willful sinners. When he sought her out, she would say: I am not listening to you until you slaughter &lt;a sacrifice&gt; to Peor. Since he had fallen madly in love with her, he would slaughter a cock to Peor and eat it with her. So they would be joined to each other. It is therefore written (in Numb. 25:2): <small>AND THEY INVITED THE PEOPLE &lt;TO THE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR GODS, SO THAT THE PEOPLE ATE AND BOWED DOWN TO THEIR GODS&gt;</small>. Thus Israel was joined (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></i>) to Baal Peor like bracelets (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></i>). R. Levi said: This was more serious than the &lt;sin of the golden&gt; calf, [for while in reference to the calf it is written (in Exod. 32:3): <small>SO ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK OFF &lt;THE GOLD RINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR EARS … &gt;</small>, so here (in Numb. 25:3): <small>THUS ISRAEL WAS JOINED</small> (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></i>) <small>&lt;TO BAAL PEOR</small>,&gt; like bracelets (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></i>)&gt;. Because of the calf about three thousand fell, but here (according to Numb. 25:9) &lt;the number fallen is&gt; twenty-four thousand.

(Numb. 25:4:) <small>TAKE ALL THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE, AND IMPALE THEM &lt;BEFORE THE LORD IN THE SUN&gt;</small>. R. Judan said: He hanged the heads of the people, because they had not protested about the people who stood out among them like the Sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:19.</i> R. Nehemiah said: He did not hang them. Rather the Holy One said to Moses: Appoint Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedra’ot.</i> Gk. plural: <i>synhedria.</i></i> heads for them, and let them judge whoever went to Peor. He said to him: But who will make such a one<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Beginning here and throughout the rest of the paragraph, the Buber text refers to these culprits by the singular, “him.” Cf. the parallels in <i>Tanh</i>., 7:19, and in Numb.

In the case of whoever has gone astray, the cloud shall be peeled back from upon him, and the sun shall shine upon him in the midst of the congregation. Then they will know anyone who has gone astray and hang him. You know for yourself that it is so. (Numb. 25:5:) <small>SO MOSES SAID UNTO THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL: EACH OF YOU KILL &lt;THOSE OF&gt; HIS OWN PEOPLE &lt;WHO HAVE BEEN JOINED TO BAAL PEOR&gt;</small>.

Siman 29

(Numb. 25:6:) <small>JUST THEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME AND BROUGHT A MIDIANITE WOMAN UNTO HIS FAMILY &lt; BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. What reason was there for him doing so?<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 7:20; Numb. R. 20:24.</i> &lt;The incident serves&gt; to teach you that he had respect neither for heaven nor for mortals. It is also stated concerning him (in Prov. 21:24): <small>AN INSOLENT</small><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>Zed</i>. Cf. above, Lev. 3:7, which argues that this word implies idolatry and the uncovering of nakedness.</i> <small>AND ARROGANT ONE, SCORNER IS HIS NAME; HE ACTS WITH ARROGANT WANTONNESS</small>. Because &lt;the woman&gt; was a king's daughter, she said to him: I am surrendering to no one but Moses or Eleazar. He said to her: I also am as great as they are, in that I bring you before their eyes. &lt;Then&gt; he seized her by her braid and brought her to Moses. He said to him: Son of Amram, is this woman permitted or forbidden? Now if you say that she is forbidden, &lt;because&gt; this woman is a Midianite, &lt;remember that&gt; the very woman who is under you (as your wife) is a Midianite; and who permitted you to have her? The ruling (<i>halakhah</i>) slipped from his mind. They all wept bitterly. That is what is written (in Numb. 25:6): <small>&lt;BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &gt; AS THEY WERE WEEPING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. Why were they weeping? Because they were discouraged for the time being. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king's daughter who had adorned herself for entering the wedding canopy &lt;and&gt; for sitting in the &lt;bridal&gt; palanquin.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>phoreion.</i></i> When she was found indulging in immorality with another, her beloved and her kinsfolk became discouraged. So it was with Israel. At the end of forty years they had camped by the Jordan to cross into the land of Israel, and there they became lawless through whoredom. They made Moses discouraged and the righteous who were with him. But why did the ruling (<i>halakhah</i>) slip from his mind? It was simply so that Phinehas would come and receive his due. Moreover, because &lt;Moses&gt; had been indolent (in the execution of justice), (according to Deut. 34:6) <small>NO ONE KNOWS HIS BURIAL PLACE</small>. &lt;This fact serves&gt; to teach you that one must be as strong as a leopard and as swift as an eagle to do the will of his Creator that &lt;dwells&gt; in the heavens. Moreover, from here you learn that the Holy One is as meticulous with the righteous as a thread of hair.

Siman 30

(Numb. 25:7–8:) <small>WHEN PHINEHAS &lt;BEN ELEAZAR BEN AARON THE PRIEST&gt; SAW THIS, &lt;HE AROSE FROM THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION AND TOOK A SPEAR IN HIS HAND. THEN HE WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE TENT, AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM, THE MAN OF ISRAEL AND THE WOMAN THROUGH HER BELLY&gt;</small>. But did they all not see it?<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 7:21; Numb. R. 20:25.</i> {And was it not before the eyes of all Israel and the eyes of Moses?} [And is it not written (in vs. 6) <small>BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL?</small>] It is simply that when he saw the deed, he remembered the ruling (<i>halakhah</i>), that one who cohabits with an Aramean woman will have zealots strike him down.
(Numb. 25:7:) <small>HE AROSE FROM THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION</small>. From where did he stand up? It is simply that, while they were involved in give and take on the matter of whether or not &lt;the culprit&gt; was liable to death, that man (Phinehas) stood up from the midst of the congregation and volunteered &lt;to carry out the sentence &gt;.
(Numb. 25:7, cont.:) <small>AND TOOK A SPEAR IN HIS HAND</small>. He put the iron prongs in his hand, which he put in his bosom. Then he began &lt;to approach&gt; leaning on the wood like a staff,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with the iron prongs hidden, the spear shaft seemed like a mere staff.</i> because he was afraid of &lt;the culprit's&gt; tribe as they surrounded him. When he reached them, they said to him: Why have you come? He said to them: I also have come to fulfill my needs. So they gave him permission, and he entered, for otherwise they would not have given him permission.
(Numb. 25:8:) <small>THEN HE WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE TENT, AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM</small>. He pierced both of them, the one on top of the other, through the unclean place (i.e., the private parts) of the both of them, lest Israel say there was no defilement there. Come and see how many miracles happened there!<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions of the traditional <i>Tanh</i>. 7:21 and Numb. R. 20:25 have twelve miracles. <i>Sanh.</i> 82b and <i>ySanh.</i> 10:2 (28d-29a) have six miracles, but not all of them correspond to the six mentioned here.</i> (1) He put power in his arm for lifting them up and (2) power in the shaft to stay in them. (3) The opening (of the tent) was raised so that both of them might come out raised up (on the spear). (4) When they came out, the members of his tribe were ready to strike him down, but an angel arose and smote those before him. (5) When Phinehas saw that &lt;an angel had arisen&gt; to destroy them, he struck them on the ground. (6) Then when he had arisen and prayed, he removed them. That is what is written (in Ps. 106:30): <small>THEN PHINEHAS AROSE AND INTERCEDED</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: <small>AND THE PLAGUE WAS STOPPED</small>.</i> in that he gave the judicial verdict (<i>din</i>). <small>INTERCEDED</small> (rt.: <i><small>PLL</small></i>) can only denote a judicial verdict (<i>din</i>), since it is stated (in reference to making a reparation Exod. 21:22): <small>AND HE SHALL PAY AS THE JUDGES</small> (rt.: <i><small>PLL</small></i>) <small>DETERMINE</small>.
(Numb. 25:9:) <small>AND THOSE WHO DIED FROM THE PLAGUE WERE TWENTY-FOUR THOUSANDS&gt;.</small> &lt;These words serve&gt; to inform you that, on every occasion when they fell, they were numbered. The Holy One has said: In this world it is on account of gross misconduct that they fall, but in the world to come (according to Hos. 2:1 [1:10]): <small>THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA, WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED OR NUMBERED…</small>.

In the context of Job <i>ru’ah</i> is better translated “wind,” but the midrash is depicting the human temperament.</i> &lt;i.e.,&gt; the &lt;spiritual&gt; weight of each and every individual. You yourself know that it is so, because of what Moses asked from the Holy One at the time of his death, when he said to him: Sovereign of the World, the temperament of each and every person is revealed to you; and the temperament of one person is unlike the temperament of another. Now that I am departing from them, would you please, if you so desire, appoint a leader over them. Appoint over them a person who will bear with each and every one of them according to his temperament. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Numb. 27:16): <small>LET THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH, APPOINT &lt;SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION &gt;….</small>

Siman 2

[(Numb. 27:16:) <small>LET THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS &lt;OF ALL FLESH&gt;, APPOINT &lt;SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION&gt;</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 45:11): <small>REGARDING THE THINGS TO COME, WOULD YOU QUESTION ME CONCERNING MY CHILDREN AND COMMAND THE WORK OF MY HANDS?</small><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although the two verbs in this citation are imperative, both the biblical context and the interpretation of the midrash regard these commands as unthinkable suggestions.</i> A parable: To what is the matter comparable?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., 8:11; Numb.

He said to him: would you please pay attention to your wife. The king said to him: Instead of you charging me concerning my wife, charge my wife concerning me, that she be careful about my honor. So did the Holy One, as it were, say to Moses: Instead of you charging me (in Numb. 27:16): <small>LET THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH &lt;APPOINT SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION&gt;</small>, charge them concerning me, that they be diligent about my honor. What is written below (in Numb. 28:1–2)? <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING…</small>.

Siman 3

Let us go back to the beginning of the section (i.e., to Numb. 25:10–11). What reason did the Holy One have for tracing the lineage of Phinehas after this act (of slaying Zimri in Numb. 25:8)?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:1; Numb. R. 21:3.</i> &lt;The reason was&gt; that, when Zimri ben Salu was pierced along with Cozbi bat Zur, the tribes rose up against him and said: Did you see ben Puti? This man, whose mother's father<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Puti was actually Phinehas’ maternal grandfather, whose full name was Putiel. So Exod. 6:25.</i> fattened calves for star worship, has killed a tribal prince of Israel! Therefore Scripture has come to trace his lineage &lt;through his paternal grandfather&gt; (in Numb. 25:11): <small>PHINEHAS BEN ELIEZER, BEN AARON THE PRIEST</small>.
(Numb. 25:12:) <small>SAY, THEREFORE: I HEREBY GRANT MY COVENANT OF PEACE</small>. And so it says (in Mal. 2:5:) <small>MY COVENANT WAS WITH HIM. &lt;A COVENANT OF&gt; LIFE AND PEACE</small>.
(Numb. 25:13:) <small>AND IT SHALL BELONG TO HIM AND TO HIS SEED AFTER HIM</small> […], <small>&lt;BECAUSE HE WAS ZEALOUS FOR HIS GOD&gt; AND ATONED FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Since atonement is spoken of in connection with him, did he offer a sacrifice? &lt;The mention of atonement is&gt; simply to teach you that, when anyone sheds the blood of the wicked, it is as if he had offered a sacrifice.
(Numb. 25:14:) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE SLAIN MAN OF ISRAEL</small>. Just as the Holy One is concerned with the praise of the righteous to publicize<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PRSM</i>. Cf. Gk.: <i>parresia</i> (“boldness in speaking out”).</i> them throughout the world, so is he concerned with disgrace of the wicked to publicize them throughout the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:2.</i> Phinehas was due praise. About him is stated (in Prov. 10:7): <small>THE REMEMBRANCE OF A RIGHTEOUS ONE IS FOR A BLESSING</small>. Zimri was due disrepute. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>.
(Numb. 25:14, cont.:) <small>ZIMRI BEN SALU, &lt;PRINCE OF A CLAN BELONGING TO THE SIMEONITES&gt;</small>. Whoever discredits himself discredits his family along with himself. It is astounding what is written about him (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO BREAKS THROUGH &lt;A BARRIER&gt;</small><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">“To break through a barrier” means “to transgress.” Cf. the parallels in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:2, and Numb. R. 21:3, which supply a fuller reference to Eccl. 10:8.</i> is a son (i.e., Zimri). His ancestor (Simeon) was the barrier maker. He was the first to display zeal against harlotry, as stated (in Gen. 34:25): <small>THEN TWO OF THE SONS OF JACOB, SIMEON AND LEVI, &lt;THE BROTHERS OF DINAH, EACH&gt; TOOK &lt;HIS SWORD&gt;….</small> But this &lt;Zimri&gt; broke through the barrier which his ancestor had made.
(Numb. 25:15:) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE MIDIANITE WOMAN WHO WAS SLAIN &lt;WAS COZBI BAT ZUR; ZUR WAS THE TRIBAL HEAD OF A CLAN IN MIDIAN&gt;</small>. &lt;These words are there&gt; to inform you how far the Midianites had given themselves &lt;over to idolatry&gt;. Thus they had abandoned a daughter of kings in prostitution. (Numb. 31:8:) <small>&lt;AND ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER VICTIMS&gt; THEY KILLED THE KINGS OF MIDIAN:</small> [<small>&lt;EVI, REKEM,&gt; ZUR, &lt;HUR, AND REBA, THE FIVE KINGS OF MIDIAN, &lt;….&gt;</small>] Zur was the greatest of them all; but because he had abandoned his daughter and exposed<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See above, on the rt.: <i>PRSM</i>.</i> her, the text has demoted him and numbered him third (in the list). [He was, however, the greatest king of them all, as stated (in Numb. 25:15): <small>&lt;ZUR&gt; WAS THE TRIBAL HEAD OF A CLAN IN MIDIAN</small>.

Siman 4

(Numb. 25:16–17:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>. Why?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:3; Numb.

(Also in Numb. 20:18:) <small>BUT EDOM SAID UNTO HIM: YOU SHALL NOT PASS THROUGH ME, OR ELSE I WILL COME OUT TO MEET YOU WITH THE SWORD</small>. Moreover, two &lt;peoples encountered them&gt; with transgression: Moab and the Ammonites. Concerning the ones who encountered them with the sword, it is written (in Deut. 23:8 [7]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT ABHOR AN EDOMITE …; YOU SHALL NOT ABHOR AN EGYPTIAN</small>. But concerning the ones who encountered them with transgression (according to Deut. 23:4 [3]): <small>NO AMMONITE OR MOABITE SHALL COME INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD</small>.

Siman 5

(Numb. 25:17:) <small>HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>. Even though it is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE</small> (<i>shalom</i>) <small>UNTO IT</small>; however, in regard to these &lt;peoples&gt; (according to Deut. 23:7:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE</small> (<i>shalom</i>) <small>&lt;AND BENEFIT&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:3; Numb.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 25:17): <small>HARASS</small> (<i><small>T</small>s<small>RWR</small></i>) <small>THE MIDIANITES</small>. Even though I have written (in Deut. 20:19): <small>WHEN YOU BESIEGE</small> (rt. <i><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></i>) <small>A CITY</small> a <small>&lt;LONG TIME&gt;</small> […], <small>YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

And so you find that, when Joram king of Israel, Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom went to fight with Moab, (according to II Kings 3:9) <small>THEY CIRCLED AROUND ON A SEVEN-DAY MARCH, SO THAT THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE ARMY OR FOR THE ANIMALS THAT WERE WITH THEM</small>. They began to weep, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 10) <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID: ALAS, FOR THE LORD HAS SUMMONED &lt;THESE&gt; THREE KINGS &lt;TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB&gt;</small>.

(Vs. 12:) <small>THEN JEHOSHAPHAT SAID: THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH HIM. SO THE KING OF ISRAEL, JEHOSHAPHAT, AND THE KING OF EDOM WENT DOWN UNTO HIM</small>. Why is Jehoshaphat not called a king here? In order to make known the humility of that righteous man, in that he did not want to go down before the prophet in royal garb but as a commoner.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> Some also say: It was because an edict had been decreed that he would be killed with Ahab, that the scriptural text has reckoned &lt;the reign of&gt; his son from that hour. For that reason "king" was not written, but as a reward for their going down to the prophet, they attained the right to see all those miracles. (vs. 13:) [<small>THEN</small>] <small>ELISHA SAID</small> (<small>TO</small>) [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL: WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU</small>? <small>GO UNTO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR FATHER &lt;AND UNTO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR MOTHER&gt;</small>. He began to implore him. He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>SURELY THE LORD HAS SUMMONED &lt;THESE THREE KINGS TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB&gt;</small>. (vss. 14–17:) [<small>ELISHA</small>] <small>SAID: AS THE LORD OF HOSTS LIVES, BEFORE WHOM I STAND, WERE IT NOT THAT I HAVE REGARD FOR JEHOSHAPHAT</small> [<small>KING OF JUDAH</small>], <small>&lt;I WOULD NEITHER LOOK UPON YOU NOR NOTICE YOU&gt;. NOW THEN GET ME A MUSICIAN…. FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU SHALL SEE NO WIND, NOR SHALL YOU SEE RAIN; YET THAT WADI SHALL BE FILLED WITH WATER….</small> &lt;So he gave them&gt; what they needed. Moreover, he said to them (in vs. 18–19): {<small>THE MOABITES SHALL FALL AT YOUR HAND</small>} [<small>SO HE WILL GIVE MOAB INTO YOUR HAND</small>]. <small>THUS YOU SHALL SMITE EVERY FORTIFIED CITY AND EVERY CHOICE CITY. YOU SHALL ALSO FELL EVERY GOOD TREE AND STOP UP ALL SPRINGS OF WATER</small>. They said to him: But it is written here (in Deut. 20:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>; yet you are saying &lt;to do&gt; so. He said to them: He gave the command with reference to the rest of the nations, but this one is insignificant, while that one is contemptable, as stated (in II Kings 3:18): <small>THIS ONE IS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD, SO HE WILL GIVE MOAB INTO YOUR HAND</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 23:7 [6]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE</small> (<i>shalom</i>) <small>AND BENEFIT</small>. These are the good trees. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:17): <small>HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>.

Siman 6

(Numb. 25:19–26:2 [26:1–2]:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE PLAGUE &lt;THAT THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO ELEAZAR BEN AARON THE PRIEST, SAYING:&gt; TAKE A CENSUS</small>. Every time that they fell, they were required to be numbered.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:4; Numb. R. 21:7.</i> &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to the wolf who went into the midst of the flock. The owner of the flock was obliged to count them to know how many were missing.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 26:2): Why did he count them? &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a shepherd to whom the householder has delivered a flock after numbering &lt;the sheep&gt;. &lt;After&gt; he has fulfilled his guardianship, when he returns them, it is necessary for them to be numbered. Thus when Israel went out from Egypt &lt;the Holy One&gt; delivered them to Moses after numbering &lt;them&gt;, as stated (in Numb. 1:1–2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT …: TAKE A CENSUS….</small> So also, when they went out, it is written (in Exod. 12:37): <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TRAVELED FROM RAMASES TO SUCCOTH, ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT</small>. Ergo, he received them with a numbering. &lt;When&gt; he was about to pass away in the plains of Moab (after completing his guardianship), he returned them with a numbering.

Siman 7

(Numb. 27:1:) <small>THEN CAME FORWARD THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD</small>. In that generation the women were fencing in &lt;the Law&gt;,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">On raising a fence about the Law, see <i>Avot</i> 1:1.</i> which the men were breaking down.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:7; Numb. R. 21:10.</i> Accordingly you find that Aaron said to them (i.e., the men in Exod. 32:2): <small>TAKE OFF THE GOLD RINGS &lt;THAT ARE IN THE EARS OF YOUR WIVES … &gt;</small>; but the women were unwilling and tried to stop their husbands. Thus it is stated (in vs. 3): <small>SO ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK OFF THE GOLD RINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR</small><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since their is masculine, there is an immplication that the women did not cooperate.</i> <small>EARS</small>. Thus the women did not take part in making the &lt;golden&gt; calf. So also in the case of the spies who had spread slander (according to Numb. 14:36): <small>WHEN THEY RETURNED, THEY MADE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>. A decree was issued against them, because they had said (in Numb. 13:31): <small>WE ARE UNABLE TO GO UP &lt;AGAINST THIS PEOPLE FOR THEY ARE STRONGER THAN WE&gt;</small>. The women, however, were not with them in their counsel. What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 26:65)? <small>BECAUSE THE LORD HAD SAID TO THEM: THEY SHALL SURELY DIE IN THE WILDERNESS, NOT A MAN OF THEM REMAINED</small>. &lt;Note that Scripture speaks of&gt; [<small>A MAN</small>] and not of "a woman." Why? Because they (i.e., the men) did not want to enter the land, but the women came forward to ask for an inheritance in the land. Therefore the parashah (which contains Numb. 26:65) was written next to this parashah, because what the men broke down the women fenced in.

Siman 8

Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:1): <small>THEN CAME FORWARD &lt;THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD BEN HEPHER BEN GILEAD BEN MACHIR BEN MANASSEH, OF THE FAMILIES OF MANASSEH BEN JOSEPH</small>. Their action was&gt; an honor to them. &lt;It was also&gt; an honor to their father, an honor to Machir, and an honor to Joseph that such righteous and wise women had issued from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 21:11.</i> But what was their wisdom? They spoke up at the proper time, when Moses was busy with the parashah on inheritance (in accordance with Numb. 26:53): <small>TO THESE SHALL THE LAND BE APPORTIONED &lt;FOR AN INHERITANCE&gt;</small>. They said to him: If we are like a son, let us inherit; but if not, let our mother marry her husband's brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">His duty would be to rear children in the name of the deceased father. On levirate marriage generally, see Deut. 25:5-6: also Gen. 38:8-9; Ruth 4:5.</i> Immediately (in Numb. 27:5): <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. They were righteous, in that they had not been married.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallels in <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:7 and Numb. R. 21:11: “In that they had never been married to someone unworthy of them.”</i> Then why did they meet with Moses? So that he would not put on airs over having abstained from his wife for forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Since Moses regularly stood in the Divine Presence, he needed to preserve an unbroken state of purity.</i> The Holy One informed him through these women, saying: Here are women who without being commanded remained &lt;unmarried&gt; for forty years until they were married to someone worthy of them.

Siman 9

(Numb. 27:5:) <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &lt;BEFORE THE LORD&gt;</small>. &lt;This happened&gt; according to what Moses said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &lt;YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:8 (end); Numb. R. 21:12; above, Gen. 10:6; <i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 1:17 (17); <i>Sanh</i>. 8a.</i> &lt;When&gt; the daughters of Zelophehad came for a judgment, the Holy One said: Did you not say (ibid.): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME?</small> In the case of the judgment which you do not know, see, the women have decided it.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:5:) <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &lt;BEFORE THE LORD&gt;</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish said: Our Master Moses knew this judgment, but they first came before chiefs of tens.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:9.</i> They said to them: It is a judgment concerning inheritance, and this is not for us but for those greater than we. They came before the chiefs of fifties. &lt;When&gt; they saw that the chiefs of ten had shown them honor, the chiefs of fifty said: [In our case] also there are {there} those greater than we. So also &lt;they came before&gt; the chiefs of hundreds, the chiefs of thousands, and the princes. They all responded to them in a similar way, because they did not want to open their mouths before one who was greater than they. Moses said: If I tell them the decision, I shall be appropriating all their dignity. He said to them: In my case also there is one greater than I. Therefore (in Numb. 27:5): <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &lt;BEFORE THE LORD&gt;</small>. He answered him with a yes (in vs. 7): <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>. Thus the Holy One acknowledged their utterance.
(Numb. 27:7, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM &lt;POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER&gt;</small>. Give them chattels and their father's birthright in the assets of Hepher. They took three portions: the portion of their father, who was among those who had come out from Egypt; his portion with his brothers in the assets of Hepher; and since he was the first born, he took two portions.

Siman 10

Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:7): <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM &lt;POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER&gt;</small>. When they received &lt;their share&gt; on the other side of the Jordan, they came before Joshua and Eleazar in the land of Canaan, as stated (in Josh. 17:4): <small>NOW THEY</small> (i.e., the daughters of Zelophehad) <small>CAME BEFORE ELEAZAR THE PRIEST, JOSHUA BEN NUN, AND THE PRINCES &lt;AND SAID: THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES TO GIVE US AN INHERITANCE ALONG WITH OUR MALE KIN&gt;</small>. Moreover, our ancestor Jacob also knew that they were receiving &lt;an inheritance&gt; on this side &lt;of the Jordan&gt; as well as on that side, since it is stated (in Gen. 49:22): <small>DAUGHTERS</small><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">English versions generally read “boughs” or the like.</i> <small>STEP OVER A WALL</small>. This &lt;wall&gt; is the Jordan, which became a wall for Moses so that he would not enter the land. Thus [Jacob] said to [Joseph]: Your daughters shall receive a share on this side &lt;of the Jordan&gt; as well as on that side.
(Numb. 27:7:) <small>&lt;THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT. YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER, &gt; AND YOU SHALL TRANSFER TO THEM THE INHERITANCE OF THEIR FATHER</small>. With reference to &lt;normal&gt; inheritance it is stated (in vs. 9): <small>AND YOU SHALL GIVE &lt;HIS INHERITANCE TO HIS BROTHERS&gt;</small>, but with reference to a daughter &lt;it says&gt; (in vs. 8): <small>AND YOU SHALL TRANSFER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew is slightly different here from what is written in vs. 7.

(Numb. 27:12:) <small>THEN THE LORD</small> {<small>SPOKE</small>} [<small>SAID</small>] <small>UNTO MOSES, SAYING: GO UP ON THIS MOUNTAIN OF ABARIM…</small>. What reason did he have &lt;for it&gt; to be written after the parashah on inheritance?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:10, cont.; Numb. R. 21:10.</i> It was simply that when Moses heard from the mouth of the Holy One (in Numb. 27:7): <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM</small>, he thought that the Holy One had been reconciled to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 21:13.</i> He said: Here I am allotting inheritances for Israel. &lt;Then&gt; the Holy One said to him: My decree remains in place.

WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN IT, YOU ALSO SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR PEOPLE, JUST AS YOUR BROTHER AARON WAS SO GATHERED&gt;</small>. You are no better than your brother.

Siman 11

(Numb. 28:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING, &lt;MY SWEET AROMA, YOU SHALL TAKE HEED TO OFFER ME IN ITS DUE SEASON&gt;</small>. Let our master instruct us: Regarding the meal offerings that were offered upon the altar, how were they offered?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:12.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Men</i>. 5:1–2):<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Lev. 1:7.</i> <small>ALL MEAL OFFERINGS WERE OFFERED UNLEAVENED EXCEPT THE LEAVENED &lt;CAKES&gt; IN THE THANK OFFERING AND THE TWO LOAVES</small> (of Pentecost) <small>WHICH WERE OFFERED LEAVENED. R. MEIR SAYS: THE LEAVEN IS SEPARATED FROM THEIR OWN &lt;DOUGH&gt;, AND &lt;IT IS FROM THIS THAT&gt; THEY ARE LEAVENED. R. JUDAH SAYS: EVEN THAT IS NOT THE BEST &lt;METHOD&gt;; ONE SHOULD BRING THE LEAVEN, PUT IT INTO THE MEASURE, AND FILL THE MEASURE &lt;WITH THE FLOUR&gt;. &lt;THE SAGES&gt; SAID TO HIM: EVEN THAT &lt;METHOD&gt; RESULTED TOO LITTLE OR TOO MUCH. ALL MEAL OFFERINGS WERE KNEADED IN LUKEWARM WATER AND ONE WATCHED THEM LEST THEY BECOME LEAVENED; AND IF THE REST OF IT BECAME LEAVENED, ONE TRANSGRESSED A NEGATIVE COMMANDMENT, AS STATED</small> (in Lev. 2:11): <small>NO MEAL OFFERING WHICH YOU OFFER TO THE LORD SHALL BE MADE WITH LEAVEN. THUS ONE MAY BECOME CULPABLE IN THE KNEADING OF &lt;LEAVEN&gt;, IN ROLLING IT, AND IN BAKING IT</small>. Of all the offerings none is more pleasing to you than the thank offering. The Holy One said to Moses: Say to those Israelites: I did not tell you to offer me sacrifices because I have need of them, since the whole world is mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 21:16; see <i>Men</i>. 110a; <i>PRK</i> 6:1; <i>PR</i> 16:1; 48:3; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 8:14.</i> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 50:12): <small>IF I AM HUNGRY, I WOULD NOT TELL YOU, FOR THE WORLD AND EVERYTHING IN IT BELONG TO ME</small>.

Siman 12

(Numb. 28:3:) <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM: THIS IS THE BURNT OFFERING &lt;WHICH YOU SHALL OFFER TO THE LORD: TWO YEARLING LAMBS WITHOUT BLEMISH….&gt;</small> Not two simultaneously, but (as in vs. 4): <small>THE ONE LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER IN THE MORNING, AND THE SECOND LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER AT TWILIGHT</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said: None who ever lodged in Jerusalem had sin on their hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:13, end; Numb. R. 21:21.</i> How so? The sacrifice of the morning atoned for the transgressions which were committed during the night, and the daily sacrifice at twilight atoned for transgressions which were committed during the day. In any case none who lodged in Jerusalem had sin on their hands, as stated (in Is. 1:21): <small>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS LODGES</small><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Although the biblical context requires a past tense for this verb, the sense of the midrash assumes a present or a future. Such a translation also fits the later use of the imperfect tense used here.</i> <small>THERE</small> (i.e., in Jerusalem). The Holy One said to those Israelites: In this world you offer shewbread and sacrifices, but in the world to come I will prepare a great table for you with the nations of the world looking on in shame. It is so stated (in Ps. 23:5): <small>YOU PREPARE A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES; YOU ANOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP OVERFLOWS</small>. It also says (in Is. 65:13 (with reference to those who forsake the <small>LORD</small>): <small>BEHOLD, MY SERVANTS SHALL EAT, BUT YOU SHALL GO HUNGRY…</small>.

Siman 13

(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY &lt;YOU SHALL HAVE&gt; A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY…</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted to eat outside the Sukkah on the the feast (of Tabernacles)?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:15; <i>BB</i> 75a; <i>ySuk.</i> 2:7 (23a); <i>Suk.</i> 27ab.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:6): [<small>R. ELIEZER SAYS</small>:] <small>ONE IS DUTY BOUND TO EAT FOURTEEN TIMES IN THE SUKKAH, ONE &lt;EACH&gt; DAY AND ONE &lt;EACH&gt; NIGHT; BUT THE SAGES SAY: THERE IS NO PRESCRIBED NUMBER EXCEPT</small> [<small>ONLY</small>] <small>ON THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FESTAL DAY</small> [<small>OF THE FEAST</small>]. But why did the sages permit one to be freed from the Sukkah on the last festal day? Simply because the whole seven days of the festival they had prayed for abundant dew, while on the last day they prayed for rain. They therefore were freed from the Sukkah, so that they might pray wholeheartedly for rain. Nevertheless the last day of the holiday is reckoned as belonging to the days of the festival. Why? Because is is so written (in Numb. 29:35): <small>&lt;ON THE EIGHTH DAY&gt; YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small> (<i>atseret</i>). Now it was fitting for it to come fifty days after the festival, just as Pentecost (<i>atseret</i>) comes fifty days after Passover; but the Holy One said: It is winter and they will not be able to leave their houses to come here &lt;to Jerusalem&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. R. 7:2:2; <i>PRK</i> 28:7.</i> Let them make the solemn assembly, while they are &lt;already here&gt; with me. How is it shown?

Siman 14

[(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY….</small>: This text is related (to Ps. 109:4): <small>IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY DENOUNCE ME, BUT I AM A PRAYER</small>. You find that on the festival (of Tabernacles) Israel would offer seventy bulls for the seventy nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:16; Numb. R. 21:24; M. Pss. 109:4; <i>PRK</i> 28:9.</i> Therefore, they should love us. It is not enough that they do not love us, but they also hate us, as stated (in Ps. 109:4): <small>IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY DENOUNCE ME</small>. Therefore the Holy One has said to them: For seven days of the festival you have offered sacrifices to me for the nations of the world. Now, however, you are to offer &lt;sacrifices&gt; for yourselves. (Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>.

Siman 15

(Numb. 29:36:) <small>THEN YOU SHALL OFFER A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING</small>, [<small>A FIRE OFFERING, A SWEET AROMA TO THE LORD</small>]: <small>ONE BULL, ONE RAM, &lt;….&gt;</small> &lt;The situation&gt; is comparble to a king who made a seven-day banquet and invited all the people of the province for the seven days of the feast. When the seven days of the feast had passed, he said to his friend: We have already fulfilled our obligation to the people of the province. Let us, you and me, make do with whatever you find: a pound<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>litra.</i></i> of meat, fish, or greens. Similarly did the Holy One say to Israel: All the sacrifices which you offered during the seven days of the feast you sacrificed for the nations of the world. However (according to Numb. 29:35): <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>. Make do with whatever you find (as in Numb. 29:36): <small>ONE BULL, ONE RAM &lt;….&gt;</small>

(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>: What was the reason for &lt;the number of sacrificial animals&gt; being reduced on each day?<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 8:17; Numb.

Thus if someone goes for lodging,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Xenia</i>.</i> where his friend receives him, on the first day that he receives him, he feeds him fowl. Then on the second he feeds him fish; [on the third he feeds him meat;] on the fourth he feeds him greens. So does he continue to reduce, until he is feeding him pulse.

Siman 17

(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE</small> (literally: <small>THERE SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>) <small>A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR YOU</small>? The Holy One said to Israel: The festive occasion<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Simhah.</i> The allusion is to the solemn assembly on the eighth day of the festival, which is called <i>Simhat Torah.</i></i> is fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; New Moons are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; festival times are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; holidays are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>FOR YOU</small>. A certain star worshiper questioned R. Aqiva. He said to him: Why do you keep festival times? Did not he say the following to you (in Is. 1:14): <small>YOUR NEW MOONS AND YOUR FESTIVAL TIMES MY SOUL HATES</small>? R. Aqiva said to him: If &lt;the Holy One&gt; had said: "My New Moons and my festival times my soul hates," I should have said so. He only said: <small>YOUR NEW MOONS AND YOUR FESTIVAL TIMES</small>, because these are the festival times which Jeroboam instituted, as stated (in I Kings 12:32): <small>JEROBOAM ALSO INSTITUTED A FESTIVAL….</small> These festival times, however, (the ones ordained by the Holy One) shall never be abolished. Neither shall the New Moons. Why? Because they belong to the Holy One, as stated (in Lev. 23:2): <small>THE FESTIVAL TIMES OF THE LORD</small>. It also says (ibid.): <small>THESE ARE MY FESTIVAL TIMES</small>. [(Also in vs. 4:) <small>THESE ARE THE FESTIVAL TIMES OF THE LORD</small>.] They shall, therefore, never be abolished; for it is concerning them that it is stated (in Ps. 111:8): <small>THEY ARE ESTABLISHED FOREVER TO BE PERFORMED WITH FAITHFULNESS AND UPRIGHTNESS</small>.

(Numb. 30:2–3 [1–2]:) <small>THEN MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES …: WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A VOW</small> (<i>neder</i>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>, &lt;….&gt; Let our master instruct us: What about <i>konamot</i> (i.e., vows of abstinence) and vows (<i>nedarim</i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:1.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ned</i>. 2:1): <small>&lt;IF ONE MAKES&gt; A <i>KONAM</i></small> (i.e., a vow of absitinence) [<small>THAT HE WILL NOT SLEEP, THAT HE WILL NOT SPEAK, THAT HE WILL NOT WALK; IF HE UTTERS A <i>KONAM</i> TO HIS WIFE THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE MARITAL RELATIONS WITH HER, SUCH A ONE IS LIABLE TO &lt;THE INJUNCTION&gt;</small> (in Numb. 30:3 [2]): <small>HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS WORD. &lt;IF HE SWEARS&gt; AN OATH</small> (<i>shevu'ah</i>)] <small>THAT HE WILL NOT SLEEP, THAT HE WILL NOT SPEAK, THAT HE WILL NOT WALK, HE IS FORBIDDEN &lt;TO DO SO&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Ned</i>. 2:2-5; <i>Ned</i>. 13b, 14b-15a; 20a; <i>yNed.</i> 2:2-5 (37b-6); above, Lev. 1:16; cf. Matthew 5:33-37; 23:16-22; James 5:12.</i> Oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>) carry more weight than vows (<i>nedarim</i>); and vows, than oaths. How so? &lt;If one makes&gt; a <i>konam</i> not to make a Sukkah, not to take up a Lulab, not to put on phylacteries, in the case of vows (<i>nedarim</i>) it is forbidden to put them on or to make them, even though they are commanded (in Torah); but in the case of oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>) it is permitted, because one does not swear to transgress against the commandments. The Holy One said to the Israelites: Be circumspect with your vows (<i>nedarim</i>) and do not break them, for all who break vows (<i>nedarim</i>) end up in being faithless in oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>). Moreover, the one who is faithless in oaths is denying me and will never have forgiveness, as stated (in Exod. 20:7 = Deut. 5:11): <small>&lt;YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN,&gt; FOR THE LORD WILL NOT EXONERATE &lt;ONE WHO TAKES HIS NAME IN VAIN&gt;</small>. It is also written (in Jer. 4:2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES, &lt;IN TRUTH, IN JUSTICE, AND IN RIGHTOUSNESS&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to the Israelites: Do not think that you have permission to swear in my name even in truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Numb.

        <br>That you should be like those three who were called God-fearing, Abraham, Job, and Joseph:
                <br>Abraham of whom it is written (in Gen. 22:12): <small>&lt;FOR NOW I KNOW&gt; THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>.

                <br>Concerning Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18): <small>FOR I FEAR GOD</small>.  Ergo (in Deut. 10:20):<small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR</small>.
        <br>[(Deut. 10:20, cont.:) <small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE</small>.] &lt;You do so,&gt; if you turn &lt;all&gt; your attention to the Torah, fulfill &lt;its&gt; commandments and have no other work.

Moroever, has it not already been stated (in Deut. 4:24): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE?</small> It is simply &lt;being stated with reference to&gt; anyone marrying off his daughter to a scholar, who reads &lt;Scripture&gt; and recites &lt;Mishnah&gt;, that he engage in commerce<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> for him and have him benefit from his assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ket.</i> 111b; cf. <i>Sot</i>. 14a.</i> It is with reference to &lt;such a&gt; one that it is stated (in Deut. 10:20): <small>TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>.
    
If you have all these &lt;attributes&gt; you may swear; if not, you are not entitled to swear. There is a story {that on the royal mountains (near Jerusalem)} [about] King [Jannai], that he had two thousand towns on the royal mountains and that they all were destroyed because of a true oath. How? Someone would say to his friend: Upon my oath I am going to eat such and such at such and such a place, and I will drink such and such at such and such a place. Then they would go to fulfill their oath and would be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Because they swore oaths over what was insignificant.</i> If this &lt;is what happens to&gt; one who swears truthfully, how much the worse it is for one who swears falsely!

Siman 2

(Numb. 31:1, 2, 6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &lt;ON THE MIDIANITES&gt;</small>. […. <small>WITH THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE TRUMPETS FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM IN HIS HAND</small>.] Let our master instruct us: How many sustained blasts (<i>teqi'ot</i>) does one blow on eve of the Sabbath to detach the people from labor?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>.,Numb. 9:2.</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 5:5): <small>ONE BLOWS THREE SUSTAINED BLASTS TO HAVE THE PEOPLE CEASE FROM LABOR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shab.</i> 35b.</i> How? The hazzan of the congregation takes the trumpets and goes up to the roof at the highest point in the city and blows. &lt;Thereupon&gt; whoever is far from the city leaves his work. Then he comes again and blows a second time. &lt;Thereupon&gt; those who are nearer enter the city. When he blows a third time, they place the <i>hammin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Sabbath food kept warm from Friday.</i> in the oven and light the &lt;Sabbath&gt; lights. &lt;If&gt; he has finished blowing &lt;while&gt; the pot was on the stove, they set it on the ground. If there was a light in a woman's hand, she set it on the ground. The Sabbath is sanctified with trumpets, and so also are New Moons and Festivals, as stated (in Numb. 10:10): <small>WHEN YOU HAVE A DAY OF REJOICING, AT YOUR FIXED FESTIVALS, AND ON YOUR NEW MOONS, YOU SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS</small>. Moreover, when they moved out &lt;from camp&gt;, they blew the trumpets to move out, as stated (in Numb. 10:6): <small>WHEN YOU BLOW</small> a [<small>SECOND</small>] <small>SHORT BLAST</small> (<i>teru'ah</i>), <small>THE CAMPS &lt;PLACED TO THE SOUTH&gt; SHALL MOVE OUT….</small> Also when &lt;the congregation&gt; met together, they blew the trumpets, as stated (in vs. 7): <small>WHEN THE CONGREGATION ASSEMBLES, YOU SHALL BLOW &lt;SUSTAINED BLASTS AND NOT SHORT ONES&gt;</small>. And when an enemy oppresses you, you shall blow the trumpets, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>AND WHEN YOU GO TO WAR IN YOUR LAND AGAINST AN ENEMY WHO OPPRESSES YOU, YOU SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS</small>. And when they went to take vengeance against Midian, they carried out their vengeance with trumpets, as stated (in Numb. 31:6): <small>WITH THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE TRUMPETS FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM</small> (<i>teru'ah</i>) <small>IN HIS HAND</small>.

Siman 3

(Numb. 31:2:) <small>EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ON THE MIDIANITES; AFTERWARD YOU SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR PEOPLE</small>. R. Judah said: If Moses had wanted to live for several &lt;more&gt; years, he would have remained alive; for the Holy One had suspended his death until after the vengeance against Midian.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:3; Numb. R. 22:2.</i> Moses said: For the sake of my remaining alive, shall I delay Israel's vengeance on Midian? Immediately (in vs. 3): <small>MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE PEOPLE, SAYING: ARM SOME OF YOUR NUMBER</small> (<i>anashim</i>) <small>&lt;FOR THE ARMY, AND LET THEM FALL ON MIDIAN TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD AGAINST MIDIAN&gt;</small>. &lt;The word, <i>anashim,</i> implies that they were&gt; righteous.

(Numb. 31:3:) <small>TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD AGAINST MIDIAN</small>. The Holy One had said (in vs. 2): <small>THE VENGEANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>; but Moses says (here in vs. 3): <small>THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to them: It is your judgment that is called for, because they caused me to harm you. Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe, if we had been uncircumcised or practitioners of star worship or had denied &lt;the binding force of&gt; the commandments, they would not have persecuted us. On the contrary, &lt;they have done so precisely&gt; because of the Torah and commandments which you have given. The vengengeance, therefore, is yours. Ergo (in Numb. 31:3): <small>TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD &lt;AGAINST MIDIAN&gt;</small>.

Siman 4

(Numb. 31:4:) <small>&lt;YOU SHALL SEND TO THE WAR&gt; A THOUSAND PER TRIBE &lt;FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. Some say: He sent two thousand from each and every tribe, while others say three thousand [from each and every tribe], with twelve thousand armed shock troops, twelve thousand to guard the baggage, and twelve thousand for prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:3, cont.; Numb. R. 22:3.</i> And where is it shown? Where it is stated (ibid.): <small>A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small> (literally: <small>A THOUSAND PER TRIBE; A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small>).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For the third thousand per tribe, Numb. R. 22:3 cites Numb. 31:5, which repeats: <small>A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small>, for the third time.</i>
(Numb. 31:5:) <small>SO FROM THE THOUSANDS IN ISRAEL THERE WERE FURNISHED A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WERE FURNISHED</small>? That they were furnished for each other in pairs<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zeuge, zuga</i>; Lat.: <i>jugera.</i> The probable meaning is that for each thousand who fought, there were a thouand replacements.</i> &lt;Another interpretation of <small>WERE FURNISHED</small>:&gt; They <small>WERE FURNISHED</small> by force. Since Scripture had suspended the death of Moses until after the vengeance against Midian, they said: Shall we go against Midian and let Moses die? They refrained from going. The Holy One said to Moses: Cast lots over the tribes, and they will be furnished automatically.

Siman 5

(Numb. 31:6:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT THEM, &lt;A THOUSAND PER TRIBE ANONG WITH PHINEHAS BEN ELEAZAR THE PRIEST FOR THE TROOPS&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to Moses (in vs. 2): Take vengeance by yourself, but he sent others.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:3, cont.; Numb. R. 22:4.</i> It was simply because he had been raised in Midian. He said: It is not right for me to oppress those who have done well by me. The proverb says: Do not cast a stone into a cistern from which you have drunk water. But why did he send Phinehas before them (instead having someone else in command)? He said: Whoever has begun a religious act should finish it. &lt;Phinehas&gt; has (according to Numb. 25:11) <small>TURNED AROUND MY WRATH</small> (by executing an Israelite man copulating with the Midianite woman). Let him finish the act.
(Numb. 31:6, cont.:) <small>AND THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY</small> (<i>haqodesh</i>). This refers to the Ark (and its contents), since it is stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>BECAUSE THEY</small> (i.e., the children of Korah) <small>HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY</small> (<i>haqodesh</i>) <small>OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THE SHOULDER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation assumes an analogy with I Sam. 4:4.</i> R. Johanan said: These were the priestly garments, for in them were the Urim and Thummim, as stated (in Exod. 29:29): <small>AND THE SACRED</small> (<i>haqodesh</i>) <small>GARMENTS OF AARON</small>. (Numb. 31:8:) <small>THEY ALSO KILLED BALAAM BEN PEOR WITH THE SWORD</small>. Now what was he doing there? He had simply gone to receive a reward for twenty-four thousand that had fallen through his counsel.
(Numb. 31:11–12:) <small>THEN THEY TOOK ALL THE PLUNDER …, AND THEY BROUGHT THE &lt; PRISONERS, THE BOOTY … &gt; UNTO MOSES…</small>. &lt;This text serves&gt; to show their excellence, for they did not want to take the spoils, until they had brought them before him; and after that [they &lt;only&gt; took &lt;them&gt;] with his permission.
(Numb. 31:13:) <small>THEN MOSES, ELEAZAR THE PRIEST, &lt;AND PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION&gt; WENT OUT &lt;TO MEET THEM&gt;</small>. &lt;This text serves&gt; to show Moses' humility, for they all were disciples of his disciples.

Siman 6

Another interpretation (of Numb. 31:2:) <small>EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Job 36:7): <small>HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS EYES FROM A RIGHTEOUS PERSON</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS EYES FROM A RIGHTEOUS PERSON</small> (literally: <small>WITHDRAW FROM A REGHTEOUS PERSON HIS EYES</small>)? The Holy One does not keep back from a righteous person what he wants to see with his eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:4; Numb. R. 22:5.</i> &lt;The text&gt; teaches that Moses longed to see vengeance on the Midianites before he died. Thus it is stated concerning him (in Ps. 58:11 [10]): <small>A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WILL REJOICE WHEN HE SEES VENGEANCE</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WILL REJOICE</small>. This refers to Moses. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN HE SEES VENGEANCE</small>, i.e., vengeance on Midian. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE WILL BATHE HIS FEET IN THE BLOOD OF THE WICKED PERSON</small>, i.e., of Balaam.

Siman 7

(Numb. 32:1:) <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN &lt;AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD&gt; HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK…</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many good gifts were created in the world?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:5; Numb. R. 22:7.</i> [Thus have our masters taught: The Holy One created three gifts in the world:] wisdom, strength, and wealth. A person meriting one of them receives what is most desirable in the whole world. When? When they come from the Holy One and come through the power of the Torah. But human strength and wealth are nothing, for thus has Solomon stated (in Eccl. 9:11): <small>AGAIN I SAW THAT UNDER THE SUN THAT THE RACE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE SWIFT, NOR THE BATTLE TO THE STRONG, NOR BREAD TO THE WISE, NOR EVEN WEALTH TO THE DISCERNING, &lt;NOR EVEN FAVOR TO THE KNOWLEDGEABLE,&gt; FOR TIME AND AFFLICTION</small> (i.e., death) <small>ENCOUNTER ALL OF THEM</small>. Thus also has Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 9:22 [23]): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: LET NOT THE WISE BOAST IN THEIR WISDOM, NOR THE STRONG BOAST IN THEIR STRENGTH, NOR THE WEALTHY BOAST IN THEIR WEALTH</small>. So these gifts, since they do not come from the Holy One, will finally be cut off from them.

Siman 8

The sages (literally: the wise) have taught: Two wise men arose in the world, one from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Balaam was from the nations of the world, while Ahitophel was from Israel; but both of them were lost from this world and from the world to come. [Two strong men arose in the world, one was from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Samson was from Israel, while Goliath was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world.] Two wealthy men arose in the world, Korah from Israel and Haman from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Why? Because their gift was not from Heaven. So also you find among the children of Gad and the children of Reuben that they were very wealthy and had a lot of livestock, but they loved the livestock and resided outside the land of Israel. For that reason they were the first of the tribes to go into exile, as stated (in I Chron. 5:26): <small>AND HE CARRIED THEM INTO EXILE</small>, i.e., <small>THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES</small>. [Who brought &lt;the exile&gt; on them? &lt;It happened&gt; because they had separated themselves from their siblings for the sake of their livestock. And where is it shown? From what they read on the subject (in Numb. 32:1): <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>.]

Siman 9

(Nume. 32:1:) <small>MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 75:7–8 [6–7]): <small>FOR IT IS NOT FROM THE EAST OR FROM THE WEST OR FROM THE WILDERNESS THAT THERE COMES AN EXALTATION</small> (<i>harim</i>), <small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES; ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7 [6]:) <small>FOR IT IS NOT FROM THE EAST</small> (rt.: <i><small>MT</small>s</i>') <small>OR FROM THE WEST</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:6; Numb. R. 22:8.</i> It is not from the fact that, when a person works hard by going out (rt.: <i><small>MT</small>s</i>') for trade and traveling from east to west, he becomes wealthy. &lt;No!&gt; Even if one sails away in ships to go from east to west and returns over wildnesses and over mountains (<i>harim</i>), he does not become wealthy. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7 [6], cont.:) <small>OR FROM THE WILDERNESS THAT THERE COMES AN EXALTATION</small> (<i>harim</i>)? R. Abba<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 9:6; and Numb. R. 22:8, this sage was R. Abba of Serungaya (near Tiberias).</i> says: Every use of <i>harim</i> in Scripture denotes mountains except for here, where it denotes exaltation. Thus one is not exalted from these things. So what does the Holy One do? He takes from one and gives to another. A certain matron asked R. Jose ben Halafta: In how many days did the Holy One create his world? He said to her in six days.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 1:18; Gen. R. 68:4; <i>PRK</i> 2:4; Lev. R. 8:1; Numb. R. 3:6; cf. above, Gen. 1:2.</i> She said to him: And what has he been doing since that time? He said to her: He sits down and makes ladders for raising up one and putting down another. You yourself know that, when he wanted the children of Reuben and Gad to become wealthy, he brought down the Midianites at their hand. What is written (in Numb. 31:9)? <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TOOK THE WOMEN</small> [<small>AND CHILDREN</small>] <small>OF THE MIDIANITES CAPTIVE</small>, [<small>AND ALL THEIR CATTLE, ALL THEIR LIVESTOCK</small>,] <small>&lt;AND ALL THEIR WEALTH THEY SEIZED AS PLUNDER&gt;</small>. Then after that &lt;comes&gt; (Numb. 32:1:) <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN &lt;AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD&gt; HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 75:8 [7]): <small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES; ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. And who is wealthy? One who is happy with his lot, as stated (in Ps. 128:2): <small>YOU SHALL EAT THE PRODUCE OF YOUR HANDS; YOU SHALL BE HAPPY, AND IT SHALL GO WELL WITH YOU</small>.

(Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES &lt;BY WHICH&gt; OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &lt;WENT FORTH FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&gt;</small>. Let our master instruct us: When a person is being pursued by robbers and brigands,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> is it permissible for such a one to profane the Sabbath. Thus have our masters taught: When a person is being pursued by robbers and brigands, such a one does profane the Sabbath to save his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:1; Numb. R. 23:1; see <i>RH</i> 2:5; ‘<i>Eruv</i> 45a; <i>Ta‘an</i>. 14a.</i> We therefore find in the case of David, that when Saul sought to kill him, he fled from him and was saved.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Men</i>. 95b, David’s eating of the consecrated bread (I Sam. 21:7 [6]) on the day of his flight (vs. 11 [10]) took place on the Sabbath.</i> Our masters have said: Once upon a time evil documents came from the Empire for the leading citizens of Sepphoris.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The traditional <i>Tanhuma</i>, Numb. 10:1, adds, “On the Sabbath.”</i> &lt;The citizens&gt; came to R. Eliezer ben Parta &lt;and&gt; said to him: Evil documents have come to us from the Empire. What do you say? Shall we flee? Since he was afraid to tell them to flee on the Sabbath, he said to them: Are you asking me? Go and ask Jacob, Moses, and David. With reference to Jacob, it is written (in Hos. 12:13 [12]): <small>THEN JACOB FLED</small>. With reference to Moses, it is written (in Exod. 2:15): <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH</small>. With reference to David, it is written (in I Sam. 19:18) <small>NOW DAVID FLED AND ESCAPED</small>. It also says (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER YOUR CHAMBERS…</small>. But where is it shown that the saving of life overrides the Sabbath? Where it is written (in Lev. 18:5): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY STATUTES AND ORDINANCES, FOR IT IS THROUGH PERFORMING THEM THAT A PERSON SHALL LIVE</small> and not die through them. It is also written, with reference to circumcision (in Lev. 12:3): <small>AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED</small>, even on the Sabbath. Now are not &lt; these &gt; words &lt;an argument&gt; <i>qal wahomer?</i> If circumcision, which concerns &lt;but&gt; one out of the 248 [human] members, overrides the Sabbath, how much the more in the case of the whole body. The Holy One said [to Israel]: My children, be mindful of my ordinances and keep the Torah, for how many miracles and wonders have I done for you from the day that you went forth from Egypt! I cast down those who hated you, I had you pass through the sea, I cast fear and trembling on your enemies, I destroyed the Amorites along with Sihon and Og, and during the whole forty years that you were in the wilderness I did not forsake you for a single hour. Moreover, how many snakes and scorpions did I exterminate in your presence. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:15): (<small>GOD</small>) <small>WHO LED YOU THROUGH THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE WILDERNESS WITH ITS FIERY SERPENTS AND SCORPIONS</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses: Write down the stages by which Israel journeyed in the wilderness, so that they will know how many miracles I performed for them during each and every stage. {Thus it is stated (in Numb. 33:1–2):} [Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 33:1–2):] <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES &lt;BY WHICH&gt; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &lt;WENT FORTH FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&gt;…. AND MOSES WROTE DOWN THEIR STARTING POINGS, STAGE BY STAGE, ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small>.

Siman 2

[(Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES</small>.] &lt;The matter&gt; is comparable to a king whose son was ill.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:3; Numb.

Similarly the Holy One said to Moses: Recount to them all the places where they provoked me. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES</small>.

It is written (in Josh. 7:19): <small>THEN JOSHUA SAID UNTO ACHAN: &lt;MY SON, PLEASE GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND MAKE A CONFESSION TO HIM. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME</small>.&gt; Achan said to him: Am I to die because of this thing that you are saying unto me?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:5; Numb.

Then I shall be found untrue (rt.: '<i><small>MN</small></i>) and deemed a liar before Joshua. At that moment Achan said to Joshua: Why are you casting lots between me and my house? Let me cast lots between you and Phinehas! If the lot does not come up for both of you, I also shall believe (rt.: '<i><small>MN</small></i>). At that moment (according to Josh. 7:19) [<small>THEN</small>] <small>JOSHUA SAID</small> {<small>TO</small>} [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>ACHAN: MY SON, PLEASE GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND MAKE A CONFESSION</small> [<small>TO HIM</small>]. <small>PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE</small>. Achan said to him: You also tell me what you have done. Immediately discord broke out in Israel, so that &lt;Achan's&gt; tribe of Judah arose in strife and killed one group after another in Israel. When Achan saw this, he said in his heart: If anyone saves a single life in Israel, it is as though he had saved the entire world; yet in my case, it has been through me that so many people in Israel have been killed. I am a sinner and one who causes &lt;others&gt; to sin. It is better &lt;for me&gt; to confess my transgression before the Holy One and before Joshua, so that no calamity come about through me. What did Achan do? He arose and made his voice heard, so that the whole congregation became silent before him. He said to Joshua (in vs. 20): <small>I AM THE ONE WHO REALLY SINNED BEFORE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL. THUS AND SO</small> (literally: <small>LIKE THIS AND LIKE THIS</small>) <small>IS WHAT I HAVE DONE</small>. So it was not <small>THIS</small> alone, but I have already acted fraudulently in other matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 85:14, according to which Achan had acted dishonestly in the person of his great grandfather, Zerah, the son of Judah by Tamar.</i> Joshua said to him: Indeed I also knew that you were responsible for the situation. (Josh. 7:19:) <small>PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME</small>. (vs. 21): <small>I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS</small>.

(Josh. 7:21) <small>&lt;I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS&gt; A FINE SHINAR MANTLE…</small>. Now do not say that I am poor and in need, for there is no one in the tribe of Judah more wealthy than I. Immediately (there follows vs. 22): <small>THEN JOSHUA SENT MESSENGERS, AND THEY RAN TO THE TENT….</small> For what reason did Joshua send them? So that the tribe [of Judah] would not steal them (i.e., the stolen articles) and continue in the discord. Joshua therefore sent quickly, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 23) <small>THEY BROUGHT THEM UNTO JOSHUA AND UNTO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL; AND THEY SPREAD THEM OUT BEFORE THE LORD</small>. What is the significance of <small>AND THEY SPREAD THEM OUT?</small> Joshua said: Sovereign of the World, is it because of these that you have been angry with your children?

(vs. 25:) <small>THEN JOSHUA SAID: JUST AS YOU HAVE AFFLICTED</small> (rt.: '<i><small>KR</small></i>) <small>US</small>, [<small>MAY THE LORD AFFLICT</small> (rt.: '<i><small>KR</small></i>) <small>YOU</small>] <small>THIS DAY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Without the bracketed words, the verse would read: <small>HOW YOU HAVE AFFLICTED US THIS DAY!</small></i> <small>THIS DAY</small> &lt;only&gt; is he to be afflicted ('<i>akhur</i>; rt.: '<i><small>KR</small></i>), but he will have a share in the world to come. (Vs. 25, cont.:) <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL PELTED HIM WITH STONES</small>, him alone, <small>AND THEY BURNED THEM WITH FIRE</small>. The text is speaking of his wealth, for so it had been told him by the Almighty (in vs. 15): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN SEIZED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN PROSCRIBED SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE TOGETHER WITH ALL THAT HE HAS</small>. &lt;This passage&gt; is only to teach you that Achan had confessed that he had stolen them on the Sabbath, when he took them out of Jericho and concealed them in the midst of his tent. Thus he was stoned for profaning the Sabbath and burned because he had transgressed the ban. And where is it shown? You find that the Holy One said so to Joshua (in Josh. 6:2–4): <small>SEE, I HAVE GIVEN JERICHO INTO YOUR HANDS, ALONG WITH ITS KING AND THE MIGHTY WARRIORS. SO YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY WITH ALL THE MEN OF WAR TO ENCOMPASS THE CITY ONE TIME. THUS SHALL YOU DO FOR SIX DAYS WITH SEVEN PRIESTS…. &lt;BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY SEVEN TIMES, AND THE PRIESTS SHALL BLOW ON THE SHOPHARS</small>. This passage serves&gt; to teach you that Jericho was conquered on the Sabbath. Now Joshua did this thing on his own with the Holy One giving his consent. Joshua said (to himself): The Sabbath is holy, as stated (in Exod. 31:14): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH, BECAUSE IT IS HOLY FOR YOU</small>. So whatever we conquer on it shall be holy, as stated (in Josh. 6:19): <small>BUT ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD</small>, [<small>AND THE VESSELS OF BRONZE AND IRON, ARE HOLY TO THE LORD</small>]. And where is it shown that he gave his consent? Where it is stated (in Joshua 6:17): [<small>THE CITY</small>] <small>AND EVERYTHING IN IT &lt;ARE TO BE&gt; PROSCRIBED FOR THE LORD</small>. At that time (according to Josh. 7:26) <small>THE LORD TURNED FROM HIS BURNING ANGER</small>. Concerning &lt;this matter&gt;, it is stated (in Prov. 16:14): <small>THE KING</small>'s <small>ANGER IS LIKE MESSEGERS OF DEATH, AND WHOEVER IS WISE WILL APPEASE IT</small>. This refers to Joshua, who caused the burning anger of the Lord to turn away from Israel.

(Numb. 34:1–2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN, &lt;THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE&gt;…</small>. Let our master instruct us: Before they entered the land, how did they say the blessing over the food?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:6; Numb. R. 23:7.</i> Thus have our masters taught: Before they entered the land, they used to say a single blessing, <i>Who Sustains All</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Philip Birnbaum, <i>Daily Prayer Book</i> (Hebrew Publishing Co., 1949), p. 759/760.</i> After they had entered the land, they said the blessing, <i>For the Land and for the Food</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Birnbaum, p. 763/764.</i> After Jerusalem was destroyed, they added <i>Builder of Jerusalem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Birnbaum, p. 765/766. The prayer also occurs as the fourteenth blessing in the <i>Shemoneh</i> ‘<i>Esreh</i> (Birnbaum, p. 89/90), as well as in other contexts. For the various versions of the prayer, see Joseph Heinemann, <i>Prayer in the Talmud,</i> trans. Richard S. Sarason (“Studia Judaica, IX; Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1977), pp. 48-50, 70-76.</i> After those slain at Bethther<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">During the Bar Cochba war, 132-135.</i> were buried, they added <i>Who is Good and Does What is Good:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Birnbaum, p. 765/766.</i> <i>Who is Good,</i> because they did not decay, and <i>Who Does What is Good,</i> because they were given burials. None of them, however, is more dear to you than the blessing of the land. The sages therefore instruct: In the blessing of the food, whoever does not mention <i>For the Land and for the Food</i>; <i>A Desirable, Good, and Spacious Land;</i> the covenant &lt;of circumcision&gt;; Torah; life; and food<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>A Desirable, Good, and Spacious Land</i> plus the elements that follow all form part of a single prayer to be found in Birnbaum, p. 761/762.</i> has not satisfied his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ber</i>. 48b-49a.</i> The Holy One said: the land of Israel is more dear to me than everything. I am the one who sought it out, as stated (in Ezek. 20:6): <small>&lt;ON THAT DAY I SWORE</small> (literally: <small>RAISED MY HAND</small>) <small>TO THEM THAT I WOULD BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT&gt; UNTO</small> {<small>THE</small>} [<small>A</small>] <small>LAND WHICH I HAD SOUGHT OUT FOR THEM</small>. So also it says (in Jer. 3:19): <small>&lt;HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN&gt; AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND &lt;THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS&gt;</small>. You find &lt;the same love for the land&gt;, when Joshua slew those kings. R. Jannay the Priest said: There were sixty-two kings, thirty-one at Jericho and thirty one with Sisera. When he went to fight with Israel they also were slain along with him. Why? Because they along with him yearned to drink water from the waters of Israel. They made a request of Sisera and said to him: If you please, let us come with you for free, because we yearn to fill our stomachs with water from the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Jud. 5:19): <small>THE KINGS CAME, THEY FOUGHT; &lt;THEN FOUGHT THE KINGS OF CANAAN, AT TAANACH, ON ACCOUNT OF</small><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: ‘<i>al.</i> The more usual translation here is <small>BY</small>.</i> <small>THE WATERS OF MEGIDDO;&gt; THEY TOOK NO GAIN OF MONEY</small>. &lt;This verse serves&gt; to inform you of the esteem in which the land of Israel was held. The Holy One had said to Moses: This land is dear to me, as stated (in Deut. 11:12): <small>A LAND FOR WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD CARES</small>. Israel also is dear to me, as stated (in Deut. 7:8): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES YOU…</small>. The Holy One said: [Because Israel] is dear to me, I will bring [them] into a land that is dear to me. {Thus it is stated} [Where is it shown? From what they read on the subject] (in Numb. 34:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &lt;OF CANAAN, THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE&gt;…</small>.

(Numb. 34:2:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>. [What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 33:52)? <small>YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND FROM BEFORE YOU</small>.] This text is related (to Job 35:11): <small>WHO TEACHES US THROUGH THE BEASTS OF</small> {<small>THE</small>} <small>EARTH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verse in this sense, although a more usual translation <small>WOULD BE WHO TEACHES US MORE THAN THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH</small>.</i> He said to Israel: Learn from the bull of Elijah; for in the hour that Elijah said (in I Kings 18:25) <small>TO THE</small> {<small>WORSHIPERS</small>} [<small>PROPHETS</small>] <small>OF BAAL: CHOOSE ONE BULL FOR YOURSELVES AND PREPARE IT FIRST</small>, at that very hour the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred {and fifty} prophets of Asherah gathered together and were unable to budge its foot from the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:8; Numb. R. 23:9.</i> Look at what is written there (in vs. 23): <small>LET THEM GIVE US TWO BULLS…</small>. Elijah said to them: Choose two bulls for yourselves, twins from the same mother, who are being fattened at the same manger. Cast lots over them, one for the Name (i.e., the Holy One) and one for Baal. They choose the one bull for themselves. Now Elijah's bull kept following him; but as for that bull which had been assigned to the name of Baal, all those prophets of Baal plus the prophets of Asherah assembled to move &lt;even&gt; its foot from the ground, and were unable to do so, until Elijah began to say &lt;to it&gt; for them: Go with them. The bull answered and spoke to Elijah before the eyes of all the people by saying to him: My colleague and I came out of the same womb, and we grew up in the same pasture at the same feeding trough. That one was assigned to the portion of the Holy One, and the name of the Holy One is sanctified through him. So have I been assigned to the portion of Baal to provoke my creator? Elijah said to him: Go with them, and do not let them find an excuse. Just as the name of the Holy One is being sanctified through this one with me, so will it be sanctified through you. He said to him: Now that you have given me this advice, I swear that I will not move from here until you deliver me into their hand. Thus it is stated (in vs. 26): <small>SO THEY TOOK THE BULL THAT HE GAVE TO THEM AND PREPARED IT</small>. And who gave it to them? Elijah. You also learn that Elijah said to them (in vs. 25): <small>CHOOSE ONE BULL FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Then at the end &lt;of the verse&gt; is written (ibid. cont.): <small>AND THEY TOOK THE BULL WHICH HE HAD GIVEN THEM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Job 35:11): <small>WHO TEACHES US THROUGH THE BEASTS OF &lt;THE&gt; EARTH</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND</small> {<small>YOU MAKE</small>} [<small>HE MAKES</small>] <small>US WISE THROUGH THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verse in this sense, although a more usual translation would be <small>AND HE MAKES US WISER THAN THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</small>.</i> The Holy One said: Learn &lt;a lesson&gt; from the ravens who fed Elijah, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 17: 4, 6): <small>AND I HAVE COMMANDED THE RAVENS TO FEED YOU THERE</small>… [<small>SO THE RAVENS BROUGHT HIM BREAD AND MEAT…</small>.] From where did they bring him (in vs. 6) <small>BREAD AND MEAT IN THE MORNING, AND BREAD AND MEAT IN THE EVENING</small>? From Jehoshaphat's table, because those ravens did not want to enter Ahab's house to take anything from the table of that evil man for this righteous man. &lt;They would not go there&gt; because his house was full of idolatry. Ergo (in Job 35:11): {<small>YOU MAKE</small>} [<small>HE MAKES</small>] <small>US WISE THROUGH THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Learn from the bull and from the ravens, and do not turn unto idols to look at them. {Thus it is stated} [Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter} (in Numb. 33:52): <small>YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND</small>.

He said: The male slaves are mine and the female slaves are mine. It would be better for me to marry my male slaves ('<i>avadim</i>) to my female slaves, {my own to my own} [who belong to me]. Similarly the Holy One said: The land is mine, as stated (in Lev. 25:23): <small>FOR THE LAND BELONGS TO ME….</small> It also says (in Ps. 24:1): <small>THE LAND IS THE LORD'S AND ALL THAT IS IN IT…</small>.

(Numb. 35:9–11:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE &lt;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&gt;: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &lt;AND SAY UNTO THEM:&gt; WHEN YOU CROSS &lt;THE JORDAN TO THE LAND OF CANAAN, YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH CITIES TO BE CITIES OF REFUGE, WHERE A KILLER MAY FLEE WHO HAS TAKEN A LIFE BY MISTAKE&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 25:8): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD AND STRAIGHTFORWARD; THEREFORE HE INSTRUCTS SINNERS IN THE WAY</small>. (Ibid., vs. 6:) <small>BE MINDFUL OF YOUR MERCIES, O LORD, AND OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE…</small>. David said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the Universe, were it not for your mercies, which took precedence for the first Adam, he would not have survived.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:11; Numb. R. 23:13.</i> Although you said to him (in Gen. 2:17): <small>FOR ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOU SHALL SURELY DIE</small>, you did not act in that way. Instead you excluded him from the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE HUMAN</small>. So why was he driven out? Because he had brought death to &lt;all future&gt; generations, he should have died immediately; but because you were merciful to him, you &lt;simply&gt; drove him out. It is the same with one who kills by mistake, when he goes into exile into the cities of refuge. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 25:6): <small>BE MINDFUL OF YOUR MERCIES, O LORD, AND OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE</small>,…. When Moses arose, the Holy One said to him (in Numb. 35:11): <small>YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH CITIES &lt;TO BE CITIES OF REFUGE&gt;,…</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe, when someone takes a life by mistake in the South or in the North, how will he know where the cities of refuge are, to which he should flee?

(Numb. 35:11:) <small>WHERE A KILLER MAY FLEE WHO HAS TAKEN A LIFE BY MISTAKE</small>, and not on purpose. If someone goes and kills on purpose, then says: It was by mistake that I killed, and flees to &lt;one of the&gt; cities of refuge, the Holy One says: Even if he comes in and flees to my altar, kill him, according to what is stated (in Exod. 21:14): <small>BUT WHEN SOMEONE PLOTS AGAINST &lt;HIS COMPANION AND KILLS HIM TREACHEROUSLY&gt;, YOU SHALL TAKE HIM AWAY &lt;EVEN&gt; FROM MY ALTAR &lt;FOR EXECUTION&gt;</small>. Who was this person who fled to the altar and was killed? This was Joab, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 2:28): <small>WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO JOAB,…. &lt;JOAB FLED UNTO THE TENT OF THE LORD&gt; AND SEIZED THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR</small>. You find that Joab was a great sage and the head of the Sanhedrin,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Synehedrion.</i></i> as stated (in II Sam. 23:8): <small>ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">These words are commonly understood as the proper name, <small>JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE</small>, but this and other citations of the verse in rabbinic literature tend to understand the verse as translated here.

Cf. <i>MQ</i> 26b, for an interpretation that identifies this sage with David himself.</i> But did he not know what is written in the Torah (in Exod. 21:14): <small>&lt;BUT WHEN SOMEONE PLOTS AGAINST HIS COMPANION AND KILLS HIM TREACHEROUSLY&gt;, YOU SHALL TAKE HIM AWAY &lt;EVEN&gt; FROM MY ALTAR FOR EXECUTION</small>, [when he went and seized the horns of the altar]?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yMakk.</i> 2:7 [6] (31d); <i>Sanh.</i> 48b; see <i>Makk.</i> 12b.</i> It is simply that [Joab] had said: Those killed by a court of law are not buried in the graves of their ancestors but by themselves. It is better to die here, so that I may be buried with my ancestors. (I Kings 2:30–31:) <small>THEN BENAIAH BROUGHT BACK WORD UNTO THE KING, SAYING: THUS HAS JOAB SPOKEN AND THUS DID HE ANSWER ME. SO THE KING SAID TO HIM: DO AS HE HAS SPOKEN, STRIKE HIM DOWN AND BURY HIM</small>. Why was he killed? Because his (Solomon's) father, David, had ordered him &lt;to do&gt; so (in I Kings 2:5–6): <small>MOREOVER, YOU ALSO KNOW WHAT JOAB BEN ZERUIAH DID TO ME…. &lt;SO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR WISDOM, AND DO NOT LET HIS GRAY HAIR GO DOWN TO SHEOL IN PEACE</small>.&gt; What did he do to him? You find that, when David wrote to Joab (in II Sam. 11:15): <small>SET URIAH IN THE FRONT LINE WHERE THE FIGHTING IS THE FIERCEST</small>, he did so, and he was killed. All the army leaders assembled against Joab, as stated of him (in II Sam. 23:39): <small>URIAH THE HITTITE</small>, &lt;was one of&gt; <small>ALL</small> &lt;those&gt; {<small>THIRTY-SIX</small>} [<small>THIRTY-SEVEN</small>} &lt;leaders&gt;. He showed them the document. It is therefore stated (in I Kings 2:5): [<small>YOU KNOW</small>] <small>WHAT</small> [<small>JOAB BEN ZERUIAH</small>] <small>DID TO ME AND WHAT HE DID TO THE TWO COMMANDERS OF ISRAEL'</small>s <small>FORCES, TO ABNER BEN NER &lt;AND TO AMASA BEN JETHER&gt;</small> [….] They had been of the opinion that David had ordered him to kill him because Abner was Saul's cousin, and for that reason David arose and cursed Joab, when he said (in II Sam. 3:29): <small>MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK &lt;ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, ONE WHO GRASPS THE CRUTCH</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Modern translations commonly understand these words to mean, <small>A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE</small>, but the midrash understands them in the sense given here.</i> <small>ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD&gt;</small>.

Gk.: <i>peisai</i> (“to have persuaded”).</i> when they knew that there was no &lt;authorization&gt; from David. So David ordered his son, Solomon, to kill him, because Joab was the son of David's sister, and he wanted him to approach the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If he received punishment is this world, his deed would no longer bar him from doing so.</i> When Solomon desired to kill him, Joab said to Benaiah: Go and tell Solomon: Do not sentence me with two judgments.

Immediately (in I Kings 2:31): <small>SO</small> [<small>THE KING</small>] <small>SAID TO HIM: DO AS HE HAS SPOKEN</small>. [<small>STRIKE HIM DOWN AND BURY HIM</small>.] R. Judah has said: All curses with which David cursed Joab were all fulfilled in David's seed.

You also find that as long as Jehoiada lived, Joash did the will of his creator, as stated (in II Kings 12:3 [2] // II Chron. 24:2): <small>AND JEHOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS AS THE PRIEST JEHOIADA INSTRUCTED HIM</small>.

THEN THE KING HEARKENED UNTO THEM</small>, in that he took it upon himself to make an idol. Therefore (According to vs. 24): <small>&lt;THE ARMY OF ARAM CAME WITH A FEW MEN….&gt; SO THEY INFLICTED JUDGMENTS ON JOASH</small>. Now for what was Abner punished. It was because he had made the blood of the young men an amusement (rt.: <i><small>SHQ</small></i>), as stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>THEN ABNER SAID UNTO JOAB: PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY</small> (rt.: <i><small>SHQ</small></i>) <small>BEFORE US. SO JOAB SAID: LET THEM ARISE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The result of their “playing” was that they all killed each other. See above, Gen. 6:5; Exod. 1:24; Numb. 6:8.</i> There are also those who say it was because he put his name before the name of David, as stated (in II Sam. 3:12): <small>THEN ABNER SENT MESSENGERS UNTO DAVID WHERE HE WAS, SAYING: TO WHOM DOES THE LAND BELONG?</small> But the sages say: It was because he did not [wait] for Saul to be reconciled with David. Moreover, he had the power to protest &lt;the massacre&gt; at Nob, the city of priests, and did not protest.

You find that Sennacherib exiled Israel in three exiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 10:13; Numb. R. 23:14; cf. Lam. R. Proem 5.</i> First, he exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. Second, &lt;came&gt; the tribe of Zebulon and the tribe of Naphtali, as stated (in Is. 8:23 [9:1]): <small>IN THE FORMER TIME HE ABASED THE LAND OF ZEBULON AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI</small>. Third, he exiled the rest of the tribes, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LATER HE AFFLICTED &lt;THE WAY OF THE SEA, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Translations of this verse vary, but the translation given here fits the sense of the midrash.</i> Nebuchadnezzar also carried out three exiles with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In the first he exiled Jehoiakim &lt;and&gt; in the second, Jehoiachin. What did he do? He bound him in his carriage<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>carruca</i>; Gk.: <i>karrouchion.</i></i> and &lt;there&gt; he became dear to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In note 65 Buber suggests a translation such as, “and it was his favorite.”</i> Thus it is stated: Behold, I am sending you away like a queen mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The text is not in Scripture, but cf. Jer. 29:2.</i> Just as one honors the queen mother, so did Nebuzaradan act toward him. Then Nebuzaradan exiled Zedekiah, for a total of three exiles. The Holy one said: In this world Israel has gone into exile because of iniquities, but in the age to come (according to Deut. 30:4): <small>EVEN IF YOUR BANISHMENT IS TO THE END OF THE HEAVENS, FROM THERE WILL THE LORD YOUR GOD GATHER YOU, EVEN FROM THERE WILL HE BRING YOU BACK</small>. It also says (in Is. 11:12): <small>AND HE SHALL GATHER THE DISPERSED OF JUDAH…</small>. And it says (in Is. 35:10): <small>AND THE RANSOMED OF THE LORD SHALL SHALL RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH SINGING. EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UPON THEIR HEADS, THEY SHALL OBTAIN JOY AND GLADNESS, WHILE SORROW AND SIGHING SHALL FLEE AWAY</small>. And it says (in Is. 51:3): <small>TRULY THE LORD HAS COMFORTED ZION; HE HAS COMFORTED ALL ITS RUINS. HE HAS ALSO MADE ITS DESERT LIKE EDEN AND ITS DRY PLAIN LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD. JOY AND REJOICING SHALL BE FOUND IN IT, THANKSGIVING AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC</small>.

Devarim



Siman 1

(Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small> (<i>elleh hadevarim</i>). May the name &lt;of the Holy One&gt; be blessed and may his memory be exalted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 1:1.</i> All the miracles that he did for Israel in the wilderness, he is likewise going to do in Zion. It is written concerning the wilderness (ibid.): <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 42:16): <small>I WILL TURN DARKNESS BEFORE THEM INTO LIGHT AND ROUGH PLACES INTO LEVEL GROUND. THESE THINGS</small> (<i>elleh hadevarim</i>) [<small>I WILL DO, AND I WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM</small>]. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small> (<i>qol</i> in the plural); and it is written concerning Zion (in Jer. 7:34): <small>&lt;AND I WILL PUT AN END … &gt; TO THE SOUND</small> (<i>qol</i>) <small>OF JOY AND THE SOUND</small> (<i>qol</i>) <small>OF GLADNESS, THE VOICE</small> (<i>qol</i>) <small>OF THE BRIDEGROOM &lt;AND THE VOICE</small> (<i>qol</i>) <small>OF THE BRIDE&gt;</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH QUAKED</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6): <small>I WILL CAUSE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO QUAKE</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL GO BEFORE YOU</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE GLAD OVER YOU AGAIN</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19): <small>I WILL ALSO REJOICE IN JERUSALEM AND BE GLAD IN MY PEOPLE</small>. [&lt;Also&gt; (according to Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>.] What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5 [3]): <small>I WILL MAKE HER LIKE A WILDERNESS</small> [<small>AND RENDER HER LIKE AN ARID LAND</small>]. For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS &lt;AND THE ARID LAND&gt; SHALL BE GLAD</small>. Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2:) <small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>HAS RECEIVED FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. R. 1:22 (57).</i> So for that reason Isaiah has comforted her doubly (in vs. 1) <small>COMFORT, O COMFORT &lt;MY PEOPLE, SAYS YOUR GOD&gt;</small>. &lt;Similarly&gt; (in Is. 51:12): I, I <small>&lt;AM THE ONE WHO COMFORTS YOU&gt;</small>. &lt;Also&gt; (in Is. 51:9): <small>AWAKE, AWAKE, &lt;PUT ON STRENGTH, O ARM OF THE LORD&gt;</small>! &lt;Also&gt; (in Is. 51:17): <small>ROUSE YOURSELF, ROUSE YOURSELF</small>! <small>&lt;ARISE, O JERUSALEM</small> … !&gt; &lt;Also&gt; (in Is. 61:10): <small>I WILL BE GLAD WITH REJOICING &lt;IN THE LORD&gt;</small>. &lt;Also&gt; (in Is. 35:1–2) <small>&lt;THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD …;&gt; IT SHALL BLOSSOM WITH BLOSSOMS</small>.

Siman 2

Another Interpretation (of Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>. For what reason was this written? To teach you that when the Holy One revealed his Divine Presence over Israel, he {was not revealed &lt;in&gt;} [did not reveal] all his bounty to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty; for if he had revealed his bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3 [4]): <small>FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THEY HAVE NOT HEARD, NOR HAS AN EAR PERCEIVED, NOR HAS AN EYE SEEN &lt;A GOD BESIDES YOU, WHO WORKS FOR THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIM&gt;</small>. Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years, &lt;when&gt; Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3): <small>I AM</small> {<small>YOUR BROTHER</small>} <small>JOSEPH …, HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM; FOR THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM</small>. How much the more &lt;would Israel have been dismayed&gt; at &lt;a sudden revelation of&gt; the Holy One! What did the Holy One do for them instead? He revealed himself to them little by little. At the beginning, he made the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THE STEPPES SHALL REJOICE. THEN AFTER THAT</small> (in vs. 2): <small>IT SHALL BLOOM ABUNDANTLY</small>. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THE GLORY OF LEBANON</small> {<small>SHALL COME UNTO YOU</small>} [<small>HAS BEEN GIVEN TO IT</small>]. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THEY SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE LORD, THE SPLENDOR OF OUR GOD</small>. For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17 [16]): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS BUILD UP ZION; HE HAS APPEARED IN HIS GLORY</small>. It also says (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF THE LORD TO ZION</small>. [Moreover, it says] (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US. THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.

Siman 3

(Deut. 2:2–4:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO ME, SAYING: YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT THIS HILL COUNTRY. &lt;TURN NORTH. &gt; NOW CHARGE THE PEOPLE, SAYING: &lt;YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF YOUR KINDRED, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU, WHO DWELL IN SEIR. THOUGH THEY WILL BE AFRAID OF YOU, YOU ARE TO BE VERY WARY</small>.&gt; This text is related (to Ps. 60:1): <small>TO THE DIRECTOR: ACCORDING TO SHUSHAN EDUTH; A MIKHTAM OF DAVID; FOR INSTRUCTION</small>. When? (According to vs. 2) <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM AND ARAM-ZOBAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 1:3; see Gen. R. 74:15.</i> Now was it not already stated (in I Kings 11:15–16): [<small>AND HE</small> (Joab) <small>SMOTE EVERY MALE IN EDOM</small>;] <small>FOR JOAB &lt;AND ALL ISRAEL&gt; STAYED THERE SIX MONTHS, &lt;UNTIL HE HAD ANNIHILATED EVERY MALE IN EDOM&gt;</small>? Still it says next (here in Ps. 60:2, cont.): <small>JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE &lt;TWELVE THOUSAND&gt; EDOMITES IN THE VALLEY OF SALT</small>. This text is related (to Is. 50:8): <small>MY VINDICATOR IS AT HAND. WHO WILL CONTEND WITH ME</small>? <small>LET US STAND TOGETHER…</small>. The Holy One gave Torah to Israel, so that through it they would attain vindication before all peoples. You find that Joab was head of the Sanhedrin,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Synedrion</i>.</i> as stated (in II Sam. 23:8) {<small>AND</small>} <small>THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE WARRIORS WHOM DAVID HAD: ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These words are commonly understood as the proper name, <small>JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE</small>, but this and other citations of the verse in rabbinic literature tend to understand the verse as translated here. See above, <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 4:12, and the note there; also <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Numb. 10:9.: Cf. <i>MQ</i> 16b, for an interpretation that identifies this sage with David himself.</i> This was Joab; but David was wiser than all, since it is stated (in II Sam. 14:20 with reference to David): <small>MY LORD IS AS WISE</small> [<small>AS THE WISDOM OF AN ANGEL OF GOD</small>.] Still, they only acted on something in accord with the Sanhedrin, as stated (in Ps. 60:1): <small>TO THE DIRECTOR: ACCORDING TO SHUSHAN EDUTH</small> (i.e., <small>LILY OF WITNESS</small>); <small>A MIKHTAM OF DAVID. SHUSHAN EDUTH</small> refers to the Sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Cant. 7:3): <small>&lt;YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT&gt; FENCED IN WITH THE LILIES</small> (<i>shoshanim</i>). <small>WITNESS</small> (<i><small>EDUTH</small></i>) &lt;is mentioned&gt; because of the Torah, which is called a witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For this interpretation, see William G. Braude, <i>The Midrash on Psalms</i> (“Yale Judaica Series,” 13; New Haven: Yale, 1959), vol. 2, p. 477, n. 2 on Ps. 60, who explains that wheat symbolizes Torah and lilies represent the sages. Thus <small>SHUSHAN EDUTH</small>, “Lily of Witness,” alludes to the sages in the Sanhedrin, who teach from their knowledge of the Witness or Torah. See also above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Exod 9:1; Numb. 1:4, and the notes there.</i> <small>MIKHTAM</small> refers to David, who made himself humble (<i>Makh</i>) and innocent (<i>tam</i>), because he walked in innocence with his Creator. When? (According to Ps. 60:2) <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM</small>. What does that mean? When Joab went to fight with <small>ARAM-NAHARAIM</small>, they came out toward him. They said to him: You are one of the children of Jacob, but we are from the children of Laban. Now here is their confirmed agreement, as written (in Gen. 31:52): <small>THIS MOUND IS A WITNESS, &lt;AND THE PILLAR</small><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Matstsebah.</i> Cf. Braude, <i>ibid</i>., n. 1 to Ps. 60, who suggests that the mikhtam of Ps. 60:1 may denote a pillar.</i> <small>IS A WITNESS THAT I WILL NOT PASS BEYOND THIS MOUND AND THIS PILLAR UNTO YOU WITH EVIL INTENT&gt;</small>. When Joab heard &lt;that&gt;, he returned to David. He said to him: What do you say to that? Here is our ancestor Jacob's sworn agreement. They immediately convened a Sanhedrin, (in the words of Ps. 60:1) <small>A <i>SHUSHAN EDUTH</i></small> (i.e., <small>LILY OF WITNESS</small>) &lt; … &gt; [<small>FOR INSTRUCTION</small>]. They instructed him and said: It really was so, but they transgressed it first. Why did Balaam the Wicked transgress it? Does it not say so (in Numb. 23:7): <small>IT IS FROM ARAM THAT BALAK HAS BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB &lt;FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST&gt;</small> …? Moreover, did not Cushan-rishathaim (of Aram-naharaim) enslave us, as stated (in Jud. 3:8): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SERVED CUSHAN-RISHATHAIM EIGHT YEARS</small>? &lt;Thus&gt; they have committed two wicked acts against us. When the court had so {thanked} [instructed] him, he immediately turned back against them and slew them, as stated (in Ps. 60:2): <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM &lt;AND ARAM-ZOBAH, JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE EDOM, TWELVE THOUSAND, IN THE VALLEY OF SALT&gt;</small>. Did he not make war with Aram (i.e., Syria)? What is the meaning of <small>AND SMOTE EDOM</small>? It should have said "Aram" and not <small>EDOM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew block letters “Aram” and “Edom” look almost identical.</i> It is simply that when Joab came to fight with Aram, the children of Edom stood up to him and said to him: Did not the Holy One say to you (in Deut. 2:5): <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE</small>? Joab answered them: Did he not say this to us (in vs. 4): <small>YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF YOUR KINDRED, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU</small>? Allow us to pass! But they did not want to &lt;do so&gt;. Joab said to them: If we eradicate Edom now, we shall find nothing to eat or drink on our return. Instead let us leave them alone until we have smitten Aram, and then we shall turn back against them. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 60:2 [1]): <small>&lt;WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM &lt;AND ARAM-ZOBAH,&gt; JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE EDOM, TWELVE THOUSAND, IN THE VALLEY OF SALT&gt;</small>. The Holy One said: You are to eradicate Edom little by little. When the time comes, I will destroy and eradicate it, as stated (in Obad. vs. 19): {<small>HE SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE NEGEB AND THE MOUNTAIN</small>} [<small>THE NEGEB SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MOUNTAIN OF</small>] <small>&lt;ESAU&gt;…</small>. It also says (in vs. 20): <small>AND THE EXILES IN THIS ARMY &lt;OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;…</small>. And it says (in vs. 21): <small>FOR SAVIORS SHALL GO UP ON MOUNT ZION TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU</small>. At that time (ibid., cont.): <small>THE KINGDOM SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD</small>.

So no creature was able to stand before him, just as it says (ibid., cont.): <small>YET I DESTROYED HIS FRUIT ABOVE &lt;AND HIS ROOTS BELOW&gt;</small>. What did the Holy One do? He bound the &lt;angelic&gt; prince that belonged to him and to his land. Then he cast him {in} [from] his place and handed him over to Israel. Our masters have said: Sihon and Og were stronger than Pharaoh and his armies; for just as they uttered a song over the fall of Pharaoh, so were they worthy to utter a song at their fall. It is simply that David came and uttered a song over them, as stated (in Ps. 136:10): <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE EGYPT THROUGH THEIR FIRST-BORN…</small>. (vss. 17, 19) <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE GREAT KINGS …; SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES…</small>.

(Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT MOSES SPOKE</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:23): <small>THE ONE WHO REBUKES A PERSON WILL IN THE END FIND MORE FAVOR THAN THE ONE WITH A FLATTERING TONGUE. THE ONE WHO REBUKES A PERSON</small> is Moses, since he rebuked Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. R. 1:2.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WILL IN THE END FIND MORE FAVOR</small> &lt;also refers to Moses&gt;, since he found favor and good insight in the eyes of God and humanity. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 34:9): <small>PLEASE, IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES, O LORD</small>. (Prov. 28:23:) <small>THE ONE WITH A FLATTERING TONGUE</small> refers to Balaam, since he said to Israel (in Numb. 24:5): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR TENTS, O JACOB; YOUR TABERNACLES, O ISRAEL</small>. To what were they comparable? To a king's son, who had two guardians.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>paidagogoi.</i></i> One loved him and the other hated him. The one who loved him warned him and said: My son, watch yourself, lest you make a transgression, since your father is judge; and if he hears that you have committed a transgression, even though he is your father, he will not show partiality to you. But the one who hated him said to him: Why are you depressed? Your father is king! Do as you desire. Be afraid of no mortal, for your father will not be upset with you. Similarly the son is Israel. The two guardians are Moses and Balaam. Moses loved them and said to them (in Deut. 11:16–17): <small>TAKE HEED LEST YOUR HEART BE DECEIVED …; FOR THE ANGER OF THE LORD WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU</small>. Why? Because he is judge, as stated (in Deut. 4:39): <small>SO KNOW THIS DAY AND TAKE TO HEART THAT THE LORD IS GOD</small>. Balaam, however, said: Do not be afraid. You are his children. Do whatever you want, for he will not be upset with you. To all the nations he does whatever he decrees over them. Why? (Numb. 23:19:) <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN, THAT HE SHOULD SPEAK FALSEHOOD</small>. But in your case he said (ibid., cont.): <small>HAS HE GIVEN HIS WORD WITHOUT ACTING &lt;ON IT&gt;</small>? <small>AND HAS HE SPOKEN &lt;SOMETHING&gt; WITHOUT FULFILLING IT</small>? On this point Solomon cries out and says (in Prov. 27:6): <small>THE WOUNDS OF A LOVED ONE ARE FOUND TO BE TRUSTWORTHY</small>. This refers to Moses. (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE KISSES OF AN ENEMY ARE PROFUSE</small>. This refers to Balaam. (Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>.

Another interpretation: By your circumcision, which is his desire (<i><small>T</small>s<small>BYWN</small></i>, i.e., gazelle [<i><small>T</small>s<small>BYH</small></i>]). Another interpretation: By the fathers, the mothers, and the tribes, which are likened to a deer. (Cant. 2:7, cont.:) <small>OR BY HINDS OF THE FIELD</small>. These are the tribes, which were likened to a hind where it is stated (in Gen. 49:21): <small>NAPHTALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE</small>.

(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON AND HIS LAND OVER TO YOU. BEGIN &lt;TO TAKE&gt; POSSESSION &lt;OF HIS LAND&gt;</small>.

When Hadrian the Wicked conquered Jerusalem, he took pride in saying: I conquered Jerusalem by force. R. Johanan ben Zakkai said to him: Do not take pride &lt;in this&gt;.

There he showed him &lt;where&gt; the Amorites &lt;lay&gt; buried, and one of them was eighteen cubits long. He said to him: When we had virtue, all these fell at our hands, but now because of our sins, you have prevailed against us. So Scripture says (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITE BEFORE YOU</small>. By virtue of what? By virtue of the Torah, which you accepted &lt;and&gt; which begins (in Exod. 20:2): I (<i>anokhi</i>) <small>AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. It is through the word <i>anokhi</i> (in Amos 2:9): I (<i>anokhi</i>) <small>DESTROYED THE AMORITE BEFORE YOU</small>.

Siman 8

Our masters have taught: Sihon was as strong as a wall tower.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Deut. 1:5; M. Pss. 136:11.</i> When he sat on the wall his feet reached to the ground, and there was no creature on earth able to stand against him. So what did the Holy One do? He bound his guardian angel (<i><small>SRW SL M</small>'<small>LH</small></i>, rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>), cast him down, and deliverered him into the hand of Moses. It is so stated (with reference to the Amorite in Amos 2:9, cont.): <small>I DESTROYED HIS FRUIT ABOVE</small> (<i><small>MM</small>'<small>L</small></i>, rt.: '<i><small>LH</small></i>) <small>AND HIS ROOTS BELOW</small>, i.e., his seed. Why? Because the Holy One foresaw his children and his children's children up to the resurrection that not one of them would fear Heaven, he immediately cut off his seed. But how did the Amorites die? Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One prepared two hornets for each and every one of them, as stated (in a literal translation of Deut. 7:20): <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD</small> [<small>YOUR</small>] <small>GOD WILL SEND THE HORNET AMONG THEM</small>. Now the hornet flies and smites one in the midst of his eye. Then immediately his eye drops out and he dies. And this is what David said (in Ps. 44:4 [3]): <small>FOR THEY DID NOT TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND WITH THEIR OWN SWORD, NOR DID THEIR MIGHTY ARM DELIVER THEM…</small>. If you had not helped them they would not have overcome them. So for that reason, when Moses saw them, he was afraid of them, until the Holy One said to him: Do not be afraid of them. The sages have said: Sihon and Og were stronger than Pharaoh and his armies; for just as they uttered a song over the fall of Pharaoh and his army, so were they worthy to utter &lt;a song&gt; over Sihon and Og. It is simply that David came and uttered a song over them (in Ps. 136:19–20): <small>SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER; AND OG, KING OF BASHAN, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER</small>.

Siman 9

(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE &lt;SIHON AND HIS LAND&gt; OVER TO YOU</small> (in the singular). He did not say: "To you (in the plural)," but <small>TO YOU</small> (in the singular), &lt;i.e.,&gt; because of you (in the singular). Now it was not because Israel possessed good works that I handed them over, but because of you. Moses said: You are sending an Angel. I have no need for him, (in the words of Exod. 33:15) <small>IF YOUR PRESENCE DOES NOT GO ALONG</small>. The Holy One said: Is it because of the angel that you are making a complaint? By your life, it shall not be an angel but a single hornet that I will send, and it shall finish them; for so it says (in Josh. 24:12): <small>I SENT THE HORNET BEFORE YOU, &lt;WHICH DROVE OUT THOSE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES FROM BEFORE YOU&gt;</small>.

Siman 10

(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE &lt;SIHON AND HIS LAND&gt; OVER TO YOU</small>. What is written there (in Deut. 2:24)? <small>&lt;SEE, I HAVE GIVEN SIHON, THE AMORITE KING OF HESHBON, INTO YOUR HAND ALONG WITH HIS LAND. BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION,&gt; AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>. But they did not do so. Rather (we read in vs. 26:) <small>THEN I SENT MESSENGERS &lt;FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH UNTO KING SIHON OF HESHBON WITH WORDS OF PEACE&gt;</small>. The Holy One said: I said: <small>AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>, but you are talking of peace. (Is. 48:22:) <small>THERE IS NO PEACE, SAYS THE LORD, FOR THE WICKED</small>. See, the words of peace are so great that Israel nullified what he had told them (in Deut. 2:24): <small>AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>. Still he was not angry with them.
[(Deut. 2:26:) <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small> (rt.: <i><small>QDM</small></i>)? Moses said to him: From you I learned that you existed before (rt.: <i><small>QDM</small></i>) the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Deut. 2:26.</i> You could have sent a single bolt of lightning to burn Egypt, but you did not do so. Rather you sent me to Pharaoh, as stated (in Exod. 5:1): <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>. Ergo <small>KEDEMOTH</small>.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 2:26): <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small>. From the Torah I learned that it existed before (rt.: <i><small>QDM</small></i>) everything. When you came to give it, it was revealed to you that the children of Esau and the children of Keturah would not accept it. But nevertheless you persevered and demanded it for them so that they would accept it. Therefore (in Deut. 2:26): <small>I SENT MESSENGERS &lt;FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH&gt;</small>. The Holy One said: You are asking peace. By your life you shall take possession of their land in peace, as stated (in Ps. 37:11): <small>BUT THE MEEK SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND AND TAKE DELIGHT IN ABUNDANT PEACE</small>.

When Nebuchadnezzar heard &lt;what they were saying&gt;, he sent to have the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Synedrion.</i></i> and Zedekiah come to him.

Immediately (in the words of Lam. 2:10): <small>THE ELDERS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION SIT ON THE GROUND AND SILENCE</small>. R. Isaac said: &lt;This teaches that&gt; they removed the pillows and cushions from beneath them. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>LIKE ONE WHO FEARS AN OATH</small>.

From here &lt;we know&gt; that he feared an oath. The former died with his eyes gouged out, and the latter died with his eyes gouged out.

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &lt;HAPPENS&gt; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &lt;FALLS&gt; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED</small>. Moses said [to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe,] everything is the same for you; (according to Job 9:22) {<small>YOU DESTROY</small>} [<small>HE DESTROYS</small>] <small>THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. The spies provoked you with anger by slandering the land, while I have served your children forty years in the wilderness. Is the same lot [in store] for me as for them? A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who wanted to take a wife. He sent emissaries<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shulahin.</i> The word represents the Hebrew concept behind the Greek and Latin words translated “apostles” and denotes people having the ancient equivalent of a power of attorney.</i> to see whether she was beautiful or not. They went to see her. &lt;Then&gt; they came &lt;back&gt; and said to him: We have seen her and there is no one more desolate and ugly than she. When her sponsor heard, he said: My Lord, there is no one in the world more beautiful than she. He came to take her. The father of the young woman said to the king's emissaries: I swear that none of you shall come to &lt;the wedding feast&gt;, seeing that you humiliated her before the king. When the sponsor came to enter, he said to him: You also may not come in. The sponsor said to him: Did I not see her and tell the king that there was no one more beautiful than she, while those said: There is no one more ugly than she? And now I shall see whether &lt;she is&gt; like my report or like their report. Similarly Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, the spies uttered slander, &lt;in describing the land (in Numb. 13:32) as&gt; <small>A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS</small>. I, however, have not seen it, but I have praised it before your children (in Deut. 8:7): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND…</small>. And now I shall see whether &lt;it is&gt; like my report or like their report. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:25): <small>PLEASE LET ME CROSS OVER AND SEE THE GOOD LAND</small>. He said to him (in Deut. 3:27): <small>&lt;GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH …,&gt; FOR YOU SHALL NOT CROSS OVER &lt;THIS JORDAN&gt;</small>. He said to him: If so, everything is the same for you. (In accordance with Job 9:22) <small>HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>.

Why did Moses only pray under the word, "beseeching (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>)"? &lt;This is the usage here&gt; where it is stated (in Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT</small> (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>) <small>THE LORD</small>. It is simply that when Moses stood there and said to the Holy One (in Exod. 33:18): <small>PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR GLORY</small>, he said to him: Sovereign of the World, please show me by what principle you run your world. The Holy One said to him: I will show you. (Exod. 33:19:) <small>AND HE SAID: I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS</small> [<small>BEFORE YOU</small>]. The Holy One said to him: I have no obligation to &lt;any&gt; creature, but I am giving you &lt;this&gt; as a favor (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>). Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small> (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>) <small>TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small>. [Moses said to him: If so, do me a kindness, and grant it to me as a favor (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>). Ergo (in Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD</small>.]

Another interpretation (of Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT &lt;THE LORD&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 30:19): <small>INDEED, O PEOPLE IN ZION, INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM</small>, [<small>YOU SHALL SURELY WEEP NO MORE. &lt;HE WILL SURELY SHOW YOU COMPASSION</small> (rt.: <i><small>HNN</small></i>)&gt;…. ] What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 3:12)?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 2:4.</i> &lt;…&gt; <small>AND ITS CITIES I GAVE</small> {<small>TO THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND TO THE CHILDREN OF GAD</small>} [<small>TO THE REUBENITES AND TO THE GADITES</small>].

He should not say that, whereas he has made a will, he will no longer pray. Rather he should pray, because the Holy One does not disqualify the prayer of [any] creature. See here. Moses made a will, as stated (in Deut. 23:12): &lt; … &gt; <small>AND ITS CITIES I GAVE TO THE REUBENITES AND TO THE GADITES</small> [….: (vs. 14:) <small>JAIR BEN MANASSEH &lt;RECEIVED&gt;….</small> (vs. 15:)<small>TO MACHIR I GAVE GILEAD</small>.

[Moses said to him:] Sovereign of the World, you addressed me as <small>MY SERVANT MOSES</small> (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT</small> ('<i>eved</i>) <small>MOSES</small>. I am a servant ('<i>eved</i>), and Leviathan is a servant ('<i>eved</i>). I act the suppliant before you, and he acts the suppliant before you, as stated (in Job 40:27 [41:3]): <small>WILL HE MAKE MANY SUPPLICATIONS UNTO YOU</small>? The supplication of Leviathan you hear, for you have made a covenant with him and sustain him, as stated (in Job 40:28 [41:4]): <small>WILL HE MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU FOR YOU TO TAKE HIM AS YOUR SERVANT</small> ('<i>eved</i>) <small>FOREVER</small>? Now I am your servant ('<i>eved</i>), you have said to me (in Exod. 34:10): <small>I HEREBY MAKE A COVENANT</small>. But you have not carried it out. Instead you have said to me (in Deut. 32:50): <small>AND YOU SHALL DIE ON THE MOUNTAIN &lt;THAT YOU ARE ASCENDING&gt;…</small>. And not only that, but you have written in the Torah and said (in Exod. 21:5–6): <small>BUT IF THE SLAVE</small> ('<i>eved</i>) <small>SAYS: I LOVE MY MASTER, &lt;MY WIFE, AND MY CHILDREN&gt;; I WILL NOT GO AWAY A FREE PERSON. THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM BEFORE GOD, AND HE SHALL BRING HIM UNTO THE DOOR OR UNTO THE DOORPOST, WHERE HIS MASTER SHALL PIERCE HIS EAR WITH AN AWL, AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOREVER</small>. &gt; Now I love you and I love your children; (in accord with Exod. 21:5) <small>I WILL NOT GO AWAY A FREE PERSON</small>. I do not want to die. (Exod. 21:6:) <small>THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM BEFORE GOD …, AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOREVER</small>. But you have not carried it out with me. So now please, (Ps. 61:2 [1]:) <small>HEAR MY SONG OF PRAYER, O GOD</small>. (Ps. 55:2 [1]:) <small>DO NOT HIDE YOURSELF FROM MY BESEECHING</small>. The Holy One said to me: Impossible! (Deut. 3:26:) <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! The litigant against you (Satan) has already made a decision over you that you and all creatures like you are to die.
When the first Adam ate from the tree, he caused death for all. Another interpretation (of Deut. 3:26): <small>SO THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! The litigant against you has already preceded you, as Job has already stated (in Job 31:35): <small>O THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE ME A HEARING</small>! [<small>HERE IS MY SIGNATURE.

So what did Job say (in Job 3:19)? <small>THE SMALL AND THE GREAT ARE THERE, AND THE SLAVE</small> ('<i>eved</i>) <small>IS FREE FROM HIS MASTERS</small>. Ergo (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! <small>DO NOT &lt;EVER&gt; SPEAK &lt;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&gt; AGAIN</small>.

Siman 6

[(Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! <small>DO NOT &lt;EVER&gt; SPEAK &lt;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&gt; AGAIN</small>.] This is related to what Job said (in Job 20:6): <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE'S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS, AND HIS HEAD REACHES THE CLOUDS</small>. With reference to what does this scripture speak? It only speaks with reference to the day of death.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 2:6.</i> So even though one ascends to the heavens and makes himself wings like a bird, when his time to die arrives, his wings are broken, and he falls before the angel of death like an animal before the butcher. So also has David said (in Ps. 146:4): <small>HIS SPIRIT DEPARTS; HE RETURNS TO THE GROUND; &lt;ON THAT DAY HIS PLANS PERISH&gt;</small>.
(Job 20:6): <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE'S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS</small>. This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and whose feet trod on Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from his hand. When his time to die arrived, he said to him (in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>. &lt;Moses&gt; said to him: Sovereign of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before your children like a horse? Is my end the worm and the maggot? R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said: This is suitable only for the king. What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i> The king said: Cut off his head with it.

Lat.: <i>census</i>; Gk.: <i>kensos.</i></i> death over the first Adam. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, [the first] Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. But I should not die. He said to him: Consider Abraham, who sanctified my name in the world but &lt;still&gt; died. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, consider &lt;the fact that&gt; out of him there came Ishmael, whose race provoked you to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) <small>THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY, THE ONES WHOM GOD BROUGHT FORTH IN HIS HAND</small>. He said to him: consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar. He said to him: Out of him there came Esau the Wicked, who destroyed your sanctuary and burned your temple. He said to him: Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes. He said to him Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he did not receive Torah from your hand, and he did not speak with you face to face. The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! <small>DO NOT &lt;EVER&gt; SPEAK &lt;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&gt; AGAIN</small>. He said to him: Perhaps &lt;future&gt; generations will say: If he had not found evil things in Moses, he would not have removed him from the world. He said to him: I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10): <small>NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, perhaps [the people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age. He said to him: I have already written (in Deut. 32:51): [<small>BECAUSE YOU ACTED FAITHLESSLY WITH ME</small>] <small>&lt;AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AT THE WATERS OF MERIBATH-KADESH IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN&gt;, BECAUSE YOU DID NOT SANCTIFY ME &lt;AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. 20:12.</i> He said to him: If you are willing, let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years [there], and after that let me die. He said to him: It is an irrevocable decision from me. He said to him: If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death. He said to him: Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, why all this anger against me? (According to Deut. 32:51) <small>BECAUSE HE DID NOT SANCTIFY ME</small>. He said to him: With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29): <small>BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A MAN</small>; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me. The Holy One said to him: See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. (1) In the first place you said (in Exod. 4:13) <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. (2, in Exod. 5:23:) <small>FOR EVER SINCE I CAME TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME</small>, [<small>HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE, AND YOU HAVE STILL NOT DELIVERED YOUR PEOPLE</small>]. (3, In Numb. 16:29:) <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>. (4, In Numb. 16:30:) <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW</small>. (5, In Numb. 20:10:) <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS, &lt;SHALL WE BRING FORTH WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK&gt;</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.</i> (6, Numb:32:14:) <small>AND NOW YOU BROOD OF SINNERS HAVE ARISEN IN PLACE OF YOUR ANCESTORS</small>. But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children? He said to him: I have learned so from you, when you said (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): <small>THE CENSERS OF &lt;THESE&gt; WHO HAVE SINNED &lt;AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES&gt;</small>. He said to him: I said (ibid.): <small>AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES</small>, and not: "At the cost of their ancestors." He said to him: Sovereign of the World: I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before you a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, you forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads because of me, yet you are not taking care of me. He said to him: Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now time was delivered into your hands, but now time is not delivered into your hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which you have brought on my body. So do not deliver me into the bonds of the angel of death. Moreover, if you do this, I will proclaim your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17–18): <small>I SHALL NOT DIE, BUT LIVE AND RECOUNT THE WORKS OF THE LORD. &lt;THE LORD HAS PUNISHED ME SEVERELY, BUT HE DID NOT HAND ME OVER TO DEATH</small>.&gt; He said to him (in vs. 20): <small>THIS IS THE GATE OF THE LORD</small>; [<small>THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL COME THROUGH IT</small>.] From this it follows that for the righteous and for all mortals death has been ordained from time immemorial. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to heaven and earth, where he said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6): <small>FOR THE HEAVENS SHALL VANISH LIKE SMOKE, AND THE EARTH SHALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See ‘<i>AZ</i> a for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.</i> He went to the sun and the moon. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 24:23): <small>THEN THE MOON SHALL BE ASHAMED, AND THE SUN SHALL BE ABASHED</small>. He went to the stars and planets. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: [Instead of us seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, [since it is stated] (in Is. 34:4): <small>ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN SHALL ROT AWAY</small> [….] He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: We should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10): <small>FOR THE MOUNTAINS SHALL MOVE, AND THE HILLS SHALL BE SHAKEN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical versions but fits the sense of the midrash.</i> He went to the Great Sea. He said to it: [Seek mercy for me. The sea] said to him: Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of &lt;other&gt; days? Are you not the son of Amram? &lt;Are you not the one&gt; who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12): <small>WHO HAD &lt;HIS GLORIOUS ARM&gt; WALK AT THE RIGHT HAND OF MOSES, &lt;WHO DIVIDED THE WATERS BEFORE THEM&gt;…</small>. So now what has happened to you? When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, &lt;AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME&gt;</small>! When I stood by you, I was a king in the world; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me. Immediately he betook himself to the Arch&lt;angel&gt; of the &lt;Divine&gt; Presence and said to him: Seek mercy for me, that I not die. He said to him: My Master, Moses, why is this a problem? This is what I have heard from behind the Curtain:<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pargod.</i> Cf. Lat.: <i>paragauda</i> or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: <i>Paragaudes</i> (a garment with a purple border).</i> that your prayer has not been heard on this matter. Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said: With whom shall I seek mercy for myself? R. Simlay said: At that time the Holy One was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26): <small>BUT THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME</small>, until Moses began by uttering this scripture: (Exod. 34:6:) [<small>THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE HIM AND PROCLAIMED</small>:] <small>THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, &lt;SLOW TO ANGER&gt;…</small>. Immediately the Holy Spirit cooled him off. The Holy One said to Moses: Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, are you coming to me with a plot? You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from your hand lick the dust? Woe<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vay.</i></i> to all mortals. They will say: If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with him face to face, and received Torah from his hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, how much the worse it will be for &lt;mere&gt; flesh and blood, who comes with no Torah and with no commandments? The Holy One said to Moses: Why all this sorrow over which you are sorrowing? He said: Sovereign of the World, I am afraid of the bonds of the angel of death. He said to him: I am not delivering you into his hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, my mother [Jochebed], who was put to shame (literally: whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be put to shame by my death. He said to him: This has come to mind, but this is the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pronoi</i> (“prudent ones”).</i> every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve &lt;me&gt;, [but now the lot of your disciple Joshua has arrived for him to serve &lt;me&gt;]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple! He said to him: If you want to do that, go and do it. Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.</i> Now Joshua was seated expounding &lt;Torah&gt;, so Moses stopped to bend his proud stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself [to death]. When Israel came to Moses' door, they found him at the door of Joshua with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua: What has come over you that Moses our Master stands, while you sit? When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said: O my Master, my Master! My Father, my Father and Lord! Israel said to Moses: Moses our Master, teach us Torah. He said to them: I have no authority. They said to him: We are not leaving you. A heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) came forth and said to them: Learn from Joshua. They took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with Eleazar and Ithamar to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Johanan said: When Joshua opened by saying: Blessed be the one who has chosen the righteous and their Mishnaic teaching, they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose &lt;from the session&gt;, they said to Moses: Close off the Torah for us. He said to them: I do not know what to answer you. So Moses our Master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said: Sovereign of the World, up to now I wanted to live, but now here is my soul given over to you.. Then when he had resigned his soul to death, the Holy One opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16): <small>WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS</small>? Who will stand for Israel in the time of my wrath? Who will stand in the battle of my children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before me? At that time Metatron<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>metator</i> (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).</i> came and fell on his face. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, &lt;as&gt; in Moses' life he belonged to you, so in his death he belongs to you. The Holy One said to him: Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day his father was angry with him and sought to kill him, because he did not maintain respect for his father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. Her servants said to him: Our Lord King, why are you weeping? He said to them: It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, she rescued him from my hand. So also did the Holy One say to Metatron: It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before me [to turn back my anger from destroying them]. They came and said to Moses: The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said to them: Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them. He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said: The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world. He said to Israel: I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me. They said to him: Our Lord Master, you are forgiven. Israel also arose before him and said to him: O Moses our Master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us. He said to them: You are forgiven. They came and said to him: The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said: Blessed be the name of the one who lives and abides forever. He said to Israel: If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones. They said: Woe (<i>oy</i>) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness. They came and said to him: The half moment has arrived. He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel: See the final end of flesh and blood. My two hands with which I received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall in the grave. At that moment his breath departed with a kiss (from the Holy One),<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>MQ</i> 28a.</i> as stated (in Deut. 34:5): <small>THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE &lt;IN THE LAND OF MOAB AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small> (literally: <small>ON THE MOUTH OF THE LORD</small>)&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BB</i> 17a; <i>ARN</i>, A 12:2; Cant.

Appendix to Vaetchanan



Siman 1

(Job 20:6:) <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE'S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS</small>. This refers to Moses, when he ascended unto the firmament and drew near unto the Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from the hand of the Holy One. But when he besought him that he not die, the Holy One said to him: (in Deut. 3:26): <small>DO NOT &lt;EVER&gt; SPEAK &lt;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&gt; AGAIN</small>. Why was the Holy One angry with Moses? Because he had rebuked Israel. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. He handed him over to a <i>paidagogos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This Greek word does not correspond to the English “pedagogue.” Rather it denotes a slave whose task was to accompany a child as a companion to steer him on the right ways of life. The <i>paidagogos</i> was more of a nanny than a teacher. See my chapter, “Ancient Education in the Time of the Early Roman Empire,” in <i>The Catacombs and the Colosseum,</i> edited by S. Benko and J. J. O’Rourke (Valley Forge: Judson, 1971), pp. 139–163, especially p. 144.</i> &lt;When&gt; the <i>paidagogos</i> became angry with him and reprimanded him, the king heard &lt;about the reprimand&gt; and said: By the life of my kingdom, you are not entering my palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Palterin.</i> Gk.: <i>praitorion</i>; Lat.: <i>praetorium.</i></i> Similarly when Moses said to Israel (in Numb. 20:10): <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS</small>, the Holy One said to him (in Numb. 20:12): <small>THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION &lt;INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&gt;</small>.
(Deut. 3:24:) <small>YOU HAVE &lt;ONLY&gt; BEGUN</small> &lt;<small>TO SHOW YOUR SERVANT YOUR GREATNESS AND YOUR MIGHT…. &gt;</small> He said to him: You are the one who opened a door for me to pray to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 3:24 (27).</i> When? When they did that deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when they made and worshiped the golden calf. See Deut. 9:7–12.</i> The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 9:14): <small>LET ME ALONE, AND I WILL DESTROY THEM AND BLOT OUT THEIR NAME FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>. Moses said: Who would seize hold of the Holy One? One only seeks to pray for one's children. What is written there (in Exod. 32:11)? <small>AND MOSES IMPLORED THE LORD HIS GOD</small>. Moses said: Once I prayed for the community and was answered, but the community prayed for me and was not answered. Why? Because you have issued a decree over me &lt;for calling them rebels&gt;! But you were the one who began by calling them &lt;rebels&gt; (in Numb. 17:25 [10]): <small>&lt;PUT BACK AARON'S ROD … &gt; TO BE KEPT AS A SIGN FOR THE CHILDREN OF REBELLION</small>. Then because I called them &lt;rebels&gt; (in Numb. 20:10): <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS</small>, you said (in 20:12): <small>THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION &lt;INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&gt;</small>.
(Deut. 3:26:) <small>BUT THE LORD WAS WRATHFUL WITH ME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WAS WRATHFUL</small> (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>)? R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagreed. One said: He was full of wrath (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>), while the other said: He made him like a pregnant (rt.: '<i><small>RB</small></i>) woman who cannot sit because of her fetus. The Holy One said to Moses: You are an example<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>deigma.</i></i> for judges, and they pervert justice. Therefore (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! You have a lot &lt;of merit stored&gt; with me for the world to come, where I am repaying you. It is also stated about this (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>.

Siman 2

(Deut. 4:25:) <small>WHEN YOU HAVE BEGOTTEN CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</small>. This text is related (to Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. When Moses arrived at passing from the world, the Holy One declared to him what Israel was going to do after the death of Joshua. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 31:16): <small>THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND</small>. For that reason Moses warned them (in Deut. 31:29): <small>FOR I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL SURELY ACT CORRUPTLY</small>. But they said to him: We will not do this thing. He said to them: You are going to beget <small>CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</small> and forget the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Deut. 4:26; 30:19): <small>I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY….</small> Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>.
And so you find that Israel did everything that he had said to them in the days of the judges, as stated (in Jud. 10:6): <small>&lt;AGAIN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD&gt; AND SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASTARTES</small>. So also Jeroboam, as stated (in I Kings 12:28–29): <small>SO THE KING TOOK COUNSEL AND MADE TWO CALVES OF GOLD &lt;….&gt; THEN HE SET ONE IN BETHEL AND THE OTHER HE</small> {<small>SET</small>} [<small>PUT</small>] <small>IN DAN</small>. Moreover, he did not allow Israel to go up to Jerusalem. Instead he said: These are your Gods, O Israel. So also Ahab sinned and made Israel sin more than all he wicked ones who came before him. (I Kings 16:30:) <small>AND AHAB</small> [<small>BEN OMRI</small>] <small>DID MORE EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD THAN ALL WHO &lt;HAD COME&gt; BEFORE HIM</small>. You yourself know that he sold himself to idolatrous worship, as stated (in I Kings 21:25): <small>&lt;INDEED THERE WAS NO ONE&gt; LIKE AHAB WHO SOLD HIMSELF TO DO EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD</small>. He also made them forget the name of the Holy One. How? He blotted out the references &lt;to the Divine Name&gt; and wrote in their place, &lt;e.g.,&gt; "And Baal spoke," "In the beginning Baal," "And Baal said." And for all the whole Torah he did likewise. That is what the prophet says (in Jer. 23:27): <small>THE ONES WHO INTEND TO MAKE MY PEOPLE FORGET MY NAME</small>. But Menasseh did more than all of them, as stated (in II Chron 33:7; cf. II Kings 21:7): <small>AND HE SET UP A SCULPTURED IMAGE &lt;WHICH HE HAD MADE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD&gt;…</small>. (II Chron. 33:6 // II <small>KINGS</small> 21:6): <small>AND HE HAD HIS SONS PASS THROUGH FIRE</small> {<small>FOR MOLECH</small>} <small>IN THE VALLEY OF BEN-HINNOM. HE ALSO PRACTICED SOOTHSAYING, AUGURY</small>, [<small>SORCERY</small>,] <small>NECROMANCY, AND WIZARDRY</small>. [<small>HE DID MUCH EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD TO PROVOKE HIM TO ANGER</small>.] And how &lt;did he do it&gt;? Molech was in the valley of Ben-hinnom.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lam. R. 1:9 (36).</i> It took place outside of Jerusalem and in a remote place. There was also an image &lt;there&gt; with the face of a calf and with its hands extended like a human [whose hands are open to receive] something from one's friend. Then they heated it until its hands became like fire. It also had seven latticed gates,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qanqalim.</i> Probably from the Gk.: <i>kingklis,</i> or the Lat.: <i>cancelli,</i> but Buber, n. 5, suggests the word comes from <i>coenacula,</i> which means “upper rooms.”</i> with &lt;the image&gt; behind the innermost of them. Each and every one would enter in accordance with his offering. Whoever offered a bird entered the first lattice gate. With a goat he entered the second lattice gate; with a lamb, the third; with a calf, the fourth; with a bullock, the fifth; with a bull, the sixth. To whoever was offering his child the idol priests would say that there is none higher than that. He entered within the seventh lattice gate. Then he went and kissed it, as stated (in Hos. 13:2): <small>THOSE WHO SACRIFICE A HUMAN BEING KISS CALVES</small>. Then the idol priests would take his child from him and put the young child<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tinoq</i>. “Young child” rather than “infant” here, because a parallel description in Lam. R. suggests that the offering might be an offspring somewhat older than an infant.</i> upon the hands of Molech, while they took the drums and beat on them, so that the father would not hear the voice of his child. Then they pressed the young child's entrails upon it, while the young child screamed until &lt;its spirit&gt; left its body in the hands of &lt;the idol&gt;. R Judah the Levite said: That is what is written (in Jer. 7:31): <small>AND THEY HAVE BUILT THE HIGH PLACES OF TOPHETH, WHICH ARE IN THE VALLEY OF BEN-HINNOM &lt;TO BURN THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN THE FIRE&gt;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TOPHETH</small>? That they beat on their drums (<i>tuppim</i>, sing.: <i>toph</i>). What is the meaning of <small>HINNOM</small>? That the idol priests said to Molech, when the young child screamed (rt.: <i><small>NHM</small></i>): May it be pleasing to you! May it be appealing to you! Look at how fervent they were for idolatry! The Holy One said: It is on account of the evil drive (<i>yetser hara</i>) that you have sinned and gone into exile; but in the age to come I am rooting it (i.e., the evil drive) out of you,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. R. 2:30.</i> as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH</small>.

Siman 3

(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 5:9 [10]): <small>A LOVER OF MONEY NEVER RECEIVES ENOUGH MONEY; NOR WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE, &lt;ENOUGH&gt; PRODUCE. &lt;THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. &gt; R. Nehemiah says: Whoever loves the Torah never receives enough Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. R. 2:26/27.</i> &lt;When&gt; one learns Mishnah, he seeks to learn the Talmud. &lt;When&gt; one learns, Talmud, he seeks to learn Tosafot.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Buber, in n. 7, that Tosefta is what is meant here.</i> So also: <small>NOR WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE, ENOUGH PRODUCE</small>. Nor does he raise up students.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.</i> <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>.
Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:9 [10]): <small>WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE</small> (rt.: <i><small>HMH</small></i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; whoever longs for (rt.: <i><small>HMH</small></i>) and yearns (rt.: <i><small>HMH</small></i>) after the commandments. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOR &lt;ENOUGH&gt; PRODUCE</small>, for he does not have good works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. Moreover, the one who cherishes the commandments is Moses. For when he came to pass from the world, &lt; there was&gt; a small commandment that he had left out. He would not pass from the world until &lt;in his words &gt;: I separate it out while I still have the power in hand. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:41): <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES</small>.

Siman 4

(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THEN</small>? &lt;It is&gt; a word &lt;denoting&gt; a song. Who uttered a song? The murderer of whom it is written (in Numb. 35:16): <small>THE MURDERER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>; for the murderer will not be slain.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the one who kills by accident will not be slain, when he reaches one of the cities of refuge set apart by Moses.</i>
Another interpretation: Who uttered a song? Moses uttered a song. A common<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> proverb says: Whoever eats the dish knows how it tastes.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. R. 2:26/27.</i> Because he had killed the Egyptian and fled, he therefore knew what was in the soul of a killer. So it says (in Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART</small>.
Another interpretation: Who uttered a song? Israel uttered a song. Since it is written (in Numb. 35:33): <small>AND FOR THE LAND THERE IS NO EXPIATION FOR THE BLOOD &lt;THAT IS SHED UPON IT, EXCEPT BY THE BLOOD OF THE ONE WHO SHED IT&gt;</small>. Israel said: Shall whoever kills by accident be killed? When Moses stated his remedy for the matter, Israel uttered a song.
(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES &lt;ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN &gt; TOWARD THE RISING OF THE SUN</small>. All murderers flee eastward. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE POSTED &lt;THE CHERUBIM&gt;</small>. Cain fled to eastward, as stated (in Gen. 4:16): <small>AND CAIN WENT OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND DWELT IN THE LAND OF NOD, EAST OF EDEN</small>.
Thus it is written (in Deut. 4:41): <small>TOWARD THE RISING OF THE SUN</small>. Israel said: Sovereign of the World, what about one who takes<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows Buber, n. 10, in reading <i>horeg</i> for the unknown <i>hawwat.</i></i> a life unwillingly? The Holy One said: In the case of whoever takes a life by accident, behold, I have given him a place where he may flee. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 28:17): <small>SOMEONE OPPRESSED BY BLOODGUILT WILL BE A FUGITIVE TO THE GRAVE; LET NO ONE SUPPORT HIM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WILL BE A FUGITIVE TO THE GRAVE</small>? The Holy One said: In the case of whoever has sinned by accident, behold, I have given him a place in the region of Reuben, (as stated in Deut. 4:43:) <small>BEZER IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE LAND OF THE PLATEAU &lt;BELONGING TO THE REUBENITES&lt;…. &gt;</small>

Siman 5

(Deut. 5:1) <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. Why did &lt;Moses&gt; begin with the word <small>&lt;YOUR&gt;</small> in the singular and not say, "Your God" (with "your" in the plural)? Rabbi Simeon has said: In order to give a defence,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synegoria.</i></i> in which Moses argued a defence (before the Holy One) for the act of the &lt;golden&gt; calf. He said to him: Why are you angry? (Exod. 32:11:) <small>WHY</small>, [<small>O LORD</small>], <small>DOES YOUR WRATH BURN AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE</small>? Have you given them some commandment?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The making of the golden calf took place before the people had received any commandments at Sinai.</i>

(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &lt;THESE STATUTES&gt;…</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 49:6 [5]): <small>WHY SHOULD I FEAR IN THE EVIL DAYS, WHEN THE INIQUITY OF MY HEELS ENCOMPASS ME</small>? May the Name of the Holy One be blessed, because he has given a Torah to Israel in which there are six hundred and thirteen simple and weighty commandments;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 3:1.</i> but the children of Adam pay no attention to them. Instead they cast them under their heels while saying they are simple.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 23:23 // Luke 11:42.</i> For that reason David was afraid of the Day of Judgment and said: Sovereign of the Universe, I am not afraid of the weighty commandments which are in the Torah, because they are weighty. Of what am I afraid? Of the simple commandments, lest I have transgressed one of them, whether I have fulfilled it or not, because it is simple; for you have said: Be as mindful of the simple commandments as of the weighty commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 2:1.</i> It therefore says (in Ps. 49:6 [5]): <small>WHY SHOULD I FEAR IN THE EVIL DAYS</small>?

Siman 2

(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &lt;THESE STATUTES&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 19:11–12 [10–11]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD; &lt;SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB&gt;. ALSO BY THEM IS YOUR SERVANT WARNED; &lt;IN KEEPING THEM THERE IS GREAT REWARD&gt;</small>. Come and see how David glorified the word of Torah, where it is stated (ibid.): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small>. And not only that, but among all the kinds of grains, none is more precious than pure semolina, which coats the mouth;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Buber, n. 4, suggests emending to “which is sifted through a sieve.”</i> but the words of Torah are more precious than that, as stated (ibid., vs. 11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB</small>. R. Hanina said: If you say that among all the beverages none is sweeter than honey, the words of Torah are &lt;even&gt; sweeter than honey. David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you say that they (the commandments of Torah) are sweet, Heaven forbid that I should have ignored them. Rather (according to vs. 12 [11]), <small>ALSO BY THEM IS YOUR SERVANT WARNED; IN KEEPING THEM THERE IS GREAT REWARD</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD &lt;WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU&gt;….</small> This is your reward for the simple commandments.

Siman 3

(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &lt;THESE STATUTES&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 5:6): <small>SHE DOES NOT STEER A STRAIGHT PATH OF LIFE; HER WAYS WANDER, AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT</small>. [R. Abba bar Kahana said:] You should not practice give and take among the commandments of Torah to see which reward of Torah and commandment is greatest and perform that one.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 3:2; M. Ps. 9:3; see Deut. R. 6:2; also Mark 12:28 // Matthew 22:36.</i> Why? (Ibid.:) <small>HER WAYS WANDER, AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT</small>. The paths of the Torah are movable. R. Hiyya said: A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and introduced workers into it, but the king did not disclose to them the reward (i.e., the payment) for his seedlings, because if he revealed the reward for his &lt;various&gt; seedlings, one would see which seedling increased &lt;their&gt; reward, and plant that one. The work in the orchard would end up with some of it suspended and some of it carried out. Similarly the Holy One did not reveal the reward for each and every commandment in the Torah; for if he had revealed it, the commandments would have been found with some of them carried out and some of them suspended. R. Aha also &lt;said&gt; in the name of R. Abba bar Kahana: The Holy One has made the reward for fulfilling commandments irregular in this world, so that Israel would totally fulfill them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yPe’ah</i> 1:1 (15d); <i>yQid.</i> 1:7 (61b); <i>PR</i> 23/24:2.</i>
R. Simeon ben Johay taught: For two commandments the Holy One did reveal their reward. These are the simplest of the simple and the most weighty of the weighty ones. The simplest of the simple ones is (Deut. 22:7): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY LET THE MOTHER &lt;BIRD&gt; GO AND TAKE &lt;ONLY&gt; THE YOUNG FOR YOUR SELF, SO THAT IT WILL GO WELL WITH YOU, AND YOU WILL PROLONG YOUR DAYS</small>. The most weighty is (in Deut. 5:16 // Exod. 20:12): <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER …, SO THAT HE WILL LENGTHEN YOUR DAYS…..</small><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">So also M. Sam. 7; cf. Mark 7:10–11 // Matthew 15:4–5.</i> Note that they are equal this world with regard to reward. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: If in regard to paying a debt, about &lt;which&gt; length of days is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Enoch Zundel, in his commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef,</i> on the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 3:2, suggests the debt here is the debt to parents for bearing, rearing, and education.</i> how much the more so when it is a case of damage to purse and loss of life. R. Levi said: They said something more significant than that. A case of paying a debt is more important than a case of damage to purse and loss of life. R. Simeon ben Johay said: Just as their reward is great, so are their punishments great. That is what is written (in Prov. 30:17):<small>THE EYE THAT MOCKS A FATHER AND SCORNS OBEYING A MOTHER WILL HAVE THE WADI RAVENS PLUCK IT OUT AND THE YOUNG EAGLES DEVOUR IT</small>. Why will ravens pluck it out and eagles devour it? The Holy One said: A raven, which is cruel to its young, will come and pluck it out without profiting from it; an eagle, which is merciful to its young, will come and will profit from it. And where is it shown that a raven is cruel to its young? Where it is stated (in Job 38:41): <small>WHO PROVIDES PREY FOR THE RAVEN</small>, [<small>WHEN ITS YOUNG CRY UNTO GOD AND WANDER ABOUT WITHOUT FOOD</small>]. It also says (in Ps. 147:9): <small>TO YOUNG RAVENS WHEN THEY CRY OUT</small>. When the raven reproduces, it reproduces white &lt;young&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRE</i> 21.</i> Then the male says to the female that another bird has begotten it. So they reject and forsake them. What does the Holy One do? He brings forth gnats from their dung.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>See Lev. R. 19:1</i>.</i> Then &lt;the young&gt; fly, and eat, and from that become black.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly Yalqut Shim’oni, Deut. 846: “Then they fly over them, eat, and become black”; but cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 3:2, which omits any reference to the ravens becoming black.</i> This is what is written (in Job 38:41): <small>WHO PROVIDES PREY FOR THE RAVEN</small>. But where is it shown for the eagle, that it is merciful? Where it is written (in Deut. 32:11): <small>AS AN EAGLE STIRS UP ITS NEST &lt;AND HOVERS OVER ITS YOUNG&gt;</small>. However, no one trusts them because of other birds who pursue them. What does it do? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IT SPREADS ITS WINGS, TAKES THEM UP, &lt;AND BEARS THEM ALOFT ON ITS PINIONS&gt;</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 30:17): <small>THE WADI RAVENS PLUCK IT OUT, AND THE YOUNG EAGLES DEVOUR IT</small>.

Siman 4

(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &lt;THESE STATUTES&gt;</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 7:7)? <small>IT WAS NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE THE MOST NUMEROUS OF ALL THE PEOPLES, &lt;THAT THE LORD DESIRED YOU AND CHOSE YOU. RATHER YOU WERE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: It was not because you were the most numerous of all the nations, and it was not because you fulfilled more commandments than they, for they magnify my name more than you.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 3:3.</i> Thus it is stated (in Mal. 1:11–12): <small>FOR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN UNTIL ITS SETTING MY NAME IS GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS, &lt;AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE IS OFFERED TO MY NAME, EVEN A PURE OBLATION; FOR MY NAME IS GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS&gt;. BUT YOU DESECRATE IT WHEN YOU SAY THE TABLE OF THE LORD IS DEFILED, AND ITS SPECIAL FOOD IS TREATED WITH SCORN &lt;LIKE ORDINARY&gt; FOOD</small>. (Deut. 7:7–8): <small>RATHER YOU WERE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES. IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE LORD'S LOVE FOR YOU</small>. Because you diminish yourselves for me, I therefore love you, and so it says (in Mal. 1:2–3): <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU, SAYS THE LORD …; BUT I HAVE HATED ESAU….</small> It also says (in Hos. 14:5 [4]): <small>I WILL HEAL THEIR APOSTASY</small> [<small>AND LOVE THEM VOLUNTARILY</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>AND LOVE THEM VOLUNTARILY</small>? My soul has volunteered to love them, even though they were not worthy; and so it says (in Deut. 7:8): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES YOU….</small>

It is written (in Is. 2:2): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT IN THE LATTER DAYS THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED &lt;AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS&gt;….</small> This text is related (to Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING</small> (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>), <small>&lt;YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH&gt;</small>. &lt;This verse is here&gt; to teach you that everyone who is troubled (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>) from his beginning has rest at his end. You have no one who was more troubled (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>) than Abraham, who was cast into a fiery furnace and went into exile from his ancestral home. Moreover, sixteen kings oppressed him. He also stood the test of ten trials and buried Sarah. Yet in the end he had rest. (Gen. 24:1) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS, AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM &lt;IN ALL THINGS&gt;</small>. Isaac was troubled (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>) in his youth, for the Philistines were jealous of him, [as stated] (in Gen. 26:16): <small>AND ABIMELECH SAID UNTO ISAAC: GO AWAY FROM US, FOR YOU HAVE BECOME HAVE BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR US</small>. In the end they begged him for mercy, [as stated] (in vs. 27): <small>AND ISAAC SAID UNTO THEM: WHY HAVE YOU COME UNTO ME…</small>. Jacob also was troubled (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>) in his youth, as stated (in Ps. 129:1): <small>THEY HAVE HARASSED ME GREATLY FROM MY YOUTH, LET ISRAEL NOW SAY</small>. While he was in his mothers belly, Esau wanted to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED WITHIN HER…</small>. [Moreover, when he received the blessings, (according to Gen. 27:41:) <small>THEN ESAU HATED JACOB …, AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: &lt;LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&gt;</small>. So he fled to Laban and was troubled (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>) over his daughter, and after that Laban wanted to kill him, as stated (in Deut. 26:5): <small>AN ARAMEAN WOULD HAVE DESTROYED MY ANCESTOR</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is required sense by the midrash. A more usual translation would read: <small>A WANDERING ARAMEAN WAS MY ANCESTOR</small>.</i> He went away from him and encountered Esau, as stated (in Gen. 33:1): <small>NOW JACOB RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ESAU COMING…</small>. There came upon him the trouble over Dinah and the trouble over Joseph. Yet in the end he had rest, [as stated] (in Gen. 47:12): <small>AND JOSEPH SUSTAINED HIS FATHER &lt;AND HIS BROTHERS&gt;…</small>. Ergo (in Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING</small> (rt.: <i><small>T</small>s</i>'<i><small>R</small></i>), <small>&lt;YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH&gt;</small>.

Another interpretation (of Is. 2:2): <small>&lt;THAT IN THE LATTER DAYS&gt; THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED &lt; AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS&gt;….</small> And Mount Tabor shall become very tall.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 214, which interprets the bracketed literally, that the temple will be established <small>AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS</small>. Since <small>MOUNTAINS</small> is plural, this midrash argues that Mounts Tabor, Sinai, and Carmel will be heaped together to form the temple mount. So also M. Pss. 36:6; 87:3.</i> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the palace<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Palterin. Gk.: <i>praitorion</i>; Lat. <i>praetorium.</i></i> children of a king. They went down from the city and killed lions, tigers, and bears in the forest. Then they brought them and hung them opposite the city gate, so that all the people in the city were amazed. Who killed those lions? The Holy One, blessed be he,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Here the divine acronym is translated in full, because it is written out in full in the Buber text.</i> did so. Sisera came against Israel on Mount Tabor. (According to Jud. 5:20): <small>THE STARS FOUGHT FROM THE HEAVENS; &lt;FROM THEIR COURSES THEY FOUGHT WITH SISERA&gt;</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pes.</i> 118b, according to which the stars descended and heated the iron implements in Sisera’s army.</i> All began to be amazed, for there had never been an event like this, when the stars came down from the heavens to make war with flesh and blood. The Holy One said: In this world the stars have fought on your behalf, but in the world to come, (according to Zech. 14:3–4) <small>THEN THE LORD WILL COME FORTH AND FIGHT WITH THOSE NATIONS &lt;AS WHEN HE FIGHTS IN THE DAY OF BATTLE&gt;. AND HIS FEET SHALL STAND &lt;IN THAT DAY UPON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES&gt;…</small>. And &lt;so on through&gt; all that section (of Zechariah). Then everyone will point him out with the finger, as stated (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US. THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.

(Deut. 11:26:) <small>SEE, I &lt;AM SETTING BEFORE YOU TODAY A BLESSING AND A CURSE&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 21:8): <small>AND</small> {<small>TO</small>} [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THIS PEOPLE YOU SHALL SAY: THUS SAYS THE LORD: SEE, I AM SETTING BEFORE YOU THE ROAD TO LIFE AND THE ROAD TO DEATH</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 78:1): <small>A MASKIL</small> {<small>OF ETHAN THE EZRAHITE</small>}<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For this reading, see Ps. 89:1.</i> [<small>OF ASAPH</small>]. <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 4:1.</i> And it is written (in Deut. 4:9–10): <small>ONLY TAKE HEED TO YOURSELF &lt;AND WATCH YOURSELF CLOSELY, LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN AND LEST THEY DEPART FROM YOUR HEART ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE; MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</small> &gt;: <small>THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB….</small> &lt;This is&gt; to tell you that &lt;when&gt; anyone despises the words of Torah, it is as though he were denying the Holy One, because he only bestowed Torah so that Israel would be occupied with it day and night, as stated (in Josh. 1:8): <small>AND YOU SHALL MEDITATE ON IT</small> (i.e., on Torah) <small>DAY AND NIGHT</small>. And it is written (in Ps. 1:2): <small>BUT THEIR DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW</small> (<i>Torah</i>) <small>OF THE LORD, &lt;AND ON HIS LAW</small> (<i>Torah</i>) <small>THEY MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT&gt;</small>. So when anyone occupies himself with the Torah and fulfills it, &lt;it is&gt; as though he had received it from Sinai. It is therefore written (in Deut. 4:9–10): <small>MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN …: THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD….</small> When Asaph came, he began to say (in Ps. 78:1) <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH…</small>. So also did Solomon say (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION; DO NOT ABANDON MY TORAH</small>. Israel said to Asaph: Is there another torah of which you say (in Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>? We have already received it from Sinai. He said to them: The schismatics of Israel say that the Prophets and the Writings are not Torah, and we do not believe in them, as stated (in Dan. 9:10): <small>AND WE HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD BY WALKING IN HIS TORAH, WHICH HE SET BEFORE US AT THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>. Ergo, The Prophets and the Writings are Torah, as stated (in Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small> (in this case to a writing of Asaph).

Siman 2

Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 16:23): [<small>THE HEART OF</small>] <small>A WISE PERSON, INSTRUCTS HIS MOUTH…</small>. When Israel sinned, they were withheld from anything good; and so you find that, when they committed the act (of the golden calf), everything good was withheld from them, as stated (in Exod. 32:19): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT AS SOON AS THEY DREW NEAR UNTO THE CAMP AND SAW THE CALF &lt;AND THE DANCING, MOSES BURNED WITH ANGER; SO HE THREW DOWN THE TABLETS FROM HIS HANDS AND SHATTERED THEM AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN&gt;</small>. Then when Moses sought mercy for them, the Holy One said to him: Moses, I created the world only for Torah, as stated (in Is. 51:16): <small>MOREOVER, I HAVE PUT MY WORDS</small> (i.e., the Torah) <small>IN YOUR MOUTH …, &lt;SO THAT I MAY PLANT THE HEAVENS AND LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH&gt;</small>. Now they have exchanged my glory for the image of a bull.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 106:20.</i> But since you have broken the tablets, how does the world continue without Torah? He said to him: What shall I do? He said to him (in Deut. 10:11): <small>CARVE OUT TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST ONES</small>. It is therefore written (in Prov. 16:23) [<small>THE HEART OF</small>] <small>A WISE PERSON, INSTRUCTS HIS MOUTH…</small>. For that reason, when Asaph was alive, he mentioned above (in Ps. 77:21 [20]): <small>YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK BY THE HAND OF MOSES AND AARON</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is Ps. 77:1 that designates this Psalm as a work of Asaph.</i> Then after that (in Ps. 78:1): <small>A MASKIL OF ASAPH</small>.

(Deut. 12:29:) <small>WHEN THE LORD GOD HAS CUT OFF THE GENTILES</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who planted a vineyard within his field, but within &lt;that field&gt; were great cedars and thorns.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 4:9.</i> The king went and cut down the cedars and left the thorns. His servants said to him: Our Lord King, the thorns, which catch our clothes, you have left &lt;standing&gt;; but you have cut down the cedars! He said to them: If I had left the cedars and cut down the thornbushes, how should I have {decreed} [fenced in] my vineyard. So also Israel is the vineyard of the Holy One, as stated (in Is. 5:7): <small>FOR THE VINEYARD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. He brought Israel into the land and cut down the cedars that were in it, as stated (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES</small> [<small>BEFORE YOU, WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT</small>]; but he left their children and their children's children so that Israel would observe the Torah, as stated (in Jud. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NATIONS WHICH THE LORD LEFT TO TEST ISRAEL</small>. So when the vineyard stands in its place in the service of the Torah, <small>THEN</small> (according to Is. 33:12) <small>THE PEOPLES SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN &lt;THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE&gt;</small>. It is also written (in Is. 40:17): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM</small>. Look at how many hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: ochloi.</i> Pharaoh sent out after Israel! When Israel saw them, they were terrified before them and said: Who can stand against these? The Holy One said to them: By your lives, all these are as unimportant before me as &lt;if they were&gt; [only] a single horse, as stated (in Exod. 15:19): <small>WHEN THE HORSE</small> (in the singular) <small>OF PHARAOH CAME</small>; they all died in a single breath (rt.: <i><small>NS</small>h<small>P</small></i>), as stated (in Exod. 15:10): <small>YOU BLEW</small> (rt.: <i><small>NS</small>h<small>P</small></i>) <small>WITH YOUR WIND, &lt;AND THE SEA COVERED THEM&gt;</small>. Similarly Gog and Magog are going to come against Israel, but the Holy One will carry out judgments against them (literally: against him), as stated (in Ezek. 38:22): <small>I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM WITH PESTILENCE AND WITH BLOOD….</small> At that time (according to Ezek. 38:23): <small>SO I WILL BE MAGNIFIED, BE SANCTIFIED, AND BE MADE KNOWN BEFORE THE EYES OF MANY</small> {<small>PEOPLES</small>} [<small>NATIONS</small>]; <small>AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD</small>.

(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON</small> (i.e., a miser) <small>MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH; AND HE DOES NOT KNOW &lt;THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM&gt;</small>. R. Hanina interpreted the Scripture verse with reference to Ephron (of Gen. 23),<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh</i>.

Rabbi Ammi interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to one who borrows a cow. Since he was too miserly to rent two cows, he borrowed one and rented one. <small>AND</small> (according to Prov. 28:22) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>, that it is written (in Exod. 22:13 [14]): <small>&lt;WHEN SOMEONE BORROWS AN ANIMAL FROM HIS NEIGHBOR AND IT IS INJURED OR DIES</small>, {<small>IF</small>} <small>ITS OWNER IS NOT WITH IT, HE SHALL SURELY PAY</small>.

Rabbi Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest. (Prov. 8:22) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>, that it is written (in Prov. 28:8): <small>THE ONE WHO AUGMENTS HIS WEALTH BY INTEREST AND USURY AMASSES IT FOR ONE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>. Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the Wicked. Is Esau the Wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>epitropoi.</i></i> who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say: Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good work for them.

Siman 7

Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end Rabbi Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly. Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes. From the remainder he and the children of his household sustained<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PRNS</i>. Gk. <i>pronoein</i> (“<i>provide for</i>”).</i> themselves. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him: My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such &lt;a number of&gt; measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself all my days. When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it a for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten &lt;measures from the tithe&gt;, but &lt;the field&gt; subtracted one hundred &lt;measures from its yield&gt;. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth &lt;years&gt;, until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw &lt;what was happening&gt;, they put on white (i.e., festive) &lt;tunics&gt; and wrapped themselves in white &lt;mantles&gt;. &lt;When&gt; they came to him, he said to them: Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who is afflicted? They said: Heaven forbid! We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One was the priest; but now the Holy One has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest. For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.

Siman 8

(Ps. 37:3:) <small>TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD; SETTLE THE LAND AND MAINTAIN FIDELITY</small>. R. Haggai said in the name of R. Isaac: Interpret this verse by transposition.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 4:11; <i>PRK</i> 10:2.</i> <small>DO GOOD; TRUST IN THE LORD</small>. It is comparable to a market commissioner who went out to inspect the measures. When a certain person saw him, he began hiding from him. He said to him: Why are you hiding from me? Look to your measures, and do not be afraid. This is what is written: <small>TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD</small>. [<small>SETTLE THE LAND AND MAINTAIN FIDELITY</small>. Bring about the settlement of the land. Sow, plant, and maintain ancestral fidelity.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Here again is interpretation by transposition.

R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Israel atoned for itself before the Omnipresent by merit from &lt;observing&gt; two commandments, &lt;i.e.,&gt; by merit from the Sabbath and by merit from tithes: By merit from the Sabbath, since it is written (in Is. 58:13): <small>IF YOU REFRAIN FROM TRAMPLING THE SABBATH…</small>. What is written after it (in vs. 14)? <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN THE LORD…</small>. By merit from tithes, since it is written (in Deut. 26:11): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN EVERYTHING GOOD</small>;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The context here concerns first fruits, and the following verse (12) mentions the tithe of the third year.</i> and there is nothing as good as Torah, since it is written (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION; &lt;DO NOT ABANDON MY TORAH&gt;</small>.

(Prov. 3:9:) <small>HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR SUBSTANCE AND WITH THE FIRST FRUITS OF ALL YOUR PRODUCE</small>.

There is a story about a person who amassed wine and oil but did not take out his tithes properly. What did the Holy One do to him? He put a squally windy {i.e., an evil spirit} in him, so that he took a staff and began to smash the &lt;wine and oil&gt; jars. His steward rebuked him. What did he do to him?

R. Levi said: There is a story about a person who took out his tithes properly. Now he had a certain field, and the Holy One gave him a mind to prepare half of it for sowing and half as storage place for water. So when a year of drought came, he sold a <i>sea'h</i> of wheat for a <i>sela</i>' and a <i>se'ahs</i> of water for three <i>sela's.</i> What made this happen to him? &lt;It was&gt; because he had taken out his tithes properly.

(Prov. 6:20:) <small>MY CHILD, KEEP YOUR FATHER</small>'s {<small>TORAH</small>} [<small>COMMANDMENTS</small>], <small>&lt;AND DO NOT FORSAKE THE TORAH OF YOUR MOTHER&gt;</small>. Our earliest ancestors separated out <i>terumot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priestly tithes on produce, sometimes called “heave offerings.”</i> and tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 4:14, cont.; <i>PRK</i> 10:6; see <i>PR</i> 25:3, cont.</i> Abraham separated out a great <i>terumah,</i> as stated (in Gen. 14:22): <small>&lt;THEN ABRAM SAID UNTO THE KING OF SODOM:&gt; I HAVE LIFTED UP MY HAND UNTO THE LORD, GOD MOST HIGH</small>. A lifting up is nothing but a <i>terumah</i> (rt.: <i><small>RWM</small></i>), since it is stated (in Numb. 18:26): <small>&lt;NOW YOU SHALL SPEAK UNTO THE LEVITES AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU RECEIVE TITHES FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THE TITHE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU AS YOUR PORTION,&gt; YOU SHALL LIFT</small> (rt.: <i><small>RWM</small></i>) <small>OUT OF IT A TERUMAH OF THE LORD, &lt;A TITHE FROM THE TITHE&gt;</small>. Isaac separated out a second tithe, as stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND AND REAPED IN THAT YEAR A HUNDREDFOLD, &lt;FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM&gt;</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: Is it not true that a blessing does not rest on what is measured, on what is weighed, or on what is counted? So why did he measure them? In order to tithe them. This is what is written (ibid.): <small>FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 14:24, which mentions a blessing in the context of the second tithe; therefore, the blessing of Gen. 26:12 must have been the result of Isaac’s second tithe.</i> Jacob separated out a first tithe, as stated (in Gen. 28:22): <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>.
A certain Cuthean (i.e., a Samaritan) came and questioned R. Meir. He said to him: Do you not say that indeed your ancestor Jacob is truthful, since it is written (in Micah 7:20): <small>YOU GIVE TRUTHFULNESS TO JACOB</small> …? &lt;The Cuthean&gt; said to him: He separated out the tribe of Levi &lt;as a tithe&gt; for the tribes, &lt;i.e.,&gt; one out of ten. Should he not have separated out &lt;a tithe&gt; from two more &lt;tribes&gt;? He said to him: You have said that there were twelve, but I say that there were fourteen, as stated (in Gen. 48:5): <small>EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH SHALL BE MINE LIKE REUBEN AND SIMEON</small>. He said to him: So here there is support for it. You have added standing grain. Have you added water? He said to him: Do you not admit that there are four matriarchs? [Take away from them the four firstborn (of Jacob's four wives),] since the firstborn is not tithed. Why? Because he is holy, and something holy does not redeem for use something &lt;else that is&gt; holy. He said to him: It is good for your people that you are among them. (Prov. 6:20:) <small>AND DO NOT FORSAKE THE TORAH OF YOUR MOTHER</small> (<i>immekha</i>), &lt;i.e.,&gt; your people (<i>ummatekha</i>). That is what David said (in Ps. 40:9 [8]): <small>TO CARRY OUT YOUR WILL, MY GOD, IS MY DESIRE, &lt;FOR YOUR TORAH IS WITHIN MY BELLY&gt;</small>. R. Aha [bar Ulla] said: Is there Torah within the belly? And is it not so written (in Jer. 31:33): <small>AND UPON THEIR HEART</small> (not their belly) <small>I WILL WRITE IT</small>? It is simply that David said: May a curse come upon me, if something goes down into my belly, except when it is tithed. This is what is written (in I Chron. 27:25): <small>AND OVER THE TREASURIES OF THE KING WAS AZMAVETH BEN</small> {<small>AZRIEL</small>} [<small>ADIEL</small>]. <small>AND OVER THE TREASURIES IN THE COUNTRY</small>, {<small>IN THE VINEYARDS, IN THE MOUNTAINS</small>,} [<small>IN THE CITIES, IN THE VILLAGES</small>,] <small>AND IN THE TOWERS WAS</small> {<small>JOHANAN</small>} [<small>JONATHAN</small>] <small>BEN UZZIAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, David was concerned enough about tithes to appoint overseers.</i> For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.

Hiyya the Great said: It is comparable to one who had a mantle (<i>tallit</i>) for sale in the bazaar.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Itlis</i>.

He said to him: Wrap yourself in it. If it fits you, then it is yours; but if it does not, it is not yours. Similarly the Holy One said to Job: (Jer. 23:24:) <small>DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>? Yet you say (in Job 31:38): <small>IF <i>MY</i> LAND CRIES OUT AGAINST ME</small>. Is this the work of your hand? Then R. Simeon ben Halafta said: It is comparable to one who had a bondmaid for sale in the bazaar. When someone passed by and saw her, he said: She is mine. He said to him: Rebuke her. If she heeds you, she is yours; but if not she is not yours. Similarly the Holy One said to Job: It is written of me (in Ps. 104:32): <small>WHO</small> (i.e., the <small>LORD</small>) <small>LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES</small>. Yet you say (in Job 31:38): <small>IF MY LAND CRIES OUT AGAINST ME</small>. Is this the work of your hand? At that time Job said: Sovereign of the Universe: I did not mean that.

This refers to the second tithe, as stated (in Deut. 14:25): <small>THEN YOU SHALL CONVERT IT INTO MONEY…</small>. (Job 31:39, cont.:) <small>AND DISAPPOINTED ITS OWNERS</small>. This refers to the tithe for the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash identifies the <small>OWNERS</small> of Job 31:39 with the poor who actually work the land.</i> If I have not done &lt;all&gt; this, (then in vs. 40): <small>MAY THORNS COME UP INSTEAD OF WHEAT…</small>. Rabbi Hosha'ya taught: Torah teaches you proper procedure. A field that grows thorns (when unplanted) is fine to sow wheat in. A field that grows stinkweed is fine to sow barley in. What is the evidence? That which is written (in Job 31:40:) <small>MAY THORNS COME UP INSTEAD OF WHEAT, AND STINKWEED INSTEAD OF BARLEY</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WORDS OF JOB ARE ENDED</small>. [Beyond this point] Job foresees and prophesies any number of prophecies.

It is simply that Job meant: If I have not fulfilled these &lt;conditions&gt; (of vss. 38–39), may my words be ended, and let me not have a pretext for saying to you (in Deut. 26:13 regarding the second tithe): <small>I HAVE REMOVED THE CONSECRATED PORTION FROM THE HOUSE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MSh</i> 5:10.</i> For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.

What is the meaning of <small>AND SO IT WAS</small> (<i>wayehi</i>)? R.

[(Dan. 9:7:) <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. R. Eleazar said: Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah spoke this verse while in the fiery furnace.

Then all the peoples of the world said to them: You know that there is power in your God to perform all these miracles for you; yet you have caused him to destroy his house and exile his children. So all the peoples of the world spat before them (literally: into their faces), until they had produced a mass of spittle. Then Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah raised their faces toward heaven and said (in Dan. 9:7): <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT THERE IS A SHAMEFUL FACE WITH US</small>. R.

Thus is it taught in the name of R. Hanina: By universal custom, if someone has a certain field, he may let it out for a third or a quarter &lt;of its yield&gt;; but it is not like that with the Holy One. He causes the wind to blow, clouds to rise, rains to descend, dews to flourish, plants to grow, and fruits to become plump; yet he only says to separate out one tenth.

See <i>PRK</i> 23:10.</i> From Noah to Abraham there are ten generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., 1. Noah, 2. Arpachshad, 3. Shelah, 4. Eber, 5. Peleg, 6. Reu, 7. Serug, 8. Nahor, 9. Terah, 10. Abraham.</i> and I took the tenth, which was Abraham. So it is therefore written (in Job 8:10): <small>WILL THEY NOT INSTRUCT YOU AND TELL YOU</small> to take out one tenth? (Deut. 15:20:) <small>YEAR BY YEAR</small>. If you have taken out a tithe during a given year, you gain merit for another year. R. Abba bar Kahana said: The importance of tithes is &lt;mentioned&gt; throughout all the Torah (in the Law, in the Prophets, and in the Writings). It is written (in Deut. 6:16): <small>DO NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST &lt;AS YOU PUT HIM TO THE TEST THROUGH A TAX</small> (<i><small>MSH</small></i>)&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So the midrash understands this verse. Since Deut. 6:16 refers to an incident at Massah (<i>MSH</i>) in Exod. 17:1–7, biblical translations render the bracketed clause to mean, <small>AS YOU PUT HIM TO THE TEST AT MASSAH</small>. Exod. 17:1–7 also explains in vs. 7 that <small>MASSAH</small> means “test.” The midrash, however, either revowels MSH as <small>MISSAH</small>, a word which means “tribute,” “contribution,” or “quota,” in this case the tithe, or perhaps understands the name as a form of <i>mas,</i> which had come to mean “tax.”</i> Also in reference to tithes it is written (in Mal. 3:10): [<small>BRING ALL THE TITHE &lt;INTO THE STOREHOUSE, THAT THERE MAY BE FOOD IN MY HOUSE&gt;</small>]. <small>SO PLEASE TEST ME IN THIS, &lt;SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS&gt;</small>. And who tested the tithes? The generation of Hezekiah, as stated (in II Chron. 31:9–10): <small>THEN HEZEKIAH</small> {<small>THE KING</small>} <small>QUESTIONED &lt;THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES&gt; ABOUT THE HEAPS</small> (of produce). <small>SO THE CHIEF PRIEST AZARIAH OF THE HOUSE OF ZADOK SPOKE</small> [<small>UNTO HIM</small>] <small>&lt;AND SAID: EVER SINCE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BRING THE</small> <i><small>TERUMAH</small></i> (i.e., the priestly tithe on produce) <small>TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD,&gt; WE HAVE EATEN</small> {<small>AND HAVE DRUNK</small>} [<small>AND HAVE BEEN SATISFIED</small>], <small>WHILE LEAVING OVER &lt;FOOD IN GREAT AMOUNTS&gt;</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE THE LORD HAS BLESSED HIS PEOPLE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world I have blessed one generation, but hereafter in the world to come, I am blessing &lt;all the generations of&gt; Israel, as stated (in Jer. 31:22 [23]): <small>AGAIN THEY SHALL SAY THIS THING</small> {<small>ON THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD, IN JERUSALEM, AND IN ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH</small>} [<small>IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND ITS CITIES, WHEN I RESTORE THEM AS BEFORE</small>]: <small>MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU, O HABITATION OF</small> {<small>RIGHTEOUS HOLINESS</small>} [<small>RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>], <small>O HOLY MOUNTAIN</small>.

(Deut. 16:18:) <small>&lt;YOU SHALL APPOINT&gt; JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS &lt;FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In biblical times court was generally held at the town gate, perhaps in one of the rooms like those built into either side of Solomonic gates at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</i> <small>WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU FOR YOUR TRIBES, SO THAT THEY MAY JUDGE THE PEOPLE WITH RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT&gt;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL. HIS WORDS</small> are the words of Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:1.</i> <small>HIS STATUTES</small> are the expositions (<i>midrsahot</i>), <small>AND HIS ORDINANCES</small> are the judgments [<small>TO ISRAEL</small>]. The Holy One gave the Torah and the judgments to no one but <small>TO ISRAEL</small> alone. And where is it shown? You learn that when Israel and a star-worshiping gentile have a dispute with each other, it is forbidden for Israel to say to the gentile (<i>goy</i>): Go with me to your courts,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arka’ot;</i> cf. Gk.: <i>archai</i> (“<i>authorities</i>”) <i>or [archeia</i> (“town offices”).</i> because he would be transgressing a prohibition, since it is stated (in Ps. 147:20): <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION</small> (<i>goy</i>); <small>AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM</small>. But were not the peoples of the world commanded concerning litigations, since that is one of the seven commandments of the children of Noah?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I Corinthians 6:1–6.</i> So what is the significance of (Ibid.): <small>AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM</small>? These are the fine points of the law (<i>din</i>). So this is what we teach (in <i>Sanh.</i> 5:2): <small>ONCE UPON A TIME BEN ZAKKAY CROSS-EXAMINED &lt;WITNESSES&gt; ON FIG STEMS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The gemara (Sanh. 41a) explains that a capital offense was involved.</i> Now the children of Noah are put to death on the evidence of a single witness, with a single judge, and without a warning. &lt;That is&gt; something which does not exist in Israel, since there are three judges in property cases, and there are twenty-three judges in capital cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 4:1.</i> Moreover, it is written (in Deut. 19:15): <small>A SINGLE WITNESS SHALL NOT BE VALID AGAINST A PERSON…. &lt;ONLY&gt; ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO &lt;OR THREE&gt; WITNESSES &lt;SHALL A CASE BE VALID&gt;</small>. So there must be an investigation and an inquiry. How do they examine the witnesses? They bring them in and solemnly forewarn them. Then they would examine them again with seven inquiries:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh.</i> 5:1.</i> 1. In what week,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., week of years, Sabbatical year of the Jubilee cycle.</i> 2. In what year? 3. in what month? 4.

Have you forewarned him?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This last query is one of various supplemental questions listed in <i>Sanh</i>. 5:1 and <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:1.</i> And so you find among the leaders<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Parnas.</i> Cf. Gk.: <i>pronoi</i> (“prudent ones”, “those who take forethought”).</i> of Israel that they were praised only for their judging.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in various summary statements about Israel’s leaders, e.g., Judges 4:4; 10:2, 3; 12:7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14; 15:20; 16:31; I Sam. 4:18; 7:6, 15–17; 8:1, 5–6, 20; I Kings 3:9, it is the fact that they judged Israel that is specifically mentioned. This fact may not always be obvious in modern translations, because they do not always render <i>ShPT</i> as “judge” but by other English verbs, such as “govern” or “rule.”</i> It is written concerning Samuel (in I Sam. 7:6): <small>AND HE WENT ON A CIRCUIT YEAR BY YEAR &lt;TO BETHEL, &lt;GILGAL, AND MIZPAH;&gt; AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL &lt;IN ALL THOSE PLACES&gt;</small>. And David also was praised only for his judging, as stated (in I Chron. 18:14 // II Sam. 8:15): <small>AND</small> {<small>DAVID</small>}<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The only difference between the versions of Chronicles and Samuel is that the name <small>DAVID</small>, which Buber chooses to bracket, appears only in the Samuel version.</i> <small>ADMINISTERED JUDGMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TO ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>.

Siman 2

And in the case of Jehoshaphat also, when he was installed in the kingship, he did not occupy himself with the business of kingship nor with honor but with the business of judging.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Note that Jehoshaphat’s name means, “The <small>LORD</small> has Judged.”</i> It is so stated (in II Chron. 17:1): [<small>THEN &lt;HIS SON&gt; JEHOSHAPHAT REIGNED</small>] <small>&lt;IN HIS STEAD,&gt; AND HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF OVER ISRAEL</small>. What is the meaning of [<small>AND HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF</small> (rt.: <i><small>HZQ</small></i>)]? That <small>HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF</small>, when he appointed judges. It also says (in II Chron. 17:6): <small>HIS HEART WAS EXALTED IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD, AND IN ADDITION HE REMOVED THE HIGH PLACES AND ASHERIM FROM JUDAH</small>. Was there a haughty spirit within him, in that it says: <small>HIS HEART WAS EXALTED</small>? It is simply that he had appointed judges over them who knew how to walk <small>IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD</small><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the divine name (<small>LORD</small>) is used here, indicates a biblical citation. The expression is found in various places, but the midrash probably adopts the wording from the verse just cited (II Chron. 17:6), which begins: <small>HIS</small> (i.e., Jehoshaphat’s) <small>HEART WAS EXALTED IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD</small>.</i> <small>AND TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The mention of keeping the <small>WAY OF THE LORD</small>, is found in various places, but this exact Hebrew citation only occurs in Gen. 18:19 with reference to Abraham’s posterity, a citation given more fully in the parallel from <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:1.</i> (II Chron. 19:6–7:) <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO THE JUDGES: CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING, SINCE YOU JUDGE NOT FOR HUMANS BUT FOR THE LORD. SO NOW LET THE FEAR OF THE LORD BE UPON YOU. TAKE CARE WHEN YOU ACT, FOR WITH THE LORD OUR GOD THERE IS NO INJUSTICE, PARTIALITY, OR TAKING A BRIBE</small>. Now if Moses our Master, who was not commanded concerning Judges,—rather Jethro told him (in Exod. 18:21): <small>YOU SHALL SEEK OUT &lt;ABLE MEN&gt; FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE…</small>, —&lt;if he&gt; convened a sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synedrion.</i></i> for Israel, how much more &lt;important is a sanhedrin&gt; in our case, when it has been commanded here in the Torah (in Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Where is it shown that Moses convened a sanhedrin? Where it is stated (in Exod. 18:25): <small>SO MOSES CHOSE ABLE MEN FROM ALL ISRAEL &lt;AND APPOINTED THEM AS HEADS OVER THE PEOPLE&gt;…</small>. And Jerusalem also was praised only because of the justice system, as stated (in Ezek. 16:14): <small>AND YOUR NAME SHALL BE SPREAD AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOUR BEAUTY</small>. And what adornment (rt.: <i><small>HDR</small></i>) is that? This is the justice system, since it is stated (in Exod. 23:3): <small>NOR SHALL YOU FAVOR</small> (rt.: <i><small>HDR</small></i>) <small>SOMEONE POOR IN HIS LAWSUIT</small>. And Jerusalem was destroyed only over perversion of justice, since it is stated (in Ezek. 22:5): <small>YOU WITH A BESMIRCHED NAME; YOU WHO ARE FULL OF COMMOTION</small>. A name for justice that you had at first is besmirched. It is also written (in Is. 1:21): <small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>WAS FULL OF JUSTICE</small>; but Jeremiah said this to them (in Lam. 4:12–13): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH DID NOT BELIEVE</small>, [ … ] <small>&lt;THAT FOE OR ENEMY WOULD COME THROUGH THE GATES OF JERUSALEM&gt;. IT WAS FOR THE SINS OF HER PROPHETS AND THE INIQUITIES OF HER PRIESTS &lt;WHO SHED THE BLOOD OF THE RIGHTEOUS IN HER MIDST&gt;</small>. At that time the Holy One swore that he himself would exact retribution from them and from their judges, as stated (in Is. 1:24): <small>THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD, THE LORD OF HOSTS, THE MOST MIGHTY OF ISRAEL: &lt;AH, I WILL EXACT VENGEANCE FROM MY FOES&gt;…</small>. Now <small>THEREFORE</small> can only be a term &lt;related to&gt; an oath, since it is stated (in I Sam. 3:14): <small>AND I THEREFORE SWEAR TO THE HOUSE OF ELI</small>. Moreover, <small>MIGHTY</small> can only be a term for the <i>Av bet Din,</i> since it is stated (in I Sam. 21:8 [7]): <small>THE MOST MIGHTY OF THE SHEPHERDS THAT BELONG TO SAUL</small>. &lt;This is&gt; to teach you that the Holy One became an <i>Av bet Din</i> in order to exact vengeance from them. And where is it shown? Where the text speaks about judges. See what is written after it (in Is. 1:26): <small>AND I WILL RESTORE YOUR JUDGES AS IN THE BEGINNING</small>. Therefore David has said (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, &lt;HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL&gt;</small>.

Siman 3

(Deut. 16:18:) <small>&lt;YOU SHALL APPOINT&gt; JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS &lt;FOR YOURSELVES&gt;: JUDGES</small> operate in courts, and <small>LAW OFFICERS</small> operate in the community.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:2; cf. <i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 16:18 (144).</i> R. Eleazar said: If there is no law officer, there is no judge. How so? When someone is found by a court to have a legal obligation to his companion, if there is no law officer who will collect from him when he withdraws from the judges, there is no power in the hands of the judge to do anything to him. If, however, &lt;a law officer is present&gt;, he delivers him into the hand of the law officer, and the law officer extracts compliance from him. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: If it had not been for the law-enforcing office<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Siteno,</i> which is being read as <i>sitero</i>, as suggested by Jastrow, s.v.</i> of Joab, David could not have enforced justice. And so it says (in I Chron. 18:14–15 // II Sam. 8:15–16): <small>SO</small> {<small>DAVID</small>}<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The only difference between the versions of Chronicles and Samuel is that the name <small>DAVID</small>, which Buber chooses to bracket, appears only in the Samuel version.</i> <small>ADMINISTERED JUDGMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TO ALL HIS PEOPLE, WHILE JOAB BEN ZERUIAH WAS OVER THE ARMY</small>. Were David and Joab judges? It is simply that whenever someone did not heed the judge, they delivered him into the hands of Joab, and he extracted compliance from him against his will. And so Joab said (in Job 29:16–17): <small>I WAS A FATHER TO THE POOR…. I BROKE THE JAWS OF THE EVILDOER</small>.

Siman 4

(Deut. 16:18:) <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT &lt;JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&gt; FOR YOURSELVES</small>, and not for the peoples of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:5.</i> Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT &lt;JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&gt; FOR YOURSELVES</small>. &lt;This&gt; teaches that the judges were called in the name of Moses. Moreover, this is one of three things over which Moses risked his life and were called by his name.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Shirata,</i> 1 on Exod. 15:1; Exod. R. 30:4; Numb.

He offered his life over Israel, as stated (in Exod. 32:32): <small>BUT NOW, IF YOU WILL FORGIVE THEIR SIN, &lt;WELL AND GOOD;&gt; BUT IF NOT, PLEASE BLOT ME OUT &lt;OF THE BOOK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN</small> &gt;. And where is it shown that they were called by his Name? Where it is stated (in Exod. 32:7, in which the Holy One tells Moses): <small>FOR YOUR PEOPLE &lt;WHOM YOU BROUGHT UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&gt; HAVE ACTED BASELY</small>. He also offered his life over the judges, as stated (in Exod. 2:12–14): <small>HE SMOTE THE EGYPTIAN &lt;AND HID HIM IN THE SAND. WHEN HE WENT OUT ON THE SECOND DAY, HERE THERE WERE TWO HEBREW MEN FIGHTING&gt;; SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE: WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE YOUR COMRADE</small>? <small>&lt;BUT HE SAID: WHO APPOINTED YOU</small><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In an unvoweled text <small>APPOINTED YOU</small> could be read as “your name.”</i> <small>A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US</small>?&gt; For that reason they were called in his name, as stated (in Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small>.

Siman 5

[(Deut. 16:18:) <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&gt; FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small> …,] in every single city, <small>FOR YOUR TRIBES</small>. Even when the whole city consists of a single family, appoint judges for yourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh,</i> Deut. 5:6: “Appoint judges for it.”</i> (Deut. 16:18, cont.:) <small>SO THAT THEY MAY JUDGE THE PEOPLE WITH RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT</small>. &lt;This is&gt; to teach you that one effects righteousness with both of them, with the innocent one who gets what belongs to him and with the guilty one from under whose hand they take away the stolen goods.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:18): <small>RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT</small>. During the time that they judge righteously, they effect righteousness with the people, as stated (in Ps. 85:12 [11]): <small>FAITHFULNESS SHALL SPRING UP FROM THE LAND WHILE RIGHTEOUSNESS LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN</small>. During the time that a faithful judgment springs up from the land, the Holy One effects righteousness with the people. He also saves them from divine punishment and afflictions, while good will comes into the world.

Siman 6

(Deut. 16:19:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE; YOU SHALL NOT SHOW PARTIALITY; &lt;YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A BRIBE, BECAUSE A BRIBE BLINDS THE EYES OF THE WISE&gt;</small>. &lt;Here is&gt; a warning for the prince not to place one suited to be low too high and one suited to be high too low.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:7.</i>
Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE &lt;JUSTICE&gt;</small> because of wealth; <small>YOU SHALL NOT SHOW PARTIALITY</small> because of honor.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19). So that a poor person does not stand while a wealthy one sits.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See James 2:1–3.</i>
Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE</small>. Let the judges always feel as if the Divine Presence is among them, as stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>&lt;GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION;&gt; HE PRONOUNCES JUDGMENT IN THE MIDST OF GODS….</small> From here it follows for litigants that they conduct themselves in awe.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE</small>. &lt;Here is&gt; a warning for a wise person not to seat someone beside one who is unfit for jurisdiction. Moreover, if he should so seat someone, it is as though he had planted an Asherah. So near &lt;this verse&gt; is &lt;the following&gt; (in Deut. 16:21): <small>YOU SHALL NOT PLANT FOR YOURSELVES ANY TREE AS AN ASHERAH &lt;BESIDE AN ALTAR OF THE LORD YOUR GOD…</small>. &gt; There is a story about a certain person who had a lawsuit with a king, one of the kings of the Hasmonean dynasty.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh.</i> 19a; cf. Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 14:168–184, for a similar story about Herod being charged with murder.</i> He came and stood before Simeon ben Shetah. He said to him: I have a lawsuit with the king. Simeon ben Shetah said to those judges who were judging along with him: If I send for the king, will you reprimand him? They told him: Yes. He sent for him. He came and put his throne beside Simeon ben Shetah. Simeon ben Shetah said to him: Stand on your feet and give satisfaction. He said to him: Are they judging the king? He turned to the right, and the judges &lt;on the right&gt; pressed their faces on the ground (to hide them). He turned to the left, and &lt; those on the left&gt; pressed their faces on the ground. The angel<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., 5:7 identifies the angel with Gabriel.</i> came and beat them on the ground, until their breath left them. Immediately the king trembled. Simeon ben Shetah said to him: Stand on your feet and give satisfaction, since you are not standing before us but before the one who spoke and the world came into being. He immediately stood on his feet and gave satisfaction. From here it follows that litigants conduct themselves in awe. They are rendering judgment, as it were, before the Holy One. Therefore Jehoshaphat said to the judges (in II Chron. 19:6): <small>CONSIDER</small> [<small>WHAT YOU ARE DOING</small>], <small>SINCE YOU ARE NOT RENDERING JUDGMENT FOR HUMANS BUT FOR THE LORD</small>. R. Hama bar Hanina said: Come and see! If there it no scriptural text written, it is not possible for him to say that flesh and blood judges its creator. The Holy One said to the Judges: Let them conduct themselves in awe, as if you were judging me. How? One fulfills a commandment before me. I have decreed over him to give him a hundred fields. If you pass judgment against him on one thing that I have decreed over him, I will give him other &lt;fields&gt; from what I possess; and I will credit it against you as though you had gotten it from me.

(Deut. 16:19, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A BRIBE</small>. When the judge sets his heart on a bribe, he becomes blind to justice and he is unable to judge &lt;a case&gt; honestly.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:8.</i> R. Eleazar said: It says here (in Ezek. 22:6): <small>BEHOLD, THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL, EACH ONE ACCORDING TO HIS STRENGTH</small> (literally: <small>ARM</small>), <small>HAVE EXISTED AMONG YOU &lt;FOR THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD&gt;</small>. Thus they stretched out<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Poshetim,</i> which is intended as a pun on <i>shofetim</i> “judges”. Thus the verb implies that the judges are the ones who stretch out their arms for bribes.</i> their arms under their robes to take a bribe. R. Abbahu said: Whoever takes the equivalent of a <i>peruta</i> (the smallest of coins) from his fellow is called wicked, as stated (in Prov. 17:23): [<small>A WICKED ONE</small>] <small>TAKES A CONCEALED BRIBE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Apart from the midrash, in the biblical context these words, which literally mean, <small>A WICKED ONE TAKES A BRIBE FROM THE BOSOM</small>, may well refer to the one who gives the bribe.</i> R. Ishmael ben Elisha said: Come and see how harmful a bribe is. One time a certain person came and brought me the first fruits of the sheep shearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 18:4; also <i>Ket.</i> 105b.</i> He also had a lawsuit before the judge, so I stood to one side. Now I said, &lt;to myself&gt;: If he pleads such and such before the judge, he will win the suit; for I was hoping for him to win. Even though he had only given me my due, and it was not a bribe, my heart was drawn to him every time I saw him. Furthermore, although had gone to the court, I asked about him whether he had won or not. &lt;This incident serves&gt; to make known to you how harmful a bribe is, since it makes the eyes blind. Now here is an argument <i>a fortiori.</i> If I, to whom he had &lt;only&gt; brought what was due and who &lt;only&gt; got what was due me, was hoping for him to win, how much the more so with one who gets a bribe.
Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay said: (Mal. 3:5:) <small>THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU IN JUDGMENT</small>; [<small>AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS, AGAINST THOSE WHO SWEAR TO A LIE, AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPRESS THE HIRED WORKER IN THEIR WAGES, THE WIDOW, THE ORPHAN AND THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE THE SOJOURNER</small>]. Woe to us for the day of judgment! Woe to us for the day of retribution!<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 93:6; Numb. R. 10:2.</i> Scripture compares (<i>heqish</i>) one who turns aside justice to all the worst transgressions. Therefore the Holy One warned (in Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE &lt;JUSTICE&gt;</small>. R. Hama bar Osha'ya said: A person having a pain in his eye gives a lot of money to a physician, &lt;when&gt; it is doubtful whether he is being healed or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ket</i>. 105a.</i> But the one who takes a bribe corrupts justice, makes her eyes blind, causes exile for Israel, and brings hunger into the world. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND POSSESS &lt;THE LAND&gt;</small>; and if not, you shall not possess it.
(Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE</small>, [&lt;with <small>JUSTICE</small> repeated&gt; two times]. From here they have maintained that one should pursue a worthy court.
Another interpretation of (Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE</small>, &lt;with <small>JUSTICE</small> repeated&gt; two times. &lt;Here is&gt; a warning for judges who judge capital cases not to render judgment on the same day as the trial. Rather let them suspend the judgment overnight (rt.: <i><small>LWN</small></i>), just as they suspend it overnight (rt.: <i><small>LWN</small></i>) in Jerusalem, since it is stated (in Is. 1:21): [<small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>WAS FULL OF JUSTICE</small>,] <small>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS LODGED</small> (rt.: <i><small>LWN</small></i>) <small>THERE</small>.
(Deut. 16:20, cont.:) <small>SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE &lt;AND POSSESS THE LAND&gt;</small>. Everyone who judges a case with unvarnished truth merits life in the world to come, as stated (in Is. 56:1): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: OBSERVE JUSTICE, AND PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS; &lt;FOR SOON MY SALVATION SHALL COME, AND MY RIGHTEOUSNESS BE REVEALED&gt;</small>.

(Zech. 13:8): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS IN IT &lt; SHALL BE CUT OFF AND DIE, BUT ONE-THIRD SHALL REMAIN IN IT&gt;</small>. This is what is stated through the Holy Spirit at the hands of David (in Ps. 97:7): <small>ALL WHO WORSHIP AN IMAGE, WHO BOAST IN IDOLS, ARE PUT TO SHAME</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:9.</i> With reference to whom were they speaking? They were only speaking with reference to the works of the Holy One. R. Hanina said: The Holy One is going to show his glory to all who have come into the world; for he will lower his throne in the middle of the firmament and again set it in place where the sun rises during the period of &lt;the month of&gt; Tebeth. R. Hanina the Elder said to him: Is it possible to see his glory, even the one of whom it is written (in Exod. 33:20): <small>FOR NO HUMAN MAY SEE ME AND LIVE</small>? Now you are saying: The Holy One is going to show his glory to all who have come into the world. He said to him: See, it is written (in Ps. 84:12 [11]): <small>FOR THE LORD</small> {<small>OF HOSTS</small>} [<small>GOD</small>] <small>IS SUN AND SHIELD</small> [….] Just as <small>A SUN AND SHIELD</small> denotes a shield over one in time of war, so also will Holy One be a shield over his children in time of war, at that time &lt;of his appearing&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the Holy One on his throne shines with the blinding rays of the sun, he will also provide a shield from these rays.</i> R.

Lieberman given orally to Daniel Sperber and cited in “Greek and Latin Words in Rabbinic Literature,” <i>Bar-Ilan: Annual of Bar-ilan University Studies in Judaica and the Humanities</i>, 14–15(1977), p. 12, n. 7. Buber’s <i>pittumin,</i> which means “ingredients” or “spices,” makes relatively little sense. Cf. <i>Codex Vaticanus, Ebr.</i> 34, which reads “<i>patronin</i>” (Gk.: <i>patrones</i>; Lat.: <i>patroni</i>), and denotes protectors. Cf. also the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:9, which seems to read <i>partomin</i> (“small portions”) but should probably be voweled as <i>protomin.</i></i> for them. Next he brings the two tablets with the Ten Commandments and says to them (i.e., to the tablets): Have they all paid attention to you? Then they say to him: From the day that you created us, no one has paid attention to us with the lone exception of your people Israel. (Ps. 96:7): <small>WHO BOAST IN IDOLS</small>. &lt;It would be&gt; more fitting for Scripture to say: <small>WHO TRUST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHO BOAST</small>? That they did not perform idol worship until they had honored each other (for doing so). The Holy One said: On each and every day you will feel shame before me. There are those among you who serve doves, and a lot of doves are slaughtered. There are also those among you who serve bricks, and a lot of bricks are broken. There are those among you who serve fish, and a lot of fish are sold in the marketplace. Immediately the Holy One put them to shame, as stated (in Micah 7:16):<small>THE NATIONS SHALL SEE ME AND BE ASHAMED</small>.

R. Hama bar Hanina said: What is the meaning of (Is. 43:9): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER</small>. In the world to come the Holy One brings the book of Torah and puts it on his lap.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 5:9, cont.; ‘<i>AZ</i> 2a-3b.</i> Then he says to everyone who has been occupied with Torah: Let him come and receive his reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

The Roman Empire entered. The Holy One said to them: With what were you occupied? They say: We have established a lot of marketplaces, produced a lot of baths, and multiplied silver and gold. Everything was &lt;done&gt; so that Israel would &lt;have leisure to&gt; be occupied with Torah. He said to them: Everything that you did you did for your own needs. Marketplaces are for settling harlots in. Baths are to refresh yourselves. Silver and gold are mine, as stated (in Hag. 2:8): <small>THE SILVER IS MINE, AND THE GOLD IS MINE</small>. The Persian Empire entered. He said to them: With what were you occupied? They say: We have {established} [conquered] a lot of cities, established a lot of bridges, waged a lot of wars. Everything was &lt;done&gt; for the sake of Israel. He said to them: Everything that you did you did for the sake of yourselves. Cities were for producing forced labor<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>angareia</i>; Lat.: <i>angaria.</i></i> in them. Bridges were for collecting tolls. Wars &lt;are what&gt; I have waged, as stated (in Exod. 15:3): <small>THE LORD IS A MAN OF WAR</small>. Are there any among you declaring this? It is so stated (in Is. 43:9, cont.): <small>WHO AMONG THEM WILL DECLARE THIS</small>? Now <small>THIS</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Deut. 4:44): <small>AND THIS IS THE TORAH WHICH MOSES SET &lt;BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. They say to him: Did you give us anything that we have not accepted? [It says about them (in Deut. 33:2): <small>THE LORD CAME FORTH FROM SINAI, AND SHONE UPON THEM FROM SEIR</small>. &lt;This&gt; teaches that the Holy One caused &lt;the light of Torah&gt; to shine over all the peoples of the world, but they did not accept it.] They say to him: Sovereign of the World, give it to us in advance, and we will carry it out. He says to them: I am giving you an easy commandment. If you observe it, I will give [you a reward] like &lt;that of&gt; Israel. He says to them: Go and build a sukkah. Immediately each and every one goes and builds a sukkah for himself. But when the Holy One brings out the sun from its case,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. and Lat.: <i>narthex,</i> where it originally denoted a shrub.</i> each one tramples down his sukkah and goes away, as stated (in Ps. 2:3): <small>LET US BREAK THEIR BONDS ASUNDER</small>. Then the Holy One laughs at them, as stated (in vs. 4): <small>THE ONE SITTING IN THE HEAVENS WILL LAUGH; THE LORD WILL DERIDE THEM</small>.

(Ps. 97:7, end:) {<small>AND</small>} <small>ALL GODS BOW DOWN TO</small> {<small>YOU</small>} [<small>HIM</small>].

Another interpretation (of Ps. 97:7): {<small>AND</small>} <small>ALL GODS BOW DOWN TO</small> {<small>YOU</small>} [<small>HIM</small>]. The peoples of the world say to their gods: Come and fall down before the Holy One, for you have led us astray.

(Zech. 13:8:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS IN IT SHALL BE CUT OFF</small> {<small>AND</small>} <small>DIE, BUT ONE-THIRD</small> (<i>shelishit</i>) <small>SHALL REMAIN IN IT</small>.

(Deut. 21:10:) <small>WHEN YOU GO OUT TO WAR &lt;AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES, AND THE LORD YOUR GOD GIVES THEM INTO YOUR HAND&gt; AND YOU TAKE THEM CAPTIVE</small>. Our masters have taught (<i>Avot</i> 4:2): <small>&lt;ONE&gt; GOOD DEED BRINGS ABOUT &lt;ANOTHER&gt; GOOD DEED, AND &lt;ONE&gt; TRANSGRESSION BRINGS ABOUT &lt;ANOTHER&gt; TRANSGRESSION</small>. (Deut. 21:11–12:) <small>AND WHEN YOU SEE AMONG THE CAPTIVES A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN &lt;WHOM YOU DESIRE TO TAKE FOR A WIFE, YOU SHALL BRING HER INTO YOUR HOUSE, &gt; WHERE SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD</small>, so that she will not find favor in his eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 6:1; see Deut. R. 6:4.</i> What is written after that (in vs. 15):) <small>WHEN A MAN HAS TWO WIVES</small>. Two wives in &lt;one&gt; house &lt;means&gt; strife in the house. And moreover (ibid., cont.:) <small>ONE LOVED AND THE OTHER HATED</small>, or both of them hated. What is written after that (in vs. 18)? <small>IF ONE HAS A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>. Whenever anyone marries a pretty face, there results from it <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>. Thus we find it so in the case of David, because (as suggested by II Sam. 3:3) he had lusted for Maacah bat Talmai king of Geshur, while he had gone to war.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">By having sexual relations while at war with Saul (II Sam. 3:1), David was disobeying the Mosaic law of warfare.

Also because of him several myriads from Israel were killed. So he made discord in Israel. Also killed were Shimei [ben Gera] (in I Kings 2:46), Sheba ben Bichri (in II Sam. 20:22), Ahithophel (in II Sam. 17:23), Mephibosheth,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">There seems to be some confusion between Mephibosheth who was a son of Saul that David had killed (in II Sam. 21:8) and the Mephibosheth who was Saul’s grandson and who was falsely accused of betraying David for Absalom (II Sam. 16:3; but cf. 19:24–30).</i> and Ishbosheth (in II Sam. 4:7). Moreover &lt;David&gt; had Ziba rule over the whole house of Saul (II Sam. 16:4; cf. II Sam. 9:9). It is also taught: R. Jose says:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh. 72a.</i></i> Is it because <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small> ate half a pound<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gk.: litra</i>.</i> of meat and drank half a log of wine that Torah says for one to go out to the place for &lt;execution by&gt; stoning (cf. Deut. 21:18–21)? It is simply that Torah has foreseen the end of <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>, that he ends up squandering his father's assets with wastrels with whom he eats and drinks, until he seeks what he has been accustomed to and does not find it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

So Torah is saying: Let him die innocent and not die guilty, for the death of the wicked is fitting for them and fitting for the world.

If he is delivered from the one,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the preventive punishment as <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>.</i> he is not delivered from the other.

For the correct order, see the beginning of the paragraph. Note also that the word for <small>GOOD DEED</small> (<i>mitswah</i>) also means <small>COMMANDMENT</small> and that the midrash has both meanings in mind.</i> Where is it shown (in Scripture)? Where it is stated (in Deut. 22:6–7): <small>WHEN YOU COME ACROSS A BIRD NEST…. YOU MUST SURELY LET &lt;THE MOTHER&gt; GO …, IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU AND YOU MAY LENGTHEN YOUR LIFE</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 8)? [<small>WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW HOUSE, &lt;YOU SHALL MAKE A PARAPET FOR YOUR ROOF&gt;</small>.] You have the right to build a house and make a parapet. What is written after that (in vs. 9)? <small>YOU SHALL NOT SOW YOUR VINEYARD WITH TWO KINDS OF SEED</small>. You do have a right to &lt;possess&gt; a vineyard and to sow a field. What is written after that (in vs. 10)? <small>YOU SHALL NOT PLOW WITH AN OX AND AN ASS &lt;TOGETHER&gt;</small>. You do have a right to &lt;possess&gt; oxen and asses.

(Deut. 22:6–7): <small>WHEN YOU COME ACROSS A BIRD NEST</small>, [….] <small>YOU MUST SURELY LET &lt;THE MOTHER&gt; GO</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 4:23): <small>MORE THAN ANY OBSERVANCE PRESERVE YOUR HEART, FOR OUT OF IT COMES LIFE</small>. R. Abba said:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 6:2.</i> There are two hundred and forty-eight [positive] commandments in the Torah corresponding to the organs that are in a human being; for each and every organ cries out at the person and says: Perform a commandment with me so that we may live through its merit and you may lengthen your life. There are also three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments like the number of the solar days. So on each day while the sun rises until it sets, it speaks and cries out at a person: You who have lived your life up to this day. Do not commit this transgression against me, and do not tilt me and the whole world toward the scale of guilt. Here are six hundred and thirteen commandments. Moreover, for each and every commandment mentioned there is a reward. For example honoring father and mother (in Exod. 20:12 // Deut. 5:16) and leaving a nest alone (in Deut. 22:7) &lt;result in&gt; a lengthening of life. There are also commandments with children as the reward, as, for example, Sarah, who lodged travellers (in Gen. 18:6–14), and the Shunammite woman, who received Elisha (II Kings. 4:8–17). There is also transgression, &lt;which may&gt; require stoning, burning, slaying (with the sword),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hereg.</i> See <i>Sanh.</i> 7:3, for the interpretation of <i>hereg</i> as beheading with a sword.</i> or strangulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For details on all four types of execution, see ibid., 6:4; 7:1–3.</i> Of all the commandments, however, none is as easy as leaving a nest alone. And what it its remuneration (according to Deut. 22:7)? <small>IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU AND YOU MAY LENGTHEN YOUR LIFE</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who brought laborers into his field to plant it but did not reveal to them the remuneration for their planting. At evening he gave one gold coin to whoever planted one tree. They all began to be amazed [and say]: Now if the one who has only planted a light and small tree [has received] one gold coin, how much the more will there be for us who have planted many &lt;of them&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. R. 6:2; Matthew 10:1–17.</i> So if the remuneration for leaving a nest alone [&lt;has&gt; a lengthening of life as its remuneration], how much the more will be the remuneration for a commandment in which there is material loss, hardship, and &lt;the need to&gt; preserve one's life. For this reason the Holy One did not explain the remuneration for the commandments which are in the Torah, so that Israel of its own accord would fulfill them and thereby increase the remuneration. Thus we have learned (in <i>Avot</i> 1:3): <small>DO NOT BE LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER &lt;FOR THE SAKE OF RECEIVING AN AWARD&gt;…</small>. [It is therefore written (in Prov. 4:23): <small>MORE THAN ANY OBSERVANCE PRESERVE YOUR HEART, FOR OUT OF IT COMES LIFE</small>.]

See what is written (in Jer. 50:33): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE OPPRESSED…. THEY REFUSE TO LET THEM GO</small>. It also says (in vs. 34): <small>THEIR REDEEMER IS MIGHTY, &lt;HIS NAME IS&gt; THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. It also says (in Is. 16:2): <small>FOR IT SHALL BE THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB AT THE FORDS OF THE ARNON SHALL BE LIKE A MIGRATING BIRD, AN ABANDONED NEST</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 17:11): <small>AS A PARTRIDGE HATCHES WITHOUT LAYING, SO IS ONE WHO MAKES MONEY APART FROM JUSTICE…</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 12): <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE EXALTED FROM THE BEGINNING, OUR SACRED SHRINE</small>. What is the connection between the two &lt;verses&gt;? Whoever says <small>A PARTRIDGE HATCHES</small> is &lt;really&gt; saying <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE</small>. &lt;This is&gt; to teach you that a partridge brings eggs from other birds and sits on them until &lt;the young&gt; emerge from their shells and become fledglings. Then they rise up over it and pluck its wings. When it goes out to fly, it is unable &lt;to do so&gt; because its wings are plucked. So a wild beast or reptile finds it and eats it. And what caused his &lt;destruction&gt;? &lt;It happened&gt; because it had raised eggs that were not its own. So it shall be with the peoples of the world, when they stretch their hands against (according to Jer. 17:12) <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE EXALTED FROM THE BEGINNING, OUR SACRED SHRINE</small>. They destroyed it, burned its temple, and carried Israel into exile. But as for Moab and Ammon, the Holy One shall destroy their memory, as stated (in Zeph. 2:9): <small>THEREFORE, AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>, [<small>THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>SURELY MOAB SHALL BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND THE CHILDREN OF AMMON LIKE GOMORRAH, …, AND DESOLATION EVERMORE.

(Deut. 25:17:) <small>REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK</small> (Esau's grandson) <small>DID TO YOU</small>. This verse is related (to Ps. 109:14): <small>MAY THE INIQUITY OF HIS FATHERS BE REMEMBERED BEFORE THE LORD….</small> Were the fathers of Esau wicked?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 6:4; <i>PRK</i> 3:1; cf. 12:4; <i>PR</i> 12:4.

His grandfather was Abraham. His father was Isaac. Yet are you saying (in Ps. 109:14): <small>MAY THE INIQUITY OF HIS FATHERS BE REMEMBERED</small>! &lt;The verse is&gt; simply &lt;referring to&gt; a sin that he sinned against his fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew of Ps. 109:14 can also be understood in this sense.</i> And how did he sin against his fathers?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 6:3; Gen.

Because he did not foresee Esau’s shame.”</i> Rabbi Levi said: During the five years that were withheld from Abraham's life, Esau committed two serious transgressions. He violated a betrothed maiden, and he took a life. The one is what is written about (in Gen. 25:29): <small>THEN ESAU CAME FROM THE FIELD, AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED</small>. Now <small>FIELD</small> can only be a reference to a <small>BETROTHED MAIDEN</small> [of whom it is stated (in Deut. 22:25): <small>IF IN THE FIELD THE MAN FINDS A MAIDEN WHO IS BETROTHED, &lt;AND THE MAN SEIZES HER AND LIES WITH HER….&gt;</small>] Moreover, <small>EXHAUSTED</small> can only be a reference to a murderer, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 4:31): <small>WOE TO ME, NOW</small>! <small>FOR MY LIFE IS EXHAUSTED BEFORE THOSE WHO KILL</small>. Rabbi Zakkay [the Elder] said: He also stole, as stated (in Obad. 5): <small>IF THIEVES HAVE COME TO YOU</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash, of course, is identifying the Edom of Obadiah with Esau.</i> The Holy One said: I had already promised my beloved Abraham (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE; YOU SHALL BE BURIED &lt;AT A GOOD OLD AGE&gt;</small>. But now he would see his grandson, when he was robbing with violence, practicing seduction, and shedding blood. At that time he was a good grandfather; &lt;so&gt; it was better for him as a righteous man to be gathered (to his ancestors) in peace, as stated in Ps. 63:4 [3]): <small>FOR STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE</small>. And what sin did he commit against his father? He caused his eyes to become dim during his lifetime. Hence they have said: Whoever produces a wicked son or a wicked disciple causes his eyes to grow dim during his lifetime. A wicked son came from Isaac, as written (in (Gen. 27:1): <small>&lt;AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD&gt; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE</small>. [Why? Because he produced Esau the Wicked.] In regard to a wicked disciple, &lt;there was a disciple&gt; from Ahijah the Shilonite, as stated (in I Kings 14:4): <small>NOW AHIJAH</small> {<small>THE SHILONITE</small>} <small>COULD NOT SEE, BECAUSE HIS EYES WERE DIM FROM OLD AGE</small>. Why? Because he produced a wicked disciple in Jeroboam. [(Ps. 109:14:) <small>AND LET NOT THE SIN OF HIS MOTHER BE BLOTTED OUT</small>.] But how had he sinned against his mother? R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and &lt;our&gt; masters &lt;differ&gt;. R.

What is the reasoning? (Ps. 58:4 [3]:) <small>THE WICKED GO ASTRAY</small> (<i>zoru</i>) <small>FROM THE WOMB</small>. R.

Abraham is dead. Isaac's eyes are dim, and he is sitting at home. Jacob has gone to Paddan-aram. Should Esau the Wicked go before her?

Thus it is written (in Gen. 35:8): <small>THEN REBEKAH'S NURSE, DEBORAH, DIED &lt;AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE OAK BELOW BETHEL&gt;</small> [<small>AND ITS NAME WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK</small> (<i>Allon-bacuth</i>)]. What is the meaning of <i>Allon-bacuth</i>? Two weepings.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bacuth,</i> of course, means “weeping,” and <i>allon</i> can be understood as a Greek adjective in the neuter that means “other” or “another.” Thus the name can be read as “another weeping” and imply a second weeping. So <i>PRK</i> 3:1; Gen. R. 81:5; cf. Eccl. R. 7:2:3.</i> While Jacob was seated in observance of mourning for {his} [her] nurse, the news about his mother came to him. This is related (to Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small> […,] <small>AND BLESSED HIM</small>. With what blessing did he bless him?

(Ps. 109:15:) <small>LET THEM</small> (the iniquity against his fathers and the sin against his mother) <small>ALWAYS BE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Whatever he has done, he has done against me.

(Deut. 25:19:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD GRANTS YOU REST …, YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>. R. Azariah said R.

Now what does the instruction mean by <small>LET US BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 7:1.</i> Moses simply foresaw that the Temple was going to be destroyed and that the firstfruits were going to cease.

When it was decreed for him not to enter the land, he began to pray, and he said (in Deut. 3:25): <small>PLEASE LET ME CROSS OVER AND SEE &lt;THE GOOD LAND&gt;</small>. The Holy One said to him (in vss. 26–27:): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>! <small>DO NOT EVER SPEAK UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER AGAIN. GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH</small>. It is therefore stated (in 26:16): <small>&lt;THIS DAY&gt; THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM…</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to obey the command to go up to the top of Pisgah.

(Deut. 26:16:) <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM…</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to vs. 12, what the Holy One is commanding concerns the payment of tithes <small>FOR THE LEVITE, THE SOJOURNER, THE ORPHAN, AND THE WIDOW</small>.</i> What is written above about the matter (in vs. 15)? <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, &lt;FROM THE HEAVENS AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&gt;</small>. R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Jose bar Hanina: How much gratification are they given! For those who perform the commandments have a pretext &lt;for doing so&gt;. If someone has business with the Empire, there are times when he gives some money, until they have him reach the king. When he does reach the king, he has doubts whether he will fulfill his request or not. The Holy One, however, is not like that. Rather when one goes down into his field &lt;and&gt; sees a &lt;grape&gt; cluster that has ripened early, a fig tree that has ripened early, a pomegranate that has ripened early, he puts it in a basket, stands in the middle of the field and asks mercy for himself, for Israel, and for the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, &lt;FROM THE HEAVENS AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&gt;</small>. And not only that, but when he said: I am not moving from here until you perform my requirements this day, as written next (in vs. 16): <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM…</small>. Resh Laqish said: A heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) comes forth and says: You shall do it again on this day in the coming year. &lt;He is&gt; like one who gives fresh fruit to his friend. Then he says: Would that you would do this again, and give me some next year.

Siman 3

(Deut. 26:16:) <small>THIS DAY &lt;THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM…</small>. &gt; What is the meaning of <small>THIS DAY</small>? Had the Holy One not given a command to Israel until now? And was not this the fortieth year (since Sinai), as stated (in Deut. 1:3): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE FORTIETH YEAR….</small> Then what is the meaning of the words: THIS DAY? Simply that Moses spoke to Israel as follows: On each and every day let the Torah be dear to you, as if you had received it <small>THIS DAY</small> from Mount Sinai. Moreover, it is written in another place (i.e., in Deut. 4:9): <small>&lt;LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN …,&gt; MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDERN…</small>. Then it is written (in vs. 10): <small>AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT &lt;HOREB&gt;</small>. (Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>THESE STATUTES</small>: These are the midrashic commentaries, <small>AND THESE ORDINANCES</small>: These are the court decisions.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 26:16): <small>THESE STATUTES AND THESE ORDINANCES</small>. &lt;They are meant&gt; to include light and heavy &lt;commandments&gt;, inferences from analogy, and fine points of scribal exegesis.
(Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>SO YOU ARE TO BE DILIGENT IN PERFORMING THEM</small>. R. Johanan said: When anyone performs Torah for its own sake, they ascribe it to him as if he had performed it himself &lt;at Sinai&gt;.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 7:1: “Scripture ascribes it to him as if it had been given to him from Mount Sinai.”</i> Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:14): <small>AND THE LORD COMMANDED ME AT THAT TIME</small> (i.e., not in the future) <small>TO TEACH YOU</small> [<small>THE STATUTES AND THE ORDINANCES FOR YOU TO PERFORM THEM</small>.] "To perform" is not stated, but: <small>FOR YOU TO PERFORM THEM</small>. Hence they ascribe it to him as if he had performed it himself &lt;at Sinai&gt;.
[(Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>WITH ALL YOUR HEART</small>.] When you pray to the Holy One, you shall not have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One and one for something else.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ben Sira 1:28 (25).</i>

Siman 4

(Deut. 27:9:) <small>THEN MOSES AND THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS SPOKE TO ALL ISRAEL, SAYING: PAY ATTENTION AND LISTEN, O ISRAEL</small>! What is the meaning of <small>PAY ATTENTION</small>? Moses said to Israel: Form &lt;yourselves into&gt; individual classes for &lt;the study of&gt; Torah, and incline your heart to hear the words of Torah. Another interpretation of <small>PAY ATTENTION</small>: He said to them: Set your heart and soul to hear the words of Torah.
(Deut. 26:16:) <small>WITH ALL YOUR HEART</small>. R. Eliezer ben Jacob says: The text has come to warn Israel with regard to something else.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 7:2: “To warn the priests when they perform a service not to have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One and one for something else.”</i> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL</small> (<i>nafsheka</i>), even though &lt;someone&gt; takes your life (<i>nafsheka</i>). On one occasion &lt;the Romans&gt;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although the parallel in the traditional <i>Tanhuma</i> identifies the persecution with the Greek kingdom, the mention of R.

Aqiva proceeded to sit down and occupy himself with the Torah. When Pappus ben Judah found him, he said to him: See here, Rabbi, you are endangering yourself, when you transgress against a decree of the King. R. Aqiva said to him: Let me illustrate for you in a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a fox. As he was walking near a river, he saw &lt;some&gt; fish there.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber.</i> 61b explains that the fish were fleeing the nets of fishermen.</i> He said to them: Get yourselves to me, and I will hide you in the clefts of the rocks. Then you shall not be afraid. They said to him: Are you the most clever of the animals? You are only a fool. All our lives have been &lt;spent&gt; only in the water. So would you tell us to walk onto the dry land! Similarly all the life of Israel exists only in the Torah, of which it is written (in Deut. 30:20): <small>FOR THAT IS YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LENGTH OF DAYS</small>; yet you are saying: You are endangering yourself. In a few days they arrested the both of them. He said to him: It would have been better for you to be arrested for the words of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I Peter 3:17.</i> Woe to that Pappus, who was arrested for vain words. Subsequently when they brought out R. Aqiva for execution, it was time to recite the <i>Shema</i>'. While they combed his flesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>. <i>7:2</i>; <i>Ber</i>. 61b adds: “With combs of iron.”</i> he was calling out the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>'.

Hanina bar Pappa said: Do not read: <small>OF THOSE WHO DIE</small>, but: "Those who kill,"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew the difference between the two renderings is a matter of how one vowels the written text.</i> because they kill themselves for the sake of the Torah, which was given &lt;by your hand&gt;. Therefore, when the children of Adam see them, they say to each other: They have sins on their hand; that is the reason they were killed. But they do not know that their portion is among the living in the world to come and that everything good is being kept in store for them. It is so stated (Ibid. cont.): <small>MAY YOU FILL THEIR BELLY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE KEPT IN STORE FOR THEM</small>. And not only that, but they attain merit for their children after them. Moreover, because &lt;the children of&gt; Israel lay down their lives for the Torah and for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, for that reason the Holy One provides them with a blessing in the world, as stated (in Deut. 26:17): <small>TODAY YOU HAVE HAD THE LORD PROMISE</small>. Just as Israel declares [its love] for the Holy One, so does the Holy One declare [his love] for them, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>THE LORD HAS PROCLAIMED YOU TODAY &lt;TO BE FOR HIM A TREASURED PEOPLE….&gt;</small> R. Joshua ben Levi said: Just as the &lt;collapsing&gt; upper story crushes, so is Israel going to crush four empires. It is so stated (in Deut. 16:19): <small>AND TO SET YOU ON HIGH OVER ALL THE NATIONS THAT HE HAS MADE IN PRAISE, IN NAME, AND IN HONOR</small>.

What is written concerning them (in Gen. 7:23)? <small>AND HE WIPED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. He overturned the works of the Sodomites, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25): <small>AND HE OVERTURNED THOSE CITIES</small>. He overturned the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28): <small>AND NOT SO MUCH AS ONE OF THEM REMAINED</small>. He overturned the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22): <small>AND FROM BABYLON I WILL CUT OFF NAME, REMNANT, OFFSPRING, AND POSTERITY…</small>. Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13 [12]): <small>THERE THE EVILDOERS HAVE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN AND CANNOT RISE</small>. When Israel falls, however, it stands up &lt;again&gt;, as stated (in Micah 7:8): <small>REJOICE NOT OVER ME, O MY ENEMY; WHEN I FALL, I SHALL ARISE…</small>. It also says (in Mal. 3:6): <small>FOR I THE LORD DO NOT CHANGE; AND YOU, O CHILDREN OF JACOB, ARE NOT DESTROYED</small> (rt.: <i><small>KLH</small></i>). R. Hanina bar Pappa said: The Holy One said: I have never smitten a people and restored them, but you children of Jacob are not destroyed, as stated (in Deut. 32:23): <small>I WILL USE UP</small> (rt.: <i><small>KLH</small></i>) <small>MY ARROWS ON THEM</small>. My arrows are used up (rt.: <i><small>KLH</small></i>) but they are not destroyed (rt.: <i><small>KLH</small></i>). And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12): <small>HE HAS BENT HIS BOW; HE HAS SET ME AS A TARGET FOR THE ARROW</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the &lt;target&gt; post and shoots the arrows at them (<i>sic</i>). The arrows are used up (rt.: <i><small>KLH</small></i>), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7): <small>THE WICKED ARE OVERTURNED AND ARE NO MORE</small>.

[(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY</small>.] Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said: Why is this parashah next to the parashah on curses (i.e., Deut. 27:11–28:69 [29:1]).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 8:1, cont.; Rashi on Deut. 29:12.</i> Because Israel heard a hundred curses less two in this parashah, apart from the forty-nine which are uttered in the Priestly Torah (i.e., in Leviticus). They immediately turned green in the face and said: Who can withstand these &lt;curses&gt;? Moses called them immediately (in Deut. 29:1 [2]) and pacified them with words (i.e., with Deut. 29:9 [10].)

Siman 3

What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 29:1–2, 6 [2–3, 7])? <small>THEN MOSES SUMMONED ALL THE</small> {<small>ELDERS OF</small>} <small>ISRAEL</small> [<small>AND SAID UNTO THEM</small>]: <small>YOU HAVE SEEN &lt;ALL THAT THE LORD DID BEFORE YOUR EYES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, &gt; …, THE GREAT TRIALS &lt;WHICH YOUR EYES SAW, THE SIGNS, AND THOSE GREAT WONDERS&gt;…. WHEN YOU CAME UNTO THIS PLACE, &lt;SIHON KING OF HESHBON AND OG KING OF BASHAN CAME OUT TO ENGAGE US IN BATTLE; BUT WE DEFEATED THEM&gt;</small>. Now in your case, for what reason were you not destroyed? After all, you did not heed my voice, and you uttered words before me for which you deserved destruction. Still I did not wreak destruction upon you, when it is stated (in Ps. 106:7): <small>WHEN OUR ANCESTORS WERE IN EGYPT, THEY DID NOT CONSIDER YOUR WONDROUS WORKS….</small> And not only that but they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. Now if you should say: For what reason are the nations of the world deserving destruction, while we are remaining alive? It is because, when afflictions come upon them, they kick against them and do not recognize the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 79:6): <small>POUR OUT YOUR WRATH UPON THE NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT KNOWN YOU</small>,…. In the case of Israel, however, when afflictions come upon them, they submit, as stated (in Ps. 116:3–4): <small>I FOUND TROUBLE AND SORROW, BUT I SHALL INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>. Therefore the Holy One said: even though maledictions were coming upon you, they themselves were raising you up; and so it says (in Deut. 8:16): &lt;They were coming upon you&gt; <small>IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOU AND IN ORDER TO TEST YOU, SO AS TO BENEFIT YOU IN THE END</small>. Thus did Moses say to Israel: Even though afflictions come upon you, you have a standing.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Amidah.</i> This word is also the name of the central Eighteen Benedictions in the daily liturgy, which are always recited standing. The implication is that Israel always has a standing before the Holy One through liturgical prayer.</i> It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU</small> {it is therefore stated: <small>YOU</small>} <small>ARE STANDING</small>.

Siman 4

Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY &lt;ALL OF YOU&gt;</small>. Just as <small>TODAY</small> (literally: <small>THE DAY</small>) sometimes darkens and sometimes lightens, so it is with you. Although you have darkness, the Holy One is going to shine on you with light eternal, as stated (in Is. 60:19): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</small>. When? When you all become one group, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): [<small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>] <small>ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. According to universal custom, if one takes a group of reeds, will he be able to break them at one stroke! But if he takes them one by one, even an infant can break them. So also you find that Israel was not redeemed until they became one group, as stated (in Jer. 50:4): <small>IN THOSE DAYS AND AT THAT TIME, SAYS THE LORD, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THEY AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH, SHALL COME TOGETHER</small>. It also says (In Jer. 3:18): [<small>IN THOSE DAYS</small>] <small>THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL GO WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, AND THEY SHALL COME TOGETHER FROM THE LAND OF THE NORTH</small>. When they are united, they shall welcome the face of the Divine Presence.

Siman 5

(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) <small>&lt;YOU ARE STANDING TODAY, ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE LORD:&gt; YOUR TRIBAL LEADERS, &lt;YOUR ELDERS, AND YOUR LAW OFFICERS&gt;</small>. Although I have appointed for you heads, judges, elders, and law officers, you shall all be equal before me, since it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 8:2.</i>
Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): All of you are responsible for each other. Even though there is &lt;only&gt; one righteous person among you, you all shall survive (literally: stand) through his merit; and not only you, but the whole world in toto, as stated (in Prov. 10:25): <small>BUT A RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE WORLD</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A more common translation would be: <small>BUT A RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS AN EVERLASTING FOUNDATION</small>.</i> However, when one sins, the whole generation is stricken, and so you find in the case of Achan (in Josh. 22:20): <small>WAS IT NOT ACHAN BEN ZERAH WHO COMMITTED</small> [<small>EMBEZZLEMENT</small>] <small>IN THE PROSCRIPTION</small> (i.e., the <i>herem</i> of Jericho)? <small>YET &lt;DIVINE&gt; WRATH CAME UPON THE WHOLE</small> [<small>CONGREGATION OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL, SINCE HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO DIE FOR HIS SIN</small>. If when the measure of punishment was small, the &lt;whole&gt; generation was seized, how much the more &lt;will the generation prosper&gt;, when the measure of &lt;divine&gt; favor is great. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL</small>; and not only the great ones who are among us, but (according to vs. 10 [11]) <small>YOUR LITTLE ONES, YOUR WIVES, AND THE ALIEN</small>. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>EVERY PERSON</small>. Now flesh and blood shows more mercy over males than over females, but the Holy One is not like that. Rather (according to Ps. 145:9), <small>&lt;THE LORD IS GOOD TO ALL&gt; AND HIS MERCY IS UPON ALL HIS WORKS</small>, upon males and upon females, upon the righteous and upon the wicked, as stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10], cont.): <small>FROM THE ONE WHO CHOPS YOUR WOOD TO THE ONE WHO DRAWS YOUR WATER</small>. R. Isaac ben Tavlay said: &lt;This&gt; teaches that, when the Gibeonites came to [Moses he did not accept them; but when they came to] Joshua, he did accept them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Josh. 9:27, Joshua gave these menial tasks to the Gibeonites.</i> Thus it is stated (in Josh. 9:4): <small>AND THEY ALSO ACTED WITH CUNNING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THEY ALSO</small>? &lt;This&gt; teaches that they had come to Moses, and he had not accepted them.

Siman 6

(Deut. 29:11 [12]:) <small>TO ENTER INTO THE COVENANT WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD, EVEN THROUGH HIS OATH</small>. Three covenants did the Holy One make with Israel: one when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, {one at Horeb,} and one here.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 8:3.</i> But why did he make &lt;a covenant&gt; with them here? Because they had {cooked} [revoked] the one which he had made with them &lt;on Sinai&gt;,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This identification appears in the parallel from the traditional <i>Tanhuma.</i></i> when they said (of the Golden Calf in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. For that reason he made &lt; another covenant&gt; with them on Horeb<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with <i>Codex Vaticanus Ebr.</i> 34.</i> and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, <small>ENTER</small> (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>), &lt;can&gt; only be in the sense of one who says to his companion: May this curse come (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>) upon me, if I go back on this word. And so you find that, when they provoked the Holy One, they went into captivity. What did Daniel say (in Dan. 7:11)? <small>AND ALL ISRAEL HAS TRANSGRESSED</small> (rt.: '<i><small>BR</small></i>) <small>YOUR TORAH</small> [….] <small>SO THE CURSE</small> (<i>alah</i>) <small>AND THE OATH ARE POURED DOWN UPON US</small>. Now <i>alah</i> can only be a curse,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alah</i> can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”</i> as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27): <small>AND THE WOMAN SHALL BECOME A CURSE</small> (<i>alah</i>). &lt;This is&gt; to teach you that, just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say: Why all this bother? It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never change anything for you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12 [13]): <small>IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE</small> […,] <small>&lt;AS HE SWORE TO YOUR ANCESTORS, TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB&gt;</small>. It also says (in Cant. 7:6 [5]): <small>THE KING IS BOUND BY THE TRESSES</small>. Now no one is bound except by an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4 [3]): <small>&lt;WHEN A WOMAN VOWS A VOW TO THE LORD&gt; AND BINDS HERSELF WITH A BOND &lt;….&gt;</small> Therefore, one cannot break his oath.

Siman 7

And so you find, when they sought to get rid of a yoke in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1): <small>SOME</small> {<small>CHILDREN</small>} [<small>ELDERS</small>] <small>OF ISRAEL CAME TO CONSULT THE LORD</small>. They said to him: Son of Adam, when a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the <i>terumah</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The priestly tithe on produce.</i> He said to them: He may eat it. They said to him: If a priest returned and sold him to an &lt;ordinary&gt; Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction? He told them: Yes. {He said to them:} [They said to him:] If we leave the jurisdiction of the Holy One, do we become like the peoples of the world? Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32–33): <small>BUT THAT WHICH YOU HAVE IN MIND SHALL NEVER COME TO PASS, THAT SHOULD YOU SAY: LET US BECOME LIKE THE GENTILES…. AS I LIVE, SAYS</small> [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>GOD, SURELY I WILL REIGN OVER YOU</small> [<small>WITH A POWERFUL HAND, WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM</small>,] <small>AND WITH WRATH POURED FORTH</small> {<small>AND WITH A POWERFUL ARM</small>}. He said to them: As long as one has not sold &lt;a slave&gt;, he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price. It is so stated (in Is. 52:3): [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU WERE SOLD FOR FREE, &lt;AND YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED FOR NO MONEY&gt;</small>.

Siman 8

(Deut. 29:12 [13]:) <small>IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE</small>…, i.e., so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to their ancestors. Deut. 29:13 [14]): <small>AND NOT ONLY WITH YOU &lt;HAVE I MADE THIS COVENANT AND THIS OATH&gt;</small>, but the generations that have yet to come were also there, as stated (in vs. 14 [15]): <small>BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE &lt;STANDING</small> ('<i><small>MD</small></i>)<small>&gt; HERE WITH US &lt;TODAY&gt; … AND WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY</small>. Now why does it say: <small>THOSE WHO ARE &lt;STANDING</small> ('<i><small>MD</small></i>)<small>&gt; HERE</small>? And why does it say: <small>THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE</small> (without using the word <small>STANDING</small>)? Because all the souls were there, &lt;even&gt; when &lt;their&gt; bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason &lt;their&gt; existence (literally: standing, rt.: '<i><small>MD</small></i>) is not stated here. R. Eleazar said: A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30): <small>WHY DID YOU STEAL MY GODS</small>? It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself [from theft]. How could it save others?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mark 15:31 = Matthew 27:42 // Luke 23:35.</i> But Israel is not like that, as stated (in Deut. 10:21): <small>HE IS YOUR PRAISE, AND HE IS YOUR GOD, &lt;WHO HAS DONE THESE GREAT AND AWFUL THINGS FOR YOU THAT YOUR OWN EYES HAVE SEEN&gt;</small>. He also watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4): <small>BEHOLD THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP</small>.

(Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, AND LET ME SPEAK; LET THE EARTH HEAR THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 16:26): <small>THE SOUL OF A LABORER LABORS FOR HIM, BECAUSE HIS MOUTH</small> (i.e., hunger) <small>URGES HIM ON</small>. Why did Moses call to the heavens and the earth at the time of his passing away?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh,</i> Deut. 10:2.</i> &lt;It was&gt; simply to teach you that he called them to charge them concerning himself.

(Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small> to what I have already told you (in Deut. 4:26): <small>I HAVE CALLED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY</small>.

Siman 2

[(Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, &lt;…&gt;; LET THE EARTH HEAR….</small>] Isaiah said (in Is. 1:2): <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS, AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>. What was the reason for Isaiah saying: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS, AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>? &lt;It was&gt; simply to teach you that all the words of the prophets are equivalent. Moses said: <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small>, and Isaiah said: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS</small>. R. Aqiva said: &lt;This&gt; teaches that when Moses uttered the Torah, he was in the heavens, and that he speaks with the heavens like one who is speaking with his friend, since he said: <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small>. But when he saw that the earth was far from him, he said: <small>LET THE EARTH HEAR THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH</small>. In the case of Isaiah, however, because he was on earth, he said: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS</small>, [since they were] far from him. After that he said: <small>AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>, because it was near to him.
(Is. 1:2, cont.:) <small>FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN</small>. They said to Isaiah: If the Lord had spoken, would not the earth have quaked? Moreover, there is the text (of Ps. 68:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH QUAKED, AND THE HEAVENS POURED, &lt;BECAUSE OF THE GOD OF SINAI, BECAUSE OF GOD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL&gt;</small>. The waters also trembled, as stated (in Ps. 93:4): <small>THAN THE ROARINGS OF MANY WATERS</small>. When? &lt;When&gt; (in Exod. 20:1) <small>GOD SPOKE ALL THESE WORDS, SAYING</small>. If he had spoken with you, would you<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So the parallel text in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 10:1. The Biber text reads “I.”</i> have lived? It is comparable to a governor who entered a city. A prefect<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>strategos</i>.</i> of that city came. When the governor came to speak with them, they became bewildered. A certain bumpkin came. The governor said to them: This is my friend, and am accustomed to speak with him. They said to him: We cannot speak with him, but if he is your friend, speak with him on our behalf. Similarly, Israel said to Isaiah: In our case he has called us his children, as stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>. It is also written (in Is. 46:3) <small>&lt;HEARKEN UNTO ME, O HOUSE OF JACOB …,&gt; THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN BORNE BY ME FROM BIRTH, &lt;CARRIED FROM THE WOMB&gt;</small>. When he spoke with us at Horeb, our soul departed at his word. Should he speak with us &lt;again&gt;, we shall die. But you are our master. You draw near and listen, just as Moses our Master did. And what was this protection that Isaiah had? What is stated (in Is. 49:5): <small>AND NOW THE LORD HAS SPOKEN, THE ONE WHO FORMED ME IN THE WOMB TO BE HIS SERVANT….</small> He therefore said (in Is. 32:1:) <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS…</small>.

Siman 3

(Deut. 32:1–2:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, &lt;….&gt; LET MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: When Moses went up to the heights, the angels were about to kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh,</i> Deut. 10:2; see <i>ARN</i>, A, 2:3; <i>Shab.</i> 88b; Exod. R. 28:1.</i> He said to them: Is it because of the two things in my hands that were granted to me from the heavens that you wish to kill me? They left him alone. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a great merchant who was walking in a dangerous place. &lt;When some&gt; brigands<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> seized him &lt;and&gt; wanted to kill him, he said to them: Is it because of the five minas<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There are four hundred minas to a shekel.</i> in my hand that you wish to kill me? But they did not know that there were in his hand precious stones and pearls,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>margaritai</i> or <i>margeleis.</i></i> which were invaluable. They said to each other: What profit is there in killing him? He has nothing on him. So they left him alone. When he entered the city, he began to sell precious stones and pearls. They said to him: When we captured you yesterday, you said: There is nothing on me but five minas; but now you are bringing out precious stones and pearls. He said to them: When I spoke to you, I was in a dangerous situation. So also did Moses our Master say to the angels: There are two things in my hand. &lt;In fact&gt; there was in his hand a great gift, as stated (in Ps. 68:19 [18]): <small>YOU ASCENDED ON HIGH; YOU CAPTURED CAPTIVES; YOU RECEIVED GIFTS FOR HUMANS</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Some translations interpret the passage to mean that the gifts are from humans, but the midrash requires the interpretation given here.</i> <small>&lt;EVEN THOSE WHO REBEL AGAINST THE LORD GOD</small>'s <small>ABIDING THERE&gt;</small>. Therefore David said (in Ps. 119:72): <small>THE LAW OF YOUR MOUTH IS BETTER FOR ME THAN THOUSANDS OF GOLD AND SILVER PIECES</small>. It also says (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small> …; and it says (in Ps. 12:7 <b>[6]):</b> <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>. Israel said to Moses our Master: Blessed are you, for your having received gifts. He said to them: If I had not said to the ministering angels that there were two things, I should have been burned by their fire, but this Torah saved me from their hand. It was with reference to them that he said (in Deut. 32:2): <small>LET MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN. DROP DOWN</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RP</small></i>) must mean killing, since it is stated (in Deut. 21:4): <small>AND THEY SHALL BREAK THE NECK</small> (rt.: '<i><small>RP</small></i>) <small>OF THE HEIFER THERE</small>; and <small>INSTRUCTION</small> must mean Torah, since it is stated (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.

Siman 4

Another interpretation (of Deut. 32:2): <small>LET &lt;MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN</small>. Israel said to Moses our Master: You have not come to speak with heaven and earth but with the rain and the dew. It is comparable to a wealthy person who went to honor the King. He took with him great princes and people of honor. He went into the king along with them, and the king received them cordially. So also did Moses say: It is better for me to call for heaven and earth, the rain and the dew to be with me, so that when I call upon the Holy One, he will answer me. For that reason he said to them (in Deut. 32:1–3): <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS…. LET &lt;MY INSTRUCTION&gt; DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN…. FOR I AM PROCLAIMING THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>.

Siman 1

(Deut. 33:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 31:29): <small>MANY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE VALIANTLY, BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL</small>. This is the blessing of Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:1; <i>PRK</i> 31:11.</i> in respect to which you should note that in the case of the earlier generations each and every one blessed his generation, but compared to all of them none was like the blessing of Moses. Noah blessed his children, but it contained a divergence. He blessed one and cursed another. (Gen. 9:27:) <small>MAY GOD ENLARGE</small> (<i><small>YPT</small></i>) <small>JAPHETH</small> (<i><small>YPT</small></i>); but he said (vs. 25:) <small>CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Isaac blessed Jacob. There was strife in it, in that he said to Esau (in Gen. 27:35): <small>YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT</small>; and it is stated (in vs. 41): <small>THEN ESAU HATED JACOB &lt;…, AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: LET THE DAYS OF MORNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&gt;</small>. Jacob blessed the tribes, but there was strife among them, in that he said to Reuben (in Gen. 49:4): <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>; and similarly (in vs. 5): <small>SIMEON AND LEVI &lt;ARE BROTHERS; WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE ARE THEIR SWORDS&gt;</small>. And from where did each and every one of the patriarchs learn to bless his generation? [They learned] from the Holy One. When he created Adam, he blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM</small>; [and<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The other part of this bracket is several lines below.</i> the world was maintained by that blessing, until the generation of the flood came, and they cancelled it out, as stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY WHICH I CREATED</small>. When Noah left the ark, the Holy One saw that this blessing had passed from them. He blessed Noah and his children anew, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. The world was maintained by this blessing, until Abraham came into the world. Then the Holy One added one blessing for him, as stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>FOR I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION…</small>. When Abraham came, the Holy One said: It is not a practice worthy of me, that I should be obliged to bless my creatures. Rather take note! I am handing over the blessings to Abraham and to his seed, so that for all who issue a blessing through him, I am placing my seal upon &lt;those blessings&gt;, as stated (in vs. 2, cont.): <small>&lt;I WILL BLESS YOU AND MAGNIFY YOUR NAME&gt; AND SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. (vs. 3:) <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU…</small>. What is the meaning of <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>. The Holy One said: Take note. I am handing over the blessings to <small>ALL WHOM YOU BLESS</small>, and I am sealing &lt;them&gt; through you. But if from then on the blessings were {spoken} [handed over] to Abraham, why did he not bless Isaac? It was because Abraham saw that Esau would issue from him. He said: If I bless Isaac, then Esau will be blessed, and Isaac will be found lacking. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the head of a household that had a vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 61:6; Numb. R. 11:2; M. Pss. 1:5; also Matthew 13:24–30.</i>: He gave it to a tenant. And in that vineyard was a tree of life, but it had overgrown a tree having a deadly poison. Now he did not know what to do. He said: If I cultivate that vineyard, then the tree having a deadly poison will flourish; but if I do not cultivate that vineyard, then the tree of life will die. So what shall I do? I will bear with that vineyard until the owner of the vineyard comes. Then he may do what he wants with his vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Matthew 13:24–30.</i> And so also did Abraham say: If I bless Isaac, Esau will end up being blessed and Jacob will lose out. Look here. It is simply that he is leaving him alone until the Holy One comes, when he will deal with what belongs to him.] Jacob came and received five blessing: two from his father, one from Abraham, one from the angel, and one from the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 94:5.</i>: Two from his father, according to what is stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED</small> (when he realized he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau). Why <small>TREMBLED</small>? R. Eleazar ben Padat said: &lt;He did so&gt; because he saw Gehinnom open for Esau. He wanted to say: Cursed. He repented and added a blessing when he said (ibid., end): <small>HE ALSO SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. Here is one blessing. A second (is in Gen. 28:1): <small>SO ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM</small>. [The blessing of Abraham (is in Gen. 28:4): <small>AND MAY HE GRANT YOU THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</small>…; the blessing of an angel is (in Gen. 32:30 [29]): <small>AND HE</small> (the angel) <small>BLESSED HIM THERE</small>; and the blessings of the Holy One (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN…, AND BLESSED HIM</small>.] When Jacob came to bless the tribes, he blessed them with the five blessing that he had in hand and added one blessing to them, as stated (in Gen. 49:28): <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, &lt;TWELVE IN NUMBER, AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM&gt; WHEN HE BLESSED THEM, EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING IS HOW HE BLESSED THEM</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash notes that the words, <small>HE BLESSED THEM</small>, occur twice and interprets the verse to mean that one blessing, the fivefold blessing he had received, was for the tribes as a group while the other blessing was a specific blessing for each tribe.</i> When Moses came to bless Israel, he added a seventh blessing to them. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>. &lt; According to another interpretation, Moses made&gt; an addition to the blessings with which Balaam had blessed Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):4</i> since it was fitting for him to bless with seven blessings corresponding to the seven altars &lt;he had built&gt;;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">On these altars, see Numb. 23:1, 14, 29.</i> but &lt;Balaam&gt; only blessed them with three, as stated (in Numb. 24:10): <small>BUT HERE YOU HAVE EVEN BLESSED THEM THESE THREE</small> [<small>TIMES</small>]. The Holy One said to him: You are wicked. Your eye is too jaundiced for you to bless them. Moreover, I am not putting the power in your hand to finish your blessing over Israel. Moses will come, whose eye is fair. Then he will bless Israel, and it is about him that Solomon has said (in Prov. 22:9): <small>HE THAT HAS A BENEVOLENT EYE SHALL BE BLESSED</small> (<i><small>YBRK</small></i>). Do not read <i><small>YBRK</small></i> &lt;with vowels meaning&gt; <small>SHALL BE BLESSED</small>, but &lt;with vowels meaning&gt; <small>SHALL BLESS</small>. This refers to Moses our Master whose eyes were fair when he blessed Israel. He also blessed them with &lt;the other&gt; four blessings:

        <br>The first is (in Exod. 39:43): <small>WHEN MOSES SAW ALL THE WORK …; HE BLESSED THEM</small>.
        <br>The second is (in Lev. 9:23): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON CAME UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING; AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT, THEY BLESSED THE PEOPLE…</small>.
        <br>The third is (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN YOU ARE AND BLESS YOU</small>.
        <br>The fourth is (here in Deut. 33:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>.
    
It is therefore stated (in Prov. 31:29): <small>MANY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE VALIANTLY, BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL</small>.

(Deut. 33:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING, WITH WHICH MOSES, &lt;THE MAN OF GOD,&gt; BLESSED &lt;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEFORE HIS DEATH&gt;</small>. It was fitting for Moses to bless Israel because he had constantly risked his life for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:1, cont.; <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):12.</i>
(Deut. 33:1:) <small>THE MAN OF GOD</small>. Resh Laqish said: If it were not in Scripture, it would be impossible to say this:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:2; <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):13.</i> Just as when a man gives an order to his wife, she carries it out; so when the Holy One gave an order to Moses, he carried it out for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although the parallel texts agree with this reading, Wm. Braude and I. J. Kapstein, <i>Pesikta de-Rab Kahana,</i> p. 456, n. 47, are probably correct that fear of blasphemy caused the midrashim to reverse what was said here. The context requires the original text to state that it was the Holy One who obeyed Moses.</i>
(Deut. 33:1:) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. It was Israel's merit that enabled him.
(Deut. 33:1:) <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>. Would it cross your mind that he blessed Israel after he died?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:3; <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):14; see <i>Sifre,</i> Deut. 33:19(342); Deut. R. 11:6.</i>: Then what is the meaning of <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>? Before the Angel of Death. When the Holy One said to him (in Deut. 32:49-50) <small>ASCEND &lt;THIS MOUNTAIN OF THE ABARIM&gt;…; AND YOU SHALL DIE ON THIS MOUNTAIN</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As the translation suggests, the biblical text in the midrash here differs somewhat from the Masoretic Test.</i> The Angel of Death thought that the Holy One had already given him authority over Moses' life. He came and stood directly above him. Moses said to him: The Holy One has already promised me that he would not deliver me into your hand. Then he blessed Israel before the Angel of Death. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 33:1) <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>.

Siman 3

(Deut. 33:2:) <small>THEN HE SAID: THE LORD CAME FROM SINAI…</small>. &lt;This&gt; teaches you that the Holy One brought the Torah around to the nations of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Lev. 3:10; <i>Tanh,</i> Lev. 3:6; Deut. 11:4; <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):15; cf. <i>Sifre</i>, Deut. 32:8(311); <i>AZ</i> 2b-3a; Lev. R. 13:2.</i> but they would not accept it, until he came to Israel; and they did accept it. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SHONE UPON THEM FROM SEIR</small>. These are the children of Esau, in that they were children of Seir. (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE APPEARED FROM MOUNT PARAN</small>. These are the children of Ishmael, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 21:21): <small>HE DWELT IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN</small>. It is also written (in Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH; HE LOOKED AND MADE NATIONS TREMBLE</small> (rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>, literally: <small>LEAP</small>). When he saw that they did not want to accept the Torah, he made them jump into Gehinnom, even as it says (in Lev. 11:21): <small>&lt;KNEE JOINTS ABOVE THEIR FEET&gt; TO LEAP</small> (rt.: <i><small>NTR</small></i>) <small>WITH UPON THE GROUND</small>. It also says in another place (in Ps. 138:4): <small>ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SHALL GIVE THANKS TO YOU, O LORD, FOR THEY HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH</small>. But we still need to say: Perhaps they wanted to heed. Micah the Morashtite came and put an end to the matter, where it is stated (in Micah 5:14 [15]): I<small>N ANGER AND WRATH WILL I EXECUTE RETRIBUTION ON THE NATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT OBEYED</small>. {….}: Here you learn that they did not want to receive the Torah. David came and gave thanks to the Holy One over this, where it is stated (in Ps. 77:15 [14]): <small>YOU ARE THE GOD WHO PERFORMS WONDERS; YOU HAVE MADE YOUR STRENGTH KNOWN AMONG THE PEOPLES</small>. David said: Sovereign of the Universe, O the wonders that you performed when you made your Torah known to the nations of the world! <small>YOUR STRENGTH</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. R. Abbahu said: It was revealed and made known to the one who spoke and world came into being that the nations of the world would not accept the Torah. Then for what reason did he make them the offer? It is simply that this represents the character of the Holy One. First he made an offer to his creatures, and after that he drove them from the world, because the Holy One does not deal with his creatures in tyranny.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>tyrannia</i>.</i> [A second reason for his making them an offer: &lt;It was&gt; because they were fortunate in their ancestors.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):15, which reads: “Because of the merit of the ancestors.” Abraham had fathered Ishmael and Isaac had fathered Esau.</i>
(Deut. 33:2, cont.:) <small>HE ARRIVED</small> ('<i><small>T</small></i>')<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, Exod. 5:14. The midrash seems to vowel these consonants to mean “beacon.” Thus the whole clause means that the Holy One was a beacon in the midst of HOLY MYRIADS. Similarly Braude and Kapstein, p. 457, note 52; see p. 244, note 64.</i> <small>FROM HOLY MYRIADS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:5; <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):16.</i>: &lt;This&gt; teaches that the Holy One is great and his name is to be praised by all his host, because his attributes are not like the attribute of flesh and blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:4; <i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):16.</i> &lt;Consider&gt; the character of flesh and blood. If the king comes out with his household,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: familia.</i> he is handsome; but among his hosts there are some more handsome than he. He is valiant, but among his hosts there some more valiant than he. In the case of the Holy One, however, there is no one like him among all his myriads. It is so stated (in Ps. 86:8): <small>THERE IS NO ONE LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD</small>. It also says (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD</small>…?]
(Deut. 33:2, cont.:) <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND IS A FIERY LAW</small>. &lt;This&gt; teaches that the Torah was given only by the right hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):17.</i> R. Johanan said: Whoever wants to be engaged with the Torah should see himself as if he were standing in the fire. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>A FIERY LAW</small>.

(Deut. 33:3:) <small>INDEED HE SHOWS LOVE TO THE PEOPLES</small> (by letting them rule over Israel).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:5, cont.; <i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):18; see <i>BB</i> 8a.</i> Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, you have placed two yokes upon your children, the yoke of Torah and the yoke of enslavement to empires. The Holy One said to him: Whoever is engaged with the Torah [is delivered from enslavement to empires]. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL HIS HOLY ONES ARE IN YOUR HAND</small>.
(Deut. 33:3, cont.:) <small>AND THEY ARE POUNDED</small> (rt.: <i><small>TKH</small></i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of this verb is doubtful. This translation follows the interpretation of the midrash.</i> <small>AT YOUR FEET</small>. Rav Joseph taught: These are the disciples of the sages, who beat (rt.: <i><small>KTT</small></i>) their feet from city to city in order to learn Torah and cast off the yoke of empire from upon them.
Another interpretation (of Deut. 33:3): <small>AND THEY ARE POUNDED AT YOUR FEET</small>. Although they are beaten, they do not move from your dwellings, but (ibid., end) <small>THEY TAKE UP YOUR WORDS</small>.
(Deut. 33:4:) <small>MOSES CHARGED US WITH TORAH, AS THE HERITAGE FOR THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL</small>. It is a heritage for all the congregations of Jacob, for whoever engages in it for its own sake is worthy of the inheritance of Jacob, as stated (in Is. 58:14): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN THE LORD…, AND I WILL FEED YOU THE INHERITANCE OF YOUR FATHER JACOB</small>.

Siman 5

(Deut. 31:14:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This verse indicates that this paragraph and the two that follow properly belong to the third section of the missing midrash on Parashah IX.</i>: This text is related (to Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i>, Deut. 11:6. The sense of the midrash requires these words to be read as a question.</i> With reference to whom is this text spoken? It speaks of none other than Moses the Righteous, for there is no one like him, not among the prophets and not among the sages. So here is the Holy One testifying concerning him after his death (in Deut. 34:10): <small>NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES &lt;WHOM THE LORD KNEW FACE TO FACE&gt;</small>; still, he did not have the power to save himself from death. David therefore said (in I Chron. 29:15): <small>FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS; OUR DAYS ON THE EARTH ARE LIKE A SHADOW, AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>. But is it not written (in Ps. 37:34): <small>HOPE IN THE LORD AND KEEP HIS WAY, AND HE WILL RAISE YOU UP TO INHERIT THE LAND</small>? So why does the text say (in I Chron. 29:15): <small>AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>? David said: Sovereign of the Universe, in all circumstances a person has hope. If one is poor, &lt;there is hope&gt; until he becomes rich. &lt;If he is&gt; feeble, &lt;there is hope&gt; until be becomes strong. If he is sick, &lt;there is hope&gt; until he is healed. If he is confined in prison, &lt;there is hope&gt; until they free him. On the day of death, however, he has no hope. So here the Holy One spoke with Moses face to face, but he was not able to save himself from death. And so Solomon has said (in Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &lt;HAPPENS&gt; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &lt;FALLS&gt; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 26:1.</i>: R. Hanina said: In the case of an intercessory spirit,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pisqonit.</i> Cf. <i>Sanh.</i> 44b, where the Tosafot and the notes of Elijah Gaon of Vilna, citing Rashi, identify this spirit with Gabriel, who was surnamed Pisqon, because he argues against the Holy One.</i> it has authority to speak before the Holy One. &lt;Such a one is&gt; like a senator<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>senator.</i></i> before the King. So he says to &lt;the Holy one&gt;: Sovereign of the Universe, all flesh is &lt;destined&gt; for death. Abraham experienced death; the wicked Nimrod experienced death; Isaac experienced death; Abimelech experienced death; Moses experienced death; the wicked Pharaoh experienced death; for Solomon has stated (in Eccl. 3:20): <small>EVERYONE IS GOING TO THE SAME PLACE</small>. So from now on, what gain is there for the righteous to be engaged with the Torah and good works in this world? And what loss is there for the wicked to sin and cause &lt;others&gt; to sin in this world? Solomon has the explanation (in vs. 21): <small>WHO KNOWS THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS THAT &lt;RISE UPWARD AND THE LIFEBREATH OF THE BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH&gt;</small>? <small>THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS</small>: These are the spirits of the righteous, because they are put in storage and hidden under the Throne of Glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shab.</i> 152b; Deut. R. 11:10; cf. Revelation 6:9, where the souls of the martyrs are under the heavenly altar.</i> <small>AND THE LIFEBREATH OF THE BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH</small>: These are the spirits of the wicked, which go down to Gehinnom. And so it says (in Is. 14:15): <small>YOU SHALL ALSO</small> {<small>GO DOWN</small>} [<small>BE BROUGHT DOWN</small>] <small>UNTO SHEOL, &lt;UNTO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE PIT&gt;</small>. But where is it shown that the righteous are called <small>ADAM</small>? Where Jonah says so (in Jonah 4:11): <small>SO SHOULD I NOT TAKE PITY ON NINEVEH, &lt;THAT GREAT CITY&gt; IN WHICH THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PERSONS</small> (literally: <small>ADAMS</small>), <small>AND &lt;MANY&gt; ANIMALS. ADAMS</small>: These are the righteous; <small>AND &lt;MANY&gt; ANIMALS</small>: These are the wicked, in that their works are like the work of the wicked. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>?

[(Deut. 31:14:) <small>BEHOLD</small> (<i><small>HN</small></i>) <small>THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU &lt;TO DIE&gt;</small>.

(Deut. 31:14, literally:) <small>BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR &lt;TO DIE&gt;</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: A drawing near is uttered with reference to the ancestors, and a drawing near is uttered with reference to the kings (in I Kings 2:1): <small>THEN WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>. With reference to the prophets (there is Moses, whom the Holy One addresses in the second person in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR &lt;TO DIE&gt;</small>. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10): <small>IN WHOSE HAND IS EVERY LIVING SOUL</small>. If the living are delivered into his hand, are the dead not delivered into his hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber</i>. 18ab.</i> Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20): <small>AND BENAIAH BEN JEHOIADA, THE SON OF A VALIANT WARRIOR</small> (literally: <small>OF A LIVING PERSON</small>) <small>FROM KAZBEEL, WHO HAD PERFORMED GREAT DEEDS…</small>. However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30 [25]): <small>AND YOU, O SLAIN WICKED &lt; PRINCE OF ISRAEL, WHOSE DAY HAS COME&gt;…</small>. And so it says (in Deut. 17:6): <small>ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES SHALL THE DEAD BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. For what reason? On seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, "Blessed Be the One Who Forms the Luminaries."<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The words, “Blessed are you, O Lord, who forms the luminaries (<i>Barukh yotser ha-me’orot</i>),” come at the end of the first blessing before the morning <i>Shema</i>‘, <i>Yotser Or</i> (“Who Forms Light”). For its use as a separate blessing with the title given here, see <i>Ber</i>. 12a. Note that the parallel in <i>Tanh</i>., Deut. 11:7, has the ore traditional <i>Yotser Or</i> here.</i> When it sets, he does not say the blessing, "Who Brings on Evenings."<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The opening blessing before the evening <i>Shema</i>‘.</i>: Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every &lt;one of these&gt; things. Moreover, they are uttered, not &lt;only&gt; while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5): <small>LET THE SAINTS REJOICE IN GLORY; LET THEM SING FOR JOY UPON THEIR BEDS…</small>.
