Seder Olam Zutta



Chapter 1

From Adam to the flood [passed] one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years. And from the flood to the generation of the dispersion, after the destruction of the Tower of Babel, [passed] three hundred and forty years - being in the year 1996 from the creation of [the world]. And from the dispersion until the birth of the Patriarch Isaac [passed] fifty-two years - being in the year 2048 from the creation [of the world]. From the birth of the Patriarch Isaac until when the Sons of Israel left Egypt [passed] four hundred years - being in the year 2448 from the creation [of the world]. And forty years the Jewish people were in the desert - being in the year 2488 from the creation [of the world]. And eight hundred and fifty years [passed] from when they entered into the Land [of Israel] until they were exiled from it - being in the year 3338 from the creation [of the world]. The Babylonian exile lasted for seventy years, between the [destruction of] the first temple and the building of the second temple - being in the year 3408 from the creation [of the world]. The second temple stood for four hundred and twenty years and was [then] destroyed - being in the year 3828 from the creation [of the world]. And from the destruction of the [second] temple until now 1053 years [have passed]. And altogether, this makes [it currently] 4881 years from the creation [of the world].
