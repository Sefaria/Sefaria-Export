Chapter 1

CHAPTER I<br>THE CHAPTERS OF RABBI ELIEZER THE GREAT<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Also called “Baraitha of Rabbi Eliezer”; see <i>supra,</i> Introduction, and cf. Zunz, <i>G.V.,</i> p. 283, Weiss, <i>Dor Dor veDorshav,</i> iii. p. 290, and Hamburger, <i>Real-Ency.</i> s. 11. i. pp. 162 ff., on the <i>P.R.E.</i> The first two chapters are probably a later addition to the Midrash contained in the rest of the “Chapters.” They form a very good introduction to this pseudepigraphic book, which was attributed to the famous teacher, Rabbi Eliezer the Great. The third chapter opens with the name of Rabbi Eliezer. The MS. fragment of our book in the British Museum which Horowitz has edited in his <i>Sammlung Kleiner Midraschim,</i> i. 4 ff., begins with the third chapter. The same fact obtains in some of the fragments contained in the Bodleian Library. For the biography of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrḳanos see Bacher, T. i. pp. 96 ff., and <i>J.E.</i> v. 113 ff., where a bibliography is added. Our “Chapters” contain about twenty dicta attributed to R. Eliezer; see Bacher, <i>op. cit.</i> pp. 122 f., who considers all these sayings as pseudepigraphic. The subject-matter of the first two chapters of our book is to be found in Aboth d. R. Nathan (<i>a</i>) 6 (<i>b</i>) xiii., Jalḳuṭ, Gen. §72, and Gen. Rab. 42 (in the new edition of Theodor, ch. xli., where further parallels are given in the notes on p. 397). Various recensions of the first two chapters have been published by Horowitz, <i>Beth ‘Eḳed Ha-Hagadoth,</i> pp. 7 ff.</i><br><small>RABBI ELIEZER AND THE TORAH</small><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The headings to the chapters have been added by the translator.

His father had many ploughmen<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Gen. Rab. 42:1 and Jalḳuṭ, Gen., <i>loc. cit.,</i> read: “his brethren were ploughing in the plain, whereas he was ploughing on the mountain.” The 1st and 2nd eds. omit the word “many.”</i> who were ploughing arable ground,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Lit. “were ploughing upon the surface of the <i>furrow</i>.” Cf. Ps. 129:3 for the word “furrows,”</i> whereas he was ploughing a stony plot; he sat down and wept. His father said to him: O my son! Why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou dost plough a stony plot? In the past thou hast ploughed a stony plot,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> These words are omitted in the 1st and 2nd eds.</i> now behold thou shalt plough with us arable soil.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This would be easier labour. At this point the MS. adds the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet to signify the beginning of the second paragraph. The 1st and 2nd eds. omit “with us.”</i> He sat down on the arable ground and wept. His father said to him: But why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou art ploughing the arable land? He replied to him: No. (Hyrḳanos) said to him: Why dost thou weep? He answered him: I weep only because I desire to learn Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Torah is not merely the written word of God, but also its oral interpretation.

In our work the Elijah story and legends are treated at considerable length. In Christian books Elijah also appears; see Mark ix. 4 ff. and Matt. xvii. 11. In the Gospel of Barnabas (124a) Elijah rebukes a man for weeping. See also Coptic Apocrypha, ed. Budge, p. 265, for a further parallel. Elijah is the “comforter” in Jewish and Christian literature, and in this capacity he is the forerunner of the Messiah.</i>— may he be remembered for good<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> On this expression see Zunz, <i>Zur Gesch.</i> pp. 321 ff.</i>—appeared to him and said to him: Son of Hyrḳanos!

Jochanan ben Ẓakkai and sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: Why dost thou weep? He answered him: Because I wish to learn Torah. (R. Jochanan) said to him: Whose son art thou? But he did not tell him.
(R. Jochanan) asked him: Hast thou never learnt<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Aboth d. R.

Jochanan ben Ẓakkai, who directed him to withdraw from his presence. He sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: My son, why dost thou weep? He rejoined: Because thou didst make me withdraw from thy presence just as a man makes his fellow withdraw, when the latter is afflicted with leprosy. (R. Jochanan) said to him: My son, just as || the odour of thy mouth has ascended before me, so may the savour of the statutes of the Torah ascend from thy mouth to Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> In Aboth d. R. Nathan (<i>b</i>) xiii. the reading is: “So may the teaching of thy mouth go forth from one end of the world to the other.”</i> He said to him: My son! Whose son art thou?

Jochanan to the Rabbis who visited him, telling them that Eliezer had not eaten at his table. Aboth d. R. Nathan (<i>loc. cit.</i>) refers to R. Jochanan’s grief at this neglect, which might have cost Eliezer’s life.</i> to R. Jochanan ben ḳakkai: Verily during the last eight days (Eliezer) has not partaken of any food.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The Geniẓah Fragment adds: “And he compelled him to eat and to drink, and on the morrow” (also).</i>

Chapter 2

CHAPTER II<br><small>R. ELIEZER AND HIS BRETHREN</small> [2<small>A</small>. i.]<br>T<small>HE</small> sons of Hyrḳanos said to their father: Get thee up to Jerusalem and vow that thy son Eliezer should not enjoy any of thy possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Lit. “and ban thy son Eliezer from thy possessions.” The Geniẓah Fragment reads: “to put him in the ban.” The brothers claimed that Eliezer should be disinherited because he had left his old father without permission. For a parallel text see Gen. Rab. 42 (ed. Theodor, p. 398), Aboth d. R. Nathan (<i>a</i>) 6Was it the custom to resort to the Synhedrion in order to disinherit one’s son?</i> He went up to Jerusalem to disinherit him, and it happened that a festival was being celebrated there by R. Jochanan ben Ẓakkai. All the magnates of the district were dining with him; (such as) Ben Zizith Hakkeseth,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Lam. Rab. 1:5 (31), Eccles. Rab. to Eccles. 7:11, and T.B. Giṭṭin, 56a. According to the Talmud (<i>loc. cit</i>.) the name Ben Zizith Hakkeseth was due to his intercourse (<i>Kisê, i.e.</i> seat) with the great men of Rome.</i> Nicodemus ben Gorion,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>J.E.</i> ix. 300, where the reference to T.B. Ta‘anith should be emended to 20a.</i> and Ben Kalba S'bu'a.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Ben Kalba S’bu‘a, this name is the result of a pun. According to T.B. Giṭṭin, <i>loc. cit.,</i> anyone who came to him even as hungry as a dog (<i>keleb</i>) was dismissed fully satisfied (<i>sab‘a</i>).</i> ||
Why was his name called Ben Zizith Hakkeseth? Because he reclined at table in a higher position than the other magnates of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> T.B. Giṭṭin, <i>loc. cit.,</i> gives another explanation of this name, due to the tradition that the fringes (<i>Zizith</i>) of the man’s garments were hanging over the cushions of his seat. The Arukh (ed. Kohut, vii. 40a, <i>s.v.</i>) appears to have had a text of our passage in accordance with the Talmudic reading, but unlike our text.</i> Concerning Nicodemus ben Gorion, people said that he had (stored) provisions containing 3 S'ah<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> S’ah, a dry measure, the size of which is held to equal 12 148 litres or 10 696 qts. The Geniẓah Fragment reads “three years” instead of “three S’ah.”</i> of fine flour for every inhabitant of Jerusalem. When the zealots<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> On the Zealots or Sicarii see Josephus, <i>Wars,</i> iv. 3. 9 ff.</i> arose and burnt all the storehouses, they measured and found that he had had provisions for three years for every inhabitant in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This passage is missing in the printed editions, but it occurs in the Geniẓah Fragment.</i> Concerning Ben Kalba S'bua it was told that he had a house measuring 4 Kors<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The Kor is assumed by Gesenius (Oxford ed. p. 499) to be the same as the Chomer, which was thirty times the S’ah. On these measures see <i>Enc. Bib.</i> iv. 5294 ff.</i> with roofs covered with gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The first printed editions read: “gardens crushed with gold.” Luria reads: “he had a palace with an area covering 4 Kors, all the beams were overlaid with gold.” He thinks that the text should read: “he had a palace covering 4 Kors with treasuries containing gold.” The MS. seems to have preserved the true reading, which is also the reading in the Geniẓah Fragment.</i> The people said (to R. Jochanan): Behold, the father of R. Eliezer has arrived. He bade them saying: Prepare a place for him, and seat him next to us.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The 1st and 2nd eds. read: “They prepared a place for him and seated him next to him” (<i>i.e</i>. R. Jochanan). The Geniẓah Fragment reads: “and seat him next to yourselves; they prepared a place for him and placed him next to him” (R. Jochanan). In the MS. the first paragraph ends here.</i> (R. Jochanan) fixed his gaze<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> For this expression see T.B. Synhedrin, 11a: “the sages fixed their gaze upon Hillel the Elder.”</i> on R. Eliezer, saying to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The Geniẓah Fragment adds: “O my son!”</i> Tell us some words<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Lit. “One word.”</i> of the Torah. (R. Eliezer) answered him saying: Rabbi!<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Perhaps “Rabban” would be more correct. The MS. uses an abbreviation.</i> I will tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this well which cannot yield more water than the amount which it has drawn (from the earth); likewise am I unable to speak words of the Torah in excess of what I have received from thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> See Aboth 2:10, where Eliezer is described as a “plastered cistern which loses not a drop,” and cf. Taylor’s note on p. 34 of his (2nd) edition of Aboth. The second paragraph ends here in the MS.</i>
(R. Jochanan) said to him, I will (also) tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this fountain which is bubbling and sending forth its water, and it is able to effect a discharge more powerful || than what it secretes; in like manner art thou able to speak words of the Torah in excess of what Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> The 1st and 2nd eds. read, “they received.”</i> received at Sinai. (R. Jochanan) continued: Lest thou shouldst feel ashamed on my account, behold I will arise and go away from thee. Rabban Jochanan ben Ẓakkai arose and went outside. (Thereupon) R. Eliezer sat down and expounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> According to Gen. Rab. <small>XLII.</small> i., the text of Eliezer’s exposition was Ps. 37:14, “The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as be upright in the way.” The brothers of Eliezer might possibly be described in the terms of this text.</i> His face shone like the light of the sun and his effulgence beamed forth like that of Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The reference is to Ex. 34:35, “And the skin of Moses’ face shone.” See also Eccles. 8:1.</i> so that no one knew whether it was day or night.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The third paragraph ends here.</i> They went and said to Rabban Jochanan ben Ẓakkai: Come and see R. Eliezer sitting and expounding, his face shining like the light of the sun and his effulgence beaming like that of Moses, so that no one knows whether it be day or night.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> This sentence is wanting in the printed editions. There seems to be some confusion in the text. The MS. concludes here the fourth paragraph.</i> He came from (his place) behind him<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> According to Aboth d. R. Nathan (<i>b</i>) xiii. R. Jochanan had gone forth from the assembly so as not to embarrass R. Eliezer. While Eliezer is expounding. R. Joshua and R. Simeon ben Nathaniel leave the assembly to find R. Jochanan, to whom they say, “Come and see! R. Eliezer is sitting and expounding things more profoundly than (the things) told to Moses at Sinai.” For another instance of kissing by the same teacher see T.B. Chagigah, 14b.</i> and kissed him on his head, saying to him: Happy are ye, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because this one has come forth from your loins.
Hyrḳanos his father said: To whom does (R. Jochanan) speak thus? The people answered: To Eliezer thy son. He said to them: (R. Jochanan) should not have spoken in that manner, but (in this wise), "Happy am I because he has come forth from my loins." Whilst R. Eliezer was sitting and expounding, his father was standing upon his feet. When || (Eliezer) saw his father standing upon his feet, he became agitated and said to him: My father! be seated, for I cannot utter the words of the Torah when thou art standing on thy feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> It would be disrespectful for a son to sit in the presence of his parent, who would be standing; cf. T.B. Ẓiddushin, 33b, where this theme is discussed.</i> (Hyrḳanos) replied to him: My son, it was not for this reason that I came, but my intention was to disinherit thee. Now that I have come and I have witnessed all this praise; behold thy brothers are disinherited and their portion is given to thee as a gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The fifth paragraph ends here in the MS.</i>
(Eliezer) replied: Verily I am not equal to one of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This section to the end of the chapter is to be found in Jalḳuṭ Makhiri to Psalms (Ps. 119), § 77, with slight variations in the reading. The last sentence reads: “But I prayed to Him only that I might be found worthy, as it is said, ‘Therefore I esteem all precepts,’” etc.</i> If I had asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for land, it would be possible for Him to give this to me, as it is said, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof" (Ps. 24:1). Had I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for silver and gold, He could have given them to me, as it is said, "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The 1st ed. and subsequent editions continue the rest of the verse, but a strange error has crept into their texts; they read “amar” instead of “n’um,” which is the actual reading in Haggai. This error is also in the Talmud (B.) Ḳiddushin, 82b.</i> (Hag. 2:8). But I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, that I might be worthy (to learn the) Torah only, as it is said, "Therefore I esteem all precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way" (Ps. 119:128).

Chapter 3

CHAPTER III<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> This is probably the beginning of the Baraitha or Pirḳê de R. Eliezer. The Chronicles of Jeraḥmeel begin with this section of our work. The following chapters up to Chapter XI. form a treatise dealing with Ma‘aseh Bereshith (The Work of the Creation) and Ma‘aseh Merkabah (The theme of God’s Chariot). Cosmological and theosophical themes were favourite ones in the school of R. Eliezer’s famous teacher, R. Jochanan ben Ẓakkai; see T.B. Chagigah, 14b, for the story of R. Jochanan ben Ẓakkai listening to R. Elaẓar ben ‘Arakh expounding the Ma’aseh Merkabah.</i><br><small>PREMUNDANE CREATION, AND THE WORK OF THE FIRST DAY</small> [2<small>B</small>. ii.]<br>R.

Eth. Enoch lxi. 10 ff. For “the heavenly host praising God” see Luke ii. 13, and for angelology see <i>J.E.</i> i. 583 ff.</i> are able to narrate (the Divine praise). But to investigate a part of His mighty deeds with reference to what He has done, and what He will do in the future (is permissible), so that His name should be exalted among His creatures, whom He has created, from one end of the world || to the other, as it is said, "One generation to another shall laud thy works" (<i>ibid.</i> cxlv. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Our text has been used by Jalḳuṭ, Psalms, § 864.

What holds good for our earthly experience is assumed to have its counterpart in the experience of the Creator. Philo (<i>de Mundi opific</i>. 4. i. M. 4, C.W. i. p. 4, § 19) offers a good parallel to the idea of preparing plans prior to the Creation; see also Gen. Rab. I. i. and my <i>Rabbinic Philosophy and Ethics,</i> p. 4.</i> Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, was tracing (the plans of) the world before Himself, but it did not remain standing until He created repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Repentance is the sole condition whereby harmony, divine and human, can obtain, cf.

Friedmann (note 33, <i>in loc.</i>) points out that by comparing the various readings in Talmud and Midrash we find that there were nine premundane things, cf. Ẓohar, Lev. 34b. It is important to bear in mind, in reading Gen. Rab. 1:4. that of the six premundane things some were actually created and some were only ideally present in the mind of the Creator. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created, but the patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the Name of the Messiah were only in the thought of God. In the Book of Enoch (Ethiopic) xlviii. 3, the Messiah is said to have had his name named <i>before</i> the sun and the signs were created; see my <i>Hellenism and Christianity,</i> pp. 15 ff., on the question of the pre-existence of the Messiah, and cf. Assumption of Moses i. 14.</i> were created before the world was created. They are: The Torah, Gehinnom, the Garden of Eden,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> “The Garden of Eden” is usually rendered by the term Paradise. The fact that Gehenna is in juxtaposition to “Gan Eden” would lead one to infer that Paradise was referred to in this context. Our author is probably opposing the view that the Garden of Eden was created on the “third day”; see Jubilees ii. 7.</i> the Throne of Glory, the Temple, Repentance, and the Name of the Messiah.

Topheth was a place in the Hinnom Valley (<i>i.e.</i> Ge-henna or Ge-Hinnom) where the hateful and cruel Moloch abominations had been perpetrated; see W. R. Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites,</i> p. 357.

Maimonides, <i>Guide</i> 1. ix., discusses our theme.

The Torah spake: The Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with me concerning the creation of the world, as it is said, "Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The idea of Wisdom or the Torah being with God prior to the Creation is generally assumed to be expressed in the famous passage verses 22-31 of this eighth chapter of Proverbs. This is, however, a mistaken view; see <i>Hellenism and Christianity,</i> pp. 65 ff. The source is rather to be found in the LXX Prov. 8:30. Our Midrashic passage is based on Gen. Rab. 1. 1Prov. 8:14, § 941, and see Bacher, P. i. p. 107 (note), who refers to the parallel in Philo.</i> I am understanding; I have might" (Prov. 8:14).

From the government of the House of David which employed counsellors, as it is said, "And Jonathan David's uncle<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The 1st and 2nd eds. have the reading “the son of David.” This is an error.</i> was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe" (1 Chron. 27:32). If the government of the House of David had counsellors, how much more so should other people act likewise. This is of benefit to them, as it is said, "But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise" (Prov. 12:15), || and (Scripture) says, "But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety" (<i>ibid.</i> xi. 14).
Eight<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The fifth paragraph in the MS. begins here. These eight things are almost identical with the seven things enumerated in Jubilees ii. 2, if “the abysses” of the latter correspond to the “Chaos and Void” of our text. See Jeraḥmeel i. 3, which is based on our text. This suggested identification seems to be warranted by the fact that Philo (<i>loc</i>. <i>cit.</i> 7) agrees with the enumeration in our text and Jubilees in the following six objects of creation: heaven, earth, darkness, water, spirit, and light. As the seventh object created on the first day he gives the abyss. This is also the reading in the Midrash Tadsheh vi., where Tehomoth = abyss. It seems that Philo knew a cosmology which was known to Jubilees, to Midrash Tadsheh, and to our author; see Charles, <i>Jubilees,</i> pp. 11 f. T.B. Chagigah, 12a, which gives appropriate quotations to support the view enunciated, enumerates ten things as being created on the first day. Neither the Talmud nor <i>P.R.E.</i> mention Tehomoth, which is the equivalent to abyss, but they both have Tohu and Bohu.</i> things were created on the first day, namely, Heaven, Earth, Light, Darkness, Tohu (Chaos), Bohu (Void), Wind (or Spirit), and Water, as it is said, "And the <i>wind</i> of God was moving upon the face of the <i>waters</i>" (Gen. 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> <span>רוח</span> can mean <i>wind</i> or <i>spirit</i>; Gen. 1:2 might be rendered, “And a mighty wind.” Is there any ancient Rabbinic authority for the translation in the R.V., “the spirit of God”? See Bacher, T. i. p. 424, and cf. Philo, ed. Cohn, G.T. i. p. 36. n. 3. The following section first appeared in the 2nd ed. (Venice, 1544) of <i>P.R.E</i>.:<br>“Some (wise men) say that day and night also,<sup></sup> as it is said, ‘And there was evening and morning, one day’ (Gen. 1:5).<br>“Eight things were created on the second day, namely, the Well,<sup></sup> the Manna,<sup></sup> the Rod,<sup></sup> the Rainbow,<sup></sup> the art of writing, the written characters,<sup></sup> the Garments,<sup></sup> and the destroying spirits.<sup></sup><br>“Ten things arose in the thought (of the Creator),<sup></sup> namely, Jerusalem,<sup></sup> the spirits of the patriarchs.<sup></sup> the paths of the righteous,<sup></sup> Gehinnom,<sup></sup> the waters of the Flood,<sup></sup> the second tables of the Law,<sup></sup> the Sabbath,<sup></sup> the Temple,<sup></sup> the Ark,<sup></sup> and the light of the world to come.”<sup></sup><br>This reading occurs in Jeraḥmeel i. 3, 4, but not in the B.M.

Our text seems to be based upon T.J. Chagigah, 2:1. 77a, according to which the world was originally “Water in water.” Then God made the water into snow (or ice); see Ps. 147:16, 17. This psalm in verse 15 speaks of God sending out“his commandment upon (the) earth; his word runneth very swiftly”—pointing to the word of creation. See Bacher, P. iii. 218. The verse quoted from Job (37:6) is rendered by the R.V., “He saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth.” See also Sepher Jezirah i. 11 for a parallel.

By these three (attributes) was the Tabernacle made, as it is said, "And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge" (Ex. 31:3).

In Jubilees ii. 2 this event is said to have been on the <i>first</i> day; see Charles’ note 2 on pp. 12 f. Our book opposes this view. The Church Fathers sometimes held this view; see Epiphanius, <i>adv. Hœr.</i> lxv. 4.

The 21st book of Augustine s <i>de Civitate Dei</i> is devoted to this theme. The Rabbis came to the conclusion that the fire of Gehenna must have been created on the second day, because the Scripture does not say with reference to this day “and it was good,” which, however, does occur in the story of the other five days of creation; see T.B. Pesachim, 54a, Ex. Rab. xv. 22, and Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 15.</i> Were not heaven and earth created on the first day, as it is said, "In the beginning God created<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. omits the rest of the verse; it is given in the 1st ed. and subsequent editions.</i> the heaven and the earth" (Gen. 1:1)?

Do they correspond with the angels of the presence of Jubilees ii. 2? The firmament implies the division between the upper and lower waters; see Midrash Kônen (Jellinek, <i>B.H.M.</i> ii. p. 25).</i> (as it is said<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> “As it is said” occurs in the printed texts.</i>), "And over the head of the Chajjôth there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible crystal"<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Or “ice.”</i> (Ezek. 1:22).

Speaking generally, the Patristic literature has much more to say concerning angels, good and bad, than Rabbinic literature.

Enoch xiv. 18, and Origen, <i>contra Celsum,</i> vi. 18. See also Hastings’ <i>Dictionary of the Bible,</i> i. 377 f. and v. 644.

Ps. 89:7. The Sephardic Liturgy is somewhat different, its phraseology for this part of the Prayer Book being probably based on Isa. 29:23. For the Ḳedushah see Ezek. 36:23; Isa. 6:3; Ex. Rab. xv. 6, and Lev. Rab. 2:8. The Venice edition adds: “His Great Name.” The B.M. MS. reads here: “And they stand near the throne of His glory and do not know the place of His glory, as it is said. ‘Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place’ (Ezek. 3:12), and the Chajjôth stand in awe and dread,” etc., as above.</i> One answers and another calls,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Jalḳuṭ on Isaiah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and T.B.

Enoch xxi. 1 and xxii. 1–3 are noteworthy, and point to the influence which the pseudepigraphic books have had upon our author. The latter part of this chapter is of importance in connection with the liturgy of the Synagogue. We note how the threefold responses of the Ḳedushah are set forth here as the responses of (1) the angels, (2) Israel, and (3) God; compare Singer, pp. 160 f. The writer of the MS. did not end the chapter here, but continued with the next chapter. A later scribe has added in the margin, “Chapter V.,” thus agreeing with other MSS. and the printed editions. Our chapter should be compared with the Merkabah Midrashim in the first two volumes of Wertheimer’s <i>Bottê Midrashoth</i>.</i>

Chapter 5

CHAPTER V<br><small>THE GATHERING OF THE WATERS</small> [5<small>A.</small> i.]<br>O<small>N</small> the third day<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Of the week of creation. Our Book agrees here with the Book of Jubilees, which states: “And on the third day He commanded the waters to pass from off the face of the whole earth” (ii. 5). Cf. Ps. 104:6, according to which the mountains were beneath the water, the surface of which was like a plain.</i> all the earth was flat like a plain and the waters covered the surface of all the earth. When the word of the Almighty<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 8, reads: “The Holy One, blessed be He.”</i> was uttered, "Let the waters be gathered together" (Gen. 1:9), the mountains and hills arose from the ends of the earth and they were scattered<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The gathering of the waters revealed the hills and valleys which had hitherto been covered by the water.</i> over the surface of all the earth, and valleys were formed over the inner parts of the earth; and the waters were rolled together and gathered into the valleys, as it is said, "And the gathering together of the waters he called seas" (<i>ibid.</i> 10).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> In the MS. the tenth paragraph (of the fourth chapter) is marked here. For a parallel text see Wertheimer, <i>op. cit.,</i> i. p. 6.</i> Forthwith the waters became proud<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The Oxford MS. (d. 35) reads: “The waters became insolent and attempted to ascend to Heaven as at first until He rebuked and subdued them and placed them beneath the soles of His feet, as it is said: ‘ Who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters’” (Isa. 43:16). The first editions agree with our MS.</i> and they arose to cover the earth as at first, when the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them || and subdued them,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> See Ps. 104:7, Job 38:8–10, and Prov. 8:29. Eth. Enoch offers a parallel: “the sea was created, and as its foundation He set for it <i>the sand against the time of anger,</i> and it dare not pass beyond it from the creation of the world unto eternity” (lxix. 18).</i> and placed them beneath the soles of His feet,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> See Job 9:8, Ps. 77:19, and Shocher Ṭob, Ps. 93:5, where our text is preserved; cf. Midrash Kônen, p. 25. The 1st ed. (<i>P.R.E</i>.) reads: “and He subdued them beneath the ends of His feet.” The Midrash should be compared with Tanchuma, Chuḳḳath. § 1, and see T.B. Baba Bathra, 74b. The subject has been discussed by Jampel in the <i>Monatsschrift</i>, 1912, p. 148.</i> and measured them with the hollow of His hand<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See Isa. 40:12.</i> that they should neither decrease nor increase. He made the sand as the boundary of the sea, just like a man who makes a fence for his vineyard. When they rise and see the sand before them they return to their former place,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>Rabbinic Philosophy and Ethics</i>, p. 10.</i> as it is said, "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The second half of the verse is not given in the MS., which reads “etc.”</i>: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea?" (Jer. 5:22).
Before the waters were gathered together the depths<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The Venice edition adds the words “the luminaries” before the words “the depths.” This is clearly a mistake.</i> were created. These are the depths which are beneath the earth; for the earth is spread<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Jalḳuṭ Makhiri to Psalms (Ps. 136:11) reads: “the earth floats upon the depths.” The text of this section in the Jalḳuṭ is more correct than the printed editions of <i>P.R.E.</i></i> upon the water like a ship which floats in the midst of the sea, so likewise is the earth spread out over the water, as it is said, "To him that spread forth the earth above the waters…" (Ps. 136:6). He opened an entrance to the Garden of Eden<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> This agrees with the Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan) 1. i.: “And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water.” See Jalḳuṭ Makhiri (<i>loc. cit.</i>) for a parallel to our text. The Venice edition differs slightly from the 1st ed. and reads: “The entrance to the Garden of Eden opened therein and He brought forth thence plants upon the face of all the earth.” This 5th chapter is devoted to the account of the creation on the third day. Thus far we find the following things enumerated: (1) the gathering of the waters, (2) the appearance of the mountains and hills, (3) the transference of the plants and trees from the Garden of Eden, and we shall have (4) an account of the mists and clouds which water the face of the earth. The Book of Jubilees seems to offer a parallel: (1) “And the dry land appeared, and on that day He created for them (2) all the seas according to their separate gathering-places, and all the rivers, and the gathering of the waters in the mountains and on all the earth and all the lakes, (3) and all the dew of the earth, (4) and the seed which is sown, and all sprouting things, and fruit-bearing trees, and trees of the wood, and the Garden of Eden in Eden, and all (plants after their kind). These four great works God created on the third day” (ii. 6, 7). It seems strange that both books in connection with the third day refer to the Garden of Eden, especially as our book has already dealt with this as one of the pre-mundane creations. According to Gen. Rab. 15:3 the Garden of Eden was created <i>before</i> the creation <i>of man,</i> who was created on the sixth day, whereas Eden was created on the third day.

The actual expression in our context is “the masculine waters.” Eth.

Berakhoth, 9:2, “the upper water is male and the lower water is female.”</i> and forthwith the earth becomes fruitful like a bride who conceives from her first husband and produces offspring of blessing, as it is said, "The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasury the heaven"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse continues: “To give the rain of thy land in its season and to bless all the work of thy hand.” This is given in the B.M. MS. The 1st ed. and later editions add: “and it is written, ‘For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee ‘<sup></sup> (Isa. 62:5), and it is written, ‘ For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven.<sup></sup>… and watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater’” (<i>ibid.</i> lv. 10).</i> (Deut. 28:12).

These editions continue: “And they minister to the seven days of the week.” The idea implied is that each planet influences the world for one hour by day and by night.

earlier than the usual time in vogue in this country). For full explanation see Rashi on T.B. Berakhoth, 59b, and on T.B. ‘Erubin, 56a. The seven planets are mentioned in the Sepher Jezirah iv. 7 by the same names as in our text. See also Baraitha d. Shemuel, ch. iii.</i> and their names are: Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The seven planets in the order of the text are represented by the following letters: Ch (Sun), N (Venus), K (Mercury), L (Moon), Sh (Saturn), Z (Jupiter), M (Mars). The letters represent the Hebrew names of the planets.</i> The mnemonic of their service is KZNSh ChLM, by night; ChLM KZNSh by day and KLSh ZMChN for the hours of the night; ChNKL ShZM for the hours of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The whole of this sentence is missing in the printed editions.</i> On the first day Mercury and the Sun, on the second day Jupiter and the Moon, on the third day Venus and Mars, on the fourth day Saturn and Mercury, on the fifth day the Sun and Jupiter, on the sixth day the Moon and Venus, on the seventh day Mars and Saturn.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The seven planets were believed to move in seven different orbits; see Philo, <i>op. cit.</i> 38, i. M. 27, C.W. i. 112. Origen, <i>contra Celsum,</i> vi. 21, speaks of “the spheres of the planets.” In the next chapter of Origen we hear of the mysteries of Mithras, and in connection with the rites of this cult the seven planets are mentioned. The order is as follows: Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, the Moon, the Sun. This is exactly the reverse order of the mnemonic in our text for the service of the planets by day. In chapter xxxi. Origen deals with the “ruling spirits” accepted by the teaching of the Gnostics; these “ruling spirits” are the seven planets. The system has fortunately been preserved in the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> (ed. Mead), pp. 360 ff. The Church Father John of Damascus, in his <i>Doctrine of Faith,</i> ii. 7, also mentions the seven planets. See also Hippolytus, <i>Philosophumena,</i> iv. 6 ff.</i> All of them minister to the twelve constellations<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>i.e.</i> the Zodiac. On this subject see John of Damascus, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and cf. <i>J.E.</i> iv. 244 f. Slavonic Enoch xxx. reads: “The sun that he should go according to each sign of the Zodiac; and the course of the moon through the twelve signs of the Zodiac,” and see Eth. Enoch lxxiii.–lxxiv.</i> which correspond to the twelve months. The constellations are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “These (<i>i.e.</i> the constellations) were created in the work of the Creation to rule the world, and thus are their ordinances. And these seven servants<sup class="footnote-marker"></sup> were created, and He placed them in the firmament of the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker"></sup> Our MS. agrees here with the Oxford MS.

Gaster’s Jeraḥmeel iv. 2 has “rules” in reference to the sun, and “serves” in connection with the other planets.</i> the days of the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Does this mean that the constellations influence the months, there being twelve constellations corresponding to the twelve months? Perhaps the reference is to the fact that the sun is in each constellation for 30 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes (<i>i.e.</i> a solar month). The Oxford MS. (d. 35) reads, “the days of the solar year.” The Venice edition reads: “the days of the solar month.” According to John of Damascus (<i>loc. cit.</i>)—<br><img

The word means “turn,” or “cycle”; cf. Ex. 34:22 and Ps. 19:6. It means in our book season, or (1) vernal equinox, or (2) the summer solstice, or (3) the autumnal equinox, or (4) the winter solstice. See Rashi on T.B. Berakhoth, <i>loc. cit.</i> where we learn that the first Teḳuphah of Nisan at the Creation was on the fourth day (Wednesday). Can Jubilees i. 14 and ii. 9 refer to Teḳuphah? See Pal. Targ. Gen. 1:14, which reads: “And God said: Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to distinguish between the day and the night; and let them be for signs and seasons for festivals and for the numbering by them of the calculation of the days and for the sanctification by them of new moons and new years, (for) intercalations of months and intercalations of years and Teḳuphoth of the Sun and the Molad of the Moon and cycles.” Etheridge’s version (<i>The Targums,</i> i. p. 159) is inaccurate.</i> of the solar year are four, each season (consisting of) 91 days 7½ hours.

Luria rejects the reading, “Some of them (last) 92 days.”</i> The first year of the cycle (of four years) has its Teḳuphah in Nisan at 6 p.m.; in the second year at 12 p.m.; in the third year at 6 a.m.; in the fourth year at 12 a.m.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> Luria’s reading in the latter part of Note 22, <i>in loc.,</i> has been adopted, as the MS. text seems to be unintelligible.

The reading adopted for the translation gives the following abbreviations: A–A, B–V, G–A, D–V, where the first letters of each set refer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years (of the small cycle) respectively; the 2nd letters indicate the hours when the Teḳuphoth of Nisan in the four years begin, namely: 6 p.m. (A), 12 p.m. (V), 6 a.m. (A), and 12 a.m. (V).</i>

Rab. xv. 22: “The Holy One, blessed be He, created 365 windows in the firmament, 183 on the east and 182 on the west.” The Jalḳuṭ on 1 Kings, §185. compares the knops mentioned in 1 Kings vii. 24 to “the 365 windows which are in the east and in the west, for the sun rises in one in the east and sets in one in the west.” This section of the Jalḳuṭ is taken from the Midrash Tadsheh (cf. Epstein, Midrash Tadsheh, p. xvi). Further parallels are to be found in Buber’s Shocher Ṭob, Ps. 19:11, and Jalḳuṭ on Psalms (xix.), § 673, and on Eccles. § 967. The astronomical theories of our book are not in agreement with the Rabbinical system set forth in the Talmud and Midrashim. It seems that our author held the view that the solar year had 366 days. Each half-year the sun passes through 91, plus 91, plus 1 apertures, or in one year through 366 apertures. Now we find a parallel teaching in the Slavonic Enoch xiii. 2: “And I saw the six great gates open, each gate having sixty-one stadia.” Thus far Text B.; see Charles’ ed.. p. 15, and cf. Eth. Enoch lxxii. 2 ff. on the course of the sun. Here also “windows” are mentioned. The whole of this chapter should be read in comparison with our text. Eth. Enoch adopts the strange calculation that the solar year has 364 days, though he was acquainted with the year of 365½ days. Does our book attempt a new solution? or, as I venture to suggest, did our author borrow from Slavonic Enoch? This seems the most probable view.</i> apertures and enters by the east; 90 days<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read 91 days.

Our author seems to treat numbers without any regard to the exact amount. By treating fractions as though they were whole numbers, we may find an explanation of the difficulty which has already occurred in the previous chapter; perhaps the 365¼ days of the year were described as 366 so as to avoid the fraction. The text should probably read thus: “The distance covered by the sun in 12 days is covered by the moon in 1 day, and (the distance) covered by the sun all the days of the year, the moon traverses in 30 days.” See, however, T.J. Rosh Ha-Shanah ii. 5, p. 58a, which is possibly the source of our text here. The lunar month according to the Hebrew astronomers was said to be 29 days, 12 hours, and 793/1080 parts of an hour (1 minute=18 parts). Our book sometimes treats this as a whole number by saying, “the month has 30 days,” or we find the more exact reference to 29 days, 12 hours, and 40 minutes, neglecting the 4 minutes, 3⅓ seconds, which really belong to the sum total. On the entire subject of the Calendar see the valuable article by S. Poznaúski in Hastings’ <i>Encyclopœdia of Religion and Ethics,</i> iii. 17 ff.</i> All the days serve for the beginning of the Molad of the (new) moon; (for the following series<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The series of the small cycles of three years in which the Molad of the next cycle falls on the day which was anterior to that on which the previous Molad fell. The calculation is based on the length of the lunar month being reckoned as measuring 29 days, 12 hours, 40 minutes, so that in one year the surplus over the complete week equals 4 days, 8 hours (since each lunar month has 4 complete weeks and 1 day, 12 hours and 40 minutes; and this surplus multiplied by 12 equals 18 days, 8 hours, <i>i.e.</i> 4 days, 8 hours beyond the two weeks), and in three years we have a surplus of 13 days (two weeks less one day); therefore the day of the next series to the one in question will be one day earlier than the preceding series; see Schwarz, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 23, and Lewisohn, <i>Geschichte und System des jüdischen Kalenderwesens,</i> p. 25, note 84.</i>) the days are reckoned backward; at the beginning of the night of the fourth day<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Tuesday, at 6 p.m.</i> the beginning of the Molad (new moon) was in the hour of Saturn;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra,</i> p. 32, note 2.

"><br>Speaking of the sun and moon, Eth. Enoch says (lxxviii. 5): “And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their revolutions to the north and come forth through the eastern portals on the face of the heaven.” The old Jewish belief as to the relation between the motion of the sun and moon was as follows: According to Rashi (T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, <i>loc. cit.</i>) the conjunction of every Molad (new moon) takes place when the moon is in the south-west corner of its orbit.<br>In winter since the sun does not traverse the west in the daytime save when it sets, therefore the moon is in the west before the sun gets there, because the moon during the first half of the lunar month goes to the north, whilst the sun revolves in the south.<br>In summer the sun goes over the greater part of the west in the daytime; and as it is then revolving in the north it is there before the moon, for then the moon is chiefly in the south. Where the sun sets there the moon rises.</i> the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of the Moon (L). In the third year, in the following hour, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Mercury (K).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra,</i> p. 43, note 3.</i> In the fourth year the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Venus (N). In the fifth year, in the hour following, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of the Sun (Ch). In the sixth year the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Mars (M). In the seventh year, in the hour following, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is || in the hour of Jupiter (Z) in the hour following.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> “In the hour following” and the next sentence do not occur in the printed texts.</i> The third and fifth years are like the seventh. In like manner for three times these hours serve at the conjunction of the moon retrospectively until the (expiration of) the 21 years of the cycle.

The Slavonic Enoch says, “And there remain 11 days over, which belong to the solar circle of the whole year” (xvi. 5). According to Eth. Enoch lxxviii. 15, 16, the lunar year has 354 days and the solar year has 364 days, thus the difference between them amounts to 10 days.

If instead of “12” we read “7” then we have the cycle of 19 years with 7 intercalated months, which will be presently considered. Luria thinks that “the sun and moon are equal at the commencement of the eve of the fourth day in the hour of Saturn,” as “when they were created” only applies at the end of the cycle of 84 years. This number is obtained by multiplying 12 (the number of the constellations) by 7 (the number of the planets); or by multiplying the solar cycle of 28 years by 3; or by multiplying the lunar cycle of 21 years by 4; possibly this 84-year cycle was intended to be used for astrological purposes.</i> intercalated months (come round) when the sun and the moon are equal (again) at the commencement of the eve of the fourth day in the hour of Saturn in the hour when they were created. Between each Molad (conjunction of the moon and sun) there are only 36 hours, 40 minutes, and 73<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The “73 minims” must be considered as an interpolation; see <i>supra,</i> p. 43, note 5.</i> minims (parts).
The moon does not disappear from the firmament save for the twinkling of an eye; even though there were a full thread (of light) surrounding it in the east and in the west,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> That is, at the beginning and end of the Molad; see T.B.

Rosh Ha-Shanah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> the Palestinian Jews were unable to discern the moon at the Molad, for 6 hours after and 18 hours before the Molad; in Babylon the reverse rule obtained. The reading “6 hours” in this Talmudic passage seems to Luria to be the appropriate reading in our text. Assuming, however, that our text is correct, we might argue that Palestine could not be the place where our book arose.</i> hours (have elapsed). (The large hours) are two hours for each (large) hour, either at the beginning of the Molad (conjunction) of the moon or at the end of the Molad of the moon.
The number of the days of the lunar year is 354 days, a third of a day, and 876 minims.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> 876 minims equal 48⅔ minutes. There is evidently something amiss here, because the next sentence tells us that the lunar month has 708 hours and 40 minutes, which means that the lunar month equals 29 days, 12 hours, and 40 minutes. On this basis the lunar year has 354 days, 8 hours. Must we assume that the “876 minims” are an interpolation? This figure equals 48⅔ minutes, which in one lunar month equal 4 1/18 minutes or 73 minims.</i> || All the hours of a lunar month are 708 hours and 40 minutes; all the hours of a lunar year are 8504 hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> 8504 hours = 12 times 29 days, 12 hours, and 40 minutes.</i>
All the constellations serve the Molad of the moon and also the generations<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> Or, “history.”</i> of the children of men;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The knowledge of the influence of the stars and planets on terrestrial affairs or, in other words, astrology was believed to enable men to know the future. Our book bases this on the text, which is quoted in this paragraph; also Gen. 5:1, which was read as follows: “This is the calculation of the generations of man.” See also Job 38:19, “Where is the way to the dwelling of light… And that thou shouldst discern the paths to the house thereof? Thou knowest for thou wast then born.” The sun, moon, and the planets are referred to in this chapter, showing that they have some connection with the time and duration of life. Slav. Enoch xix. 2 says, “And these orders arrange and study the revolutions of the stars, and the changes of the moon, and revolutions of the sun, and superintend the good and evil condition of the world.” The N.T. also implies a belief in the doctrines of astrology, <i>e.g.</i> Matt. ii. 9; see Jeremias, <i>Babylonisches im N.T.,</i> p. 52. This book of Jeremias is the best book on N.T. astrology; for astrology among the Jews see Löw, <i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>, ii. 115 ff.</i> upon them the world stands, and everyone who is wise and understands, he understands the Molad of the moon and the generations of the children of men, and concerning them the text says, "And let them be for signs,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add the next word in the verse, “and for seasons”; this is wanting in our MS.</i> and for seasons" (<i>ibid.</i> 14).

In three cycles of the sun or in four cycles of the moon<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The lunar cycle referred to here consists of 21 years, as stated <i>supra,</i> p. 43. The solar cycle consists of 28 years, see <i>supra,</i> p. 34.</i> there are 84 years, which are one hour<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> God’s day equals 1000 years, therefore 1 hour (reckoning 12 hours to the day) equals 83⅓ years. The third part of the year is reckoned as a whole year. This is another instance of the use of fractions as whole numbers, which seems to be a characteristic of our author. The Church Fathers use this idea of God’s day lasting 1000 years; see Justin Martyr, <i>Dialogue with Trypho,</i> lxxxi., and Irenæus, <i>adv. Hær.</i> v. 28. 3; and cf. Slavonic Enoch xxxiii. 1 f.</i> of the day of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Rabbi Nehorai said: It is the decree of the King<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “The decree of the King is made public by a word.” See Jalḳuṭ, Jer. § 285. Instead of the reading “by a word” Luria suggests the reading “in the world,” referring to the eclipses which are visible over a large portion of the world.</i> that when Israel sins || and fails to intercalate the year as is becoming, the Holy One, blessed be He, acts in His mercy at the time when the flame of the sun reaches the moon by night at 40 degrees (or ascents), then the Holy One, blessed be He, makes the moon dim and hides one of the Synhedrion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf. T.B. Synhedrin, 37a, and Cant. Rab. on Cant. 7:3. Here “to hide” means to conceal in the future life; this, in other words, is a warning not to neglect the intercalation. According to the Jesod ‘Olam iii. 17 the moon is the “chief” of the Synhedrion, which dies at the eclipse by being <i>hidden.</i> For eclipse in N.T. see Luke xxiii. 44, 45.</i> When Israel does the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, in His great mercy He makes the sun dim and He sends forth His anger upon the nations of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read here also “the nations of the world.” Later editions read: “worshippers of idols.”</i> as it is said, "Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the <i>nations</i>, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions continue the verse.</i> for the <i>nations</i> are dismayed at them" (Jer. 10:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Some of the old editions read here: “the nations (or according to the Prague edition ‘the worshippers of idols’) are dismayed, but not Israel.” See Pseudo-Seder Elijahu Ẓuṭṭa (ed.

Rosh Ha-Shanah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and T.B.

The reading in our text (the 20th) is approved by Schwarz (<i>Der jüdische Kalender,</i> p. 36, note 3). The “Megillah of Abiathar” (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 471) reads: “If the Teḳuphah of Ṭebeth had occurred from half (of the month) and later they intercalate the year, but till half (of the month) and earlier they do not intercalate the year.” The printed editions read: “If the Teḳuphah had occurred by the 20th day of the month or earlier they intercalate the year; but from the 20th day of the month or later they do not intercalate the year.” This is clearly wrong. The correct reading is preserved by our MS., which is confirmed by the Oxford MS. (d. 35). On this subject see Maimonides, Ḳiddush Ha-Chodesh iv. 2, Schürer, i. (3rd ed.), pp. 752 ff.; F. K. Ginzel, <i>Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie,</i> ii. p. 67; and L.Wreschner, <i>Samaritanische Traditionen,</i> p. 10.

Charles), xiv. 13: “Nor shall fish be eaten unless they are split alive and their blood was shed.” Dr Schechter thinks that this rule was” “directed against the Rabbinic opinion permitting the eating of the blood of the fish. See Sifra, 39a, and Kerithoth, 20b.” See, further, T.B. Chullin, 27b, “where,” says Dr. Schechter, “we have a homily to the effect that cattle have to be killed in a certain way because they were created out of the dry land (earth); fish, again, require no killing, being created out of the water; whilst birds, which were created out of alluvial mud (a combination of water and earth), occupy also, with regard to their ritual killing, a middle place between cattle and fish. The notion was that the mode of killing is in some way connected with the element out of which the animal in question was created.” See Wreschner, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 54.

This universalistic aspect of the mission of the Hebrew is familiar to the student of the Bible. Abraham, Moses, and the suffering servant of God, who is none other than Israel, represent this teaching, which our book enforces.

Our book was the source used by the author of the Midrash. The variant readings which a comparison of the two texts affords may be illustrated by one example: instead of “the day of the salvation of Israel,” the Midrash reads, “the day of my salvation.” Again, the prayer of Jonah in the Midrash is considerably longer than that of <i>P.R.E.</i><br>The story of Jonah is interpreted in a fine Midrashic spirit by Zeno in his 17th tractate. Ephraim (29th chap. on the prophet Jonah) refers to Jonah’s dread of being called a “lying prophet,” and mentions also the dread inspired by Jonah among the terrible monsters of the deep. A very interesting point is suggested by a passage in Origen, <i>contra Celsum,</i> vii. 57, according to which Jonah was considered to be the Messiah in place of Jesus. Our book ascribes certain Messianic functions to Jonah in connection with the Leviathan and the Day of Israel’s salvation. Perhaps he is a type of the “Messiah ben Joseph” who is to overcome the Anti-Christ or Satan (<i>i.e.</i> the Leviathan). The New Testament connects the story of Jonah with its Messiah; see Matt. xii. 39–41 and <i>ibid.</i> xvi. 4; cf. Luke xi. 29–32. The “Fish” as a Christian Messianic emblem may be associated with the Jonah legends.</i>

By asking about the “fruit of <i>the garden</i>” the Serpent was enabled to mislead Eve. The Talmud (T.B. Synhedrin, 29a) lays stress on the addition to the Divine command made by Eve when she said, “neither shall ye touch it” (Gen. 3:3). Our MS. intends the question to be quite general: “Is it a fact that you have been commanded (not to eat) the fruit of any tree?” This agrees with the Midrash Haggadol, Gen. <i>loc. cit</i>.</i> She said (to him): Yes, as it is said, "Of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden" (Gen. 3:8).

Daiches considers this custom as a relic of nail magic (see Jews’ College Publications, v. pp. 31 f. n. 1). According to the Church Father Ephraim, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 139, Adam and Eve lost their angelic endowments immediately after their sin, their sight and power of discerning became limited only to matters corporeal and sensible; see the Book of Adam and Eve (ed.

Similarly also did the woman (receive) toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of parturition, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God. But the curse in all its fulness fell upon the serpent which had beguiled them.” For other references see Diestel, <i>op. cit</i>.

CHAPTER XV<br><small>THE TWO WAYS</small> [17<small>A</small>. i.]<br>R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LIEZER</small> said: I heard with my ear<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See Isa. 5:9, and note the Targum thereon. R. Eliezer ben Hyrḳanos was held to be worthy of being endowed with the Holy Spirit; see T.J. Soṭah (end) and T.B. Synhedrin, 11a; Jalḳuṭ, Job, § 919.</i> the Lord of hosts speaking. What did He speak? He said: "See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil" (Deut. 30:15). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Behold, these two ways<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The theme of this chapter of our book is the Jewish doctrine of the Two Ways, the ways of good and evil, or of life and death. Adam did not keep the “way of life” (see <i>supra</i>, p. 85); he disobeyed God by taking of the fruit of the tree of “good and evil.” The “Way of Life” in Paradise was guarded by the Cherubim, and the earthly way of “good and evil” is likewise in the charge of angels, good and evil. Slavonic Enoch xxx. 15 connects the “two ways” with Adam before his disobedience. On the “Two Ways” see <i>Jewish Sources of the Sermon on the Mount</i>, pp. 239 ff. See also Gen. Rab. 21:5. The Christian literature has also its doctrine of the Two Ways; see the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, vii. 1; Epistle of Barnabas xviii.–xx.; Hermas, Mand. vi. 2; Pseudo-Clementine Homilies, v. 7; and for “Heaven and Hell” see the <i>Revelation of Peter</i> (ed. Robinson and James, 1892, pp. 48 ff.). See also Test. XII Pat., Asher i. 3, with Charles’ note <i>in loc</i>. Some of the printed texts read “two words” instead of “two ways.” The latter is, of course, the correct reading; see Jalḳuṭ, Job, <i>loc. cit</i>.</i> have I given to Israel, one is good, the other is evil. The one which is good, is of life; and the one which is evil, is of death.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> See T.B. Joma, 38b.</i> The good way has two byways, one of righteousness and the other of love, and Elijah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> On Elijah in Jewish literature see <i>supra</i>, p. 2, note 7; <i>J.E</i>. v. 122 ff.; Schechter, <i>Aspects of Rabbinic Theology</i>, p. 288.</i> be he remembered for good, is placed exactly between these two ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>i.e</i>. the ways leading to life and death.</i> When a man comes to enter (one of these ways), Elijah,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra</i>, p. 95; T.B. Ḳiddushin, 70a; Ruth Rab. 5:6. On Elijah’s work see Seder ‘Olam Rab. 17</i> be he remembered for good, cries aloud concerning him, saying, "Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in" (Isa. 26:2). And there cometh Samuel the prophet, and he places himself between these two byways.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Samuel, like Elijah, sought to reconcile God and man. On Samuel in Rabbinic literature see <i>J.E</i>. xi. 7. On the idea in our Midrash see 1 Sam. 2:26; according to this text, Samuel grew in favour with God and man. The favour of God is the result of “righteousness,” whilst the favour of man is due to “love” between man and his fellow.</i> He says: On which of these (two byways) shall I go? If I go on the way of righteousness, then (the path) of || love is better than the former; if I go on the way of love, (the way) of righteousness is better: but I call heaven and earth to be my witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This expression is very common in the Tanna de bê Elijahu.</i> that I will not give up either of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add here: “but I will take them for myself.” See Eccles. 7:18.</i>
The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Samuel ! Thou hast placed thyself between these two good byways. By thy life! I will give to thee three good gifts. This teaches thee that everyone who doeth<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read “who desireth and doeth,” instead of “doeth.” Luria suggests “pursueth.”</i> righteousness and sheweth the service of love, shall inherit three good gifts, and they are: life, righteousness, and glory, as it is said, "He that followeth after righteousness and love, findeth life, righteousness, and glory" (Prov. 21:21). It is only written here (in the text): "He findeth life, righteousness, and glory."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> This sentence is missing in the printed editions.</i>
(Leading) to the way of evil, there are four<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf. the three sins of Israel mentioned by Amos 2:6 and the four calls of Wisdom in Prov. 1:20 ff.</i> doors, and at each door seven angels<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “seven watchers, angels, are sitting,” <i>i.e</i>. guardian angels.</i> are standing—four without, and three within. The (angels) without are merciful, and those within are cruel. When a man comes to enter,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “the first door.”</i> the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him: What hast thou to do with the fire yonder? What hast thou to do with those glowing coals?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “Why wilt thou enter into the midst of this fire? Why wilt thou enter among the uncircumcised and the glowing coals?” Luria reads “flames” instead of “uncircumcised.” The picture of Gehenna in our context may be suggested by the “swords of flaming fire” in the hands of the Cherubim guarding Paradise. The “flaming fire” is outside Paradise. For the “everlasting fire” in the New Testament see Matt. xxv. 41; the old editions (<i>e.g</i>. Amsterdam) read <span>הרים</span>, “mountains,” instead of “wicked.”</i> Listen to us and repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Or “return”; possibly the word implies “<i>repent and return</i>.”</i> If he hearken to them and repent, behold it is well, and if not, he says to them:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read here: “If he hearken to them it is well; and if not, verily they say to them: Amongst them (yonder) there is no life.” Our MS. has undoubtedly the better reading.</i> Amongst them (yonder) let my life (be). || They say to him: Thou hast entered the first door; do not enter the second door.

If he listen to them and repent, it is well; and if not, he says to them:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> See note 2 above.</i> With them yonder let my life (be). They say to him: Behold thou hast entered the second door, do not enter the third door. When he is about to enter the third door the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read, instead of our text, the following: “Why wilt thou be erased from the book of life?<sup class="footnote-marker"></sup> Is it not better for thee to be inscribed (therein) rather than to be erased (therefrom)? Hearken unto us, and repent. If he listen to them, it is well; and if not, woe to him and to his head!” See Wisdom i. 13.</i> What benefit is to thee that they (<i>i.e</i>. the good angels) should flee from thee and call thee "Unclean"? Would it not be better that they should call thee "Pure One" and not "Unclean"? Hearken to us and repent. If he hearken unto them, behold, it is well; and if not, he says unto them: With them (yonder) let my life (be). They say to him: Behold thou hast entered the third door; do not enter the fourth door! When he is about to enter the fourth door the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him: Behold, thou hast entered these doors, and thou hast not hearkened nor returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The translation might also be, “repented.” See Jalḳuṭ, Job, <i>loc</i>. <i>cit</i>.</i> Thus far the Holy One, blessed be He, receives || the penitent; thus far the Holy One, blessed be He, pardons<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add “sins.”</i> and forgives,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See T.B. Joma, 86b, and T.B.

Justin Martyr, <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>, cv., on the “evil angel taking our soul.” See also Hippolytus (<i>Against Plato</i>. ed Lagarde, p. 69).</i> say: Since he would not hearken to the first (angels), let us cause his spirit to depart, as it is said, "Let his spirit go forth, let him return to his earth" (<i>ibid.</i> cxlvi. 4). And concerning them<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The unrepentant.</i> (the Scripture) says:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The printed texts omit the quotation from Ex. 20:5 and conclude the quotation from Job 33:29 with the word “work,” adding “etc.”</i> "Upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me" (Ex. 20:5); and another verse says: "Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man" (Job 33:29). And thus He calls to Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Luria thinks that probably the text originally ended with a reference to Samuel. The first editions agree with our MS. and read “to Eliezer,” indicating Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrḳanos, whose name also occurs at the beginning of the chapter.</i>
The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Eliezer ! Thou hast made thyself like a threefold cord,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The printed texts omit the quotation from Eccles. 4:12. Some of the texts read, “Hast thou made thyself?” etc. The threefold cord is Torah, Divine Worship, and Loving Service. R. Eliezer had acquired Torah, and devoted his life to the service of God; and by his action to his brothers he rendered loving service to them. The reference to Samuel would be just as likely.</i> as it is said, "And a threefold cord is not quickly broken" (Eccles. 4:12). I also will apply to thee this verse: "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God" (Deut. 18:13). Do not read thus, but: "Thou shalt be perfect <i>before</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> In the MS. the texts “with the Lord” are identical.

Chapter 16

CHAPTER XVI<br><small>THE SERVICE OF LOVING-KINDNESS</small> [17<small>B</small>. ii.]<br>T<small>HE</small> world rests upon three things: upon the Torah, upon Divine Worship, and upon the service of loving-kindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See Aboth 1:2; Pesiḳta Rabbathi, 5 p. 15b; and cf. <i>supra,</i> p. 89, and <i>infra,</i> p. 122.</i>
"Upon the Torah," whence do we know (this)? Because it is written, "If my covenant<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> God’s covenant is the Torah; see T.B. Sabbath, 33a; cf. T.B. Pesachim, 54a; and T.B. Nedarim, 32a. The argument by analogy afforded by comparing similar words in two different verses of Scripture is known as “Geẓerah Shavah,” and is employed here. For examples see Levy, <i>N.H.W.</i> i. 320 f.; and cf. Bacher’s <i>Terminologie,</i> i. <i>s.v.</i> pp. 13 ff.</i> of <i>day and night</i> stand not" (Jer. 33:25); and (another text) says, "This book of the Torah shall not depart out of thy mouth,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The rest of the verse is omitted by our MS.; it occurs in the first editions. The MS. adds the paragraph following dealing with the service of loving-kindness.</i> but thou shalt meditate therein <i>day and night</i>" (Josh. 1:8). Whence do we know (that the world rests) upon the service of loving-kindness? Because it is said, "For I desired love, || and not sacrifice" (Hos. 6:6). Whence do we know (that the world rests) upon Divine Worship? Because it is written, "And the prayer of the upright is his delight"<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> Luria thinks that the text should read: “(The world rests) upon Divine Worship. What is this (Worship)? Prayer.” The preceding part of the verse quoted reads: “The <i>sacrifice</i> of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, and the prayer of the upright is his <i>delight</i>” (Prov. 15:8). In Mal. 2:13 “delight” is used instead of “offering.” On this theme see Aboth de R. Nathan (<i>a</i>) iv. p. 9b; T. J. Megillah 3:7. 74b; Num. Rab. 12:12. The ethical lesson here is noteworthy: knowledge of God’s Law must find expression, on the one hand, in Divine Worship, and, on the other, in the service of loving-kindness to humanity. Judaism claims to be the highest expression of religious truth, and stands or falls by the ethical teaching it enunciates.</i> (Prov. 15:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “What is the Divine Worship? Prayer, for thus we find in Daniel, to whom Darius said: ‘Thy God whom thou <i>servest</i> continually, he will deliver thee’ (Dan. 6:16).

Whence do we learn of the service of loving-kindness for bridegrooms? We learn (this) from the Holy One, blessed be He; for He Himself bestowed loving-kindness upon Adam and his help-mate. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come ye and let us show loving-kindness to Adam and his help-mate. The Holy One, blessed be He, descended with the ministering angels to show loving-kindness to Adam and his help-mate.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> In the Garden of Eden; see <i>supra,</i> pp. 88 ff.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said: More beloved unto Me is the service of loving-kindness than sacrifices and burnt-offering which Israel, in the future, will bring on the altar before Me, as it is said, "For I <i>desired</i> love, and not sacrifice" (Hos. 6:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra,</i> pp. 76, 84, 89, for the idea that the world rests on love. Here the stress is on “<i>I desired</i>,” since God’s desire or will is the cause of the world’s existence. The bridegroom is especially mentioned, because the study of the Torah is to be set aside in order to render the service of loving-kindness to the bride and bridegroom. The Jewish teachers did not encourage celibacy; neither was the cult of virginity considered a desirable element in religion, as was the case in the Christian Church. It is possible that the emphasis laid on the Divine participation in Adam’s nuptials was intended to counteract the attitude of the Church towards marriage; see I Cor. vii. 8; Matt. xix. 10, 12. This section in our book should be compared with the latter part of Chapter XII.; see also Pesiḳta de R. Kahana, p. 172b (end).</i>

Whence do we learn (the duty of) showing loving-kindness to mourners? From the men of Jabesh-Gilead.

Loving-kindness is that extra service of love which is more than one is in duty bound to do to one’s fellow. The latter sums up one’s obligation to any and every human being, namely, to deal justly and truly with all men, and not to hurt anyone. Loving service goes beyond this.

The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, "Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the <i>earth</i>; and the heavens are the work of thy hands" (Ps. 102:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> See T.B.

The “School of Hillel” is the correct reading, as in our MS. The following passage until “Yea, mine hand” is omitted in the printed texts.</i> "These are the generations of the <i>heavens</i> and of the earth" (Gen. 2:4). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, "In the day that the Lord God made <i>earth</i> and heaven" (<i>ibid.</i>). The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, because it is said, "And the <i>heavens</i> and the earth were finished" (<i>ibid.</i> 1). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, "Yea, mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens" (Isa. 48:18). The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, and the earth afterwards, because it is said, "Thus saith the Lord, The <i>heaven</i> is my throne, and the earth is my footstool" (<i>ibid.</i> lxvi. 1). Contention arose between them (<i>i.e.</i> the Schools<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Lit. them.</i>) on this question, until the Holy Spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read “Shekhinah.”</i> rested between them, and they both agreed that both (heavens and earth) were created in one hour and at one moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The Ẓohar, Gen. 17b, has this idea; cf. <i>ibid.</i> 29b. The basis for this third view is afforded by the text Isa. 48:13: “When I called unto them, they stood up together.” The Targum renders this text thus: “Yea, with my word I completed the earth, and with my power I expanded the heavens; I called to them, they stood together.”</i>
What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand and stretched forth the heavens, and He put forth His left hand and founded the earth, as it is said, "Yea, mine <i>hand</i> || hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my <i>right hand</i> hath spread out the heavens:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. and the printed texts end the quotation here.</i> when I called unto them, they stood up <i>together</i>" (<i>ibid.</i> xlviii. 13).

Therefore it is said, "And the heavens and the earth <i>were finished</i>" (Gen. 2:1).
Israel spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of the worlds! Thou didst complete the heavens and the earth with reference to being made, created, and called into existence;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “in the six days of Creation.”</i> let not Thy mercy and loving-kindness be withheld,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> “From us” should probably be added to the text; cf.

This idea is well expressed by the teaching of 4 Ezra 7:135–137. The Bible text, “Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses, for they have been <i>ever of old</i>” (Ps. 25:6), is a parallel to our passage; cf. Targum of this verse, which renders the last words, “for they have been from eternity.” Cf. Gen. Rab. 22:1, Jalḳuṭ, Ps. § 702, and Shocher Ṭob to Ps. 25:8, p. 107a, where the question is discussed. How would mankind have arisen if God had dealt with Adam with strict justice? The grace of God was granted to Adam so as to enable mankind to arise and flourish on earth before the doom of death over-took him. There may be an attempt here to counteract the un-Jewish doctrines of the Pauline school, which taught that, owing to Adam’s sin, God’s grace was withdrawn, and only through the advent of a Second Adam (or Christ) could this Divine grace be restored to the world.

The offering was brought on the 14th, and eaten that day at even, which is the beginning of the 15th. On the other hand, according to our book, <i>supra,</i> p. 52, the creation began on the 25th of Ellul, and Adam was fashioned on the 1st of Tishri; “at the end of days” would be interpreted as the change in the seasons from autumn to spring, when the first-fruits would be brought. Cf. <i>infra,</i> p. 236. Our text is reproduced by Pal. Targ. Gen. 4:3, and Midrash Agadah (ed. Buber), Gen. p. 10, and see <i>ibid.</i> note 6.<br>According to Dr. Büchler (<i>J.Q.R</i>. v. 442), in the first year of the triennial cycle of reading the Torah, a Palestinian custom, on the first day of Passover, Gen. 3:22–iv. 26 was read. Now, the story of the offering of Cain and Abel occurs in Gen. 4:3 ff., and would fall in the Passover week. This explains our text, “the night of the festival of Passover arrived.” See <i>J.E.</i> xii. p. 256a, line 6; Gen. 3, which is quoted there, should probably be Gen. 4<br>Chrysostomus (about 175 <small>C.E.</small>) declared that it was customary to begin reading from Genesis during Lent, <i>i.e.</i> Nisan. This shows that the Early Church followed the old Jewish custom of commencing the reading of the Torah in Nisan, the beginning of the Jewish ecclesiastical new year; see <i>J.E. ibid.</i> p. 257b. For a parallel reading, with slight variants, see Midrash Haggadol, c. 106 f.</i> arrived. Adam called his sons and said to them: In this (night) in the future Israel will bring Paschal offerings, bring ye also (offerings) before your Creator.
(Cain) brought the remnants of his meal of roasted grain, (and) the seed of flax,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> In Tanchuma, Bereshith, § ix., we read: “Some sages say, The remnants of his meal; other sages say, The seed of flax.” See ‘Arukh (ed. Kohut) iv. p. 229b; and cf. Ẓohar, Lev. 87a, where flax is mentioned as the offering of Cain.</i> and Abel brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of their fat, he-lambs, which had not been shorn of their wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The offering was the first-fruit of the animal and the first shearing of the wool.</i> The offering of || Cain was precluded,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> This is also the reading of Oxford MS. (e. 76). The Oxford MS. (O.A. 167) and the first editions read “was abhorred”; cf. Prov. 28:9.</i> and the offering of Abel was acceptable, as it is said, "And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering" (<i>ibid.</i> 4).
Rabbi Joshua ben Ḳorchah said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Heaven forbid ! Never let the offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Wool from Abel’s sheep and flax from Cain’s offering. The two combined would come under the prohibition of Sha’aṭneẓ (cf. Deut. 22:11). Perhaps the prohibition of Kilayim (Lev. 19:19) is also intended. This reference to Adam in connection with Sha’atnez is probably intentional, and is our author’s imitation of Jubilees, which also connects various laws with the Patriarchs. See Tanchuma, Bereshith, <i>loc. cit</i>., for a variant reading, and cf. ‘Arukh, <i>loc. cit., s.v. Kilayim,</i> and see Maimonides, <i>Guide,</i> iii. 37, and <i>J.E.</i> xi. 212 f.</i> of Cain and Abel be mixed up (with one another), even in the weaving of a garment, as it is said, "Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, <i>wool</i> and <i>linen</i> together" (Deut. 22:11).

Rabbi Zadok said: A great hatred<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The Book of Jashar i. 16 says: “And Cain was jealous of his brother on this account.” Josephus. <i>Ant., loc. cit.</i>, also agrees with this view. The first editions read: “<i>Envy</i> and a great <i>hatred</i>.” The Oxford MS. (e. 76) reads: “Envy and hatred.” Test. XII Pat., Benj. vii. 5: “Because forever those who are like unto Cain in <i>envy</i> and <i>hatred</i> of brethren, shall be punished with the same judgment.”</i> entered Cain's heart against his brother Abel, because his offering had been accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> This agrees with Jubilees iv. 2; see also Irenæus, <i>adv. Hær.</i> iv. 3 (<i>A.N.C.L.</i> v. p. 433).</i> Not only (on this account), but also because Abel's twin-sister was the most beautiful of women, and he desired her in his heart. Moreover he said: I will slay Abel my brother, and I will take his twin-sister<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> In Jubilees iv. 1 the wife of Cain is ’Avan, who was born after Abel. See Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan) 1. lxxviii.</i> from him, as it is said, "And it came to pass when they were in the <i>field</i>" (Gen. 4:8). "In the field" means woman, who is compared to a field.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The Oxford MS. (e. 76) adds: “as it is said: ‘But if a man find the damsel that is betrothed in the <i>field</i>’” (Deut. 22:25). The first editions read: “as it is said: ‘For man is the tree of the field’” (Deut. 20:19). Man is the <i>tree,</i> woman is the <i>field.</i> This fine figure has a parallel in Euripides, Orestes, 552 ff. Compare our expression, “<i>Mother</i> Earth.”</i> 
He took the stone and embedded it in the forehead<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan) 1. lxxix. states: “And Cain… took a large stone and smote his brother with it upon his head.” See Pal. Targum, Gen. 4:8, which reproduces our text: “he embedded a stone in his forehead and slew him.” The Book of Jashar i. 25 speaks of “the iron part of the ploughing instrument with which he suddenly smote his brother.” See also Book of the Bee, p. 26.</i> of Abel, and slew him, as it is said, "And Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" (<i>ibid.</i>).
Rabbi Jochanan said: Cain did not know that the secrets are revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Jubilees (iv. 6) states, in connection with Cain’s crime, that “we announce when we come before the Lord our God, all the sin which is committed in heaven and on earth, and in light and in darkness, and everywhere. The 1st eds., Oxford MS. (e. 76) and Gaster MS. add: “What did he do?”</i> He took the corpse of his brother Abel and hid it in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The Oxford MS. (e. 76) reads: “he dug in the earth and hid (or buried) it.” The first editions have almost the same reading. According to our book there was apparently no actual burial by Cain, this was done by Adam and Eve; see <i>infra</i> in this chapter. See Tanchuma, <i>loc. cit</i>., and Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 38. Our Midrash was known to Jerome, <i>Ep. ad Dam.</i> 125. See Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan), <i>loc. cit.</i> According to the Book of Jashar, <i>loc. cit</i>., “Cain rose up and dug a hole in the field, wherein he put the body of his brother, and he turned the dust over him.” Ginzberg, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 66, note 2, deals with this theme; see also Grünbaum, <i>op. cit.</i> pp. 83 f.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: "Where is Abel thy brother?" (<i>ibid.</i> 9). He replied to Him: Sovereign of the world ! A keeper of vineyard and field hast Thou made me.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Abel’s flocks would not be in the fields or vineyards of Cain, and therefore, in the ordinary course of events, he would not have known the whereabouts of his brother.</i> A keeper of my brother Thou hast not made me; as it is said, "Am I my brother's keeper?" (<i>ibid.</i>). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: || "Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?"<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> “Hast thou taken possession” of thy brother? (<i>i.e.</i> his wife and his flock). The later editions read: “I have also heard.”</i> (1 Kings 21:19). "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground" (Gen. 4:10).

Cain spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds ! "My sin is too great to be borne" (<i>ibid.</i> 13), for it has no atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Luria suggests that the last words might be read as a question: “Is there no atonement for it?”</i> This utterance was reckoned to him as repentance,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf.

CHAPTER XXII<br><small>THE FALL OF THE ANGELS</small> [26<small>A</small>. i.]<br>"A<small>ND</small><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “It is written: ‘And Adam,’” etc.</i> Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and he begat in his own likeness after his image" (Gen. 5:3). Hence thou mayest learn that Cain was not of Adam's seed,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra,</i> pp. 150 f., for the statement that Cain was the offspring of Eve and Sammael. The Scripture text seems to have afforded ground for the distinction which the Rabbis and others drew between Cain and Seth: “And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare Cain, and <i>she</i> said, I have acquired a man (child) from the Lord” (Gen. 4:1). Concerning Abel the Bible states, “And she continued to bare his brother Abel” (<i>ibid.</i> 2), without adding any further qualification as in the case of Cain. With reference to Seth the text says, “And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and he begat in <i>his own likeness</i> after <i>his image,</i> and <i>he</i> called his name Seth” (<i>ibid.</i> v. 3). The fifth chapter of Genesis begins afresh the history of Adam’s offspring, but omits all reference to Cain, whose descendants are mentioned in ch. iv. The Pal. Targum to Gen. 5:3 adds: “but before Eve had borne Cain, who was not like to him” (<i>i.e.</i> Adam).</i> nor after his likeness, nor after his image.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The words “likeness and image” are not mentioned in the story of Cain’s birth.

There is probably some confusion in the texts here. “The generations of the righteous” are the offspring of Seth mentioned in Gen. 5; and “the generations of the wicked” are the offspring of Cain enumerated in Gen. 4 See Ẓohar, Gen. 35b, and Gen. Rab. 23:1. Pal.

The fact that our book protests so strongly against the immodest vogue which probably obtained at the period and in the place where the author lived might point to the “origin” of our book, if we could only locate the fact referred to. One is apt to think of the vagaries of certain classes of recluses who belonged to the Christian Church and led solitary lives in the deserts of Egypt. Thus, in the <i>Paradise of the Holy Fathers</i> (ed. Budge, vol. i. p. 242), we read of the Abba Bessarion, who “wandered hither and thither like one possessed; in the season of frost he went naked.” In the Jalḳuṭ quoted above, the passage states (on the text, Deut. 32:21, “They have moved me to jealousy with that which is <i>not God</i>”): “this refers to those who come from Barbary (or Mauretania) who walk naked in the street.” See also Siphrê, Deut. § 320.

See also Ephraim, on the Repentance of Nineveh (E.T. p. 34), for the refusal of the people to repent at the bidding of Noah. The Church Fathers speak of Noah as a preacher. See Methodius, <i>Banquet of Ten Virgins,</i> x. 3. and cf. Hippolytus, <i>A.N.C.L.</i> vi. pp. 492 f.</i> said to them: Turn from your ways and evil deeds, so that He bring not upon you the waters of the Flood, and destroy all the seed of the children of men.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>Rabbinic Philosophy and Ethics,</i> pp. 39 f., and Wisdom x. 4.</i> They said to him: Behold, we will restrain ourselves from multiplying and increasing, so as not to produce the offspring of the children of men.

They seem to indicate that our book was intended originally to be a Midrash on the Torah, and as it is now preserved it is but a fragment of what it might have been. The “Portion” of Genesis is not to be identified with the “Book” of Genesis. The question of the triennial cycle of reading the Torah must also be borne in mind in dealing with our book. The narrative dealing with the Adam legends recurs three times: (1) Chapters III.–V., (2) Chapters XI.–XIV., and (3) Chapters XVIII.–XXII. Thus far in the first twenty-two chapters of the book we have only covered the first six chapters of Genesis. The first two chapters were biographical, and apart from them, the actual Midrash of twenty chapters may be subdivided as follows:<br>Chapter XVI. and XVII. seem out of place in this scheme.<br>A considerable portion of this chapter and the one following occurs in the Midrash Haggadol. Several parallels are to be found in Leḳach Ṭob, Midrash Agadah, and Aggadath Bereshith.</i>

Likewise everyone who walks with the righteous acquires some of their good ways and deeds. Therefore it is said, "He who walketh with wise men shall be wise." "But the companion of fools shall be broken" (<i>ibid.</i>). To what is this comparable?

Sublime Porte for the use of “gate” as a court of government or law.<sup></sup> The MS. seems to have a mistake here; it merely repeats what was stated a few lines previously, without explaining why Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. See Pal. Targum, <i>in loc.</i></i> Because he was afraid of the men of the city, (and did not venture) to act (charitably) by day, but he did so by night. He saw the two angels walking in the street of the city, and he thought that they were wayfarers in the land, and he ran to meet them. He said to them: Come and lodge ye overnight in my house, eat and drink, and ye shall go your way in peace. But the men would not accept this for themselves, and he took them by the hand against their will, and brought them inside his house, as it is said, "And he urged them greatly" (<i>ibid.</i> 8).

All day the oxen lick it and it decreases up to her feet, and in the morning (the pillar of salt) grows afresh, as it is said: ‘And his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt’” (Gen. 19:26). In the days of Maimonides all trace of the pillar had been lost. The Book of Jashar (xix. 54) reads: “And the oxen which stood in that place daily licked up the salt to the extremities of their feet, and in the morning it would spring forth afresh and they again licked it up, unto this day.” For a parallel Christian Midrash, see “A Strain of Sodom” in <i>A.N.C.L.</i> xviii. p. 230.

See also Sirach (li. x.*) in <i>A. and P.</i> i. p. 515. The last chapter of our book probably ended with the words printed in the “contents of the chapters” in the Venice edition (1544) and in later editions thus: “Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest the sick of Thy people Israel.” This is the eighth benediction of the Shemoneh ‘Esreh.

To all the prophets He was revealed in a vision,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “he appeared in a vision of the night.” Instead of reading “of the night,” Luria holds that the reading should be, “or in a revelation.” This passage was possibly the authority used by Maimonides in dealing with the subject of prophecy; see his Hilkhoth Jesodê Ha-Torah vi. 2 and 6. For Luria’s suggested reading see Lev. Rab. 1:4. On “vision and revelation” see Gen.

Targum, <i>in loc.,</i> and Gen. Rab., <i>loc. cit.</i></i> in a revelation and in a vision. Whence do we know of the revelation? Because it is said, "And the Lord <i>appeared</i> unto him by the oaks of Mamre" (<i>ibid.</i> xviii. 1). Whence do we know of the vision? Because it is said, "After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a <i>vision</i>" (<i>ibid.</i> xv. 1). He said to him: Abraham !

Targum (Gen. 15:1) interpret the fear of Abraham as implying that his victory was his entire recompense for his life’s devotion to the cause of God.

Rabbi Joshua said: Abraham took his sword and divided them, each one into two parts, as it is said, "And he took him all these, and he divided them in the midst" (Gen. 15:10). Were it not for the fact that he divided them, the world would not have been able to exist, but because he divided them, he weakened their strength, and he brought each part against its corresponding part, as it is said, "And he laid each half over against the other" (<i>ibid.</i>). And the young pigeon he left alive, as it is said, "But the bird he divided not" (<i>ibid.</i>). Hence thou mayest learn that there was not any other bird there except a young pigeon.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “Hence thou mayest learn that the word Zippôr in the Torah means only a young pigeon.”</i> The bird of prey came down upon them || to scatter them and to destroy them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Pal.

Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, that his children should not be enslaved by these four kingdoms. A deep sleep fell upon him, and he slept, as it is said, "A deep sleep fell upon Abram" (Gen. 15:12). Does then a man lie down and sleep, and yet be able to pray?

Whence do we know this concerning the four (terms) applying to man? (Namely,) the uncircumcision of the ear, the uncircumcision of the lips, the uncircumcision of the heart, and the uncircumcision of the flesh. Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the ear? Because it is said, "Behold, their ear is uncircumcised" (Jer. 6:10). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the lips? Because it is said, "For I am of uncircumcised lips" (Ex. 6:12). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the heart? Because it is said, "Circumcise the foreskin of your heart" (Deut. 10:16); and (the text) says, "For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart" (Jer. 9:26).

And "all the nations are uncircumcised" in all the four cases, and "all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."

See also Book of the Bee, xxv. p. 43.</i> and when they reached Zophim they saw the glory of the Shekhinah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> This passage is of considerable interest. We are in the domain of Philonic interpretation of the Bible. Thus Clement of Alexandria, under the influence of Philo’s allegorical interpretation, says on the text, Gen. 22:3, 4: “Abraham, when he came to the place which God told him of on the third day, looking up, saw the place afar off. For the first day is that which is constituted by the sight of good things; and the second is the soul’s best desire; on the third, the mind perceives spiritual things” (<i>Strom.</i> v. 11).<br>Our book identifies the place (<span>מקום</span>) with the Shekhinah, just as Philo does (<i>De Somniis</i>, i. M. i. 638, C.W. iii. p. 213); see Gen. Rab. 56:1 f.; and cf. the valuable note in Weinstein’s <i>Zur Genesis der Agada</i>, p. 88. The representation of the Shekhinah as a “Pillar of Fire” corresponds with Philo’s identification of the Logos with the “Pillar of Cloud,” which at night became the “Pillar of Fire” in the wilderness, leading God’s people to the Holy Land; see <i>Hellenism and Christianity</i>, p. 25, note. According to Jubilees xviii. 4: “And he came to a <i>well of water</i> and he said to his young men, ‘ Abide ye here with the ass.’” Does our author intentionally vary this by substituting the “cloud” for the well?</i> resting upon the top of the mountain, as it is said, "On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw <i>the place</i> afar off" (Gen. 22:4). What did he see? (He saw) a pillar of fire standing from the earth to the heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add here: “He said to his son Isaac: My son! dost thou see anything upon one of these mountains?

Chullin, 139b, the name of Moses is mentioned, as also the names of Mordecai, Esther, and Haman, all these names being hinted at in the Torah. Luria observes that Cyrus (Is. 44:28 and xlv. 1) should have been mentioned in the list of people named before their birth. This fact would not warrant the inference that all these people were pre-existent. This reasoning is, however, often applied to the name of the Messiah, as though it meant that the Messiah pre-existed because his name was named before his birth; see <i>Hellenism and Christianity</i>, p. 17.</i> and they are: Isaac, Ishmael, Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “our Rabbi,” or “our teacher.”</i> Solomon, Josiah, and King Messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “the name of the Messiah.” The Amsterdam edition reads: “our Messiah.” The first editions add: “May the Holy One, blessed be He, cause him to come speedily in our days.”</i>

Cheth (the third letter points to) the <i>eighth</i> (day), for he was circumcised on the eighth day, as it is said, "And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old" (<i>ibid.</i> xxi. 4). Ḳuf (the fourth letter of the name marks) the <i>hundred</i> (years), for his father was an hundred years old (at Isaac's birth), as it is said, "And Abraham was an hundred years old" (<i>ibid.</i> 5).

CHAPTER XXXV<br><small>THE VISION OF JACOB AT BETHEL</small> [45<small>B</small> i.]<br>"B<small>ETTER</small> is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof" (Eccles. 7:8).

The final blessings were the blessings of the foundation of the world, and in them there is no (interruption),<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> There is a lacuna in the MS.; the space is just sufficient for the word which occurs in the Oxford MS. or in the first editions, and which means “interruption.”</i> either in this world or in the world to come, as it is said, "And God Almighty bless thee" (<i>ibid.</i> xxviii. 3). And he further added unto him the blessing of Abraham, || as it is said, "And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> In the MS. the quotation ends here; it is continued in the first editions.</i> to thee and to thy seed with thee"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse continues: “that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings.”</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 4).

"Better is the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit" (<i>ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “‘Better is slowness to anger than the proud in spirit.’ ‘Better is slowness to anger,’ this (saying),” etc. The Oxford MS. agrees with our text.</i> "Better is the patient in spirit"—this (saying) is applicable<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Read <span>אמור כיעקכ</span>.</i> to our father Jacob, for every day he was patient in spirit, and he spake all kinds of words of entreaty.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. reads “Pangeoth,” so also in first editions. Jastrow corrects this and reads Pagneoth (entreaty); see <i>T.D.</i> 1135a; his reference to our book on 1186a must be corrected so as to read Chapter XXXV. According to Luria the reading should be: “Every day he ate plain food.” The Oxford MS. has: “Every day he ate food which was disqualified” (for the altar).</i> (The words) "than the proud in spirit" (<i>ibid.</i>) refer to the wicked Esau, because every day he was eating the flesh of that which he had hunted. Owing to his pride he did not give any of his food to Jacob. Once he went out to hunt but he did not meet with any success. He saw Jacob eating lentil food, and he desired this in his heart, and he said to him: "Let me gulp down, I pray thee, some of that red pottage" (Gen. 25:30). Jacob said to him: Thou camest forth red at thy birth from thy mother; (now) thou dost desire to eat (this) <i>red</i> food; therefore he called his name "Edom" (red), as it is said, "And Esau said to Jacob" (<i>ibid.</i>).
Rabbi Eliezer said: Lentils are the food of mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See T.B. Baba Bathra, 16b; Pal. Targ. Gen. 25:29, and Gen. Rab. 63:14. Cf.

Moreover, the lentils by their round form typify the going around of trouble and loss in this world. (See <i>J.E.</i> vii. 682.)</i> and on account of the exile of Israel. Hence thou mayest learn that the children of Esau will not fall until a remnant from Israel shall come and give to the children of Esau lentil food in mourning and sorrow, and will take away from them the dominion of the kingdom and the birthright, which Jacob acquired from (Esau) by oath, as it is said, "And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him" (<i>ibid.</i> 33).

CHAPTER XXXVII<br><small>JACOB AND THE ANGEL</small> [49<small>A</small>. ii.]<br>"As if a man did flee from a lion || and a bear met him" (Amos 5:19). The "lion" means Laban, who pursued (Jacob) like a lion to destroy<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> In Jalḳuṭ, Amos, <i>in loc.</i>, the reading is “to tear in pieces”; cf. Ps. 7:2, and see Midrash Haggadol, c. 524.</i> his life. The "bear" refers to Esau, who stood by the way like a bear bereaved by man,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “like a bereaved bear, he came.”</i> to slay the mother with the children. The lion is shamefaced, the bear is not shamefaced.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> Laban not only did not molest Jacob, but admitted that he was unable to do so. Esau made no such admission.</i> Jacob arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all the Universe ! Hast Thou not spoken thus unto me, "Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee"? (Gen. 31:3).
And behold, Esau, the evil one, has now come to slay me; but I fear him and he does not fear Thee. Hence (the sages) say: Do not fear an executive officer or a ruler, but (fear) a man who has no fear of Heaven. (Esau) stood by the way like a bear bereaved by man, to slay mother and child.
What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent an angel<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> See Gen.

As soon as the dawn appeared, the angel said to him: Let me go, for the time has arrived when I must stand<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> In Heaven; cf. Isa. 6:3 for the song of the angels. The same idea occurs in the New Testament; see Luke ii. 13. See also Midrash Haggadol, c. 511 f.</i> to sing<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “to minister.”</i> and to chant praises before the Holy One, blessed be He. But Jacob did not wish to let him go. What did the angel do? He began to sing and to chant praises from the earth, || and when the angels (on high) heard the voice of the angel who was singing and praising from the earth, they said: Because of the honour of the righteous (one) do we hear<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. reads: “stand.” The first editions read: “hear.”</i> the voice of the angel who is singing and praising from the earth; and concerning him the verse says, "From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> glory to the righteous" (Isa. 24:16).
Again the angel said to him: "Let me go" (Gen. 32:26). Jacob answered him: I will not let thee go until thou hast blessed me;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “as it is said: ‘I will not let thee go except thou bless me’” (Gen. 32:26).</i> and he blessed him, as it is said, "And he blessed him there" (<i>ibid.</i> 29). Again he said to him: "Let me go" (<i>ibid.</i> 26). He answered him: I will not let thee go until thou tellest me what thy name<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> See also Hos. 12:4.</i> is. And (the angel) called his name Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The second half of this sentence is omitted by the Prague edition.</i> like his own name, for his own name was called Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> See Gen. Rab. 78:3, and Tosaphoth on T.B. Synhedrin, 37b, catchword “From the corner”; cf. Num. Rab. 10:6. The idea of this Haggadah seems to be: the angel is named according to the mission entrusted to him by God. Here it was to announce the ideal for Jacob to pursue, namely, that he was to live as Israel, the warrior of God, destined in his seed to do battle with everything which opposes the establishment on earth of the Kingdom of God. Therefore the angel is named Israel. Israel must fear neither man nor angel; he has prevailed over the powers above man, and need fear only God. See Judg. 13:3 ff. for the case of the angel and Manoah, where the same principle obtains. The angel is called <span>פלאי</span>, which suggests <span>הפלאה</span>, “the separation” involved in the Nazirate of Samson. It may also be that the angel was the guardian angel of Israel and therefore bore the name “Israel.”</i> Jacob wished to prevail over the angel, and to throw him down upon the earth. What did the angel do? He took hold of the sinew of the hip, which was upon the hollow of Jacob's thigh, and he lifted the sinew of his hip (out of its place), and it became like the fat<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The fat around the sinew of the thigh is prohibited to the Israelite; see T.B. Chullin, 89b, 92b, and 100b, and Maimonides, <i>Maakhaloth Asuroth</i>, viii. 1.</i> of the dead. Therefore the children of Israel are forbidden to eat of the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the animal's thigh, as it is said, "Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh" (<i>ibid.</i> 82).
Jacob wished to cross the ford of the Jabbok, and he was detained<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “and to stay there.”</i> there. The angel said to him: Didst thou not speak thus<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “unto me.” The Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 132, omits “unto me.”</i>—"Of all that thou shalt give me<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. and the first editions omit the first part of the verse.</i> I will surely give a tenth unto thee" (<i>ibid.</i> xxviii. 22)?

The angel said: Didst thou not speak thus—"<i>Of all</i> that thou shalt give me<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> I will surely give a tenth unto thee" (<i>ibid.</i>)? Behold, thou hast sons. Thou hast not given a tithe of them. What did Jacob do? He put apart the four firstborn<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The first-born are excluded from the operation of the law of tithe; see T.B. Bekhoroth, 53b.</i> children of the four mothers, and eight children remained. He began (to count) from Simeon, and finished with Benjamin, who was still in his mother's womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> That means, eight children. Two more were required, and starting to count <i>ab initio</i> we find that Levi is the tenth. See Jubilees xxxii. 3, where Levi is chosen as the tithe: “Jacob counted his sons from (Benjamin), and Levi fell to the <i>portion of the Lord</i>.” Pal. Targum, <i>loc. cit.</i>, agrees with our author, but Gen. Rab. 70:7, and Tanchuma, Re’êh, § xiv., offer another calculation. Both Jubilees and our author fix the choice of Levi at the time when “Rachel became pregnant with her son Benjamin” (Jubilees xxxii. 3).</i> Again he began (to count) from Simeon, and he included Benjamin, and Levi was reckoned as the tithe, holy to God, as it is said, "The tenth shall be holy unto the Lord" (Lev. 27:82).
Rabbi Ishmael said: All firstborns are required to have a tithe taken (only) when they fall under the observation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> According to Luria we should read: “When they do <i>not</i> fall under the observation of the eye.”</i> of the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>i.e.</i> guarded so that the owner derives no benefit from them; see T.B. Bekhoroth, 9b, and T.B.

Dr. Charles’ note on p. 192 of <i>Jubilees</i> must be modified accordingly. See also Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 133.</i> and concerning him the Scripture says, "The tenth shall be holy unto the Lord" (<i>ibid.</i>).
Michael, the angel, descended and took Levi, and brought him up before the Throne of Glory,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> See Test.

When Jacob passed to come into the land of Canaan, Esau came to him from Mount Seir in violent anger, contriving to slay him, as it is said, "The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth" (Ps. 37:12). Esau said: I will not slay Jacob with bow and arrows, but with my mouth and with my teeth will I slay him, and suck his blood, as it is said, "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept" (Gen. 33:4). Do not read <i>vayishakêhu</i> (and he kissed him), but (read) <i>vayishkêhu</i> (and he bit him). But Jacob's neck became like ivory, and concerning him the Scripture says, "Thy neck is like the tower of ivory" (Cant. 7:4). The wicked (Esau's) teeth became blunt,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> See Cant. Rab. to Cant. 7:5, Gen. Rab. 54:9, and Midrash Haggadol, c. 517. The New Testament speaks of Esau as “a fornicator or profane person” (Heb. xii. 16): “For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears” (<i>ibid.</i> 17).</i> and when the wicked one saw that the desire of his heart was not realized he began to be angry, and to gnash with his teeth, as it is said, "The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away" (Ps. 112:10).
Jacob took all the tithe of his possessions and sent it by the hand of his servants, and gave it to Esau, saying to them: Say ye || to him, "Thus saith thy servant Jacob" (Gen. 32:4). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob ! That which was holy hast thou made profane? He replied to Him: Sovereign of all worlds ! I flatter the wicked, so that he should not slay me.

The disciples of the Founder of Christianity are commanded to be “wise as serpents and harmless as doves” (<i>ibid.</i> x. 16), as they were being sent forth “as sheep in the midst of wolves” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Esau said to him: O my brother, I have enough; as it is said,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> See Jalḳuṭ, <i>loc. cit.</i></i> "And Esau said, I have enough" (Gen. 33:9).

Nay, but I have said, "And the <i>elder</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> This in Hebrew is “Rab.”</i> shall serve the younger" (Gen. 25:23); and yet thou hast said, "Thy servant Jacob" (<i>ibid.</i> xxxii. 4).

Therefore Jacob said to him (Esau): "Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant" (<i>ibid.</i> xxxiii. 14).

The form of the ban, and the prohibition of eating the bread of the Samaritans, have been exhaustively considered by Dr. Büchler in <i>R.É.J</i>. xliii. pp. 50 ff., where the following results are stated: (1) The form of the ban and its accompanying circumstances—(<i>a</i>) children as witnesses, (<i>b</i>) scrolls of law to sanctify the pronouncement, and (<i>c</i>) sounding of the Shofar—tally with the practice known to the Geonim of Babylon in the ninth century (<i>e.g</i>. Paltoi; see Chemdah Genuẓah, No. xxii., and cf. ‘Arukh, <i>s.v</i>. <span>הסת</span>, iii. 229a; see also Hekhaloth Rab., ed. Jellinek, <i>B.H.M</i>. iii. p. 84). The prohibition of eating the <i>bread</i> of the Samaritans mentioned by our author does not find any support in the Talmudic literature (see T.J. Shebi‘ith vii. 38b, line 69), but is “an institution of the Geonic age” (p. 64). The decree says that Samaritans could not be received as proselytes. Where the texts of the Talmud speak of <span>כותי</span>, “Samaritan,” we have probably to read <span>נכרי</span>. There was a sect who were put on this footing by the Gaon Naṭronai (Teshuboth Ha-Geonim, Sha‘arê Zedeḳ, p. 24a, Nos. 7 and 27). The Halakhoth Gedoloth (ed. Hildesheimer, 443) states that “Cutheans, Seboneans, and <i>Samaritans</i> are not to be received as proselytes.” This again appears in the Tanna de bê Elijahu Ẓuṭṭa (p. 169). The Karaites in the ninth century mutilated the Bible text, and in their reading agreed with the Samaritans (p. 67). In other words the literature of the Samaritans of the ninth century exercised a baneful influence in creating sects opposed to orthodox Judaism. Hence the ban against them. Moreover, the word for ban (<span>חרם</span>) does not occur in the Talmud (B. Shebu‘oth, 35b–36a), but is common in the Geonic period. On the oath or ban see Eth. Enoch vi. 4 ff., where Mount Hermon is mentioned; Dr. Büchler sees here a reference to <span>חרם</span>. Is there any connection, he asks, between Enoch and our book here? That Jubilees was known to the Geonim has been shown by Epstein, <span>מקרמוניות היהורים</span>, page vii, and also the fact that many of the characteristics of the Enoch literature have their parallels in the Geonic literature (see <i>Z.D.M.G</i>. vii. (1853) p. 249) has been established.</i> They have no || portion in the resurrection of the dead,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The Dositheans, like the Sadducees, denied the future life.

He kept (the oath) and did (accordingly), as it is said, "And he said, Swear unto me" (<i>ibid.</i>). And all the mighty men of the kingdom went up with him to bury him, and to show loving-kindness to Jacob his father, as it is said, "And Joseph went up to bury his father" (<i>ibid.</i> l. 7).

Chushim, the son of Dan, had defective hearing and speech,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> See the Book of Jashar, ch. lvi., for a parallel account of the legend, which practically agrees with <i>P.R.E</i>. According to Charles the legend in the Book of Jashar “has borrowed its materials from the Midrash in Josippon”; see <i>Jubilees</i>, ed. Charles, p. 215, note. Charles refers to Bousset, <i>Z.f.N.T. Wissensch</i>., 1900, p. 205. In this connection the legend of the wars between the sons of Jacob and Esau with his sons in Jubilees xxxvii., xxxviii., the Testament of Judah (Test. XII Pat.) ix., and Jeraḥmeel, pp. 80–87, must be considered very briefly. According to Charles, “the oldest form of the legend is found in Jubilees and in the Test. Jud. 9; the next oldest is the Jalḳuṭ and Chronicles of Jeraḥmeel, and the latest is the Book of Jashar” (<i>Jubilees</i>, p. 215). The account in the Book of Jashar contains two parts: (1) the death of Esau by the hands of Chushim, son of Dan, at the burial of Jacob. This part of the legend is taken directly from our book, which was also the source used by Pal. Targum on Gen. 50:13. The source of our Midrash was T.B. Soṭah, <i>loc. cit</i>. Then (2) the account of the wars between the sons of Esau and the sons of Jacob which the Book of Jashar gives is undoubtedly connected with the account of Zepho, son of Eliphas, and Æneas of Africa, given in the history of Josippon. Now the Chronicles of Jeraḥmeel agree with the Book of Jubilees in making Jacob the slayer of his brother Esau, and they agree in fixing the occasion of the conflict at the mourning for Leah. According to Beer, <i>Das Buck der Jubiläen</i>, pp. 4 ff., the original form of the legend was that Judah slew Esau at the burial of Isaac. The death of Esau at the hands of Judah is mentioned in T. J. Kethuboth 1. 5 (p. 25c); T.J. Giṭṭin 5:6 (p. 47a); Siphrê, Deut. § 348; Shocher Ṭob, Ps. 18:40 (sect. 32); see also Jalḳuṭ, Gen. § 162; and Jalḳuṭ, Samuel, § 163. The later form of the legend is preserved in T.B. Soṭah, <i>loc. cit</i>., which attributes the death of Esau to Chushim, who was deaf and dumb, at the burial of Jacob. Jalḳuṭ, Gen. <i>loc. cit</i>., combines both forms of the legend. Jalḳuṭ, Pss. § 776, agrees with our book in the details of the death of Esau. Beer draws attention to the fact that the Jews of Palestine in the time of Hadrian (<i>c</i>. 135 <small>C.E.</small>) attributed the fierce hatred on the part of the Romans to the belief that Judah, the forefather of the Jews, had slain Esau, the forefather of the Romans, who were identified with the Edomites descended from Esau. In order to remove the “historical” foundation for this hostility, later forms of the legend transferred the deed to an irresponsible person, Chushim, whose descendants, the tribe of Dan, had long since disappeared from the land of Israel, having been carried away into exile, and, as some of the Rabbis taught, lost for all time. Jubilees holds to the original legend, owing to the opposition which it represents to the orthodox Rabbinic traditions of Palestine obtaining in the period prior to and following the rise of Christianity. Pirkê de R. Eliezer is aware of the teaching of Jubilees, and tries to correct and refute it on all fundamental points of controversy. This is sometimes done as strikingly by omission as by a variant doctrine, or story.</i> and he said to them: Why are we sitting here? He was pointing (to Esau) with his finger. They said to him: Because this man will not let us bury our father Jacob. What did he do? He drew his sword and cut off Esau's head with the sword, and took the head into the Cave of Machpelah. And they sent his body to the land of his possession, to Mount Seir.
What did Isaac do? He grasped the head of Esau and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said: Sovereign of all the universe ! Let mercy be shown<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The words are borrowed from Isa. 26:10.</i> to this wicked one, for he had not learnt all the precepts of the Torah, as it is said, "Let favour be shewed to the wicked,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> The MS. and the first editions omit the first part of the verse.</i> yet will he not learn righteousness" (Isa. 26:10).

Israel was called God’s firstborn. When God bade Pharaoh to send forth His firstborn son Israel, he refused. In return God smote his firstborn. The Jewish teaching as to the Divine method of retribution is well expressed by the Book of Wisdom xi. 16, which refers to the plagues thus: “That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, thereby he is punished.” Cf. Revelation of Peter, 7 and 9, for a parallel view of retribution. As a parallel to our text, the following verse from Wisdom xviii. 5 seems appropriate: “But them who plotted to slay the infants of the holy ones (and when a single child had been exposed and saved) Thou to convict them didst deprive of the multitude of their children, and all together didst destroy them in a mighty flood.” Jubilees xlviii. 14 says: “A thousand strong and brave men perished for one infant whom they had cast into the river.” For further illustrations see Goodrick, <i>Wisdom,</i> p. 352.</i> Israel went forth,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions add: “from Egypt.”</i> what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do?

The Venice edition agrees on the whole with this text, but adds: “there will not be any more new misfortunes.” R.S. b. Adereth reads “evil” instead of “plague.” In the Messianic Kingdom there will be neither sin nor misfortune.</i> in the future will all the host of heaven fade away like a vine and a fig tree, and they will again be renewed before Him to make known that there is passing away (which) does not (really) pass away.

All the kings of the earth heard (thereof) and they were astonished, for they had not seen anyone like him from the day when the world was created. And whence do we know that he was delivered from the fiery furnace? Because it is said, "And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of the <i>furnace</i> of the Chaldees" (Gen. 15:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The next quotation is omitted by the first editions.</i> Another text says, "Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> Abram, and broughtest him forth out of the furnace of the Chaldees" (Neh. 9:7).

He dried up<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “He caused the ducts of the breasts of their wives to become dried up”; cf. Gen.

"All<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse (Ezek. 17:24) is now expounded allegorically.</i> the trees of the field shall know" (<i>ibid.</i>); this (expression) refers to the nations of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> The later editions read: “the worshippers of fire.”</i> "That I the Lord have brought down the high tree" (<i>ibid.</i>) (this refers to Nimrod<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> “This refers to Nimrod” is omitted by our MS., but it occurs in the first editions.

The third wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and the earth were created there never was a man upon whom grey hairs were sprinkled<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Hos. 7:9 for a similar expression; cf.

Because it is said, "And Abraham was old, well <i>stricken in age</i>" (<i>ibid.</i> xxiv. 1).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Gen. 15:15.</i>
Rabbi Levitas, a man of Jamnia, said:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “Like a crown which is the glory on the king’s head, so are grey hairs,” etc.</i> Like a diadem which belongs to the head of the king, so are grey hairs beauty and glory to old men, as it is said, "The glory of young men is their strength,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> In the MS. the quotation begins here; the first editions read the entire verse.</i> and the beauty of old men is the hoary head" (Prov. 20:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf. also Prov. 16:31: “The hoary head is a crown of glory; it shall be found in the way of righteousness”; cf.

See T.B. Berakhoth, 57b.</i> for the death of the world was changed into light, as it is said, "His neesings flash forth light" (Job 41:18).
The fifth wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and the earth were created, the waters of the sea had not been changed into dry land until Israel went forth from Egypt and passed over on dry land in the midst of the sea, as it is said, "But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea" (Ex. 15:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions omit the quotation.</i> All the kings of the earth heard (thereof) and trembled, because there had been nothing like it from the day when the world had been created, as it is said, "The people heard, they trembled" (<i>ibid.</i> 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra</i>, p. 330.</i>
The sixth wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and earth were created, the sun,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions omit: “the sun.”</i> the moon, and the stars and the constellations were ascending to give light upon the earth, and they did not come into contact<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> See Jalḳuṭ, Josh. § 22, and Shocher Ṭob on Ps. 19:9, p. 84a.</i> with one another until Joshua came and fought the battles of Israel.

Perhaps the idea is that of casting spells to force the constellations to oppose the enemy; cf. for this notion Judg. 5:20: “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought <i>against</i> Sisera.” See also Jalḳuṭ, Josh., <i>loc. cit</i>.</i> the constellations to come<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> The first editions read: “coming,” present participle, and not the infinitive as in the MS.</i> against Israel.

Whence do we know that one made unclean through a corpse (needs) seven (days of purification)?

Whence<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The rest of the paragraph is wanting in the text of this last chapter of <i>P.R.E</i>. published by Wertheimer in <i>Bottê Midrashoth</i>, iii. pp. 29–34.</i> do we know that the (bridal) banquet (lasts) seven days?

And Jacob did so, and fulfilled<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> her week" (<i>ibid.</i> xxix. 27, 28).

Rabbi said: They<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> The Israelites.</i> slandered God again and said, We were dwelling in the land of Egypt in ease and contentment, but the Holy One, blessed be He, and Moses have brought us forth from Egypt to die in the wilderness, as it is said, "And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?" (<i>ibid.</i> xxi. 5). What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do unto them? He sent against them fiery serpents which bit and killed them, as it is said, "And the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died" (<i>ibid.</i> 6). Moses beheld the misfortune of Israel, and he arose and prayed on their behalf. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Moses! Make thee a serpent of copper like that serpent<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>supra</i>, p. 428, and cf. Tanchuma (ed. Buber), Num. p. 63 f.</i> || which spoke slander betwixt Adam and his helpmate, and place it on a high place.

Moses made a serpent of copper and set it up in a high place, and every man who had been bitten turned his heart to his Father who is in heaven, and gazed at that serpent, forthwith he became restored to health, as it is said, "And it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> The quotation ends here in the MS.</i> any man, when he looked at the serpent of copper, he lived" (<i>ibid.</i> 9); and it also says, "If the serpent bite without enchantment, then is there no advantage in the master of the tongue" (Eccles. 10:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"> The expression, “the master of the tongue,” seems to point to the slanderer, whose condemnation forms the theme of our chapter.

Rabbi José said: If a man hire a workman who is zealous, and (when) he discharges him should he give him his wages in full; what favour does he give him?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The labourer who has fully earned his wages.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were zealous workmen. Thou gavest to them wages in full, of their own (earnings) Thou didst give them.

Nathan, the text of which corresponds to the Recension “A” in Dr. Schechter’s edition. In a future work, I hope to translate the chapters claimed to belong to <i>P.R.E</i>., and published by Horowitz, and later by Friedmann in his edition of the Tanna de bê Elijahu.<br>I have a very humble favour to ask at the hands of my readers. Will they kindly let me know whether they can suggest any variations in my translation and offer any parallels from Jewish and Christian and Mohammedan, as well as from classical literature, in illustration of the various points arising out of this Midrash? I am painfully aware that this work is in a very crude condition, and that there are many errors, but in spite of all its blemishes I sincerely hope that something of value may be found in this volume, which has cost the author very many hours of toil snatched away from leisure and holiday.</i>
