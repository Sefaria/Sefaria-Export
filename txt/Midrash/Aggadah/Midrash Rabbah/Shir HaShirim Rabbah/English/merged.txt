Parasha 1



Chapter 1

<b>“The Song of Songs that is Solomon’s” (Song of Songs 1:1).</b><br>Prologue of the Sages. “The Song of Songs,” that is what [the verse] written by Solomon states: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings, he will not stand before dark ones” (Proverbs 22:29). “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor” – This is Joseph, in whose regard it is written: “He came into the house to perform his labor [and none of the men of the house were there, in the house]” (Genesis 39:11). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: It was a day of disgrace and manure,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is referring here to Egyptian ritual worship, and uses these words to describe it in order to demean such idolatry.</i> and a day of theater. Rabbi Neḥemya says it was a day of theater in honor of the Nile. Everyone went to see, and he entered to perform his labor to calculate the accounts of his master.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas says in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Abba: Anyone who serves his master properly is set free. From where do we derive this? From Joseph. Because he served his master properly, he was set free. Therefore, “he will stand before kings,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated: “Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him from the dungeon” (Genesis 41:14). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Potiphar, as the Holy One blessed be He blinded his eyes and castrated him.
Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent…,” this is Moses in the labor of [constructing] the Tabernacle; therefore, “he will stand before kings,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated “Arise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh” (Exodus 8:16). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Yitro. Rabbi Neḥemya said: You have rendered the sacred profane; rather, “he will stand before kings,” this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days” (Exodus 34:28). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated: “There was a thick darkness [in the entire land of Egypt]” (Exodus 10:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh is referred to as dark because his land became dark. Alternatively, the reference is due to the fact that Moses announced that he would no longer come to see Pharaoh after the plague of darkness (see Exodus 10:29).</i>
Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor…,” these are the righteous who are engaged in the labor of the Holy One blessed be He; therefore, “he will stand before kings,” as they stand resolute in the Torah, as it is stated: “Through me kings reign” (Proverbs 8:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is stated from the persective of the Torah. Thus, one who stands resolute in Torah is able to stand before kings.</i> “He will not stand before dark ones,” these are the wicked, as it is stated: “Their deeds are in the dark” (Isaiah 29:15), and it is written: “Let their way be dark and slippery” (Psalms 35:6).
Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor,” this is Rabbi Ḥanina. They said: One time, he saw the residents of his city taking up burnt offerings and peace offerings [to the Temple in Jerusalem]. He said: All of them are taking peace offerings up to Jerusalem and I am not taking up anything. What shall I do? Immediately, he went to the wilderness of his city, in the ruins of his city.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">An area of the city that had become ruins and was therefore uninhabited (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> He found a particular stone there and he went and smoothed it, chiseled it, and painted it. He said: ‘I take it upon myself to take it up to Jerusalem.’ He sought to hire laborers, he said to them: ‘Will you take this stone up to Jerusalem for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us one hundred gold pieces as our wages and we will take your stone to Jerusalem for you.’ He said to them: ‘From where do I have one hundred gold pieces, or [even] fifty to give to you?’ He was unable to find [enough money] at that time, and immediately they went on their way. Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He summoned for him five angels in the guise of men. They said to him: ‘Rabbi, give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take your stone up to Jerusalem for you, provided that you give your hand [and carry it] with us.’ He gave his hand and they found themselves standing in Jerusalem. He sought to give them their wages but did not find them. The incident came to the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This was the seat of the Great Sanhedrin. He sought direction in what he should do with the money since he was unable to locate the laborers.</i> They said to him: ‘Our rabbi, it appears that ministering angels took the stone to Jerusalem for you.’ Immediately, he gave the Sages those wages with which he hired the angels.
Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor,” this is Solomon son of David. “He will stand before kings,” as he was diligent in the construction of the Temple; that is what is written: “He built it in seven years” (I Kings 6:38), and another verse says: “Solomon built his palace in thirteen years” (I Kings 7:1). Is the result that the construction of Solomon’s palace was finer and more elaborate than the construction of the Temple? Rather, this is what they said: In the construction of his palace, he was indolent; in the construction of the Temple he was diligent and was not indolent. Huna [said] in the name of Rav Yosef: If everyone assists the king, all the more so that everyone assists for the honor of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, even spirits, even demons, and even ministering angels.<br>Yitzḥak son of Rav Yehuda bar Yeḥezkel said: It is written: “I have built [<i>bano baniti</i>] an abode for You” (I Kings 8:13); I have built for you a built building.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is quoting Solomon as saying that he put up a building, the Temple, that was actually built by itself.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: “The House that they were building,” is not written here, but rather: “The House, in its construction” (I Kings 6:7), [indicating that] it was built on its own, as it is stated: “It was built of whole stones that were transported” (I Kings 6:7). “Built” is not written here, but rather, “it was built [<i>nivna</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the term <i>nivna</i> as a reflexive term, indicating that it built itself.</i> This teaches that the stone would lift itself and be placed on the row of stones. Rav said: Do not be astonished by this. What is written below? “One stone was brought and placed at the entrance to the den” (Daniel 6:18). Were there stones in Babylon?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Babylon has only lowlands and soft earth, and no mountains.</i> Rather, it flew from the Land of Israel at that moment and came and settled at the entrance to the pit. Rav Huna said, in the name of Rav Yosef: An angel descended in the image of a stone lion and settled at the entrance of the pit. That is what in written: “My God sent His angel and closed the lions’ mouths” (Daniel 6:23). Do not be astonished; if in honor of that righteous one [Daniel], it is written: “One stone was brought,” in honor of the Holy One blessed be He<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the building of the Temple.</i> all the more so.<br>“He will stand before kings”—he will stand before kings of the Torah. “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is the group of the wicked. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When [the Sages] voted, and concluded that three kings and four commoners do not have a portion in the World to Come, they sought to add Solomon to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This was due to what is described in I Kings 11:1–10.</i> A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Do not touch My anointed ones” (Psalms 105:15). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Moreover, he is listed as the head of a [royal] genealogical lineage, as it is stated: “Reḥavam the son of Solomon [reigned in Jerusalem]” (I Kings 14:21). Rabbi Yudan bar Simon said: Moreover, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed these three books: Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes.
That is what is written: “Your sons will be in the stead of your fathers” (Psalms 45:17). You find a righteous person begetting a righteous person, a wicked person begetting a wicked person, a righteous person begetting a wicked person, and a wicked person begetting a righteous person. Each of them has [an allusion in] the Bible, has [an allusion in a popular] proverb, and has [an allusion in] common parlance. A righteous person begetting a righteous person has [an allusion in] the Bible and has [an allusion in] a proverb. The Bible, as it is written: “Your sons will be in the stead of your fathers.” It has a proverb: A scion<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The scion (a shoot or twig of a plant used to form a graft) of a fig tree.</i> that established a fig tree. A wicked person begetting a wicked person has [an allusion in] the Bible, has [an allusion in] a proverb, and has [an allusion in] common parlance. The Bible, as it is written: “Behold, you have risen in the stead of your fathers, [a brood of sinful men]” (Numbers 32:14). A proverb, [as it is written]: “as the ancient proverb says: From the wicked, wickedness will emerge” (I Samuel 24:14). [In] common parlance, from where? What does the beetle bear? Ticks that are worse than it. A righteous person begetting a wicked person has [an allusion in] the Bible: “Thistles will emerge in the stead of wheat” (Job 31:40). A proverb, [as it is written]: They<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Partridges.</i> beget fledglings that are not like them; they raise those that are not similar to them. A wicked person begetting a righteous person has [an allusion in] the Bible: “In the stead of a brier, a cypress will rise” (Isaiah 55:13). [And] a proverb: From the thorn, a rose will emerge.<br>But Solomon was a king, son of a king; a wise man, son of a wise man; a righteous man, son of a righteous man; a nobleman, son of a nobleman. You find that everything that is written regarding this one is written regarding that one. David reigned forty years, and that one [Solomon] reigned forty years. David reigned over Israel and Judah, and his son reigned over Israel and Judah. His father [David] built the foundations [of the Temple] and he [Solomon] built the superstructure. His father reigned from one end of the earth to [the other] end, and that one reigned from one end of the earth to [the other] end. David wrote books and Solomon wrote books. David recited songs and Solomon recited songs. David said vanities and Solomon said vanities.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">They instructed the people not to chase after temporal pleasures, which are mere vanities (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> David said words and Solomon said words.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">They spoke words of wisdom inspired by the Divine Spirit.</i> David stated proverbs and Solomon stated proverbs. David lauded with “then” and Solomon lauded with “then.” David built an altar and Solomon built an altar. David sacrificed an offering and Solomon sacrificed an offering. David took up the Ark and Solomon took up the Ark.<br>David reigned forty years, as it is stated: “The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years” (I Kings 2:11). Solomon reigned forty years, as it is stated: “Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all Israel, for forty years” (II Chronicles 9:30). David reigned over Israel and Judah, as it is stated: “The Lord, God of Israel, chose me from all the house of my father [to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah]” (I Chronicles 28:4). Solomon reigned over Israel and Judah, as it is stated: “Judah and Israel were numerous...” (I Kings 4:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The passage is discussing the reign of Solomon, and begins: “Solomon was king over all Israel” (I Kings 4:1). Thus, the verse cited in the midrash specifically mentions Israel and Judah because he was king over both.</i> David built the foundations [of the Temple], as it is stated: “King David rose on his feet [and said: …it was in my heart to build a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and I prepared to build]” (I Chronicles 28:2). Solomon built the superstructure, as it is stated: “I have built an abode for You” (I Kings 8:13). David said words, as it is stated: “These are David’s last words” (II Samuel 23:1). Solomon said words, as it is stated: “The words of Kohelet ben David, king in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:1). David said vanities, as it is stated: “Indeed, everyone is vanity, every standing man, Selah” (Psalms 39:6). Solomon said vanities, as it is stated: “Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet; vanity of vanities, everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 1:2). David stated proverbs, as it is stated: “As the ancient proverb says: From the wicked, wickedness will emerge” (I Samuel 24:14). Solomon stated proverbs, as it is stated: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David” (Proverbs 1:1). David wrote books, as Psalms is attributed to him. Solomon wrote books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. David lauded with “then,” as it is stated: “Then our mouths will be filled with laughter, and our tongues with song. Then the nations will say…” (Psalms 126:2). Solomon lauded with “then,” as it is stated: “Then Solomon said: The Lord said…” (I Kings 8:12). David took up the Ark, as it is stated: “David, and the elders of Israel […were walking to take up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord]” (I Chronicles 15:25). Solomon took up the Ark, as it is stated: “Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel… [to take up the Ark of the Covenant…]” (I Kings 8:1). David recited songs, as it is stated: “David spoke to the Lord the words of this song…” (II Samuel 22:1). Solomon recited songs, as it is stated: “The Song of Songs that is Solomon’s.”<br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan of Bet Guvrin in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Since you equate them, equate them regarding all aspects. Just as his [Solomon’s] father was forgiven for all his iniquities, as it is stated: “The Lord has also put away your sin; you shall not die” (II Samuel 12:13), so, too, in his regard. Moreover, the Divine Presence rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.
Another matter, “The song of songs”—that is what the verse said: “The heart of the wise will make his mouth prevail” (Proverbs 16:23); the heart of the wise man is filled with wisdom. What can attest to him, what can indicate that he is full of wisdom? His mouth will indicate his wisdom; his mouth will be instructive in his regard. “He will increase his lesson on his lips” (Proverbs 16:23); by expressing matters of Torah from his heart, he increases the lesson of Torah. They stated an analogy, to what is the matter comparable? To a barrel that is filled with gems and pearls, is sealed with a tight cover, placed in one corner, and no one knows what is in it; one person comes and empties it, and everyone knows what is in it. So too, Solomon’s heart was filled with wisdom, but no one knew what was in it. When the Divine Presence rested upon him, and he composed three books, everyone became aware of his wisdom.<br>“He will increase his lesson on his lips,” the lesson that he added to matters of Torah elevated him, as it is stated: “I applied my heart to seek and to scout [<i>velatur</i>] wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 1:13). What is <i>velatur</i>? It is to become a scout for wisdom. That is what is written: “So they may scout [<i>veyaturu</i>] the land of Canaan” (Numbers 13:2). One who is expert in Bible, I will go to him; one who is expert in Mishna, I will go to him, as it is stated: “To scout wisdom.”<br>Another matter, “to seek and to scout [<i>latur</i>],”—to fulfill the quota [<i>latur</i>] and go beyond [<i>lehotir</i>]. The poet, when he composes an alphabetic acrostic poem, at times he finishes [the alphabet] and at times he does not finish it. However, Solomon composed an alphabetic acrostic and [added lines for] five additional letters, as it is written: “His songs were a thousand [<i>alef</i>] and five” (I Kings 5:12); his song was an alphabetic acrostic<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word a thousand [<i>alef</i>] is read as a reference to the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, <i>aleph</i>, indicating an alphabetical acrostic poem.</i> and five. It was not only regarding matters of Torah that Solomon would scout, but rather: “Everything that is done under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:13), such as how one can sweeten mustard [and] how one can sweeten mandrakes. The Holy One blessed be He said: You scouted after matters of Torah, by your life, I will not withhold your reward. I will rest My Divine Spirit upon you. Immediately, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.
Another matter, “The song of songs,” that is what the verse says: “Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise” (Ecclesiastes 12:9). Had another person said them,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The lessons stated in the book of Ecclesiastes.</i> you would have been required to bend your ear and listen to those matters; more so because Solomon said them. Had he said them on his own, you would have been required to bend your ear and listen to them; more so because he said them through the Divine Spirit.<br>“Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise, moreover, he taught the people knowledge, considered [<i>izen</i>] and investigated, composed many proverbs” (Ecclesiastes 12:9). He considered matters of Torah, investigated matters of Torah, and made ears [<i>ozynayim</i>] for the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This can be understood to mean that he attracted many listeners for matters of Torah. Or it could be understood to mean that he crafted handles [<i>oznayim</i>] for the Torah in the sense that he explained the Torah and thereby made it more accessible, just as the handles of a vessel allow one to easily lift and transport it.</i> You find that until Solomon arose, there was no analogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">No one composed analogies to help the masses understand difficult Torah concepts.</i> Rav Naḥman <said two>, Rav Naḥman said: [This is analogous] to a large palace in which there were numerous entrances, and everyone who would enter it would stray from the path of the entrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They were unable to find the entrance that would take them where they needed to go.</i> One clever man came and took a skein and hung it on the path of the entrance. Everyone would enter and exit by means of the skein. So too, until Solomon arose, there was no person who was able to understand matters of Torah. Once Solomon arose, everyone began discoursing regarding matters of Torah. Rav Naḥman <said another version>: This is analogous to a thicket of reeds into which no person could enter. One clever man came and took a scythe and cut [them]. Everyone began entering and exiting through the cut area. So it was with Solomon.<br>Rabbi Yosei said: [This is analogous] to a large basked filled with produce, but it did not have a handle, and it could not be moved. One clever man came and crafted handles for it and it began to be moved by means of the handles. So too, until Solomon arose, no one was able to understand matters of Torah. Once Solomon arose, everyone began discoursing regarding matters of Torah.<br>Rabbi Sheila said: [This is analogous] to a large jug that was filled with boiling water but it did not have a handle so that it could be moved. One came and crafted a handle and it began to be moved by means of the handle.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: [This is analogous] to a deep well filled with water, and its water was cold, sweet, and excellent, but no creature could drink from it. One man came and tied rope to rope and string to string, drew from it and drank. Everyone began drawing and drinking. So too, from word to word and proverb to proverb, Solomon comprehended the secrets of the Torah, as it is written: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David” (Proverbs 1:1). By means of Solomon’s proverbs, he was able to comprehend matters of Torah.<br>The Rabbis say: Do not let this analogy be insignificant in your eyes, as by means of the analogy a person can comprehend matters of Torah. This is analogous to a king who lost a gold piece in his house, or a fine gem; is it not by means of a wick worth an <i>isar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A small copper coin.</i> that he finds it? So too, do not let the analogy be insignificant in your eyes, as by means of the analogy a person comprehends matters of Torah. Know that it is so, as Solomon, by means of analogy, comprehended the minute details of the Torah.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: It is to teach you that anyone who says matters of Torah in public will be privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him. From whom do you learn [this]? From Solomon, as because he said matters of Torah in public, he was privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him, and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.
Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair began: “If you seek it like silver…” (Proverbs 2:4). If you seek matters of Torah like these hidden treasures, the Holy One blessed be He will not withhold your reward. This is analogous to a person, if he loses a <i>sela</i> or a <i>kilarin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This was a valuable ornament of gold inlaid with a jewel.</i> in his house, he will kindle several lamps, several wicks, until he finds them. The matter can be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>; if for these, that [enhance] the temporal life of this world, a person kindles several lamps and several wicks until he discovers them and finds them, matters of Torah, that [are essential for] life in this world and in the World to Come, do you not need to search for them like these hidden treasures? That is: “If you seek it like silver….” Rabbi Elazar said: In all my days, no one preceded me to the study hall and I did not leave a person there and exit. One time I awoke early and I found the collectors of manure and collectors of straw,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">These individuals would arise very early to collect straw and manure from public thoroughfares in order to sell them as fertilizer. They had begun their work before Rabbi Elazar had gone to the study hall.</i> and I said: “If you seek it like silver and search for it like for hidden treasures, then you will understand fear of the Lord” (Proverbs 2:4–5). We are not even like the collectors of manure and collectors of straw. Thus we have learned that Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair used to say: Alacrity leads to cleanliness. Cleanliness leads to purity. Purity leads to sanctity. Sanctity leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to piety. Piety leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection of the dead leads to Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory.<br>Alacrity leads to cleanliness, as it is stated: “He shall complete atoning<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>kapara</i> means atonement as well as cleanliness. This verse, which is about the service of the High Priest in the Temple on Yom Kippur, indicates that it is the completion of a service, which is accomplished through alacrity, that leads to atonement, or cleanliness.</i> for the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 16:20). Cleanliness leads to purity, as it is stated: “The priest shall atone for her and she will be purified” (Leviticus 12:8). Purity leads to sanctity, as it is stated: “He shall purify it and he shall sanctify it” (Leviticus 16:19). Sanctity leads to humility, as it is stated: “For so said the Exalted and Most High, who abides forever and whose name is holy: Exalted and holy I will dwell and I will be with the downtrodden and lowly” (Isaiah 57:15). Humility leads to fear of sin, as it is stated: “In the wake of humility is fear of the Lord…” (Proverbs 22:4). Fear of sin leads to piety, as it is stated: “Then you spoke in a vision to your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the text here should read: “The mercy [<i>ḥesed</i>] of the Lord is forever and ever upon those who fear Him” (Psalms 103:17), in accordance with the parallel text of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:3). The term <i>ḥesed</i>, translated in the verse as mercy, is related to the term <i>ḥasidut</i>, piety (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Piety leads to the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “Then you spoke in a vision to your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20). The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, as it is stated: “I will place My spirit in you, and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). The resurrection of the dead leads to Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending Elijah the prophet to you [before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord]” (Malachi 3:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">“The great and terrible day of the Lord” is understood as a reference to the resurrection of the dead. Elijah will come before the resurrection of the dead, but it is the need to perform the resurrection of the dead that leads to his coming (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Matna said: What wisdom made as a crown on its head, humility made as a sandal on its heel. What wisdom made a crown on its head [<i>roshah</i>], as it is stated: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord” (Psalms 111:10), humility made a sandal on its heel [<i>akevah</i>], as it is stated: “In the wake of [<i>ekev</i>] humility is fear of the Lord…” (Proverbs 22:4).<br>The resurrection of the dead is by means of Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory. That is what is written: “Then you will understand fear of the Lord, and you will find knowledge of <the sacred> <God>” (Proverbs 2:5), this is the Divine Spirit.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Commentaries struggle to understand this line, which does not prove that resurrection of the dead is by means of Elijah. Some suggest that it be deleted (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Others suggest that this is a proof that alacrity eventually leads to understanding via the Divine Spirit, as indicated above. This is because the verse that precedes the one cited here relates to alacrity (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥalafta: [This is analogous] to a royal adviser who grew prominent in the king’s palace. The king said to him: ‘Make a request; what shall I give you?’ The adviser said: If I request silver and gold, he will give them to me; gems and pearls, he will give them to me. He said: I will request the king’s daughter, and everything will be included. So too, “In Givon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; God said: Request; what shall I give you?” (I Kings 3:5). Solomon said: If I request silver, gold, gems and pearls, he will give them to me. But I will request wisdom and everything will be included. That is what is written: “Give Your servant an attentive heart” (I Kings 3:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Solomon, you requested wisdom and you did not request wealth and property and the lives of your enemies. By your life, wisdom is granted you, and thereby, I will give you wealth and property.’ Immediately, “Solomon awakened and behold, a dream” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The dream was fulfilled; a donkey brayed and he knew what it was braying, a bird tweeted and he knew what it was tweeting. Immediately, “he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He sacrificed burnt offerings, he performed peace offerings, and he made a feast for all his servants” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Elazar said: From here it is derived that one makes a feast upon completion of the Torah. Rabbi Yudan said: It is to teach you that anyone who teaches Torah in public is privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him, as so Solomon did. He taught and the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.
Another matter, “The song of songs,” Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Aivu said: Song, one, of songs, two; that is three.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The term song is singular while the term songs is plural. Adding the two terms together, they refer to three songs, indicating that Song of Songs is really comprised of three independent songs.</i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Song of Songs is entirely one. The other two, what do you do with them? [One is] “A song of ascents for Solomon” (Psalms 127:1) and one is: “A psalm, a song for the dedication of the House, by David” (Psalms 30:1). They thought to say that David said it. But you say it was attributed to David,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">One might think that David composed Psalm 30 with divine inspiration, despite the fact that it is about the Temple, which was built after his death. The midrash clarifies that Solomon composed it and attributed it to David because David had made the preparations necessary for the construction of the Temple. Thus, the verse is to be understood as referring to the “House by David,”—the Temple, whose construction was prepared by David.</i> as it is stated: “Your neck is like the tower of David” (Song of Songs 4:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the Temple.</i> Rather, it is just like Song of Songs; Solomon said it, and attributed it to David.<br>When you analyze you say that all the actions of that man [Solomon] were threefold. Solomon rose to three levels. Regarding the first level, it is written: “For he ruled over the entire region beyond the River” (I Kings 5:4). Regarding the second level, it is stated: “Solomon was the ruler [over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt]” (I Kings 5:1). Regarding the third level, it is stated: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king” (I Chronicles 29:23). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Is it possible for a person to sit on the throne of the Lord, in whose regard it is written: “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24), and it is written: “A river of fire flowed and emerged [from before Him]” (Daniel 7:10), and it is written: “His throne was sparks of fire” (Daniel 7:9), and you say: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord”? Rather, just as the throne of the Holy One blessed be He rules from one end of the earth to the other, so, too, the throne of Solomon ruled from one end of the earth to the other. Just as the throne of the Lord judges without witnesses and forewarning, so, too, the throne of Solomon judged without witnesses and forewarning. Which [trial] was that? That was the trial of the harlots. That is what is written: “Then two women, [who were harlots,] came” (I Kings 3:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">They each had a baby, and one of the babies died. Each claimed the living baby was hers, and they came before King Solomon for adjudication. See I Kings 3:16–28.</i> Who were they? Rav said: They were spirits. The Rabbis say: They were childless women awaiting levirate marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">If a man dies without children, his widow is subject to the law of levirate marriage, whereby the brother of her dead husband must marry her. The husbands of these women had died without living children, but while their wives were pregnant, and the women subsequently gave birth. However, a child who dies within the first thirty days of its life does not exempt the mother from undergoing levirate marriage, and therefore an outcome of the case would be the determination of which woman would be subject to levirate marriage (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: They were actual harlots, and Solomon issued his ruling without witnesses and forewarning.<br>Solomon descended three descents. The first descent: After he was a great king from one end of the earth to the other, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over Israel. That is what is written: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel” (Proverbs 1:1). The second descent: After he was king over Israel, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over Jerusalem. That is what is written: “I am Kohelet, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). The third descent: After he was king over Jerusalem, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over his house,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The reading in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 20b) is that he was king only over his own bed.</i> as it is stated: “Behold Solomon’s bed; [sixty mighty men are around it, from the mighty of Israel,] all armed with a sword… [from fear in the nights]” (Song of Songs 3:7–8). He was not even king over his bed, as he feared the spirits.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Even in his own bed he was not a powerful king, as indicated in the verses cited in the midrash. He feared the spirits who had deposed him from his throne; see <i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 1:12.</i> <br>He saw three worlds. Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yudan said: King, commoner, and king, wise man, fool, and wise man, wealthy, indigent, and wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He was a king, wise, and wealthy, and then he became a commoner, a fool, and indigent, and then he once again became a king who was wise and wealthy. These were Solomon’s three worlds, meaning three stages of life.</i> What is the reason? “I have seen everything in the days of my vanity” (Ecclesiastes 7:15). A person relates his troubles only during the days of his wellbeing.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, since this verse was written at the end of Solomon’s life, it is apparent that he was restored to his position of wellbeing, as a king who was wise and wealthy.</i> Rabbi Hunya said: Commoner, king, and commoner, fool, wise man, and fool, indigent, wealthy, and indigent. What is the reason? “I am Kohelet, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). “I was,” I was when I was; however, now, I am no longer.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, since this verse was written at the end of Solomon’s life, it is apparent that he ended his life as a commoner who was a fool and indigent. Since Solomon did end his life as a wise king, this is to be understood to mean that he did not regain the levels of power, wisdom, and wealth that he once had (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>He violated three prohibitions: He amassed horses, he amassed women, he amassed silver and gold,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">These were in violation of the Torah’s commandments regarding the behavior of kings; see Deuteronomy 17:16–17.</i> as it is stated: “The king rendered the silver in Jerusalem like stones” (II Chronicles 9:27). Would they not have been stolen? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: They were ten-cubit stones and eight-cubit stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the silver and gold pieces on the streets of Jeusalem were too heavy to steal.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Even the weights that were in use during Solomon’s era were of gold; that is what is written: “Silver was not considered anything in the days of Solomon” (II Chronicles 9:20). He amassed women, as it is stated: “King Solomon loved many foreign women, and Pharaoh’s daughter…from the nations of whom the Lord said to the children of Israel: Do not consort with them and they shall not consort with you… [to them Solomon cleaved for love]” (I Kings 11:1–2).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is due to: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the fact that Solomon married too many women, the verse in Kings appears to critique him for marrying foreign women. This is due to the fact that he violated the verse cited here from Deuteronomy.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “For love” (I Kings 11:2); for actual love, for licentiousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">He consorted with them but did not marry them. Thus, he did not violate the prohibition stated in Deuteronomy 7:3, but his conduct was considered improper.</i> Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is written: “He, too, the foreign women caused him to sin” (Nehemiah 13:26); it teaches that he would have relations with them when they were menstruants and they would not inform him. Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta says: “For love,” to render them beloved [to God], to love them, to draw them near, to convert them, and to cause them to enter beneath the wings of the Divine Presence. It turns out that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, and Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili all said the same thing. Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta disagrees with the three of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta, the verse does not criticize Solomon for the fact that he married foreign women.</i> <br>Three adversaries confronted him. That is what is written: “The Lord raised up an adversary for Solomon, Hadad the Edomite” (I Kings 11:14); and it is written: “God raised up an adversary for him: Retzon son of Elyada” (I Kings 11:23); and it is written: “He was an adversary for Israel all the days of Solomon,” (I Kings 11:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although this verse refers to Retzon, the midrash may be interpreting this as a reference to Jeroboam, whom the next verse (I Kings 11:26) states rebelled against Solomon. Thus, Jeroboam is the third adversary (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> He amassed horses, as it is stated: “A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred silver pieces and a horse for one hundred and fifty” (I Kings 10:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The verse previously established (I Kings 10:26) that Solomon had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which were considered very large numbers.</i> <br>He stated three proverbs: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel” (Proverbs 1:1); “the proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to a father” (Proverbs 10:1); “these, too, are the proverbs of Solomon, that the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied” (Proverbs 25:1).<br>He said three vanities: “Vanity [<i>havel</i>] of vanities [<i>havalim</i>] said Kohelet…” (Ecclesiastes 1:2), <i>havel</i>, one, <i>havalim</i>, two;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havel</i> is a singular term, whereas <i>havalim</i> is a plural term.</i> that is three.<br>He recited three songs: Song, one, of songs, two, that is three.<br>He was called three names: Yedidya, Solomon, Kohelet. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said these three, [and also] Agur, Yakeh, Lemuel, Itiel,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">These additional names are based on Proverbs 30:1 and 31:1.</i> are seven. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The primary among them are Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman concedes that these [additional] four were added for him and that he was called by them, and they must be expounded: Agur, because he amassed [<i>agur</i>] matters of Torah; bin-Yakeh, a son [<i>bin</i>], who vomited [<i>hekia</i>] for a time, like this basin that is filled for a time and emptied for a time; so, too, Solomon studied Torah for a time and forgot it for a time. Lemuel,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded as though it were written Nemuel.</i> who spoke to God [<i>nam laEl</i>] with all his heart. He said: I can amass and not sin. “To Itiel, to Itiel and Ukhal” (Proverbs 30:1). Itiel, God [<i>el</i>] is with me [<i>iti</i>] and I will prevail [<i>veukhal</i>].<br>He wrote three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Which of them did he write first? Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Yonatan, Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: He wrote Proverbs first, then Song of Songs, and then Ecclesiastes, and he derived it from this verse: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” (I Kings 5:12); proverbs, this is the book of Proverbs; “his songs were one thousand and five” (I Kings 5:12), this is Song of Songs, and he said Ecclesiastes last.<br>The <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great disagrees with this statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>baraita</i> represents an alternate tradition regarding Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great’s opinion, different from the statement cited previously in his name.</i> The <i>baraita</i> says: He wrote the three of them simultaneously, and the statement says that he wrote each and every one individually. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great taught: It was only in Solomon’s old age that the Divine Presence rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Rabbi Yonatan said: He wrote Song of Songs first, then Proverbs, and then Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Yonatan derived it from the way of the world. When a person is young, he says words of song, when he matures, he says words of proverbs, when he grows old, he speaks of [how the pleasures of the world are] vanities. Rabbi Yannai, the father-in-law of Rabbi Ami said: Everyone concedes that he composed Ecclesiastes last.
Rabbi Elazar bar Avina in the name of Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis. Rabbi Elazar said [in the name of Rabbi Aḥa]: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” regarding each and every matter. “His songs were one thousand and five”—one thousand and five reasons for each and every matter. The Rabbis say: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” on each and every verse. “His songs were one thousand and five”—one thousand and five reasons for each and every proverb. “His proverbs were” is not written here, but rather, “his songs were one thousand and five”—the song of the proverb, the reason for the matter, [and another] reason for the matter.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: We reviewed the entire book of Proverbs and we found written in it only nine hundred and fifteen verses, and you say three thousand proverbs? Rather, you do not have any verse that does not have two or three thoughts, like: “A nose ring of gold and an adornment of fine gold” (Proverbs 25:12), “a nose ring of gold in the snout of a pig” (Proverbs 11:22). <sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The first verse equates “a nose ring of gold and an adornment of fine gold.” The second verse mentions only the nose ring of gold, but it also applies to an adornment of fine gold.</i> “Do not glorify yourself before a king, and do not stand in the place of the great” (Proverbs 25:6). It goes without saying do not sit; do not sit, and it goes without saying, do not speak.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">By teaching that one should not stand in the place of the great, by corollary Solomon is also teaching that one should not sit in their place, and that one should not speak there.</i> <br>We learned:<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Yadayim</i> 3:5.</i> Rabbi Akiva said: God forbid, not even one person in Israel disagreed regarding Song of Songs, claiming that it does not impurify the hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">There is a rabbinic decree that any sacred scroll renders <i>teruma</i> or one’s hands impure. (This decree was enacted so that people would not store their <i>teruma</i> with those scrolls; that could result in vermin attracted by the <i>teruma</i> gnawing at the scrolls and causing them damage.) Thus, if one were to hold that a scroll of the Song of Songs does not render one’s hands impure, that would mean it is not part of the Bible.</i> as there is no day in the entire history of the world like the day that Song of Songs was given. Why? It is because all the Writings are holy, and this is the holy of holies. Regarding what did they disagree? It is regarding Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Akiva’s father-in-law said in accordance with the statement of ben Azai: So they disagreed, so they concluded.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">There was a dispute regarding both Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes, but the conclusion was that both are part of the Bible and therefore render one’s hands impure.</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya stated a parable for it. [It is comparable] to one who took a <i>se’a</i> of wheat to the baker [and] said to him: ‘Produce for me from it flour, fine flour.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Grind the wheat into flour, and then sift it repeatedly to produce fine flour.</i> Produce for me from it one loaf, from the fine flour, [produced from] the flour.’ So, of all of Solomon’s wisdom, only Song of Songs is fine flour for Israel. Song of Songs, the best of songs, the finest of songs, the most excellent of songs; we will recite songs to the One who has made us into a song in the world, just as you say: “Wail, songs of the palace” (Amos 8:3); the praises of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The verse addresses songs as if they are people, alluding to the fact that the people of Israel are like a song in that they represent the glory of God.</i> <br>Another matter, Song of Songs, the best of songs, the finest of songs, the most excellent of songs; we will recite songs [<i>shirim</i>] to the One who rendered us the remnants [<i>shiyurim</i>] of the world, just as it is stated: “The Lord alone will lead him” (Deuteronomy 32:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is expounded to mean that the Lord will lead him alone, meaning that the people of Israel will remain alone in tranquility at the end of days.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Abba: We will recite songs and praise to the One who is destined to rest the Divine Spirit upon us. We will recite many songs before Him.<br>In all the songs, either He lauds them, or they laud Him. In the song of Moses, they laud Him and say: “This is my Lord and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). And in the song of Moses, He lauds them: “He would mount him on the elevations of the earth” (Deuteronomy 32:13). However, here, they laud Him and He lauds them. He lauds them, “Behold, you are fair, my love” (Song of Songs 1:15) and they laud Him: “Behold you are fair my beloved, pleasant, too” (Song of Songs 1:16).<br>Rabbi Shimon in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori said, it is a double song.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">God and Israel praise each other.</i> Rabbi Simon said: Doubled and redoubled.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In many verses, the praise is doubled even from the perspective of one speaker, such as: “Behold, you are fair, my love, behold, you are fair” (1:15).</i> <br>Rabbi Levi said: The numerical value of <i>shir</i> corresponds to the years of the patriarchs and the Ten Commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs is a tribute to Israel, as implied by the fact that the numerical value of the word <i>shir</i>, song, corresponds to the number of years of the lives of the patriarchs, plus the Ten Commandments given to Israel at Sinai.</i> <i>Shir</i> is five hundred and ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shin</i> 300, <i>yod</i> 10, <i>reish</i> 200, equal 510.</i> If you say that there is a surplus in them,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham lived 175 years, Isaac, 180, and Jacob, 147, plus 10 commandments, equal 512, not 510.</i> deduct from them the years of famine<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">One year during the lifetime of Abraham, and one year during the lifetime of Isaac.</i> that are not included in the tally.<br>Another matter, Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan [said]: Every place that “King Solomon” is mentioned in this scroll, the verse is speaking of King Solomon. [Whenever it says] simply “the king,” the verse is speaking of the Holy One blessed be He. The Rabbis say: Every place that “King Solomon” [<i>Shelomo</i>] is mentioned in this scroll, the verse is speaking of the King, [of Whom it may be said that] peace is His. [Whenever it says] simply “the king,” the verse is speaking of the congregation of Israel.

Chapter 2

<b>“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2).</b><br>“Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,” where was it stated? Rabbi Ḥinena bar Pappa said: It was stated at the sea, as it is stated: “To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots [I have likened you my love]” (Song of Songs 1:9).<br>Rabbi Yuda ben Rabbi Simon said: It was stated at Sinai, as it is stated: “The song of songs” [<i>hashirim</i>]; the song that was recited by the singers [<i>hashorerim</i>], as it is stated: “First the singers [<i>hasharim</i>] and then the musicians” (Psalms 68:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This psalm is understood as referring to the giving of the Torah, and therefore the fact that the verse “let him kiss me” is introduced as a song indicates that it was stated at the giving of the Torah.</i> It was taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: The Holy One blessed be He in the glory of His greatness recited it, as it is stated: “The song of songs that is Solomon’s [<i>lishlomo</i>]”—the King [of Whom it may be stated that] peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His.” Rabban Gamliel says: The ministering angels recited it;<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">At the giving of the Torah.</i> “the song of songs,” the song that was recited by the supernal singers [<i>sharim</i>].

The whole Torah in its entirety is six hundred and thirteen commandments. In terms of numerical value, Torah totals six hundred and eleven mitzvot [that] Moses spoke to us; however, <i>anokhi</i> and <i>lo yihye lekha</i> we did not hear from the mouth of Moses, but rather, from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He.
Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse as regarding the Israelites when they ascended Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse “let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” as referring to when the Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai before the giving of the Torah.</i> [This is analogous] to a king who sought to take a wife, well-born and of distinguished lineage. He sent a messenger to her, who spoke to her [and proposed marriage]. She said: ‘I am not worthy to be even his maidservant;<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This means she is agreeing to marry him.</i> however, I wish to hear it from his mouth.’ When that messenger returned to the king his face was glad, but his conversation was not comprehensible to the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The messenger was glad that the woman had agreed to marry the king, but embarrassed to report that hearing the king’s proposal only from the messenger was insufficient for her, and therefore he did not clearly communicate her response.</i> The king, who was clever, said: From the fact that his face is glad, apparently she accepted, but his conversation is not comprehensible to me, so apparently she said: I want to hear it from his mouth. So too, Israel is the well-born woman, the messenger is Moses, the king is the Holy One blessed be He. At that moment: “Moses returned the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:8). Why, then, does the [next] verse state: “Moses related the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9)? Because it is stated: “Behold, I am coming to you in a thickness of cloud, so that the people will hear while I speak with you, and they will believe also in you forever. Moses related the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse God indicated that He would not speak directly to the people, but rather He would speak to Moses, and Moses would speak to the people.</i> [Moses] said to Him: ‘This is what they demanded.’<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Moses told God that the people wanted Him to speak directly to them.</i> He said to [Moses]: ‘Does one listen to a baby [and give him] everything he asks?’ Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: The proverb says: One who was bitten by a snake, a rope frightens him. So too, Moses said: ‘Yesterday,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">When God appeared to him at the burning bush.</i> because I said to Him: “But they will not believe me (Exodus 4:1),” I received my just deserts through them; now what can I do for them?’<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Moses had been punished previously for indicating to God that he thought they would not believe God had spoken to him. Therefore he was fearful of relaying their request for God to speak directly to them.</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: This is what they demanded: They said: ‘We wish to see the glory of our King.’ Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: It was revealed before the Holy One blessed be He that Israel is destined to exchange His glory for that of another, as it is stated: “They exchanged their glory” (Psalms 106:20). [God agreed to speak to them] so that they would not say: ‘Had He shown us His glory and His greatness, we would have believed in Him. Now that He did not show us His glory and His greatness, we do not believe in Him.’ [This is] to uphold what is stated: “Do not enter into judgment with your servant, [for no living man will be justified before You]” (Psalms 143:2).
Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Yuda bar Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Neḥemya. Rabbi Yehuda says: At the moment that Israel heard: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), Torah study was affixed in their heart and they would study and would not forget. They came to Moses and said: ‘Moses our master, you become an intermediary between us, as it is stated: "You speak to us and we will hear” (Exodus 20:16), “Now, why shall we die? (Deuteronomy 5:22). What benefit would there be in our demise?’ They reverted to studying and forgetting. They said: ‘Just as Moses is flesh and blood and transient, so, too, his teaching is transient.’ Immediately, they returned and came to Moses and said to him: ‘Moses our master, if only He would appear to us a second time. If only “let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” If only Torah study will be affixed in our heart as it was.’ He said to them: ‘This will not [happen] now, but [it will occur] in the future, as it is written: “I will place My Torah within them and on their heart I will write it”’ (Jeremiah 31:32).<br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: At the moment that Israel heard: “You shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:3), the evil inclination was uprooted from their heart. They came to Moses and said: ‘Moses our master, you become an intermediary between us, as it is stated: "You speak to us and we will hear” (Exodus 20:16). “Now, why shall we die? (Deuteronomy 5:22). What benefit would there be in our demise?’ Immediately, the evil inclination returned to its place. They returned and came to Moses and said to him: ‘Moses our master, if only He would appear to us a second time. If only “let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”’ He said to them: ‘This will not [happen] now, but it [will occur] in the future, as it is written: “I will remove the stone heart from your flesh”’ (Ezekiel 36:26).
Rabbi Azarya, and some say Rabbi Elazar, Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Elazar says: This is analogous to a king who had a wine cellar. One came, the first guest; he poured him a cup and gave it to him. The second came, and he poured him a cup and gave it to him. When the king’s son came, he gave him the entire cellar. So too, Adam, the first man, was commanded with seven commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries write that the text should state “six commandments,” as the midrash goes on to list only six. This is also consistent with the text of <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 16:6 (see <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> That is what is written: “The Lord God commanded the man, saying: From all the trees in the Garden you shall eat” (Genesis 2:16). “He commanded [<i>vaytzav</i>],” this is [the prohibition against] idol worship, just as you say: “Because he willingly followed an order [<i>tzav</i>]” (Hosea 5:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, the prophet is expressing that the kingdom of Israel is oppressed because of the sin of idolatry.</i> “The Lord,” this is [the prohibition against] blaspheming the name, as it is stated: “One who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely die” (Leviticus 24:16). “God [<i>Elohim</i>],” this is [the commandment to appoint] judges, as it is stated: “The statement of the two of them shall come to the judges [<i>elohim</i>]” (Exodus 22:8). “The man,” this is [the prohibition against] bloodshed, as it is written: “One who spills the blood of the man [by man shall his blood be shed]” (Genesis 9:6). “Saying,” these are forbidden sexual relations, as it is stated: “Saying: If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him [and becomes another man’s wife, may he return to her again?]” (Jeremiah 3:1). “From all the trees in the Garden,” this is robbery, as it is written: “[Did you eat] from the tree that I commanded you [not to eat?]” (Genesis 3:11).<br>Noah, [the prohibition against eating] a limb [detached] from a living animal was added for him, as it is written: “But flesh with its life, its blood [you shall not eat]” (Genesis 9:4).

Judah [was commanded] regarding [levirate marriage with] a childless sister-in-law, as it is stated: “Judah said to Onan: Consort with your brother's wife, and consummate levirate marriage with her” (Genesis 38:8). [The children of] Israel [were commanded] regarding all the positive commandments and the negative commandments.<br>Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina and the Rabbis say: This is analogous to a king who would distribute provisions to his troops by means of dukes, governors, and commanders.

This one says the source of the <i>halakha</i> and that one says the source of the <i>halakha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Each one provided a source for his opinion as to the halakhic conclusion in the matter under discussion.</i> The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘Their passion comes from Me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Their commitment to arrive at the true <i>halakha</i> is for the sake of Heaven, and therefore, are the words of the living God (see <i>Eiruvin</i> 13b).

Rabbi Azarya said: We find that the soul of Aaron was taken only with a kiss; that is what is written: “Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor at the command of [<i>al pi</i>] God and he died there” (Numbers 33:38).<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the phrase <i>al pi</i> according to its literal meaning, such that the verse states “with the mouth of God,” meaning with a Divine kiss.</i> From where is it derived that the soul of Moses [also departed with a kiss]? As it is stated: “Moses, servant of the Lord, died there…at the command of [<i>al pi</i>] God” (Deuteronomy 34:5). From where is it derived that [the soul of] Miriam [departed with a kiss]? As it is written: “Miriam died there” (Numbers 20:1). Just as “there” that is written below, was with the mouth of God, so, too, here, it is the same, but it is improper to state it explicitly.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Since the word “there” appears regarding the death of Moses, who died with a kiss, the use of the term “there” regarding the death of Miriam implies that she died in the same manner. However, the verse did not state this explicitly regarding Miriam because it would have been improper to indicate the kiss regarding a woman (see <i>Bava Batra</i> 17a).</i> The rest of the righteous, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Let him kiss me from the kisses of his mouth.” If you engaged in matters of Torah that kiss your lips, ultimately, everyone will kiss you on the mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">So too, God will collect your soul with a Divine kiss (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> <br>Another matter, “let him kiss me [<i>yishakeni</i>] with the kisses”—He will arm me, He will purify me, He will cleave to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">All of these are connoted by the word <i>yishakeni</i>, as the midrash will explain.</i> <i>Yishakeni</i>, He will arm me, from what is written: “Armed [<i>noshekei</i>] with bows, right-handed and left-handed” (I Chronicles 12:2). Rabbi Shimon bar Naḥman said: Matters of Torah were likened to weapons. Just as these weapons serve their owners in times of war, so, too, matters of Torah serve one who exerts sufficient effort in their study. Rabbi Ḥana bar Aḥa cites it from here: “Exaltation of God [is in their throats, and a double-edged [<i>pifiyot</i>] sword is in their hand]” (Psalms 149:6); just as this sword cuts with both its edges,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">It can thereby save the life of its owner on two planes.</i> so too, Torah provides life in this world and life in the World to Come.<br>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: The Torah that was stated by one mouth [<i>peh</i>] is stated by many mouths [<i>piyot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the verse from Psalms cited above, which compares Torah to a double-edged [<i>pifiyot</i>] sword. Originally it was stated to Israel by Moses, and then all of the children of Israel spoke about it.

The written Torah is stated in one matter, compared to one mouth, whereas the oral Torah, which was not given with one exact text, is communicated in different forms by different people.

“…for your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2). We learned there (Mishna <i>Avoda Zara</i> 2:5): Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua as they were walking on the way: ‘Why did [the Sages] prohibit the cheese of the gentiles?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him: ‘Because they curdle it with the stomach contents of an animal carcass.’ He said to [Rabbi Yehoshua]: ‘But are the stomach contents of a burnt offering not more stringent than the stomach contents of an animal carcass, yet they said that a priest who is broad minded<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">He is not particular about what he eats.</i> swallows it raw.’ What is, swallows it raw? He gulps it down. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: They rendered it like a tainted cup; he may not benefit, but he is not liable for misuse of consecrated items.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if one eats the stomach contents of a consecrated animal, one is not liable for misuse of a consecrated item. This proves that it is not considered a food item, therefore its consumption is not a normal act of eating. Similarly, the stomach contents of an unslaughtered animal carcass should not be considered a food item, and should not render the cheese non-kosher.</i> [Rabbi Yishmael] said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">In the mishna, this is stated as a response to a second explanation given by Rabbi Yehoshua for the prohibition of eating the cheese of gentiles: They curdle it in the stomach contents of animals that have been slaughtered as an idolatrous sacrifice.</i> ‘If so, why did they not prohibit benefit from it?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] diverted his attention to another matter. He said to him: ‘Yishmael, my brother, how do you read it? For Your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine, or your love [<i>dodayikh</i>] [is better] than wine?’<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Do you think that the term “your love” is stated in the masculine form [<i>dodekha</i>], indicating that it is being stated by the woman, representing Israel, to the man, representing God, or is it stated in the feminine form [<i>dodayikh</i>], indicating that it is stated by the man, representing God, to the woman, representing Israel. Rabbi Yishmael answered that it is vocalized <i>dodayikh</i>, in the feminine.</i> He said to him: ‘The matter is not so, as its counterpart teaches in its regard: “Your oils [<i>shemanekha</i>] have a goodly fragrance”’<b> </b>(Song of Songs 1:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Just as this verse is in the masculine, so, too, the previous verse, which is the verse under discussion, is also in the masculine.</i><br>Why did he not reveal it to him?<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Why did he divert his attention rather than answering his question?</i> Rabbi Yonatan said: It is because they had prohibited it only recently,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">When the Sages issue a decree, for the first year they do not reveal the reason behind it, so that people will accept the decree without questioning its rationale.</i> and Rabbi Yishmael was young. Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta and Rabbi Ḥagai in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman [said]: It is written: “Lambs [<i>kevasim</i>] will be for your garments” (Proverbs 27:26). <i>Kevashim</i>, concealed items, is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The word, as written, can be read either <i>kevasim</i> or <i>kevashim</i>.</i> When your students are young, conceal matters of Torah from them. When they grow and become Torah scholars, reveal the secrets of Torah to them. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them” (Exodus 21:1), just as this treasure [<i>sima</i>] is not revealed to every person, the same is true of matters of Torah.<br>Rav Huna raised a question and Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva posed a difficulty:<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the text should read: Rav Huna, citing Rabbi Hama bar Ukva, posed a difficulty (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> If he sought to divert him, he should have diverted him from the five verses in the Torah that require resolution.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">In each of these cases there are two phrases, and it is unclear whether a particular word which appears at the border of the two belongs to the first or second phrase.</i> These are they: “<i>se’et</i>” (Genesis 4:7); “cursed” (Genesis 49:7);<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Does “cursed” belong to the previous verse: “And with their will they hamstrung an ox that is cursed” or does it belong to the beginning of this verse: “Cursed is their wrath, as it is fierce”? </i> “tomorrow” (Exodus 17:9);<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Is it “Go out and battle Amalek tomorrow” or is it “Tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill”?</i> “crafted like almonds” (Exodus 25:34);<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Is it “four cups crafted like almonds,” or is it “like almonds are its knobs and flowers”?</i> “arise” (Deuteronomy 31:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Is it “you will lie with your ancestors and arise,” or is it “this people will arise and it will stray”?</i> Is it, “if you do well you will receive forgiveness [<i>se’et</i>],” or is it “you will bear your sin [<i>se’et</i>] if you do not do well”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I have another: “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard” or “when they heard [the men were saddened] and they came from the field” (Genesis 34:7). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “And the Lord commanded me” (Deuteronomy 4:14); there are matters that He said to me myself, and there are matters that He told me to say to my children.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Some matters of Torah are meant to publicized to all, and others are meant to be communicated only to those who are worthy.</i> Rabbi Eila said: There are matters that one seals [<i>meshikin</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from <i>yishakeni</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua raised this verse to Rabbi Yishmael in order to allude to the fact that not everything is meant to be publicized (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> in one’s mouth.<br>How so? One verse says: “I store Your saying in my heart, so as not to sin against You” (Psalms 119:11), and one verse says: “With My lips I have recounted all the ordinances of Your mouth” (Psalms 119:13). In what sense can both these verses coexist?

Another matter, “as your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine”; matters of Torah are similar to each other, they are companions to one another, they are close to each other, just as you say: “Or his uncle [<i>dodo</i>] or his cousin” (Leviticus 25:49).<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the term <i>dod</i> indicates a familial relationship, that of an uncle (<i>dodo</i>, his <i>dod</i>, means his uncle), the term <i>dodekha</i>, “your <i>dod</i>,” in the verse, indicates a close relationship. This is interpreted as referring to matters of Torah, which are close to each other in the sense that one passage sheds light on another.</i> “However, a spring, or cistern, a gathering of water, [shall be pure]” (Leviticus 11:36), [yet] render food susceptible to impurity, as it is stated: “But if water shall be placed on a seed […it shall be unclean for you]” (Leviticus 11:38).<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">This verse teaches the law that food items become susceptible to impurity only if they have already come into contact with water or another liquid. One might have thought that a pool of water that can render an impure item pure, such as those mentioned in verse 36, would not render food items susceptible to impurity. The juxtaposition of the verses teaches that the water referred to in verse 38 includes even the types of water in verse 36, and although these pools of water can render an impure item pure, they also render food items susceptible to impurity. This is an example of how one verse can shed light on another.</i><br>Shimon bar Abba [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The words of the scribes<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The Oral Law transmitted by the Sages, as well as rabbinic ordinancs.</i> are as dear as matters of Torah. What is the reason? “Your palate is like fine wine” (Song of Songs 7:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The palate represents that which is stated by the Sages, while wine represents what emerges directly from the grape, a metaphor for the written Torah.</i> The scholars [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The words of the scribes are dearer than matters of Torah, as it is stated: “Your palate is like fine wine.”<br>One who says there are no phylacteries, which contradicts matters of Torah, is exempt;<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">One who denies the existence of the commandment to don phylacteries does not assume the status of a rebellious elder, as one who disputes matters written explicitly in the Torah is not considered an elder.</i> [one who says they have] five compartments, which adds to the words of the scribes, is liable.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The head phylactery has four compartments, each with a small scroll upon which a passage from the Torah is written. This is part of the Oral Law given to Moses at Sinai. An elder who claims there are five compartments would attain the status of a rebellious elder, who is executed (see Deuteronomy 17:12). Thus, one who contravenes matters transmitted by the Sages is punished more severely than one who contradicts the Written Torah.</i> <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi derived it from this:<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">From the following statement, which is from the Mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 1:3).</i> Rabbi Tarfon said: I was [once] coming on the road and I stopped and reclined to recite <i>Shema</i> in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai. I endangered myself due to armed robbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Tarfon endangered himself by stopping his travels in order to recite <i>Shema</i> in a reclining position, as required by Beit Shammai for the evening <i>Shema</i>. The Sages responded to him that he deserved to lose his life for violating the opinion of Beit Hillel, which does not require reclining for <i>Shema</i>.</i> You see, had he refrained from reciting it, he would have merely violated a positive command. Now that he recited it, he is liable to lose his life; that is: The words of the scribes are dearer than matters of Torah.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Ada said in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Aḥa: They are more stringent than matters of Torah and prophecy; it is written: “Do not preach, they preach” (Micah 2:6). This is analogous to a king who sent his officials to the provinces. Regarding one, he wrote: If he shows you my seal and my insignia, trust him, but if not, do not trust him. Regarding the other one, he wrote: Even if he does not show you my seal and my insignia, trust him. So too, regarding prophecy, it is written: “If a prophet will arise in your midst” (Deuteronomy 13:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">It is only when the truth of his prophecy is proven that the people are commanded to obey him.</i> Regarding words of the scribes, it is written: “On the basis of the Torah that they will instruct you” (Deuteronomy 17:11); “that the Torah will instruct you” is not written here, but rather, “that they will instruct you.” “And the judgment that they will say to you, [you shall do;] you shall not deviate from the matter that they will tell you, right or left” (Deuteronomy 17:11) – [if they tell you that] the right is the right and the left is the left, heed them; and even if they tell you that the right is the left and that the left is the right.
Another matter, “as your love is better than wine”—matters of Torah were analogized to water, to oil, to honey, and to milk. To water, “ho, everyone who is thirsty, go to water” (Isaiah 55:1); just as water [extends] from one end of the earth to the other, as it is written: “To the One who spreads the earth over the water” (Psalms 136:6), so too, Torah, [extends] from one end of the earth to the other, as it is stated: “Its measure is longer than the earth” (Job 11:9). Just as water provides life to the world, as it is stated: “A garden spring, a well of living water” (Song of Songs 4:15), so too, Torah provides life to the world, as it is stated: “They are life for those who find them” (Proverbs 4:22), and it is written: “Go, purchase and eat” (Isaiah 55:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is interpreted as referring to Torah, and comparing it to food, which sustains life.</i> Just as water is from the heavens, as it is stated: “At the sound of his placement of plenteous water in the heavens” (Jeremiah 10:13), so too, Torah is from the heavens, as it is stated: “That I spoke to you from the heavens” (Exodus 20:19). Just as water [rains down] with thunderous sound, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is on the water” (Psalms 29:3), so too, the Torah [was given] with thunderous sound, as it is stated: “It was on the third day when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning” (Exodus 19:16). Just as water restores the soul, as it is stated: “God split the hollow that was in Lehi, [and water emerged from it. He drank, and his spirit returned]” (Judges 15:19), so too, Torah: “The Torah of the Lord is complete, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8). Just as water purifies a person from impurity, as it is stated: “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you will be purified” (Ezekiel 36:25), so too, Torah purifies the impure from his impurity, as it is stated: “The words of the Lord are pure words” (Psalms 12:7). Just as water purifies the body, as it is stated: “He shall immerse his flesh in water [and become pure]” (Leviticus 14:9), so too, Torah purifies the body, as it is stated: “Your saying is extremely pure” (Psalms 119:140).<br>Just as water covers the nakedness of the sea, as it is stated: “As the water covers the seabed” (Isaiah 11:9), so too, Torah covers the nakedness of Israel, as it is stated: “Love covers all transgressions” (Proverbs 10:12). <sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah renders those who engage in it beloved to God.</i> Just as water descends drop by drop but becomes streams upon streams, so too, Torah, a person studies two <i>halakhot</i> today and two tomorrow, until he becomes a flowing stream. Just as water, if a person is not thirsty, it is not pleasant for his body, so too, Torah, if one does not exhaust himself [in its study], it is not pleasant for his body. Just as water forsakes an elevated place and goes to a low place, so too, Torah forsakes one who is arrogant and cleaves to one who is self-effacing. Just as water is not preserved in vessels of silver and gold, but rather, in the lowliest of the vessels, so too, Torah is preserved only in one who renders himself like an earthenware vessel. Just as regarding water, a great man is not ashamed to say to his inferior: ‘Give me water to drink,’ so too, in matters of Torah, a great man is not ashamed to say to his inferior: ‘Teach me one chapter, one matter, one verse, or even one letter.’ Just as water, when a person does not know how to sail on it, he will ultimately capsize, so too, in matters of Torah, if a person does not know how to navigate them and to issue rulings in them, ultimately, he will capsize.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina of Caesarea said: Just as water is drawn to gardens, orchards, lavatories, and bathhouses, could it be that the same is true of matters of Torah? The verse states: “For the ways of the Lord are straight” (Hosea 14:10). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva said: Just as water causes the plants to grow, so too, matters of Torah cause anyone who exerts himself sufficiently in their study to grow.<br>If so, just as water becomes spoiled and foul in the jug, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “[better than] wine”—just as wine, the longer it ages in the jug it improves, so too matters of Torah, the longer they age in the body of a person, the greater they become. If so, just as water is not recognizable in the body, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Wine”—just as wine is recognizable in the body, so too, matters of Torah are recognizable in the body. [People] motion, point, and say: ‘This is a Torah scholar.’ If so, just as water does not cause the heart to rejoice, is the same true of matters of Torah? The verse states: “Wine”—just as wine causes the heart to rejoice, as it is stated: “Wine will cause the heart of a person to rejoice” (Psalms 104:15), so too, matters of Torah cause the heart to rejoice, as it is stated: “The precepts of the Lord are upright, causing the heart to rejoice” (Psalms 19:9).<br>If so, just as wine is sometimes harmful to the head and the body, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states “oil” (Song of Songs 1:3) just as oil is pleasant for the head and the body, so too, matters of Torah are pleasant for the head and the body, as it is stated: “Your word is a lamp to my feet” (Psalms 119:105). If so, just as oil is bitter at its outset and sweet at its culmination, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Honey and milk” (Song of Songs 4:11); just as they are sweet, so too, matters of Torah are sweet, as it is stated: “Sweeter than honey” (Psalms 19:11). If so, just as honey has waste,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the wax of the honeycomb, and to the elements that are found mixed in with honey before it is purified.</i> is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Milk,” just as milk is pure, so too, matters of Torah are pure, as it is written: “Gold and glass cannot equal it” (Job 28:17). If so, just as milk is bland, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Honey and milk.” Just as honey and milk when they are mixed do not harm the body, so it is with matters of Torah, as it is stated: “It will be healing for your navel” (Proverbs 3:8), “as they are life for those who find them” (Proverbs 4:22).<br>Another matter, “as your love is better,” these are the patriarchs; “than wine,” these are the princes.<br>Alternatively, “as your love is better,” these are the offerings; “than wine,” these are the libations. Rabbi Ḥanina said: Had Moses known how beloved the offerings would be when the Israelites performed that deed,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf.</i> he would have sacrificed all the offerings in the Torah. Instead, he ran to the merit of the patriarchs, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob your servants” (Exodus 32:13).<br>Another matter, “as your love is better,” these are the Jewish people; “than wine [<i>yayin</i>],” these are the gentiles; <i>yod</i>, ten, <i>yod</i>, ten, <i>nun</i>, fifty, the seventy nations,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of <i>yod</i> is ten and of <i>nun</i> is fifty, such that the numerical value of the word <i>yayin</i> (<i>yod-yod-nun</i>) is seventy, which corresponds to the seventy nations of the world.</i> to teach you that Israel is more beloved to the Holy One blessed be He than all the nations.

Chapter 3

<b>“By the fragrance of your good oils, your name is like poured oil; therefore, the young women love you” (Song of Songs 1:3).</b><br>“By the fragrance of your good oils,” Rabbi Yanai son of Rabbi Shimon [said]: All the songs that the patriarchs recited before You were fragrances, but we, “your name is like poured oil,” like a person who empties from his vessel to the vessel of another.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is to the song sung after the splitting of the sea, which expressed praise of God so fully that it far overshadowed the praises uttered by the patriarchs, just as an oil is much more substantive than its fragrance.</i> All the mitzvot that the patriarchs performed before You were fragrances,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">They had been commanded to perform only a small number of mitzvot.</i> but we, “your name is like poured oil,” [we have] two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments and three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments.<br>Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Eliezer says: If all the seas were ink, [all the reeds that grow in] the swamps were quills, the heavens and the earth were scrolls, and all people were scribes, they would not suffice to write the matters of Torah that I have learned [from my teachers], and I culled only the equivalent of one who dips the tip of his quill, like a brush, in the sea. Rabbi Yehoshua says: If all the seas were ink, the swamps were quills, the heavens and the earth were sheets of parchment, and all people were scribes, they would not suffice to write the matters of Torah that I have learned, and I culled only the equivalent of one who dips the tip of his quill, like a brush, in the sea. Rabbi Akiva says: I do not have the ability to say what my teachers said; rather, my teachers culled from it, but I did not cull from it, but rather, like one who smells a citron. The one who smells enjoys, but the citron is not lacking. And like one who fills from an aqueduct and like one who lights from a lamp to a lamp.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">In all of these cases, one gains from the original item without taking anything noticeable from it. In the metaphors of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, they compared what they had learned to one who actually takes a miniscule amount of substance from the source.</i> <br>One time, Rabbi Akiva tarried in his arrival at the study hall. He arrived and sat outside. A question was asked: Is this the <i>halakha</i>? They said: ‘The <i>halakha</i> is outside.’ Again a question was asked. They said: ‘Torah is outside.’ Again a question was asked. They said: ‘Akiva is outside, make room for him.’ He came and sat before the feet of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer’s study hall was configured like an oblong arena, and there was one stone there that was designated for him [Rabbi Eliezer] to sit upon. One time Rabbi Yehoshua entered and began kissing that stone. He said: ‘This stone is like Mount Sinai and the one who sits on it is like the Ark of the Covenant.’
Another matter, “by the fragrance of your good oils,” Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Ḥiyya: There are two oils, the oil of priesthood and the oil of kingship.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The plural term oils in the verse refers to these two positions. Kings and High Priests were anointed with special oil during their inaugurations.</i> The Rabbis say: There are two Torahs, the written Torah and the Oral Torah.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: “Your name is like poured oil [<i>shemen</i>],” oil improves on anyone who engages in the greatness [<i>shamna</i>] of the Torah. This is [consistent with another] opinion of Rabbi Yudan, who said: “The yoke will be broken due to the oil” (Isaiah 10:27). The yoke of Sennacheribwas broken due to Hezekiah and his associates, who were engaged in the greatness of Torah.<br>Another matter, “your name is like poured oil,” just as this oil is bitter at its outset and sweet at its culmination, so too, “your beginning may be small, but your end will soar very high” (Job 8:7). Just as this oil improves only by means of crushing, so too, Israel repents only by means of crushing. Just as this oil does not mix with other liquids, so too, Israel, does not intermingle with the nations of the world, as it is written: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). Just as this oil, a full cup does not cause a drip like other liquids, so too, matters of Torah do not dislodge matters of cynicism.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">If a drop of oil falls into a full cup of a different liquid, since the oil floats to the top, it is the oil that overflows rather than the other liquid. Similarly, if one’s heart is full of cynicism and one hears words of Torah, the Torah will not penetrate (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Just as this oil, when you have a cupful of oil in your hand and a drop of water falls into it, a corresponding drop of oil is dislodged, so too, if a matter of Torah enters the heart a corresponding matter of cynicism is dislodged, and if a matter of cynicism enters the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">This is the case if one’s heart has some cynicism, but is not saturated with cynicism.</i> a corresponding matter of Torah is dislodged. Just as this oil brings light to the world, so too, Israel is light for the world, as it is stated: “The nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). Just as this oil is superior to all liquids, so too, Israel is superior to all nations, as it is stated: “The Lord your God will place you supreme” (Deuteronomy 28:1). Just as oil does not produce a sound,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">When poured from one vessel to another.</i> so too, Israel does not produce a sound in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">They do not respond to those who antagonize them, but rather, accept in silence.</i> But regarding the World to Come it is written: “You will be brought down and you will speak from the ground” (Isaiah 29:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">This will culminate “with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, storm and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire” (Isaiah 29:6).</i>
Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding Abraham our patriarch. When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Go you from your land, from your birthplace” (Genesis 12:1), to what was it analogous? To a flask of balsam oil that was placed in one corner and its fragrance did not diffuse. One came and moved it from its place and its fragrance diffused. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Abraham, you have many good deeds, you have many mitzvot, move yourself around in the world and your name will be exalted in the world.’ “Go, you,” what is written thereafter? “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2).<br>“Therefore, young women love you.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Here are many young women,’ as it is written: “Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his nephew, all the property that they acquired, and the souls that they made in Ḥaran” (Genesis 12:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion to young women is derived from “the souls that they made in Haran.”</i> But is it not so, that if the whole world were to gather to create a single mosquito, they would be unable to create it? Rather, these are the proselytes that Abraham and Sarah proselytized.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to souls alludes to the fact that Abraham and Sarah proselytized both men and women.</i> That is why it is stated: “And the souls that they made in Ḥaran.” Rabbi Ḥonya said: Abraham would proselytize the men and Sarah, the women. Why does the verse state: “That they made in Ḥaran”? It teaches that Abraham our patriarch would bring them into his house, feed them, give them drink, befriend them, and draw them near under the wings of the Divine Presence. You learn that anyone who brings a single person into the midst of the wings of the Divine Presence, the verse ascribes to him as though he created him, formed him, and molded him.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, from the fact that You bring light to the world, Your name is exalted in the world. What is the light? It is salvation, as when You bring us light, many proselytes come and convert and join us, such as Yitro and Raḥav. Yitro heard and came; Raḥav heard and came.’ Rabbi Ḥanina said: When the Holy One blessed be He performed a miracle for Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, many proselytes converted, as it is written: “For upon his seeing his children, My handiwork, in his midst, they will sanctify My name” (Isaiah 29:23). What is written thereafter? “Those of misguided spirit will gain understanding” (Isaiah 29:24).<br>Another matter, “therefore, the young women love you,”because You gave us the plunder of Egypt, the plunder of the sea, the plunder of Siḥon and Og, and the plunder of the thirty-one kings. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women [<i>alamot</i>] love you,” because You obscured [<i>shehe’elamta</i>] from them the day of death and the day of consolation, they love You. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” with youthfullness and alacrity. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” these are the penitents. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is the third group, as it is stated: “I will bring the third through the fire, and I will refine them like the refining of [silver]” (Zechariah 13:9). Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” these are the proselytes; that is what is written: “Lord, I heard Your renown; I was afraid, Lord; your deeds are in the midst of the years…” (Habakkuk 3:2). Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is the generation of persecution, as it is stated: “For we are killed all day long for You; we are considered as sheep for slaughter” (Psalms 44:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, the term young maidens [<i>alamot</i>] is related to <i>al mut</i>, beyond death.</i> Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is Israel, as it is stated: “Rather, it is from the Lord’s love of you, and from His observance of the oath…” (Deuteronomy 7:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">This verse states that God loves Israel, not that Israel loves God. The midrash may be citing this verse as an introduction to the following one, which states that God “keeps covenant and mercy with those that love him” (Deuteronomy 7:9), indicating that Israel loves God (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” because you obscured from them the reward of the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, when they perform mitzvot, it is an expression of love of God, rather than in order to receive reward (<i>Yefei Kol</i>).</i> <br>As Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo said: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to render Himself the head of the circle for the righteous in the future. What is the reason? “Direct your heart to its ramparts [<i>leḥeila</i>]” (Psalms 48:14); a circle [<i>leḥola</i>] is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, the word is written <i>leḥeila</i>, and its spelling cannot be vocalized <i>leḥola</i>. It is possible that the point of the midrash is that the more common construct of this word would be <i>leḥeilah</i>, or even <i>leḥomatah</i>. The fact that it is written <i>leḥeila</i> is in order to hint to the similar word, <i>leḥola</i> (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>; <i>Midrash Hamevoar</i>).</i> righteous on this side and righteous on that side, and the Holy One blessed be He in the middle of them, and they youthfully dance before Him in circles, and indicate to each other with a finger and say: “For this is God, our God, forever and ever. He will lead us beyond death” (Psalms 48:15). In two worlds He will lead us, in this world and in the World to Come.<br>Another matter, “He will lead us beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” with youth [<i>alemut</i>] and alacrity. Alternatively, “beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” like those young women, as it is stated: “Amid the drumming young women [<i>alamot</i>]” (Psalms 68:26). Alternatively, “beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” Akilas translated: <i>Athanasia</i>, a world in which there is no death, and [people] motion to each other with a finger and say: “For this is God, our God, forever and ever. He will lead us beyond death.” In two worlds He will lead us, in this world and in the World to Come. In this world, as it is written: “For the Lord your God has blessed you” (Deuteronomy 15:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">This verse appears in a passage that describes God leading Israel through the wilderness.</i> and in the World to Come, as it is written: “The Lord will lead you always” (Isaiah 58:11).

Chapter 4

<b>“Draw me; we will run after you . The king has brought me to his chambers; let us exult and rejoice in you. We will recount your love through wine; sincerely do they love you” (Song of Songs 1:4).</b><br>“Draw me; we will run after you.” Rabbi Meir said: When the Israelites stood before Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Am I giving you the Torah without assurance? Rather, bring Me good guarantors that you will observe it, and I will give it to you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is expounding on the term “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>],” which is related to the term collateral [<i>mashkon</i>], or “take collateral from me [<i>mashkeni</i>].”</i> They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, our ancestors will be guarantors for us.’ He said to them: ‘Your ancestors need guarantors.’ To what is this matter analogous? It is to one who went to borrow from the king. [The king] said to him: ‘Bring me a guarantor and I will lend to you.’ He went and brought him a guarantor. [The king] said to him: ‘Your guarantor needs a guarantor.’ He went and brought him a second guarantor. [The king] said to him: ‘Your guarantor requires a guarantor.’ Once he brought him a third guarantor, he said: ‘Know that because of this, I am lending to you.’ So, too, when the Israelites stood to receive the Torah, He said to them: ‘Bring Me good guarantors that you will observe it, and I will give it to you.’ They said before him: ‘Master of the universe, our ancestors are guaranteeing for us.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I have [claims against] your ancestors. Abraham, I have [a claim] against him, as he said: “How will I know” (Genesis 15:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">When God promised to give the Land to Abraham, Abaraham asked: “How will I know that I will inherit it?” instead of just trusting God’s promise.</i> Isaac, I have [a claim] against him, as he loved Esau, and I hated him, as it is stated: “And Esau I hated” (Malachi 1:3); Jacob, who said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). Rather, bring me effective guarantors and I will give it to you.’<br>They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, our prophets will be guarantors for us.’ He said to them: ‘I have [claims] against them, as it is stated: “And the shepherds were disloyal to me [and the prophets prophesied to the Baal]” (Jeremiah 2:8). And it is written: “Like foxes among the ruins, so are your prophets, Israel” (Ezekiel 13:4). Rather, bring me effective guarantors and I will give it to you.’ They said: ‘Our children are guaranteeing for us.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘They are certainly good guarantors, I will give it to you on their account.’ That is what is written: “From the mouths of infants and sucklings You founded strength” (Psalms 8:3), and strength means only Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord will give strength to His people (Psalms 29:11). When payment is demanded from the borrower, but he lacks resources to pay, who is apprehended? It is the guarantor. That is what is stated: “You forgot the Torah of your God; I, too, will forget your children” (Hosea 4:6). Rabbi Aḥa said: “I, too,” [means that] as it were, I, too, am subject to forgetfulness. Who will say at the [reading of the] Torah before Me: Bless the blessed Lord? Is it not the sucklings? That is, due to the laxity of the Torah in you, your children were apprehended, as it is stated: “I struck your children in vain” (Jeremiah 2:30). As it were, I, too, am subject to forgetfulness. Who will say before Me: Bless the blessed Lord? Therefore, a person must introduce his son to Torah and train him in study, so that he will prolong his days in the world, as it is stated: “For with me your days will increase” (Proverbs 9:11).
Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and the Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">They said in their exposition of the verse: “Draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you.”</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because You took us into a good and expansive land, we will run after You to a good land that is called a dwelling place [<i>mashkenuta</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Because You took us to the good and extensive lands of Siḥon and Og on the eastern side of the Jordan, we desired to follow You further, to the Land of Israel proper, which is called God’s dwelling place (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Because You took us to a good, expansive land that is called a dwelling place [<i>mashkenuta</i>], we will run after You.<br>The Rabbis say: Because You rested Your Divine Presence [<i>shekhina</i>] in our midst, as it is written: “They shall make for Me a sanctuary, and I will dwell [<i>veshakhanti</i>] among them” (Exodus 25:8), we will run after You. The Rabbis say another matter: Because You removed Your Divine Presence from our midst, we will run after You. Know that this is so, for with all the troubles that befell them for the incident of the Golden Calf they did not mourn, but when Moses said to them [on behalf of God]: “For I will not ascend in your midst” (Exodus 33:3), immediately, “When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned” (Exodus 33:4). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: [It was] a weapon that He gave to the Israelites at Ḥorev with the ineffable name engraved upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated in explanation of the adornment mentioned in the verse: “The children of Israel were stripped of their adornment from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6).</i> When they sinned in the incident of the Calf, it was taken from them. How was it taken from them? Rabbi Aivu and the Rabbis, Rabbi Aivu said: It was peeled off them by itself, and the Rabbis say: An angel would descend and peel it off them. The Israelites said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, does a wife not adorn herself only for her husband?’<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">If You will not be ascending with us, what is the point of the ornaments?</i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The Israelites yearned for the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Let my beloved come to his garden [<i>legano</i>]” (Song of Songs 4:16) – to his wedding canopy [<i>leginuno</i>].
Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Azarya. Rabbi Yudan said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, because You acted with my neighbors with the attribute of justice, and with me with the attribute of mercy, I will run after You,’ as Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What was not done to the Generation of the Flood was done to the Ten Tribes. Regarding the Generation of the Flood it is written: “Only evil the entire day” (Genesis 6:5), and regarding the Ten Tribes it is written: “Woe, the devisers of iniquity who perform evil on their beds” (Micah 2:1). That is at night; in the morning, from where is it derived? “In the morning light they perform it, for it is in their power” (Micah 2:1). From them, no remnant remained, but from these, a remnant remained;<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The Generation of the Flood sinned only during the day and there were no survivors, while the Ten Tribes sinned night and day, and there were survivors.</i> by what merit? Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted it to their credit, [as] Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: It was by the merit of, “behold a remnant remained in it, [who are brought forth]” (Ezekiel 14:22), “who bring forth” is not written here, but rather, “who are brought forth.” [This teaches that a remnant remained] in the merit of the righteous men and the righteous women, the prophets and the prophetesses, who would emerge from them.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: A statement was made regarding the coastal cities that was not stated regarding the Generation of the Flood: “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Keretim” (Zephaniah 2:5)—a nation that is liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>. By whose merit were they rescued? It was by the merit of one God-fearing person whom they produced each and every year. Rabbi Levi interpreted it to their credit: “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Keretim”—a nation that established [<i>karat</i>] a covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">This is an allusion to the fact that some members of this nation converted and fulfilled the covenant of circumcision. This merit prevented the destruction of the nation at that time, but the punishment was only temporarily averted (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> as it is stated: “He established [<i>vekharot</i>] a covenant with him” (Nehemiah 9:8).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Nehemiah said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: A statement was made regarding the tribes of Judah and Benjamin that was not stated regarding the Sodomites. Regarding the Sodomites it is written: “Their sin is very weighty” (Genesis 18:20), but regarding the tribes of Judah and Benjamin it is written: “He said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very very great” (Ezekiel 9:9). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: We have another verse: “The iniquity of the daughter of my people exceeded [the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands seized it]” (Lamentations 4:6). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: One hand did not seize another, they did not extend their hands to perform mitzvot; but these extended their hands to perform mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Tanḥuma explains why Sodom was overthrown in a moment whereas the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were not, despite the fact that their sins were greater than those of Sodom. The Sodomites did not extend their hands to assist one another or perform mitzvot, whereas the tribes of Judah and Benjamin did.</i> “The hands of merciful women [cooked their children, they were food for them]" (Lamentations 4:10). Why [did they act] in such a way? It was because they provided “food [<i>levarot</i>] for them in the disaster of the daughter of my people”<b> </b>(Lamentations 4:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse in Lamentations to mean the starving people of Jerusalem would give the small amount of food they had to others in order to attempt to console [<i>lehavrot</i>] them for the loss of family members. The reference to cooking their children is understood allegorically in the sense that they deprived them of food in order to console others. Thus, the verse states that the merciful women deprived their own children of food. Why did they act in such a way? In order to attempt to console others.</i>
Rabbi Azarya said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, because You gave me the plunder of my neighbors,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">This comment is based on the similarity of the word <i>moshkeni</i>, “draw me,” and <i>mishkenai</i>, “from my neighbors” (Maharzu).</i> we will run after You, as it is stated: “A woman will borrow from her neighbor” (Exodus 3:22); [we thus received] the plunder of Egypt, [along with] the plunder of Siḥon and Og, and the plunder of the thirty-one kings, [and so] we will run after You.’<br>Another matter, “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you,” because you incited my wicked neighbors against me. Rabbi Avun said: [This is analogous] to a king who grew angry at a noblewoman and incited wicked neighbors against her, and she began shouting: ‘My lord the king, rescue me!’ So too regarding Israel, “Sidonites, Amalek, <and Maon oppressed you> and you called to Me and I rescued you from their hand” (Judges 10:12).<br>Another matter, “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you,” You endanger me [<i>maskineni</i>], so we will run after You. Alternatively, You make me impoverished [<i>memaskeini</i>], so we will run after You, like what Rabbi Aḥa said: A Jew requires the carob to repent,<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Carobs were an important component of the diet of the poor. When people experience economic distress, that can cause them to repent.</i> like what Rabbi Akiva said: Poverty is appropriate for the daughter of Jacob like a [decorative] red strap on the neck of a white horse. Alternatively, “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you,” from the collateral that You have taken from me [<i>mashkineni</i>], we will run after You. From the great collateral that you have taken from me, we will run after You, as Rabbi Menaḥama said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “We have done injury [<i>ḥavol ḥavalnu</i>] to you” (Nehemiah 1:7), this is the first destruction and the second destruction, that were taken as collateral due only because of us.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is to the destruction of the two Temples. The Temple is presented as something great that was taken as collateral in the sense that it was taken due to the debt generated by the sins of Israel. The trauma of destruction can cause people to repent.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai: It is written: “Moses led Israel [from the Red Sea]” (Exodus 15:22); he led them away from the sin at the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">They sinned at the sea by complaining against God and Moses before the splitting of the sea (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 21:10) or by carrying an idol with them (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 24:1–3).</i> They said to him: ‘Moses our master, to where are you leading us?’ He said to them: ‘To Eilim, from Eilim to Alush, from Alush to Mara, from Mara to Refidim, and from Refidim to Sinai.’ They said: ‘To wherever you go and lead us, we are with you.’ This is analogous to one who went and married a woman from a village. He said to her: ‘Arise and come with me.’ She said to him: ‘From here to where?’ He said to her: ‘From here to Tiberias, and from there to Burseki, from Burseki to the upper marketplace, and from there to the lower marketplace.’ She said to him: ‘To wherever you go and take me, I will go with you.’ So too, Israel said: “My soul cleaves after You” (Psalms 63:9). Rabbi Yosei bar Ika said: The verse proclaims and says: “Draw me; we will run after you,”—if to Bible, to Bible; if to Mishna, to Mishna; if to Talmud, to Talmud; if to <i>Tosefta</i>, to <i>Tosefta</i>; if to <i>aggada</i>, to <i>aggada</i>.
“The king has brought me to his chambers.” It is taught there: Four entered the orchard;<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">This means that they contemplated the mysteries of God, including Creation and the Divine Chariot.</i> ben Azai, ben Zoma, Elisha ben Avuya, and Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azai glimpsed and was harmed; in his regard it is stated: “You found honey, eat as much as is sufficient for you [lest you be sated with it and vomit it]” (Proverbs 25:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Ben Azai took in more than he could absorb.</i> Ben Zoma glimpsed and died. In his regard it is stated: “Weighty in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His devoted ones” (Psalms 116:15). Elisha ben Avuya cut the shoots.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">He treated parts of the divinity as independent entities, which is heretical.</i> How did he cut the shoots? When he would enter synagogues and study halls and see children who were successful in their studies, he would say something to them and they would be silenced. In his regard it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin” (Ecclesiastes 5:5). Rabbi Akiva entered in peace and emerged in peace. He said: ‘It is not because I am greater than my colleagues; rather, this is what the Sages taught in the Mishna (<i>Eduyot</i> 5:7): Your actions will draw you near and your actions will distance you.’ In his regard it is written: “The king has brought me to his chambers.”
Rabbi Yanai said: The Torah need have been taught only from: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2). Why, then, did the Holy One blessed be He reveal to Israel what was on the first day, and what was from the second day to the sixth day? In the merit of their saying: “Everything that the Lord had said, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), He immediately revealed it to them. Rabbi Berekhya said: It is written: “He told you His covenant [<i>berito</i>]” (Deuteronomy 4:13); He told you the book of Genesis, which is the beginning of the creation [<i>beriyato</i>] of the world. “That He commanded you to perform, the ten precepts” (Deuteronomy 4:13), these are the Ten Commandments, ten for the Bible and ten for the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">The Ten Commandments are to be understood as they are written, and are also to be expounded in the manner of Talmudic analysis.</i> From where, then, will Elihu ben Berekhel the Buzite<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">One of Job’s friends (see Job 32:2).</i> come and reveal to Israel the secrets of [<i>ḥadrei</i>] Behemoth and Leviathan,<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the text of the midrash should be emended. Elihu discussed with Job aspects of the creation of the world (See Job 37:6–11), but the secrets of the Behemoth and Leviathan were mentioned by God Himself (see Job 40:15, 25) (Rabbi David Luria; <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> and from where will Ezekiel come and reveal the secrets [<i>ḥadrei</i>] of the Divine Chariot?<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Had God not detailed the creation of the world in the Torah, and hinted in its text to further secrets of creation, they could not have been expounded upon and revealed in greater detail later in history.</i> That is what is written: “The king has brought me to his chambers [<i>ḥadarav</i>].”
“Let us exult and rejoice in you.” Ten expressions of joy are employed in Israel’s regard: <i>Gila</i>, <i>sisa</i>,<i> simḥa</i>, <i>rina</i>, <i>pitzḥa</i>, <i>tzahala</i>, <i>alatza</i>, <i>elza</i>, <i>ḥedva</i>, <i>terua</i>. <i>Gila</i>, “rejoice [<i>gili</i>] greatly, daughter of Zion” (Zechariah 9:9); <i>sisa</i>, “I will be gladdened [<i>sos asis</i>] in the Lord” (Isaiah 61:10); <i>simḥa</i>, “rejoice [<i>simḥu</i>] with Jerusalem” (Isaiah 66:10); <i>rina</i>, “sing [<i>roni</i>] and rejoice, daughter of Zion” (Zechariah 2:14); <i>pitzḥa</i>, “burst [<i>pitzḥi</i>] into song and rejoice” (Isaiah 54:1); <i>tzahala</i>, “shout [<i>tzahali</i>] and sing” (Isaiah 12:6); <i>alatza</i>, “my heart rejoices [<i>alatz</i>] in the Lord” (I Samuel 2:1); <i>elza</i>, “my heart exults [<i>vaya’aloz</i>], and with my song I give thanks to Him” (Psalms 28:7); <i>ḥedva</i>, “the children of Israel…performed [the dedication of this House of God with joy [<i>beḥedva</i>]]” (Ezra 6:16); <i>terua</i>, “shout with joy [<i>hariu</i>] to the Lord, all the earth” (Psalms 98:4), “shout [<i>hariu</i>] to God with a joyous voice” (Psalms 47:2). There are some who remove <i>terua</i> and insert <i>ditza</i>, just as you say: “Anguish rejoices [<i>tadutz</i>] before it” (Job 41:14); it dances like that mudfish.
Another matter, “let us exult and rejoice in you.” We learned there: If a man marries a woman and stays with her ten years and she has not given birth, he may not remain idle.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">He must take another wife in addition to or instead of the first wife in order to fulfill the mitzva of procreation.</i> Rabbi Idi said: There was an incident involving a certain woman in Sidon who stayed with her husband ten years and did not give birth. They came to Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai and sought to separate from one another. He said to them: ‘By your lives, just as you came together with food and drink,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">At your wedding feast.</i> so too, you shall separate only with food and drink.’ They followed his advice and made a celebration for themselves, made a great feast, and she got him to drink in excess.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">She hoped that he would agree to keep her as his wife even when he married another.</i> When he was in good spirits, he said to her: ‘My daughter, see any good item that I have in the house, take it, and go to your father’s house.’ What did she do? After he fell asleep, she motioned to her servants and maidservants and said to them: ‘Carry him in his bed and take him to my father’s house.’ At midnight he awakened from his slumber after his wine had abated. He said to her: ‘My daughter, where am I?’ She said to him: ‘In my father’s house.’ He said to her: ‘What am I doing in your father’s house?’ She said to him: ‘Is this not what you said to me in the evening: See any good item that I have in the house, take it, and go to your father’s house? There is no item in this world better for me than you.’ They went to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai and he stood and prayed for them and they were remembered,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">She conceived.</i> to teach you that just as the Holy One blessed be He remembers the barren, so too, the righteous cause the barren to be remembered. And [additional] matters may be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If a flesh and blood [woman], because she said to another of flesh and blood ‘there is no item in this world better for me than you,’ was remembered, Israel, who are waiting for the salvation of the Holy One blessed be He every day, and say: ‘There is nothing good in the world other than You,’ all the more so. That is, “let us exult and rejoice in you.”<br>[This is analogous] to a noblewoman whose husband the king, her sons, and her sons-in-law went to a country overseas. [Her servants] told her: ‘Your sons have come [home].’ She said: ‘What do I care? Let my daughters-in-law rejoice.’ They said to her: ‘Your sons-in-law have come.’ She said: ‘What do I care? Let my daughters rejoice.’ They said to her: ‘Your husband the king has come.’ She said: ‘This is complete joy, joy compounded by joy.’ So too, in the future, the prophets will come and say to Jerusalem: “Your sons will come from afar” (Isaiah 60:4), and it will say to them: What do I care? “Your daughters are carried on the side” (Isaiah 60:4), and it will say to them: What do I care? When they say to it: “Behold, your king is coming to you, righteous and victorious” (Zechariah 9:9), it says: This is complete joy, as it is written: “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, [behold your king is coming to you]” (Zechariah 9:9), and it is written: “Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion [for behold I am coming]” (Zechariah 2:14). At that moment, it says: “I will be gladdened in the Lord, my soul will exult in my God” (Isaiah 61:10).
Another matter, “let us exult and rejoice in you.” Rabbi Avin began: “This is the day that the Lord has made, we exult and rejoice in Him [<i>bo</i>]” (Psalms 118:24). Rabbi Avin said: We do not know regarding what to rejoice, whether the day, or the Holy One blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>bo</i> in the phrase “we exult and rejoice <i>bo</i>” can alternatively be translated “in it,” meaning the day, or “in Him,” referring to God.</i> Solomon came and specified: “Let us exult and rejoice in You,” in the Holy One blessed be He. In You, in Your salvation; in You, in Your Torah; in You, in fear of You.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">This is in line with the verse: “Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling” (Psalms 2:11) (Rabbi David Luria).</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “In You [<i>bakh</i>],” with the twenty-two letters that You wrote for us in the Torah, <i>beit</i>, two, <i>kaf</i>, twenty, that is <i>bakh</i>.
“We will recount your love through wine [<i>miyayin</i>],” through the wine of the Torah; the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, the laws of <i>Sukkot</i> on <i>Sukkot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Part of the joy of the festivals will be through studying the laws that pertain to that festival.</i> Alternatively, “we will recount your love through wine,” through the wine of the patriarchs;<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">In the version of this midrash cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (<i>Shir HaShirim</i> 982), it states that the actions of the patriarchs were more pleasing to God than the wine libations performed in the Temple (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> what actions did Adam the first man perform before You? Who performed actions before You like Abraham? Who performed actions before You like Isaac? Who performed actions before You like Jacob?
“Sincerely [<i>meisharim</i>] do they love you.” How upright [<i>yashiryan</i>] are the ones You love.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">The patriarchs.</i> How powerful are the ones You love. Rabbi Aivu said: Our patriarchs did everything that they did before You with great uprightness. Rabbi Ḥanin said: “That because you have done this thing” (Genesis 22:16); it was the tenth ordeal and you call it a “thing”?<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">As this was the last of Abraham’s ten ordeals, the verse should have used a plural term to refer to all of them rather than a singular term.</i> Had he not accepted this matter upon himself, he would have ruined and nullified all the previous ones; that is, “sincerely do they love you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">The ordeal of the binding of Isaac was so great that it outweighed all of Abraham’s other ordeals put together. By passing that ordeal, he demonstrated his great love and loyalty for God.</i>

Chapter 5

<b>“I am black but lovely, daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon” (Song of Songs 1:5).</b><br>“I am black but lovely,” black in terms of my actions but lovely in terms of the actions of my ancestors. “I am black but lovely,” the congregation of Israel said: I am black in terms of myself,<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">I acknowledge my sins and demand of myself that I improve in my service of God (Maharzu).</i> and am, therefore, lovely before my Creator, as it is written: “Are you not like Kushites to Me, children of Israel [– the utterance of the Lord]” (Amos 9:7), you are like Kushites in terms of yourselves, but to Me you are the children of Israel – the utterance of the Lord.<br>Another matter, I was black in Egypt and I was lovely in Egypt. I was black in Egypt; “they defied Me and were unwilling to heed Me” (Ezekiel 20:8). I was lovely in Egypt, with the blood of the Paschal offering and the blood of circumcision, as it is written: “I passed you, and I saw you wallowing in your blood, and I said to you: In your blood, you shall live” (Ezekiel 16:6); this is the blood of the Paschal offering; “I said to you: In your blood, you shall live” (Ezekiel 16:6); this is the blood of circumcision.<br>Another matter, I was black at the sea, as it is stated: “They rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7). And I was lovely at the sea, as it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). I was black at Mara, as it is stated: “The people complained against Moses, saying: What will we drink?” (Exodus 15:24). And I was lovely at Mara, as it is stated: “He cried to the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree and he cast it into the water and the waters were sweetened” (Exodus 15:25). I was black in Refidim, as it is stated: “He called the name of the place Masa and Meriva” (Exodus 17:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Masa and Meriva literally translate to “trial” and “dispute.”</i> And I was lovely in Refidim, as it is stated: “Moses built an altar, and he called its name: The Lord is my banner” (Exodus 17:15). I was black at Ḥorev, as it is stated: “They crafted a calf at Ḥorev” (Psalms 106:19). And I was lovely at Ḥorev, as it is stated: “Everything that the Lord stated we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). I was black in the wilderness, as it is stated: “How much they defied Him in the wilderness” (Psalms 78:40). And I was lovely in the wilderness with the establishment of the Tabernacle, as it is stated: “On the day the Tabernacle was established” (Numbers 9:15). I was black with the scouts, as it is stated: “They issued a slanderous report” (Numbers 13:32). And I was lovely with Joshua and Caleb, as it is stated: “Except Caleb ben Yefuneh the Kenizite [and Joshua son of Nun]” (Numbers 32:12). I was black in Shitim, as it is stated: “Israel settled in Shitim [and the people began engaging in harlotry]” (Numbers 25:1). And I was lovely in Shitim, as it is stated: “Pinḥas stood and prayed” (Psalms 106:30). I was black regarding Akhan, as it is stated: “The children of Israel trespassed regarding the proscribed spoils” (Joshua 7:1). And I was lovely regarding Joshua, as it is stated: “Joshua said to Akhan: My son, please give honor [to the Lord, God of Israel]” (Joshua 7:19). I was black regarding the kings of Israel and I was lovely regarding the kings of Judah. If with the black that I had, I was lovely, among My prophets, all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Many commentaries suggest that the text should read “lovely ones [<i>na’im</i>]” rather than “prophets [<i>neviim</i>]” (see, e.g., Maharzu; <i>Etz Yosef</i>). One interpretation of this statement is: If even at the places where I was black I was also lovely, how much more so in the places where I was not black.</i>
“I am black,” this is referring to Ahab, as it is stated: “It was when Ahab heard these matters that he rent his garments [and placed sackcloth upon his flesh, and he fasted]” (I Kings 21:27). How much did he fast? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Three hours. If he was accustomed to eat his meal at three hours, he ate at six, and if he would eat at six, he ate at nine. “He lay in sackcloth, and walked slowly” (I Kings 21:27). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He walked barefoot.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">One who walks barefoot often walks more slowly than usual. The point here is that although Ahab was a wicked king, and is therefore called “black,” he humbled himself before God and his repentance was accepted (see I Kings 21:29), and is therefore also “lovely.”</i> [Similarly,] regarding Yehoram, what is written? “The people saw, and behold, the sackcloth was upon his flesh underneath” (II Kings 6:30).<br>Rabbi Levi Bar Ḥaita said three approaches in regard to this [verse]: I am black all the days of the week and I am lovely on Shabbat. I am black all the days of the year and I am lovely on Yom Kippur. I am black regarding the Ten Tribes and I am lovely regarding the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.<br>I am black in this world and I am lovely in the World to Come.
“Daughters of Jerusalem,” the Rabbis say: Do not read it as “daughters of [<i>benot</i>] Jerusalem, but rather, builders of [<i>bonot</i>] Jerusalem. This is the Great Sanhedrin of Israel, which convenes and instructs them with regard to every question and judgment.<br>Another matter, “daughters of [<i>benot</i>] Jerusalem,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Jerusalem is destined to become a metropolis for all countries, and to draw [people] to it in streams, for its glory, as it is stated: “Ashdod, its towns, [<i>benoteha</i>] and its surrounding areas; Gaza, its towns, and its surrounding areas up to <Lasha>”<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">The word Lasha does not appear in the verse and its inclusion in the text of the midrash appears to be an error (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> (Joshua 15:47). This is the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “I will give them to you as daughters [<i>levanot</i>] and not due to your covenant” (Ezekiel 16:61). What is “<i>levanot</i>”? Towns. What is “not due to your covenant”? It is not due to your contract, but rather due to My contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">It is not because you have kept all of the responsibilities incumbent upon you due to our covenant; it is rather a gift from Me. Alternatively, the nations who will come to show honor to Jerusalem are not just the ten nations promised to Abraham in the Covenant of the Pieces, but rather are additional nations (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Beivai said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: “Sing, barren one, [who did not bear]” (Isaiah 54:1). What song is there for barrenness? Rather, “sing, barren one,” who did not bear children for Gehenna.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Israel was likened to a female, just as a female takes one-tenth of the property from her father and leaves, so, too, Israel inherited the land of the seven nations, which is one-tenth of the seventy nations. Because they inherited like a female, they sang songs in the feminine, as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song [<i>hashira hazot</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">These terms are in the feminine form.</i> to the Lord” (Exodus 15:1). But, in the future, they are destined to inherit like a male, who inherits all his father’s property; that is what is written: “From the eastern side to the western side, Judah, one portion” (Ezekiel 48:7). “Dan one portion…Asher one portion” (Ezekiel 48:1–2), and all of them so, and they speak in the masculine, as it is stated: “Sing to the Lord a new song [<i>shir ḥadash</i>]” (Psalms 96:1); <i>shira ḥadasha</i> is not written, but rather <i>shir ḥadash</i>.<br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi [said]: Why was Israel likened to a female? Just as a female loads and unloads,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">This means that she becomes pregnant and gives birth.</i> loads and unloads, and then unloads and does not load again, so, too, Israel is enslaved and redeemed, enslaved and redeemed, and is then redeemed and is never enslaved again. In this world, because their trouble is like the trouble of a female who gives birth,<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Their redemption is not permanent.</i> they sing songs in the feminine; however, in the World to Come, where their trouble is not like the trouble of one who gives birth, they sing songs in the masculine. That is what is written: “On that day this song [<i>hashir</i>] will be sung” (Isaiah 26:1).
“Like the tents of Kedar,” just as the tents of Kedar appear externally to be ugly, black, and in tatters, but internally they are gems and pearls, so too Torah scholars, even though they appear ugly and black in this world, internally there is Torah in them, Bible, Mishna, Midrash, <i>halakhot</i>, Talmud, <i>Tosefta</i>, and <i>aggada</i>. If so, just as tents of Kedar do not require laundering, perhaps the same is true of Israel; the verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon”—just as these curtains of Solomon are soiled and laundered, and are again soiled and laundered, so, too, Israel, even though they are soiled with sins all the days of the year, Yom Kippur arrives and atones for them, as it is stated: “For on this day He will atone for you” (Leviticus 16:30), and it is written: “If your sins will be like scarlet, they will be whitened as snow; if they will be reddened like crimson, they will be like wool” (Isaiah 1:18).<br>If so, just as the tents of Kedar are moved from place to place, perhaps the same is true of Israel. The verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon [<i>Shelomo</i>],” like the curtains<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">The heavens.</i> of the One [of Whom it may be stated] that the peace is His, the One Who spoke and the world came into being, that from the moment He spread them, they did not move from their place. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov taught: “A tent that will not be displaced [<i>yatzan</i>]” (Isaiah 33:20); it will not emerge [<i>yetze</i>] and will not move [<i>yanua</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yatzan</i> is an acronym of <i>yetze</i> and <i>yanua</i>.</i><br>Just as the tents of Kedar are not subject to the yoke of any creature,<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to nomads who live in the wilderness.</i> so too, Israel, in the future, will not be subject to the yoke of any creature. Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “I led you upright” (Leviticus 26:13); with an upright stature, without fear of any creature.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Although the verse cited is stated regarding the exodus from Egypt, it is understood as also alluding to the future redemption.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: Like Joseph; just as Joseph was sold to the tents of Kedar, as it is stated: “They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites… [and they brought Joseph to Egypt]” (Genesis 37:28), and he then purchased his purchasers, as it is stated: “Joseph purchased all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 47:20), so too Israel: “They will be captors of their captors” (Isaiah 14:2).

Chapter 6

<b>“Do not look at me that I am dark, that the sun has tanned me. My mother’s sons were incensed at me; they placed me as guard of the vineyards; I did not guard my own vineyard” (Song of Songs 1:6).</b><br>“Do not look at me that I am dark.” Rabbi Simon began: “Do not slander a servant to his master” (Proverbs 30:10). Israel were called servants, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are servants to Me” (Leviticus 25:55), and the prophets were called servants, as it is stated: “Unless He has revealed His secret to His servants, the prophets” (Amos 3:7). So said the congregation of Israel to the prophets: ‘Do not see me in my darkness.’<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Even when Israel is guilty, the prophet must not demean them because of their sins.</i> There is none who rejoiced more in my sons than Moses, and because he said: “Hear me now, defiant ones” (Numbers 20:10), it was decreed upon him that he would not enter the land.<br>Another matter, there is none who rejoiced more in my sons than Isaiah, but because he said: “I live in the midst of a people with impure lips” (Isaiah 6:5), the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Isaiah, you are permitted to say about yourself: “For I am a man with impure lips” (Isaiah 6:5), that is fine; perhaps [you think it is acceptable to also say] “I live in the midst of a people with impure lips”? I am astonished! Come see what is written there: “One of the seraphim flew to me and in his hand a coal [<i>ritzpa</i>]”’ (Isaiah 6:6). Rav Shmuel said: <i>Ritzpa</i> [is a conjunction of the words] <i>rotz peh</i>, smash the mouth of one who slandered My children.<br>It is written similarly in Elijah’s regard, as it is stated: “He said: I have been zealous for the Lord, God of hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant; [they have destroyed Your altars and killed Your prophets by sword.

What are <i>retzafim</i>? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: <i>Ritzpa</i>, <i>rotz peh</i>, smash the mouth of anyone who slandered My children.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan cites it from this: “A prophecy of Damascus: Behold, Damascus…. Abandoned are the cities of Aroer” (Isaiah 17:1–2). Why is he standing in Damascus and mentioning Aroer? Is Aroer not within the boundaries of the land of Moav?<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">It is strange that the prophet mentions Aroer, a Moavite city, in a prophecy about Damascus, which was in the kingdom of Aram.</i> Rather, there were three hundred and sixty-five houses of idol worship in Damascus, corresponding to the days of the solar year, and they would worship in each and every one of them on its day. They had one day when they would visit all of them on that day and worship them [all]. Israel made all [the idols] jointly sovereign over them and worshipped them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel continued to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they served the Be'alim [and the Ashtarot, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moav, and the gods of the children of Amon, and the gods of the Philistines]” (Judges 10:6). When Elijah slandered Israel, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Elijah, instead of indicting these, come and indict those.’ That is what is written: “Go, return on your path to the wilderness of Damascus” (I Kings 19:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">God indicated to Elijah that he should speak in an accusatory manner regarding Damascus rather than regarding Israel.</i> <br>Rabbi Abahu and Reish Lakish were entering one of the neighborhoods of Caesarea. Rabbi Abahu said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: ‘Why is it that we have entered into a neighborhood of cursers and blasphemers?’ Reish Lakish dismounted from his donkey and collected sand and placed it in [Rabbi Abahu’s] mouth. [Rabbi Abahu] said to him: ‘Why did you do that?’ He said to [Rabbi Abahu]: ‘The Holy One blessed be He does not want one who slanders Israel.’
“That the sun has tanned me,” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: It is written: “For My people have performed two evils” (Jeremiah 2:13). Did they not forsake many more [than two commandments]? Rather, it teaches that they performed one that is as severe as two, as they prostrated themselves to idols while exposing themselved toward the Temple. That is what is written: “He brought me to the inner courtyard of the House… [twenty-five men, their backs toward the Sanctuary of the Lord and their faces to the east…to the sun]” (Ezekiel 8:16). Just as you say: “Their corruption is in them, a blemish is in them” (Leviticus 22:25).<br>Another matter, “that the sun has tanned me,” because I prepared horse-drawn chariots for the sun, as it is written: “He abolished the horses that the kings of Judah had designated for the sun, from going to the House of the Lord” (II Kings 23:11). <sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">The kings of Judah had horse-drawn chariots rush toward the rising sun as a form of honor and worship.</i>
Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding the war with Midyan.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">This war was conducted to avenge the fact that twenty-four thousand Israelites died in a plague as a result of idolatry they committed after being seduced by Moavite and Midyanite women. See Numbers chapter 25.</i> You find that when Israel went out to the war with Midyan, they would enter in pairs to a woman, and one would blacken her face and one would remove her jewelry. She would say to them: ‘Are we not creations of the Holy One blessed be He, that you are doing this to us?’ The Israelites would say to them: ‘It it not enough for you that we received our punishment because of you?’ That is what is written: “The Lord said to Moses: Take all the leaders of the people, and hang them for the Lord opposite the sun, [and the enflamed wrath of the Lord will be withdrawn from Israel]” (Numbers 25:4). Rabbi Aivu said: What was the sin? “They cleaved to Baal Peor” (Psalms 106:28).<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was an incident involving a certain provincial woman, who had a Kushite maidservant who descended to draw water from the spring, she and her friend. She said to her friend: ‘My friend, tomorrow my master is going to divorce his wife and take me as a wife.’ [The friend] said to her: ‘Why?’ [The maidservant answered:] ‘Because he saw her hands blackened with coal.’ [The friend] said to her: ‘What a world-class fool, let your ears here what your mouth is saying. If his wife, who is exceedingly beloved to him, you say that he wishes to divorce her because he saw her hands blackened with coal, you who are completely black from your mother’s womb [and will be black] all your life, all the more so.’ So too, because the nations of the world taunt Israel and say: ‘This nation has exchanged their Glory,’ as it is stated: “They exchanged their glory [for the cast image of a grass-eating bull]” (Psalms 106:20), Israel says to them: ‘If we, who did so for a single moment, are liable in this manner, you, all the more so.’<br>Moreover, Israel says to the nations of the world: ‘We will tell you to what we are comparable; to the son of kings who went out to the wilderness outside the city and the sun beat down on his head and his face darkened. He entered the city, and with a little water and a little bathing from the bathhouse, his body whitened and he regained his previous beauty. So it is with us; [even] if the sun of idol worship has darkened us, you are darkened from your mother’s womb, for even when you were in your mother’s womb you worshipped idols. How so? When a pregnant woman enters her house of idol worship, she bows and prostrates herself to the idol, she and her son.’
“My mother’s sons were incensed at me.” Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei.

That is: “I did not guard my own vineyard.”<br>Another matter, “my mother’s sons were incensed at me”—the members of my nation, this is Yerovam ben Nevat. “Were incensed at me”—they assailed me; they filled the Judge with enflamed wrath against me. “They placed me as guard of the vineyards,” the guarding of Yerovam’s two calves, “I did not guard my own vineyard,” I did not maintain the priestly and Levite watches. That is: “I did not guard my own vineyard.”<br>Rabbi Levi said: On the day that Solomon married the daughter of Pharaoh Nekho, [the angel] Mikhael, the great prince, descended from the heavens and inserted a large reed into the sea. Mud arose on this side and that, and made that place like a thicket. It became the location of Rome.<br>On the day that Yerovam ben Nevat established the two golden calves, two towers were built in Rome. They would build them and they would collapse, build them and they would collapse. There was one elderly man there named Abba Kolon.

<b>“Tell me, he whom my soul loves, where do you herd, where do you rest your flock at noon? Why should I be as one bound to the flocks of your companions” (Song of Songs 1:7).</b><br>“Tell me, he whom my soul loves,” Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon interpreted the verse regarding Moses.

Rabbi Berekhya interpreted it regarding this verse: “May the Lord, God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint [a man over the congregation]” (Numbers 27:16). “May the Lord…appoint”—[Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, since you are ousting me from the world, inform me who are the shepherds whom You are installing over Your children.’ Where is the matter articulated? “Tell me, he whom my soul loves,” the nation that my soul loves, the nation to whom I dedicated my life; “where do you herd,” during the period of the monarchy; “where do you rest your flock at noon,” when [Israel is] subjudgated to [foreign] kingdoms. “Why [<i>shalama</i>] should I be as one bound [<i>keoteya</i>]?” Rabbi Azarya said: <i>Shalama</i>, that I will not [<i>shelo</i>] become as nothing [<i>lema</i>] in the eyes of Your companions<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the patriarchs.</i> regarding their flocks.

Similarly, Moses requested that God appoint good leaders over the nation after him so as to avoid a desecration of Gdod’s name.</i> The Rabbis say: So that your children will not see that their trouble is trouble and deviate [<i>yatu</i>] from following You and cleave to the flocks of Your companions,<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the nations of the world.</i> just as you say: “Can the seat of wickedness be Your companion?” (Psalms 94:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">This verse demonstrates that the nations of the world can be referred to as companions of God.</i> <br>At that moment the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Moses, you say to Me: “Where do you herd, where do you rest your flock,” by your life, if you do not know, ultimately, you will know,’ as it is stated: “If you do not know, fairest among women” (Song of Songs 1:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew phrase generally translated “if you do not know” can also be translated “shall you not know,” and that is how the midrash is interpreting it here.</i><br>Another matter, “if you do not know, fairest among women,” fairest among prophets, the most outstanding among the prophets.

Chapter 8

<b>“If you do not know, fairest among women, go out in the footsteps of the flock, and herd your kids by the tents of the shepherds” (Song of Songs 1:8).</b><br>“Go out in the footsteps of [<i>be’ikvei</i>] the flock.” Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Akiva, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer says: From the coal-baked loaf that the Israelites took in their hands from Egypt, from which they ate for thirty-one days, as Rabbi Shila said: You know that there were sixty-two meals for the Israelites from this coal-baked loaf, [you know] what I [God] will do for them at the end, ultimately [<i>be’akev</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash draws an allusion to this from the term <i>be’ikvei</i> in the verse, and portrays God as responding to Moses’s doubts by assuring him that just as He provided for Israel miraculously in the desert, He will provide at the end of days as well.</i> That is what is written: “There will be abundance of grain in the land” (Psalms 72:16). Rabbi Akiva says: From the fact that I surrounded them with clouds of glory, just as you say: “The Lord was going before them by day…. The pillar of cloud by day…departed not [from before the people]” (Exodus 13:21–22), you know what I will do at the end, ultimately. That is what is written: “There will be a shelter for them for shade by day” (Isaiah 4:6). The Rabbis say: From what I gave them to eat in the wilderness, that was sweeter than milk and honey, you know what I will do for them at the end, ultimately, as it is stated: “It will be on that day, that the mountains will drip nectar” (Joel 4:18).<br>Another matter, “go out in the footsteps of the flock,” [God] said to him [Moses]: ‘Ultimately, the entire flock will depart and you will depart last.’ It is not that Moses was indolent, but rather, the Israelites were engaged in plunder and Moses was engaged in the mitzva of Joseph, just as you say: “Moses took Joseph’s bones with him” (Exodus 13:19).<br>Another matter, “go out in the footsteps of the flock,” He said to him: ‘Ultimately, this entire generation will die, and you will be like them.’ What was the cause of this matter? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It was due [to his conduct] at the bush, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: All the seven days of the bush, the Holy One blessed be He was enticing Moses to go on His mission to Egypt, as it is stated: “Moses said to the Lord: I am not a man of words, not yesterday, not the day before, and not since You spoke to Your servant” (Exodus 4:10).

Ultimately, it was said to him: ‘It is not yours, it is your brother Aaron’s.’ That is what is written: “It was on the eighth day, Moses called Aaron” (Leviticus 9:1).<br>Rabbi Ḥelbo said: All seven days of Adar, Moses was appeasing and entreating before the Holy One blessed be He that he might enter the land. Ultimately, He said to him: “For you will not cross this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27). “Herd your kids,” the kids are entering, the goats are not entering. “By the tents of the shepherds,” the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will tell you until when you will stand over My people and herd them.’ “By the tents of [<i>mishkenot</i>] the shepherds [<i>ro’im</i>]”—on the thorns,<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Siḥon and Og.</i> that is on the land of the wicked [<i>ra’im</i>] and hard men who had been in it, Siḥon and Og.<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Moses led the Israelites until they had conquered the lands of Siḥon and Og, but he did not take them any further.</i>

Chapter 9

<b>“To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots I have likened you, my love” (Song of Songs 1:9).</b><br>“To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots,” Rabbi Papis expounded: “He is of one mind, and who can respond to Him?” (Job 23:13). He alone judges all creatures, and one may not challenge the words of the One who spoke and the world came into being. Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis, one may not challenge the words of the One who spoke and the world came into being, because everything is true and everything is just,’ as it is written: “I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne” (Isaiah 6:1). Rabbi Simon said: It is a throne that distinguishes between death and life. “And all the host of the heavens attending Him on His right and on His left” (I Kings 22:19). Is there left On High? But is it not all right, as it it is stated: “Your right, Lord, is glorious in power; Your right, Lord, smashes the enemy” (Exodus 15:6)? Why, then, does the verse state: “On His right and on His left”? Rather, these incline to the right and these incline to the left; these advocate exoneration and these advocate condemnation. Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Aḥa cites it from here: “The truth of the matter and a great host” (Daniel 10:1). One arrives at the truth when it is accomplished with a great host, as it is written: “The Lord God is truth” (Jeremiah 10:10). What is truth? Rabbi Aivun said: That He is the living God and King of the universe.<br>Rabbi Elazar said: Anywhere that it is stated: “And the Lord,” it is He and His court. The paradigm of them all [is the verse]: “And the Lord has spoken evil in your regard” (I Kings 22:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is the culmination of a passage in which the prophet Mikhaihu, speaking to King Ahab, begins: “I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left” (I Kings 22:19).</i> That is the paradigm of them all. How, then, does Rabbi Elazar interpret that verse of Rabbi Papis: “He is of one mind, and who can respond to Him”? Rather, He alone seals the verdict for all creatures and no being seals it with Him. What is the seal of the Holy One blessed be He? Rabbi Beivai said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: Truth, as it is stated: “However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writ of truth” (Daniel 10:21). If truth, why inscribed, and if inscribed, why truth?<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">The implication of “truth” is that it is indelible, while the implication of “inscribed” is that it can be erased.</i> Rather, until the ruling is signed, it is “inscribed”; once the ruling is signed, it is “truth.”<br>Reish Lakish said: Why is it “truth [<i>emet</i>]”? <i>Alef</i> is the first of the letters, <i>mem</i> is in the middle, and <i>tav</i> is at their end; this is to say: “I am first and I am last and aside from Me there is no God” (Isaiah 44:6). “I am first,” as I did not receive My kingdom from another. “And I am last,” as I will not transfer it to another, as there is none [other] in the world. “And aside from Me there is no God,” as there is no second to Me.
Rabbi Papis expounded: “Behold, the man has become like one [<i>ke’aḥad</i>] of us” (Genesis 3:22), like the Unique One [<i>keyeḥido</i>] of the world. Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis.’<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">One cannot suggest a parallel between any being and God.</i> He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘How do you interpret [the phrase] “has become like one of us”?’ [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Like one of the ministering angels.’ The Rabbis say: It is neither in accordance with the statement of this one, nor in accordance with the statement of that one, but rather it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He presented two paths before him, the path of life and the path of death. He [Adam] chose the path of death and forsook the path of life.
Rabbi Papis expounded: “They exchanged their glory for the cast image of a [grass-eating] bull” (Psalms 106:20).

It turned to flee but was seized with trembling [<i>retet</i>]” (Jeremiah 49:24).
Rabbi Papis expounded: “To a mare [<i>lesusati</i>] in Pharaoh's chariots”—<i>lesisati</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>lesusati</i> is written without a<i> vav</i> such that it can also be read <i>lesisati</i>.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Just as I was gladdened [<i>sasti</i>] to eliminate the Egyptians at the sea, so I would have been gladdened to eliminate the enemies of Israel.’<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">The “enemies of Israel” is used here as a euphemism for the people of Israel themselves.</i> Who caused them to be saved? “On their right and on their left” (Exodus 14:22); due to the merit of the Torah thay they were destined to receive from the right of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “From His right, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “And on their left,” this is <i>mezuza</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mezuza</i> is situated to the left of the door when one is leaving the house. They were saved partially in the merit of their future fulfillment of the mitzva of<i> mezuza</i>.</i> Alternatively, on their right, this is reciting <i>Shema</i>, “and on their left,” this is [the <i>Amida</i>] prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Like the right, reciting <i>Shema</i> is superior because in it one does not request fulfillment of his own needs. By contrast, in the <i>Amida</i> prayer we request fulfillment of our own needs. This is exemplified in the verse: “Length of days is on its right; on its left is wealth and honor” (Proverbs 3:16) (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis. Every place that gladness [<i>sisa</i>] is stated, it is written with a <i>sin</i>, and here with a <i>samekh</i>.’ He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘How do you interpret [the phrase] “to a mare in Pharaoh's chariots”?’ [Rabbi Akiva answered:] ‘Pharaoh mounted a stallion, and the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, revealed Himself on a stallion. That is what is written: “He mounted a cherub and flew” (Psalms 18:11). Pharaoh said: ‘A stallion kills its owners in war;<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">This is because its conduct is more aggressive.</i> rather, I will ride on a mare.’ That is what is written: “To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots.” Pharaoh then rode on a red horse, on a white horse, or on a black one. As it were, the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on a red, white, and black horse. That is what is written: “You trampled in the sea with Your horses” (Habakkuk 3:15), interchanging horses.<br>The wicked Pharaoh emerged with armor and a helmet; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated; “He donned righteousness like armor [and a helmet of salvation on His head]” (Isaiah 59:17). [Pharaoh] brought naphtha;<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">A flammable liquid, which he brought in order to use in battle.</i> as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Hail and coals of fire passed through His clouds” (Psalms 18:13). [Pharaoh] brought catapult stones; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “And the Lord provided thunder and hail” (Exodus 9:23). [Pharaoh brought] swords and spears; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Many bolts of lightning” (Psalms 18:15). [Pharaoh] brought arrows; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He shot His arrows” (Psalms 18:15). Rabbi Levi said: “He shot his arrows and dispersed them” (Psalms 18:15) [teaches] that the arrows would scatter them; “many bolts of lightning and they confounded them” (Psalms 18:15) teaches that they would confuse them and confound them. He removed their banners<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Without the banners, the formation of their camp disintegrated.</i> and they did not know what they were doing.<br>Pharaoh emerged in full armor; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord will emerge like a mighty man” (Isaiah 42:13). [Pharaoh] thundered with his voice; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord would thunder from the heavens” (II Samuel 22:14). [Pharaoh] heartened them [his soldiers] with his voice; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated]: The Most High would project His voice” (II Samuel 22:14). Pharaoh emerged with fury; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “With fury You trod the earth” (Habakkuk 3:12). [Pharaoh emerged] with a bow; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “Your bow will be bared” (Habakkuk 3:9). [Pharaoh emerged] with shield and armor; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “Grasp Your shield and armor” (Psalms 35:2). [Pharaoh emerged] with a flashing spear; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “The glow of the flash of Your spear” (Habakkuk 3:11).<br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: When Paharaoh exhausted all his weapons, the Holy One blessed be He began exalting over him. He said to him: ‘Wicked one, do you have wind, do you have a cherub, do you have wings?’ From where did the Holy One blessed be He cause them to fly [to the sea]? Rabbi Yudan said: The Holy One blessed be He removed them from between the wheels of the Divine Chariot and flew them at the sea. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: One who is flesh and blood rides upon something that carries him, and it is an item that has substance; however, the Holy One blessed be He is not so; He carries what He rides upon, and He rides upon an item that has no substance. That is what is written: “He mounted a cherub and flew, and He soared on wings of wind” (Psalms 18:11).<br>One verse says: “He soared [on wings of wind]” and one verse says: “He was seen on wings of wind” (II Samuel 22:11). In what sense can both verses be reconciled? Rabbi Aḥa said: From here [it may be derived] that the Holy One blessed be He has had many worlds and He emerges to be seen in them.
“I have likened you [<i>dimitikh</i>], my love,” Rabbi Eliezer said: [This is analogous] to a princess who was taken captive and her father was about to redeem her. She was motioning to her captors and saying to them: ‘I am for you, I am yours, and I will follow you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">She said this out of fear of what they might do to her if her father was unable to redeem her.</i> Her father said to her: ‘Do you believe that I do not have the wherewithal to redeem you? I am silencing you [<i>duma dimitikh</i>], be silent.’ So too, when the Israelites were encamped at the sea: “Egypt pursued them and overtook them encamped by the sea” (Exodus 14:9). The Israelites, in their fear, were motioning to the Egyptians and saying to them: ‘We are for you, we are yours, and we will follow you.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Do you believe that I do not have the wherewithal to redeem you? I am silencing you [<i>duma dimitikh</i>], I have silenced you.’ That is what is written: “The Lord will wage war for you and you shall be silent” (Exodus 14:14).
Another matter, “I have likened you [<i>dimitikh</i>], my love,” the Rabbis say: Because Israel appeared like mares, and [the horses of] the wicked Egyptians were aroused stallions, and they were pursuing them until they sank in the sea. Rabbi Simon said: Heaven forbid, Israel did not appear like mares, but rather the waves of the sea appeared like mares and [the horses of] the wicked Egyptians were aroused stallions, and they pursued them until they sank them in the sea. The Egyptian would say to his horse: ‘Yesterday, I would drag you to the Nile and you would not follow me, and now, you are sinking me in the sea?’ The horse would say to its rider: “He cast into the sea [<i>rama bayam</i>]” (Exodus 15:1); see what is in the sea [<i>re’eh ma bayam</i>]. A trap is prepared for you in the sea. Rabbi Yishmael taught: “The Lord overthrew Egypt in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27); it teaches that the horse would cast its rider upward and he would descend downward with the horse above him. Rabbi Levi said: Like one who stirs a pot; what is below rises to the top and what is above descends below.<br>“My love [<i>rayati</i>]”—what is <i>rayati</i>? Rabbi Yonatan said: My benefactor; it is they who provide for Me two daily continual offerings. That is what is written: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning” (Numbers 28:4), as Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Israel would sacrifice two continual offerings each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The one in the morning was sacrificed for transgressions that were performed at night, and the one in the afternoon was sacrificed for transgressions that were performed during the day. There was, then, no person in Jerusalem who would remain overnight with iniquity ascribed to him, as it is stated: “Righteousness would dwell there” (Isaiah 1:21).<br>Another matter, “I have likened you, my love [<i>rayati</i>]”—the shepherds [<i>rayata</i>] of My world, as you accepted the Torah. Had you not accepted it, I would have restored My world to emptiness and disorder, as Rabbi Ḥanina said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: It is written: “The earth and all its inhabitants melt away; I set its pillars firm, Selah” (Psalms 75:4). Had Israel not stood at Mount Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7), the world would have melted away and returned to emptiness and disorder. Who firmly established the world? “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars firm, Selah.” Due to the merit of “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Due to the fact that Israel accepted the Torah, represented by the first of the Ten Commandments, “I am the Lord your God,” God set the the world on a firm foundation.</i> “I set its pillars firm.”

Chapter 10

<b>“Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with beads” (Song of Songs 1:10).</b><br>“Your cheeks are lovely”—just as these cheeks were created only for speech, so too, Moses and Aaron were created only for speech; “with ornaments [<i>batorim</i>],” with two Torahs, written and oral.<br>Another matter, <i>batorim</i>, many Torahs; that is what is written: “This is the law [<i>tora</i>] of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 6:2); “this is the law [<i>tora</i>] of the meal offering” (Leviticus 6:7); “this is the law [<i>tora</i>] of the guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:1); “this is the law [<i>tora</i>] of the peace offering” (Leviticus 7:11). “This is the law [<i>tora</i>] of a person when he dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14).<br>Another matter, <i>batorim</i>, with two countenances [<i>te’arim</i>], with two brothers, these are Moses and Aaron, whose countenances were favorable to each other. This one rejoiced over the prominence of the other and that one rejoiced over the prominence of the other. Rabbi Pinḥas said: It is written: “He will speak to the people on your behalf, and he will be a mouth for you, and you will be an <i>elohim</i> for him” (Exodus 4:16). [“He will be a mouth for you,”] a disseminator. “And you will be an <i>elohim</i> for him,” did Moses become a god for Aaron that you say: “And you will be an <i>elohim</i> for him”? Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Moses, just as fear of Me is upon you, so too, your fear will be upon your brother.’ But he did not do so. Rather, “Moses and Aaron went and they assembled all the elders of the children of Israel; Aaron spoke all the matters” (Exodus 4:29–30). [Moses] equated his shoulder to [Aaon’s] shoulder,<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">They stood shoulder to shoulder and treated each other as equals. Thus, Moses did not send Aaron to do his bidding; they worked together.</i> as this one still rejoiced over the prominence of the other, and that one over the prominence of the other.<br>From where [is it derived] that Aaron rejoiced over Moses’s prominence? As it is stated: “He will see you and he will rejoice in his heart” (Exodus 4:14). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The heart that rejoiced over the prominence of Moses his brother will don the Urim and the Tumim. That is what is written: “You shall place the Urim and the Tumim in the breastplate of judgment and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart” (Exodus 28:30).<br>From where [is it derived] that Moses rejoiced over Aaron’s prominence? As it is stated: “It is like fine oil on the head, descending onto the beard, the beard of Aaron” (Psalms 133:2). Rabbi Aḥa said: Did Aaron have two beards, as it is written: “Descending onto the beard, the beard of Aaron”?<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Why does it say the word beard twice?</i> Rather, when Moses saw the anointing oil descending onto the beard of Aaron, it was comparable for him as though it descended onto the beard of Moses, and he rejoiced; therefore, it is stated: “Onto the beard, the beard of Aaron.”
“Your neck with beads,” these are the seventy members of Sanhedrin who were strung after them,<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">They were ardent followers of Moses and Aaron.</i> as on a string of pearls.<br>Another matter, “your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,” these are the Bible teachers and the Mishna teachers who teach the children faithfully. “Your neck with beads,” these are the children. Alternatively, “your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,” these are the Sages. “Your neck with beads,” these are the students who crane their necks to hear matters of Torah from [the Sages’] mouths, like a person who has never before heard matters of Torah.
Another matter, “your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,” when they explore the <i>halakha</i> with each other, like Rabbi Abba bar Mimi and his colleagues. “Your neck with beads,” when they would string together matters of Torah, from Torah to Prophets, and from Prophets to Writings, and fire is ignited around them, and the matters were as joyful as when they were given from Sinai. At their primary giving from Mount Sinai, were they not given in fire, as it is stated: “The mountain was burning with fire to the heart of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:11)?<br>Ben Azai was sitting and expounding and fire was surrounding him. They went and told Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi, ben Azai is sitting and expounding and fire is burning around him. [Rabbi Akiva] went to him and said to him: ‘I heard that you were expounding and fire was buring around you.’ He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘Yes.’ [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Perhaps you were engaged in the esoterica of the Divine Chariot?’ He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘No, but rather I was sitting and stringing together matters of Torah, from Torah to Prophets, and from Prophets to Writings, and the matters were as joyful as when they were given from Sinai, and as sweet as when they were first given. At their primary giving from Mount Sinai, were they not given in fire? That is what is written: “The mountain was burning with fire” (Deuteronomy 4:11).’ Rabbi Abahu was sitting and expounding and fire was burning around him. He said: ‘Am I perhaps not stringing together matters of Torah properly? As Rabbi Levi said: There are those who know to string but do not know to drill and there are those who know to drill but do not know to string. However, I was stringing and I was drilling.’<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to drilling and stringing pearls. The metaphor is that one must delve deeply in one’s Torah study and then properly tie together the matters analyzed. Rabbi Abahu said that the fire was burning around him as he studied because he had followed all of those steps.</i> <br>Another matter, “your cheeks are lovely with ornaments [<i>batorim</i>],” when they read matters of Torah in their sequence [<i>betoreihen</i>]; the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover on Passover, the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, and the <i>halakhot</i> of<i> Sukkot</i> on<i> Sukkot</i>. Just as you say: “When the turn [<i>tor</i>] of each and every young woman would come” (Esther 2:12). “Your neck with beads,” Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina: These are the portions of the Torah that are linked to each other, lead one to another, leap one to another,<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">That which is unclear or missing from one passage is clarified or filled in from a different passage (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> are comparable one to another, and are related one to another. Like this, that is written: “To these the land will be divided as an inheritance” (Numbers 26:53). What is written there? “The daughters of Tzelofḥad approached” (Numbers 27:1), “the daughters of Tzelofḥad speak correctly” (Numbers 27:7), and it is written thereafter: “Ascend to this highland of Avarim” (Numbers 27:12),<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash cites verses from three consecutive passages: Moses took a census of the Israelites, following which God commanded that the Land of Israel be eventually divided among those counted in that census (Numbers 26:1–56). The daughters of Tzelofḥad came to Moses to request that although only men were counted in the census, since their father had died without sons, his portion should go to his daughters. Moses consulted God, who said that in a case where a man dies without sons, he is inherited by his daughters (Numbers 27:1–11). Then God commanded Moses to ascend to Avarim, where he would die, and Moses asked God to appoint a successor to lead the Israelites, and God appointed Joshua (Numbers 27:12–23).</i> which is Mount Nevo.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 32:49.</i> What does this have to do with that? Since the land was divided, the daughters of Tzelofḥad came to Moses to receive their portion and Moses recused himself from their case. That is what is written: “Moses brought their case before [the Lord]” (Numbers 27:5). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, from their case you recuse yourself, but you do not remove yourself from before Me?<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">You continue pleading before Me to allow you to enter the Land.</i> “Ascend to this highland of Avarim.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was told that he may see the Land from the mountain, and that after seeing the Land he would die without entering it.</i> He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, since You are expelling me from the world, what leaders are You appointing for Israel?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Is it necessary for you to command Me regarding My children; “will you command Me regarding My handiwork” (Isaiah 45:11)? Before you command Me regarding My children,<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’s request is expressed in a somewhat assertive manner: “Let the Lord appoint a man” (Numbers 27:16).</i> command My children in My regard.’ This is that is written: “Command the children and say to them” (Numbers 28:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">This introduces the command to bring the daily continual offerings.</i> To what is this matter analogous? It is to a king’s wife who was departing from the world. She said to him: ‘By the life of my lord, the king, I command you regarding my children.’ He said to her: ‘Before you command me regarding my children, command my children in my regard.’ So it was when Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, since You are expelling me from the world, what leaders are You appointing over them?’

<b>“We will make you golden rings with studs of silver” (Song of Songs 1:11).</b><br>“We will make you golden rings.” “We will make you golden rings,” this is the plunder at the sea; “with studs of silver,” this is the plunder of Egypt. Just like the difference between silver and gold, so was the property at the sea more valuable than the plunder of Egypt, as it is stated: “You came with ornaments upon ornaments [<i>ba’adi adayim</i>]” (Ezekiel 16:7). <i>Ba’adi</i>, this is the plunder of Egypt, <i>adayim</i>, this is the plunder at the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adayim</i> is a plural term while <i>adi</i> is singular, implying that the Egyptian property recovered by the Israelites at the sea was significantly more valuable than the Egyptian property the Israelites took with them from Egypt.</i> <br>Another matter, “we will make you golden rings,” this is the Torah that Alekulin learned from the knowledge of the Holy One blessed be He. “With studs of silver,” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: These are the letters.

<b>“While the king was at his feast, my nard released its fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:12).</b><br>“While the king was at his feast,” Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Meir says: While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Israel released a foul odor and said to the calf: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). Rabbi Yehuda said to him: ‘Enough, Meir, one does not expound Song of Songs disparagingly, but rather, favorably, as Song of Songs was given only in praise of Israel. What is: “While the king was at his feast”? While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Israel released a fine fragrance before Mount Sinai, and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7).<br>According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, it should have said: My stench released its odor.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse was referring to the Golden Calf, it should have referred to stench rather than the fragrance of the sweet-smelling nard.</i> Rather, a treatise ascended in their hand from the Diaspora,<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is citing an ancient tradition recorded in a treatise that was transported from Babylon during the Return to Zion to build the second Temple.</i> and they taught in its regard that He skipped the incident of the calf for them and the act of the Tabernacle preceded it.<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf (Exodus chap. 32) should have been recorded in the Torah immediately following the events of the revelation at Sinai.

Therefore, the verse characterizes their odor as nard.</i><br>Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Eliezer says: “While the king was at his feast,” while the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Mount Sinai was already enveloped in flames, as it is stated: “The mountain was burning with fire” (Deuteronomy 4:11).

[This is analogous] to a king who decreed: On such and such day I will enter the province. The residents of the province slept through the night and when the king arrived, he found them asleep. He positioned trumpets, horns, and a shofar, the governor of that province awakened them and brought them out to meet the king, and the king walked before them until he reached his palace. So too, the Holy One blessed be He arrived early, as it is stated: “It was on the third day when it was morning,” and it is written: “For on the third day, the Lord will descend before the eyes of the entire people” (Exodus 19:11). Israel slept through that entire night because sleep during [the season of] <i>Shavuot</i> is pleasant and the night is short. Rabbi Yudan said: Not even a flea stung them. The Holy One blessed be He came and found them asleep. He began positioning trumpets; that is what is written: “It was on the third day when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning” (Exodus 19:16), and Moses was awakening them and taking them out to meet the King of kings the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Moses took the people out of the camp toward God” (Exodus 19:17). The Holy One blessed be He was walking before them until He reached Mount Sinai, as it is written: “The entire Mount Sinai was smoking [because the Lord had descended]” (Exodus 19:18). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is why He taunted them through Isaiah, as it is stated: “Why have I come and there is no man, I called and there is no one to answer? Is My hand insufficient for redemption?” (Isaiah 50:2).
Rabbi Yudan said: While Hezekiah and his entourage were partaking of their Paschal offerings in Jerusalem, the Holy One blessed be He had already come earlier that night, as it is stated: “It was on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians” (II Kings 19:35).<br>Rabbi Abahu said: While Moses and the Israelites were reclining and partaking of their Paschal offerings in Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He had already come earlier, as it is stated: “It was at midnight, and the Lord smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:29). According to the opinion of Rabbi Abahu it should have said: My stench released its odor. It teaches that the odor of that blood was intolerable, but the Holy One blessed be He provided them with a fine fragrance from the spices of the Garden of Eden<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">They wished to partake of the Paschal offering that had been prepared with those spices.</i> and their souls desired to partake of it. They said to him: ‘Moses our master, give us something to eat.’ Moses said to them: ‘This is what the Holy One blessed be He said to me: “No foreigner shall partake of it”’ (Exodus 12:43). They rose and separated the foreigners that were in their midst. Their soul desired to partake. They said to him: ‘Moses our master, give us something to eat.’ Moses said to them: ‘This is what the Holy One blessed be He said to me: “And any man’s slave, purchased with silver: you shall circumcise him, then he shall partake of it”’ (Exodus 12:44). They rose and circumcised their slaves. Their soul desired to partake. They said to him: ‘Give us something to eat.’ He said to them: ‘This is what the Holy One blessed be He said to me: The principle is: “All uncircumcised men shall not partake of it”’ (Exodus 12:48). Immediately, each and every one of them placed his sword on his thigh and circumcised himself.<br>Who circumcised them? Rabbi Berekhya said: Moses was the circumciser, Aaron uncovered,<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">After cutting the foreskin, one then pulls back a membrane and uncovers the corona.</i> and Joshua gave them to drink. Some say: Joshua was the circumciser, Aaron uncovered, and Moses gave them to drink; that is what is written: “At that time, the Lord said to Joshua: Make flint knives for yourself and circumcise the children of Israel again, a second time” (Joshua 5:2). Why “a second time”? From here [it may be derived] that he had circumcised them the first time. Immediately, “Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins” (Joshua 5:3). What is “at the Hill of the Foreskins”? Rabbi said: It teaches that they made that hill out of foreskins.

Chapter 13

<b>“A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, lying between my breasts” (Song of Songs 1:13).</b><br>“A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me.” What is “a bundle of myrrh”? Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda interpreted the verse regarding Abraham our patriarch. Just as this myrrh is the first of all the kinds of spices,<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 30:23.</i> so too, Abraham was the first of all the righteous. Just as this myrrh, its fragrance diffuses only through fire, so too Abraham, his actions became known only after he was cast into the fiery furnace. Just as this myrrh, anyone who gathers it his hands become bitter, so too Abraham would embitter himself and torment himself with suffering.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">He suffered deprivation in order to focus his energies on serving God, and due to his opposition to the idolatrous notions of the time.</i> <br>“Lying between my breasts,” as he is positioned between the Divine Presence and an angel, as it is stated: “He saw and he ran toward them” (Genesis 18:2). “He saw,” the Divine Presence; “he ran,” to the angel.

Chapter 14

<b>“My beloved is to me as a cluster of henna in the vineyards of Ein Gedi” (Song of Songs 1:14).</b><br>“A cluster of henna [<i>hakofer</i>],” this is Isaac, who was bound on the altar like a cluster. <i>Hakofer</i>, who atones [<i>mekhaper</i>] for the sins of Israel. “In the vineyards of [<i>bekharmei</i>] Ein Gedi,” this is our patriarch Jacob, who entered with his face contorted [<i>bikhrum</i>] in fear of being humiliated before his father. He donned garments made from a kid [<i>gedi izim</i>] and took the blessings that are the eye of [<i>ein</i>] the world.<br>Rabbi Ḥunya [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: There is nothing dearer to a woman than a cluster of henna. Where does she place it? Between her breasts. And Rabbi Ḥunya said in the name of Reish Lakish: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You afflicted the Egyptians with their firstborn, you embittered their soul, but me, “lying between my breasts.”’ How so? An Egyptian would say to an Israelite: Conceal my firstborn among your sons. He would take him and conceal him, but the angel would enter and smite him. But for me: “Lying between my breasts.”<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">This expresses the idea that even if God would smite an Egyptian in the Israelite home amongst the Israelites, His relationship with the Israelites was one of affection (Rabbi David Luria). </i>
Rabbi Berekhya said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘When You are afflicting me, embittering me, “my beloved is to me”—You become my beloved and you see who is the great man in my midst who can say to the attribute of justice: Enough, and You take him as collateral for me.’ That is what is written: “A cluster of henna [<i>eshkol hakofer</i>].” What is <i>eshkol</i>? A man in whom there is everything [<i>ish shehakol bo</i>]: Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <i>Tosefta</i>, and <i>aggadot</i>. <i>Hakofer</i>, who atones [<i>mekhaper</i>] for the sins of Israel. “In the vineyards of Ein Gedi,” these are the fathers of the world who were drawn after you like kids [<i>gedi</i>] and took the blessings that are the eye of [<i>ein</i>] the world.
Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding the incense of the house of Avtinas.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">The house of Avtinas was a priestly family that would prepare the incense to be used in the Temple. See, e.g., Mishna <i>Shekalim</i> 5:1.</i> “A bundle of myrrh,” this is one of the eleven spices that one places in it. Rabbi Huna said in its regard: “The Lord said to Moses: Take spices for you [stacte and onycha and galbanum; spices and pure frankincense; each part shall be equal]” (Exodus 30:34). [Take spices for you], these are two.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">The word spices is plural.</i> “Stacte and onycha and galbanum,” these make five. “Spices,” if you say that these are two, “spices” was already stated. “Each part shall be equal,” give five corresponding to five, these are ten. “And pure frankincense,” these are eleven. From here, the Sages examined and found that these eleven spices alone are optimal for incense.<br>“Lying between my breasts,” as it was confined between the two staves of the Ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">The cloud created by the burning of incense in the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur was confined to the area between the two staves of the Ark (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> “A cluster of henna [<i>eshkol hakofer</i>],” as it atones [<i>mekhaper</i>] for the iniquities of Israel. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Cluster, as it would rise in a column until the rafters and then spread and descend like a cluster. <i>Hakofer</i>, as it atones [<i>mekhaper</i>] for the iniquities of Israel.<br>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “The incense cloud will cover” (Leviticus 16:13). We did not know what this covering was until David came and explained it: “You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered [all of their sins]” (Psalms 85:3). “In the vineyards of Ein Gedi,” due to the conditions that I stipulated to Abraham your patriarch between the pieces, as it is stated: “On that day, the Lord established a covenant with Abram, saying…” (Genesis 15:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">The covenant was based on the animals that would be sacrificed by Abraham’s descendants, including the kid [<i>gedi</i>].</i><b><br></b>The verse is speaking of Abraham, as it is stated: “After these matters, the word of the Lord was to Abram in a vision” (Genesis 15:1). Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama: There were ruminations that took place there.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">This was after Abraham’s victory over the four kings (see Genesis chapter 14).</i> Who ruminated? Abraham ruminated, and said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You made a covenant with Noah that You would not eliminate his descendants from the world, and I arose and amassed good deeds before You, and the covenant with me overrode the covenant with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham had just eliminated a significant number of his descendants.</i> Perhaps another man will arise and amass more mitzvot and good deeds than me, and the covenant with him will override the covenant with me.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘“Fear not, [Abram,] I am your shield” (Genesis 15:1). From Noah I did not produce protectors and righteous people, but from you I will produce protectors and righteous people. Moreover, when your descendants perform transgressions and evil deeds, I will see who the great man among them is, who is able to say to the attribute of justice: Enough, and I will take him as collateral on their behalf, as it is stated: <i>Eshkol</i>, a man in whom there is everything [<i>ish shehakol bo</i>], Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <i>Tosefta</i>, and <i>aggadot</i>. <i>Hakofer</i>, who atones for the sins of Israel. “In the vineyards of Ein Gedi,”<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew can also be translated “for the sake of the vineyard…” and it is understood here as a reference to Israel, which is referred to as God’s vineyard (see Isaiah 5:7) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> I take them as collateral on their behalf.’<br>Another matter, <i>eshkol—</i>ben Gezira said: This is the Holy One blessed be He, a Man in whom there is everything. <i>Hakofer</i>, who renounced the nations of the world and acknowledged Israel. When did He renounce the nations of the world? Say it was during the war of Yehoshafat; that is what is written: “It was thereafter that the children of Moav and the children of Amon, and with them some Amonites, came against Yehoshafat to war” (II Chronicles 20:1). You find Israel coming by virtue of Abraham, and Amon and Moav coming by virtue of Lot. These waged war with those and these fell into the hands of those. Yehoshafat, his God aided him and he prevailed. That is [what is stated] that He renounced the nations of the world. If a person will say to you that the verse is not speaking of Yehoshafat, say to him: “Ein Gedi” is stated here, and it is stated below: “In Hatzetzon Tamar, which is Ein Gedi” (II Chronicles 20:2). Just as Ein Gedi, that is stated below, the verse is speaking of the war of Yehoshafat, here, too, the verse is speaking of the war of Yehoshafat. Rabbi Levi bar Zekharya said: If, in this world, where it is written regarding the Holy One blessed be He: “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a zealous God” (Deuteronomy 4:24), He renounced the nations of the world and acknowledged Israel, in the future, where He is likened to dew, as it is stated: “I will be like dew for Israel” (Hosea 14:6), all the more so.

Chapter 15

<b>“Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; your eyes are like doves” (Song of Songs 1:15).</b><br>“Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair.” Behold you are fair in mitzvot, behold you are fair in acts of kindness. Behold you are fair in positive commandments, behold you are fair in negative commandments. Behold you are fair in mitzvot of the house, in distributing <i>teruma</i> and tithes, behold you are fair in mitzvot of the field, in gleanings, forgotten sheaves, produce in the corner of the field, the tithe of the poor, and ownerless property.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">One is obligated to declare the produce of the Sabbatical Year ownerless.</i> Behold you are fair regarding diverse kinds, behold you are fair regarding a cloak with ritual fringes.

“Your eyes are like doves.” “Your eyes,” these are the Sanhedrin, who are the eyes of the congregation; that is what is written: “It shall be, if from the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). There are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person, and all of them go and come only after the eyes. Similarly, Israel is unable to do anything without their Sanhedrin. “Doves,” just as this dove is flawless, so too, Israel is graceful in their walking when they ascend on the occasion of the pilgrim festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Several commentaries add to the text, based on parallels from other midrashic sources, such that it reads: Just as this dove is flawless, so is Israel flawless in its faith; just as the dove is graceful, so is Israel graceful in its walking… (see Maharzu; <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Just as the dove is distinguished [by its appearance], so too, Israel is distinguished regarding shaving, circumcision, and ritual fringes.<br>Just as the dove is chaste, so too, Israel is chaste. Just as the dove extends its neck to be slaughtered, the same is true of Israel, as it is stated: “For we are killed for You all day” (Psalms 44:23). Just as the dove atones for iniquities,<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">The dove is sacrificed as a sin-offering under certain circumstances.</i> so too, Israel atones for the nations, as all those seventy bulls that they sacrifice on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> correspond to the seventy nations, so the world will not be desolate of them. That is what is written: “In return for my love, they accuse me; I am prayer.” (Psalms 109:4).<br>Just as the dove, from the moment it becomes familiar with its mate, it does not exchange it for another, so too Israel, from the moment that they became familiar with the Holy One blessed be He, they did not exchange Him for another. Just as the dove enters its nest and recognizes its nest and its cote and its fledglings, its chicks, and its openings, so are the three rows of Torah scholars when they sit before them,<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">They sit before the Sanhedrin listening intently, prepared to join them if the need arises.</i> each and every one recognizes his designated place. Just as the dove, even if you take its fledglings from beneath it, it never forsakes its cote, so too Israel, even though the Temple was destroyed, they did not abolish the three annual pilgrim festivals.<br>Just as each and every month, the dove renews the product of its cote,<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">It lays eggs and hatches them.</i> so too, each month, Israel renews its Torah and good deeds. Just as the dove dispatches many<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">It dispatches many of the occupants of its cote to gather food.</i> on foot and returns to its cote, the same is true of Israel. That is what is written: “They will stir like a bird from Egypt” (Hosea 11:11); this is the generation of the wilderness, “and like a dove from the land of Assyria” (Hosea 11:11); these are the Ten Tribes. Both these and those “I will settle them in their homes, the utterance of the Lord” (Hosea 11:11).<br>Rabbi says: There is a species of dove that one feeds it, and its counterparts smell it and come to it in its cote. So too, when the elder is sitting and expounding, many proselytes convert at that moment, such as Yitro, he heard and came, Raḥav heard and came. Similarly in the case of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, many proselytes converted at that time. What is the reason? “When he sees his children… [who will sanctify My name]” (Isaiah 29:23). What is written thereafter? “Those of misguided spirit will attain understanding” (Isaiah 29:24).
Rabbi was sitting and expounding and the audience was dozing. He sought to rouse them. He said: A certain woman in Egypt bore six hundred thousand in a single womb. There was one student there, Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei was his name. He said to him: ‘For whom was it so?’ [Rabbi] said to him: ‘This is Yokheved, who bore Moses, who is the equivalent of six hundred thousand of Israel.’ That is what is written: “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel” (Exodus 15:1). “The children of Israel did according to everything that the Lord commanded Moses, so they did” (Numbers 1:54).<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">The verse does not say that God commanded Israel, but rather that He commanded Moses and Israel did what He commanded.</i> “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">The verse could have said “Another prophet like Moses has never arisen in Israel,” but instead it states this sentence is such a manner that “Israel” and “Moses” are juxtaposed, in order to imply that Moses is the equivalent of all of Israel.</i>
“Your eyes are like doves.” Like doves; your quality is like that of the dove. Just as the dove brought light to the world, you, too, bring light to the world, as it is stated: “The nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). When did the dove bring light to the world? During the days of Noah. That is what is written: “The dove came to him at evening time and behold, there was an olive leaf plucked [<i>taraf</i>] in its mouth” (Genesis 8:11). What is “<i>taraf</i> in its mouth”?<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>tet-resh-pei</i> can refer to food or to killing.</i> Killed, just as you say: “Joseph was mauled [<i>tarof taraf</i>]” (Genesis 37:33). Rabbi Berekhya said: Had it not killed it, it would have become a great tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">The dove brought a leaf from a living tree, indicating to Noah that there was life in the world.</i><br>From where did it bring it? Rabbi Levi said: It brought it from the branches of the Land of Israel. That is what people say: The Land of Israel was not stricken with the flood waters. That is what was stated by Ezekiel: “Son of man, say to it: You are a land that has not been cleansed, that has not been rained upon on the day of fury” (Ezekiel 22:24). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even the lower millstones were dissolved in the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, since the destruction wrought by the flood was so devastating, it must be that if a tree was growing at that time, it was from the Land of Israel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Taryi said: The gates of the Garden of Eden opened for it, and it brought it from there. Rabbi Aivu said to him: Had it brought it from the Garden of Eden, should it not have brought a high-quality item, e.g., cinnamon or balsam? Rather it was hinting to Noah, [as though] it said to him: My master, Noah: [It is preferable to have something] bitter from this [tree] from the hand of the Holy One blessed be He, and not [something] sweet from your hand.

Chapter 16

<b>“Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too; indeed our bed is fresh” (Song of Songs 1:16).</b><br>“Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too.” Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Abahu said: He lauded her with a compound expression, and she lauded him with a simple expression. He lauded her with a compound expression: “Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair” (Song of Songs 1:15), for if He sought to adopt another nation, He could.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">The verse repeats the laudatory phrase to say that even though He could, he chooses not to do so.</i> She lauded him with a simple expression: “Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too.”<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">“Behold” is not repeated, and “fair” is not repeated either.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina said to him: She, too, lauded him with a compound expression, as it is stated: “Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too [<i>af</i>].” She said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, the anger [<i>af</i>] with which You treat me is pleasant. Why? Because You return me and cause me to be better.<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">The people of Israel recognize that their suffering is meant to cause them to repent.</i>
“Indeed our bed is fresh,” this is the Temple, just as you say: “And his nurse in the bedroom” (II Kings 11:2). What is “the bedroom”? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: The side chambers. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: In the upper side chambers. The one who said in the side chambers, it is during the rainy season. The one who said in the upper side chambers, it is during the summer season.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">During the hot summer months it is more comfortable in the upper chambers, where there is more of a breeze, whereas in the winter months it is more comfortable in the lower chambers.</i> <br>Another matter, “indeed our bed is fresh,” Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: [This is analogous] to a king who went out to the wilderness, and they brought him a short bed. He began straining himself and cramping his limbs. When he entered the province, they brought him a long bed, [and] he began stretching himself and extending his limbs. So too, until the Temple was constructed, the Divine Presence restricted itself between the two staves of the Ark. Once the Temple was constructed, “the staves were extended” (I Kings 8:8).
Another matter, “indeed our bed is fresh,” just as this bed is made only for comfort, so too, until the Temple was constructed, the Divine Presence was tossed from place to place; that is what is written: “I would make My way in a tent and in a tabernacle” (II Samuel 7:6). Once the Temple was constructed, “this is My resting place forever” (Psalms 132:14).<br>Another matter, “indeed our bed is fresh,” just as this bed is made only for comfort, so too, until the Temple was constructed the Israelites were tossed from place to place, “they traveled…and they encamped” (Numbers 33:5). When the Temple was constructed, “Judah and Israel lived securely” (I Kings 5:5).<br>Another matter, “indeed our bed is fresh,” just as this bed is only for procreation, so too, until the Temple was contructed, “go count Israel” (I Chronicles 21:2). Once it was constructed, “Judah and Israel were numerous [like the sand that is by the sea in abundance]” (I Kings 4:20).<br>Another matter, “indeed our bed is fresh,” just as this bed is only for procreation, so too, until the Temple was contructed, “The entire congregation together was forty [-two] thousand [three hundred and sixty]” (Ezra 2:64). Once the Temple was constructed, they procreated, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From Gevat until Antipatris there were six hundred thousand towns, and they would produce twice the number of those who emerged from Egypt. Now, even were you to introduce six hundred thousand reeds there, it would not contain them and would not hold them. Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Land of Israel has [since] contracted.

Chapter 17

<b>“The beams of our houses are cedars, and our panels are cypresses” (Song of Songs 1:17).</b><br>“The beams of our houses are cedars,” Rabbi Menaḥama [said] in the name of Rabbi Berekhya: The stones upon which Jacob our patriarch slept became like a bed and a duvet beneath him. What growth sprouted from it? “The beams of our houses are cedars.”<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">These stones became the foundation for Solomon’s Temple, which was constructed with the wood of cedar and cypress trees.</i><br>Another matter, “the beams of our houses are cedars,” these are the righteous men and righteous women, the prophets and prophetesses, who descended from him.
“Our panels are cypresses.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A person does not benefit from this cypress. Why? Because it bends.<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently, it is not useful in construction.</i> This is [consistent with another] opinion, of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “I am like a fresh cypress” (Hosea 14:9). It is I<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">God.</i> who bent over to eliminate the inclination of idol worship. “Ephraim: What more have I [to do with idols]” (Hosea 14:9). What do I have to do with the inclination of idol worship? “I respond [<i>aniti</i>]” (Hosea 14:9), I submitted [<i>uneti</i>] to Him: “I will gaze upon them [<i>va’ashurenu</i>]” (Hosea 14:9), did we not <i>ashurenu</i>? Did we not sing song [<i>shira</i>] to You?<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, Israel, represented by Ephraim, is portrayed by the prophet as stating that they have given up idolatry, and that this is consistent with their history of submitting to God’s authority and singing songs to Him at the Red Sea.</i> Rather, say: It is I who bent over to eliminate the inclination of idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">God responds that it was He who eliminated the inclination for idol worship and that is why Israel has ceased worshipping idols.</i> <br>Another matter, “our panels [<i>rahitenu</i>] are cypresses,” the place where the priests would move quickly was [overlaid] with cypress, just as you say: “He overlaid the floor of the House with boards of cypress” (I Kings 6:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Torah taught proper conduct. A person should roof with cedars and floor with cypresses, as it is stated: “The beams of our houses are cedars, and our panels are cypresses.”

<b>“I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys” (Song of Songs 2:1).</b><br>“I am a rose [<i>ḥavatzelet</i>] of Sharon.” The congregation of Israel said: I am as I am, yet I am beloved [<i>ḥaviva</i>]. It is I whom the Holy One blessed be He loved me more than seventy nations. “A rose [<i>ḥavatzelet</i>] of Sharon,” I made Him shelter [<i>tzel</i>] by means of Betzalel, as it is written: “Betzalel crafted the Ark” (Exodus 37:1). “Of Sharon,” as I recited song [<i>shira</i>] before Him by means of Moses, as it is written: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang” (Exodus 15:1).<br>Another matter, “I am a rose of Sharon.” The congregation of Israel said: I am as I am, yet I am beloved. It is I who was shrouded in the shadow of Egypt, but the Holy One blessed be He brought me quickly to Rameses.

It is I who was shrouded and trampled in the shadow of kingdoms. Tomorrow, when the Holy One blessed be He redeems me from the shadow of the kingdoms, I will blossom like a lily, and I will recite a new song before Him, as it is stated: “A psalm. Sing to the Lord a new song, for He has performed wonders; His right hand and His holy arm have wrought salvation for Him” (Psalms 98:1).
Rabbi Berekhya said: This verse, the wilderness said it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon wrote it from the perspective of the wilderness (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> The wilderness said: ‘I am the wilderness, yet I am beloved, as all the good in the world is shrouded in me, as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness cedar, acacia…” (Isaiah 41:19). The Holy One blessed be He gave them to me so they would be protected in me. When the Holy One blessed be He asks me for them, I will return His deposit to Him with nothing lacking. I generate good deeds and sing songs before Him,’ as it is stated: “The wilderness and wasteland will be glad” (Isaiah 35:1).<br>In the name of the Rabbis they said: The earth said it. It said: ‘I am as I am, yet I am beloved, as all the dead of the world are shrouded in me, as it is stated: “Your dead will live, my corpses shall arise” (Isaiah 26:19). When the Holy One blessed be He asks me for them, I will return them to Him. I will generate good deeds like a lily and recite song before Him,’ as it is stated: “From the edge of the earth we heard songs” (Isaiah 24:16).
Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yudan said: “I am a rose [<i>ḥavatzelet</i>] [of Sharon, a lily [<i>shoshana</i>] of the valleys],” is it not a <i>ḥavatzelet</i> and is it not a <i>shoshana</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Is <i>ḥavatzelet</i> not the same as <i>shoshana</i>? Although generally translated differently, as rose and lily, the midrash assumes that the <i>ḥavatzelet</i> and <i>shoshana</i> are the same flower.</i> Rather, as long as it is small, [the verse] calls it <i>ḥavatzelet</i>, when it grows larger, it calls it <i>shoshana</i>. “Rose [<i>ḥavatzelet</i>],” why is it called <i>ḥavatzelet</i>? Because it is shrouded in its shade [<i>ḥavuya betzila</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When it is small, its petals are folded around the top of the stalk.</i><br>Rabbi Eliezer said: The righteous are likened to the most excellent of species and to the most excellent of that species; the most excellent of the species, like a lily, the most excellent of that species, a lily of the valley. Not like the mountain lily, which quickly withers, but like the lily of the valley that remains moist. The wicked are likened to the vilest of species and the vilest of that species; the vilest of the species, “like chaff before the wind” (Psalms 83:14). If you say like chaff of the valley, that has moisture in it; rather, “it will be pursued like the chaff of mountains before the wind” (Isaiah 17:13).<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: 'I am as I am, yet I am beloved. I am sunk in the depths<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, <i>imkei</i>, related to the word valleys [<i>amakim</i>] that appears in the verse.</i> of troubles, but when the Holy One blessed be He will extricate me from the troubles, I will blossom good deeds like a lily and will sing songs before Him. That is what is written: “Lord, in their trouble they turned to You” (Isaiah 26:16).<br>Rabbi Aḥa said: The congregation of Israel said: When You intensify Your gaze at me,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">You discover my shortcomings and transgressions and punish me.</i> I blossom good deeds like a lily and sing songs. That is what is written: “A song of ascents. From the depths I call to You, Lord” (Psalms 130:1).<br>The Rabbis say: The congregation of Israel said it. The congregation of Israel said: I am as I am, yet I am beloved. I am situated in the depths of Gehenna, but when the Holy One blessed be He will rescue me from its depths—that is what is written: “He raised me from the pit of destruction” (Psalms 40:3)—I will blossom good deeds and sing songs before Him. That is what is written: “He placed a new song in my mouth” (Psalms 40:4).<br>The opinion of the Rabbis corresponds with what Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i said: The princes of the nations are destined in the future to come to denounce Israel before the Holy One blessed be He, and say: ‘These engaged in idol worship and those engaged in idol worship, these engaged in forbidden sexual relations and those engaged in forbidden sexual relations, these shed blood and those shed blood; why are these descending to Gehenna and those are not descending?’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Why are the gentiles descending to Gehenna while the Jews are not?</i> The Holy One blessed be He responds to them and says: ‘If that is so, all the peoples will descend with their gods to Gehenna.’ That is what is written: “For all the peoples will walk, each in the name of its god, [but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever]” (Micah 4:5).<br>Rabbi Reuven said: Had this matter not been written, it would have been impossible to say it: As it were, “for the Lord will judge [<i>nishpat</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reflexive [<i>nifal</i>] conjugation<i>,</i> indicating, as it were, that God will be judged.</i> in fire” (Isaiah 66:16). <i>Shofet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This conjugation is the standard way of expressing that God will judge.</i> is not written here, but rather <i>nishpat</i>.

The verse states: “Only [<i>Akh</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>akh</i> is always understood to be a restrictive term.

The verse states: “May only [<i>akh</i>] goodness and kindness pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever [<i>le’orekh yamim</i>]” (Psalms 23:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le’orekh yamim</i> is expounded to mean a world where the day is infinitely long [<i>yom shekulo arokh</i>].

Chapter 2

<b>“Like a lily among the thorns, so is my love among the girls” (Song of Songs 2:2).</b><br>“Like a lily among the thorns,” Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding Rebecca, as it is stated: “Isaac was forty years old, and he took Rebecca, daughter of Betuel the Aramaean of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Aramaean, [to be his wife]” (Genesis 25:20). If it is to teach that she was from Padan Aram, why does the verse state: “Sister of Laban the Aramean”?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the verse emphasize that her father was an Aramean and her brother was an Aramean and that she was from Padan Aram?</i> Rather, her father was a swindler [<i>ramai</i>], her brother was a swindler, and the people of her area were swindlers, and this righteous woman emerged from their midst. To what is she comparable? It is to a “lily among the thorns.”<br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Simon: It is written: “Isaac sent Jacob and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban son of Betuel the Aramean,” thereby including all of them in swindling.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">By mentioning “Aramean” at the end of the verse, it implies that all those mentioned in the verse were swindlers. Yet Jacob did not learn from their corrupt ways (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>
Rabbi Eliezer interpreted the verse regarding the redemption from Egypt. Just as this lily, when it is situated among the thorns, is difficult for its owner to pluck it, so too, the redemption of Israel was difficult for the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Or has a god sought to come and take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation…?” (Deuteronomy 4:34). Rabbi Yehoshua said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanan: It is not written here: “A nation from the midst of a people,” or “a people from the midst of a nation,” but rather, “a nation from the midst of a nation,” as these were uncircumcised and those were uncircumcised, these grew their hairlocks and those grew their hairlocks,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is a to a hairstyle that was common among gentiles, known as <i>belorit</i>, in which they would grow a long lock of hair from the backs of their heads.</i> these wore garments of diverse kinds and those wore garments of diverse kinds.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites and Egyptians appeared quite similar to each other in appearance and in lifestyle.</i> If so, the attribute of justice would never have allowed Israel to be redeemed from Egypt. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Had the Holy One blessed be He not bound Himself with an oath, Israel would never have been redeemed from Egypt. That is what is written: “Therefore, say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord and I will take you out from under the burdens of Egypt” (Exodus 6:6). “Therefore” is nothing other than an oath, just as it says: “Therefore, I have taken an oath to the house of Eli” (I Samuel 3:14). Rabbi Berekhya said: “With Your arm, You redeemed Your people” (Psalms 77:16), by force.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">You overcame the attribute of justice by force.</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said: From “to come and take for himself a nation” until “awesome deeds” (Deuteronomy 4:34) there are seventy-two letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew text.</i> If a person will tell you seventy-five, say to him: Exclude from them the second [mention of the word] nation [<i>goy</i>], which is not included in the tally.

Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda that Rabbi Simon said: This is analogous to a king who had an orchard, and they descended and planted a row of fig trees, a row of grapevines, a row of pomegranate trees, and a row of apple trees. He entrusted it to a sharecropper and went. Some time later, the king came and peered at the orchard to ascertain what he had done, and he found it filled with thorns and briars. He brought cutters to cut it down,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He was going to cut down the entire orchard.</i> but he saw a rose in it and smelled it, and he was placated. The king said: Because of this rose, the orchard will be saved. So too, the world was created only for Israel. After twenty-six generations passed, the Holy One blessed be He peered at His world to ascertain what it had done, and He saw that it was water in water. The generation of Enosh was obliterated with water.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 23:6.</i> The Generation of the Flood was obliterated with water; the Generation of the Dispersion, in water. He brought cutters to cut it, as it is stated: “The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood” (Psalms 29:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He sat in judgment.</i> He saw a rose, this is, Israel; He took it and smelled it when Israel assented to the Ten Commandments, and He was placated. When Israel said: “We will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Due to this rose, the orchard will be spared; due to the merit of the Torah and those who engage in its study, the world will be spared.’
Rabbi Ḥanan of Tzippori interpreted the verse regarding acts of kindness. The way of the world is that ten men enter into a house of mourning and none of them is able to open his mouth to recite the blessing of the mourners.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Many people are not fluent in this blessing.</i> One opens his mouth and recites the blessing of the mourners; to what is he comparable? To “a lily among the thorns.” The way of the world is that ten men enter the house of the wedding feast and none of them is able to open his mouth to recite the blessing of the bridegrooms. One opens his mouth and recites the blessing of the bridegrooms; to what is he comparable? To “a lily among the thorns.” The way of the world is that ten men enter the synagogue and none of them is able to recite aloud the blessings before <i>Shema</i> and pass before the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">To repeat the <i>Amida</i> prayer as the leader of the prayer service.</i> One of them recites aloud the blessings before <i>Shema</i> and passes before the ark; to what is he comparable? To “a lily among the thorns.”<br>Rabbi Elazar went to a certain place. They said to him: ‘Recite aloud the blessings before <i>Shema</i>.’ He said to them: ‘I am not wise.’ [They said:] ‘Pass before the ark.’<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Again he demurred, claiming that he did not know how.</i> They said: ‘Is this Rabbi Elazar? Is this the one whom they praise? They call him “our master” for nothing.’ He turned pale and he went to his teacher Rabbi Akiva. [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Why do you look ill?’ He related the incident to him and he said to him: ‘Would my master like to teach me?’ He said to him: ‘Yes,’ and he taught him. Sometime later he went [back] to that place. They said to him: ‘Recite aloud the blessings before <i>Shema</i> for us.’ He recited for them. ‘Pass before the ark.’ He passed. They said: ‘Rabbi Elazar has been fortified,’ and they called him Rabbi Elazar the strong. Rabbi Yona would teach his students the blessing of the bridegrooms and the blessing of the mourners so that they would be prepared in every circumstance.
Rabbi Huna interpreted the verse regarding the kingdoms.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdoms within which the Jewish people are scattered in exile.</i> Just as a lily, when it is situated among the thorns, a north wind emerges, tilts it northward, and the thorn pierces it, but, nevertheless, its stalk is directed upward; so, too, Israel, even though taxes and levies are collected from them, their heart is directed toward their Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “My eyes are always toward God” (Psalms 25:15).<br>Rabbi Aivu interpreted the verse regarding the future redemption.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, tomorrow’s redemption.</i> Just as this lily, when it is situated among the thorns, it is difficult for its owner to pluck it; what does he do? He brings fire and burns [the thorns] around it and then plucks it. So too, “The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that those that surround him should be his adversaries” (Lamentations 1:17), like Ḥalamish to Naveh, Jericho to No’aron, Susitan to Tiberias, Kastra to Haifa, Lod to Ono.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">All of these were gentile cities that were adjacent to Jewish cities.</i> That is what is written: “This is Jerusalem, in the midst of the nations I have situated it” (Ezekiel 5:5). In the future, when the end of days will arrive, what will the Holy One blessed be He do? He will bring fire and burn around it. That is what is written: “Peoples will be burnings of lime, [cut thorns ignited with fire]” (Isaiah 33:12). What is written there? “The Lord alone will lead him [and there is no foreign god with Him]” (Deuteronomy 32:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">There will no longer be peoples who engage in idol worship (Onkelos).</i>
Rabbi Avun said: Just as this lily, when a hot wind passes over it, it is shriveled [and] when dew emerges, it blossoms; so too, as long as the shadow of Esau exists, [Israel] appears shriveled in this world. When the shadow of Esau has passed, Israel blossoms and develops. That is what is written: “I will be like dew to Israel, it will blossom like a lily” (Hosea 14:6). Just as this lily continues to exist due to its fragrance,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It has value even when it shrivels up as long as it retains its fragrance (see <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>; <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> so Israel continues to exist due to mitzvot and good deeds. Just as this lily is only for its fragrance, so too, the righteous were created only for the redemption of Israel. Just as this lily is placed on the table of kings from beginning to end,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Of the meal.</i> so too Israel, they are in this world and they are in the World to Come. Just as this lily is conspicuous among the grasses, so Israel is conspicuous among the nations of the world, as it is stated: “All who see them will recognize them” (Isaiah 61:9). Just as this lily is designated for <i>Shabbatot</i> and festivals, so, Israel is designated for the future redemption.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Go say to Israel: My children, when you were in Egypt, you were like a lily among the thorns. Now that you are entering the land of Canaan, be like a lily among the thorns, pay attention that you will not emulate the practices of these or the actions of those.’ That is what is written: “You shall not emulate the practices of the land of Egypt in which you lived, and you shall not emulate the practices of the land of Canaan where I am bringing you …” (Leviticus 18:3).

Chapter 3

<b>“Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the boys. In its shade I delighted and I sat, and its fruit was sweet to my palate” (Song of Songs 2:3).</b><br>“Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,” Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Just as this apple tree, everyone flees from it during the heat, and why is that, because it does not have shade to enable one to sit in its shade, so too, the nations of the world fled from the shadow of the Holy One blessed be He on the day of the giving of the Torah. Is, perhaps, the same true regarding Israel? The verse states: “In its shade I delighted and I sat,” it is I who delighted in Him and not the nations.<br>Rabbi Aḥa ben Rabbi Ze’eira said two [statements]. He said one: This apple tree<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 88a) who argue that the tree referred to here is a citron rather than an apple tree.</i> produces its blossom before its leaves; so too, Israel, when they were in Egypt, achieved faith before hearing. That is what is written: “The people believed, and they heard that the Lord had remembered” (Exodus 4:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites had a tradition from their fathers that they would be redeemed, and they believed that would occur even before they heard that God had spoken to Moses and said that He would redeem Israel (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i>
Rabbi Aḥa ben Rabbi Ze’eira said another: Just as this apple tree produces its blossom before its leaves, so too, Israel put performance before hearing, as it is stated: “We will perform and we will heed [<i>nishma</i>]” (Exodus 24:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Although translated here as “heed,” the term <i>nishma</i> can be translated “hear.” The point here is that Israel committed to following God’s commands even before hearing what they were.</i> <br>Rabbi Azarya said two [statements]: Just as the apple tree produces is ripened fruit only in Sivan, so too, Israel emitted a good fragrance only in Sivan.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Sivan is the month in which Israel received the Torah.</i> Rabbi Azarya said another: Just as this apple tree, from the time it produces its blossom until it produces ripened fruit is fifty days, so too, from the time that Israel departed from Egypt until they received the Torah it was fifty days. When did they receive it? It was “in the third month from the departure of the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:1).<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said two [statements]: Just as this apple, you give an <i>isar</i> for it<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>isar</i> is a coin of relatively little value.</i> and you can smell its fragrances numerous times, so too, Moses said to Israel: ‘If you wish to be redeemed, you can be redeemed with a simple matter.’ [This is analogous] to one who was injured in his legs and he circulated among all the doctors to be cured, but he was not cured. One came and said to him: ‘If you seek to be cured, you can be cured with a simple matter, attach animal dung to it.’ So too, Moses said to Israel: ‘If you wish to be redeemed, you can be redeemed with a simple matter: “You shall take a bundle of hyssop and dip”’ (Exodus 12:22). They said to him: ‘Moses our master, this bundle of hyssop, how much it its value, four <i>ma’a</i> or five <i>ma’a</i>?’<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It is of little monetary value.</i> He said to them: ‘Even if it is one [<i>ma’a</i>], and it will cause you to acquire the plunder of Egypt, the plunder at the sea, the plunder of Siḥon and Og, and the plunder of the thirty-one kings. Regarding a palm branch,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the four species taken on <i>Sukkot</i>.</i> on which a person is required to expend much money and it is associated with many <i>mitzvot</i>, all the more so.’ Therefore, Moses cautions Israel: “You shall take for you on the first day” (Leviticus 23:40).
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said another: This is analogous to a king who had a gem and pearls. His son came and said to him: ‘Give it to me.’ He said to him: ‘It is for you, it is yours, and I am giving it to you.’ So too, Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: “The Lord is my strength [<i>ozi</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that the Israelites were asking that the strength of the Lord be given to them.</i> and song” (Exodus 15:2). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘It is for you, it is yours, and I am giving it to you.’ <i>Oz</i> is nothing other than Torah, “The Lord will give strength [<i>oz</i>] to his people” (Psalms 29:11).<br>Rabbi Levi said: There were three great expectations that Israel anticipated at the sea. They anticipated the Torah, they anticipated the banners, they anticipated the Tabernacle. They anticipated the Torah, as it is written: “In its shade I delighted and I sat.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The connection between shade and Torah is based on the verse: “I placed My words in your mouth and with the shade of My hand I covered you” (Isaiah 51:16).</i> They anticipated the banners, as it is written: “I delighted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived in conjunction with the next verse, which states “his banner over me is love” (Song of Songs 2:4) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> They anticipated the Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I sat [<i>veyashavti</i>],” just as it says: “For I have not dwelt [<i>yashavti</i>] in a house from the day I took the children of Israel up from Egypt [to this day; I have moved about in a tent and a Tabernacle]” (II Samuel 7:6). This is similar to what Rabbi Menaḥaman said: “They went out to the wilderness of Shur” (Exodus 15:22); it teaches that they prophesied about themselves that they were destined to align according to their various camps, banners, and rows [<i>shurot</i>], like the alignment of a vineyard.<br>“And its fruit was sweet to my palate,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the twelve months that Israel stayed before Mount Sinai, reveling in the sweetness of the Torah. What is the reason for “and its fruit was sweet to my palate”?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly if someone is sensing the sweetness, they are sensing it with their palate.</i> It was sweet to my palate, but to the palate of the nations of the world it was bitter as wormwood.
“[The Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him] from the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:1). Rabbi Elazar said: Although the Torah was given from Sinai, Israel was not punished for [transgressing] it until it was explained to them at the Tent of Meeting. [This is analogous] to a royal missive that was written and sealed and entered the province. The residents of that province were not liable for it until it was explained to them in the province. So too, although the Torah was given from Sinai, [Israel] was not punished for [transgressing] it until it was explained to them at the Tent of Meeting. That is what is written: “Until I brought him into my mother’s house” (Song of Songs 3:4); this is Mount Sinai, “and into the chamber of the one who conceived me” (Song of Songs 3:4); this is the Tent of Meeting, as it is from there that Israel became liable for its teachings.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: If the nations had known how beneficial the Tent of Meeting was for them, they would have surrounded it [to protect it] with military encampments and fortifications, as until the Tent of Meeting stood, they would hear the sound of divine speech, and would lose control of their bowels in the halls of their palaces.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Many of them lost control of their faculties and even died due to the fear and trepidation involved in hearing the divine speech.</i> That is what is written: “For who of all flesh who heard the voice of the living God… [has lived?]” (Deuteronomy 5:23). Rabbi Simon said: The divine speech would emerge in two forms; an elixir of life for Israel and an elixir of death for the nations of the world. An elixir of life for Israel, “[Has a people heard the voice of God speaking…] as you heard, and lived?” (Deuteronomy 4:33); you heard and lived. And an elixir of death for the nations of the world, they heard and died. Therefore it says: “Under the apple tree I roused you” (Song of Songs 8:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The apple tree is understood here as an allusion to Mount Sinai (Maharzu). The verse indicates that God roused Israel from the dead after speaking to them, whereas He did not rouse the nations of the world who heard Him speak (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>“[The Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him] from the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:1). Rabbi Ḥiyya taught that from there the voice would stop and would not emerge outside the tent. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Before the Tent of Meeting stood, prophecy was found among the nations of the world. Once the Tent of Meeting stood, prophecy ceased from them. From there, “I grasped him and I would not release him” (Song of Songs 3:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded in reference to prophecy.</i> If you say: But did Bilam ben Beor not prophesy? Say, it was for the benefit of Israel that he prophesied, as it is stated: “How goodly are your tents, Jacob” (Numbers 24:5); “one has seen no iniquity in Jacob” (Numbers 23:21); “for there is no divination in Jacob” (Numbers 23:23); “who has counted the dust of Jacob” (Numbers 23:10); “a star has risen from Jacob” (Numbers 24:17); “one from Jacob will rule” (Numbers 24:19).

Chapter 4

<b>“He brought me to the wine house, and his banner over me is love” (Song of Songs 2:4).</b><br>“He brought me to the wine house,” Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Meir says: The congregation of Israel said: ‘The evil inclination gained control over me like wine, and I said of the calf: “This is your god, Israel”’ (Exodus 32:4). When wine enters a person, it confuses him. Rabbi Yehuda said to him: Enough, Meir, one does not expound Song of Songs disparagingly, but rather, favorably, as Song of Songs was given only in praise of Israel. What, then, is “he brought me to the wine house”? The congregation of Israel said: The Holy One blessed be He brought me to a large wine cellar, this is Sinai.

Moreover, the Holy One blessed be He says: His omission [<i>dilugo</i>] is beloved to Me. Rabbi Berekhya said: Even all the subterfuge [<i>digulin</i>] that Jacob employed regarding his father, just as it says: “And the hides of the goat kids, she placed on his hands” (Genesis 27:16), the Holy One blessed be He says: ‘I rest My Divine Presence over them.’ That is what is written: “You shall make sheets of goats’ hair” (Exodus 26:7). Moreover, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “His banner [<i>vediglo</i>] over me is love,” his subterfuge [<i>vedigulo</i>] over me is love.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: The congregation of Israel said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He brought me to a large wine cellar, this is Sinai. There, I saw Mikhael and his banner, Gavriel and his banner, and my eyes saw heavenly rites and I loved them.’ At that time the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Since the desire of My children is for banners, they will encamp with banners.’ That is what is written: “Each at his banner according to the insignia” (Numbers 2:2).

Now that the Torah is not accessible, they seek to hear a passage from the Bible or a passage from <i>aggada</i>. Rabbi Levi said: In the past, money was available and a person desired to hear a passage from Mishna, <i>halakha</i>, and the Talmud. Today that money is not available, and especially because they are ill due to subjugation, they seek to hear only words of blessing and consolation.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: When the Israelites departed from Egypt, to what were they comparable? To the son of a king who recovered from his illness. His caretaker said to him: ‘Let your son go to the academy.’ The king said to him: ‘My son has not yet regained his radiance, which changed due to his illness. Rather, let my son be pampered and enjoy himself for three months with food and drink, and then he will go to the academy.’ So too, when the Israelites departed from Egypt, there were those among them who were marred from subjugation with mortar and bricks. The ministering angels said to Him: ‘This is the time, give them the Torah.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘My children have not yet regained their radiance as a result of mortar and bricks. Let them be pampered up to three months with spring water, manna, and quail, and thereafter I will give them the Torah.’ When? “In the third month” (Exodus 19:1).
At the end of the persecution,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">After the death of Hadrian, emperor of Rome, who had outlawed Torah study and made other repressive decrees, and who had crushed the Bar Kokhva revolt.</i> our Rabbis assembled in Usha; they were: Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov. They sent to the elders of the Galilee and said: ‘Anyone who is learned, let him come and teach, and anyone who is not learned, let him come and study.’ They assembled, studied, and did everything that they needed to do. When the time arrived to take their leave, they said: ‘Are we to leave empty the place in which we were received?’<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Will we leave without honoring and expressing our appreciation for the residents of the host city?</i> They accorded honor to Rabbi Yehuda, who was a resident of the city; not that he was greater than they were in Torah, but rather because a person’s place entitles him to honor.<br>Rabbi Yehuda entered and expounded: “Moses would take the Tent and pitch it outside the camp at a distance from the camp… [and anyone who would seek the Lord would go out to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp]” (Exodus 33:7). “At a distance” is stated here, and there it is stated: “There shall be a distance between you and it a measure of approximately two thousand cubits” (Joshua 3:4). Just as “distance” that is stated here is two thousand cubits, so “distance” stated there is two thousand cubits. “And anyone who would seek Moses” is not written here, but rather, “who would seek the Lord.” From here we have learned that anyone who welcomes Torah scholars, it is as though he received the Divine Presence. You, our brethren, our Rabbis, Torah luminaries, those of you who suffered [by traveling] ten <i>mil</i>, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, in order to hear matters of Torah, all the more so that the Holy One blessed be He will not withhold your reward in this [world] and in the [World] to Come.<br>Rabbi Neḥemya entered and expounded: “An Amonite or Moavite shall not enter the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4). It is taught: Two great nations were denied entrance into the congregation of the Lord. Why? “Due to the fact that they did not greet you with bread and water” (Deuteronomy 23:5). Did Israel need it at that time? Is it not so, that all forty years that Israel was in the wilderness, the spring would rise for them, the manna would fall for them, quail was available for them, the clouds of glory enveloped them, and the cloud pillar traveled before them, and you say: “that they did not greet you with bread and water”? Rabbi Elazar said: Proper etiquette is that when one comes from travel one greets him with food and drink. Come and see what the Holy One blessed be He repaid these two nations: “An Amonite or Moavite shall not enter the congregation of the Lord.” You, residents of Usha, who welcomed our Rabbis with your food, your drink, and your beds, the Holy One blessed be He will repay you a fine reward.<br>Rabbi Meir entered and expounded: “A certain elderly prophet was residing in Beit El” (I Kings 13:11). Who was this? This was Amatzya, the priest of Beit El. Rabbi Yosei said: 'Meir, there is much confusion here. Who was this? This was Yonatan ben Gershom ben Moses [Moshe].

If he was the grandson of Moses, and also the priest of Beit El mentioned in Kings, by what merit would he have lived from the time of Judges until the time of the events in Kings?</i> He said to them: Yes, because he was discouraging vis-à-vis idol worship. How so? A person would come to worship, and he would say to him: ‘How old are you?’ He would say to him: Forty years old, or fifty, or sixty, or seventy years old, or however old he was. He would say to him: ‘How old are you, forty years old, or fifty, or sixty, or seventy, or eighty years, and this idol was crafted only five or twelve years ago, and you seek to forsake your God and worship it? That is contemptible.’ [The visitor] would then become embarrassed and would leave. A certain contemptible individual came, and [Yehonatan] said this to him. He said to [Yehonatan]: ‘Why are you sitting here and worshipping it?’ He said: ‘I take my salary and mislead him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Yehonatan said that his employer, Mikha, believed that he worshipped the idol, but that was not actually the case.</i> When David heard of him, he sent and brought him, and he said to him: ‘You are the grandson of that righteous one and you engage in idol worship?’ He said to him: ‘This is the tradition that I receive from the house of my grandfather: Sell yourself for idol worship but do not be beholden to people.’<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Take a job pertaining to idolatry if necessary, but do not be financially dependent on others.</i> He said to him: ‘Heaven forbid, it is not so, but rather sell yourself to a labor that is foreign<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The confusion stemmed from the fact that the literal translation of <i>avoda zara</i>, the term used to connote idol worship, is foreign labor.</i> to you, but do not be beholden to people.’ When David saw how fond he was of money, he appointed him officer of the treasury.

If this one, who lied and fed him the bread of falsehood, was privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him, you, our brethren, residents of Usha, who welcomed our Rabbis with the food of truth, and drink, and a bed, all the more so that the Holy One blessed be He will pay you a fine reward.<br>Rabbi Yosei entered and expounded: “The Ark remained in the house of Oved Edom the Gittite [for three months]” (II Samuel 6:11). “It was told to King David saying: The Lord has blessed the house of Oved Edom and everything that is his” (II Samuel 6:12). By what merit? “Because of the Ark of God” (II Samuel 6:12). With what did He bless him? With children; that is what is written: “[Oved Edom had sons: Shemaya the first…] Amiel the sixth and Yisakhar the seventh” (I Chronicles 26:4–5), and likewise it says: “All these were of the sons of Oved Edom, they and their sons” (I Chronicles 26:8).

And the eight of them, that is sixty-two.

He said to them: It is because he performed a great service for the Torah. What service did he perform for the Torah? He would kindle before the Ark one lamp in the morning and one lamp in the afternoon. The matters can be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If the Ark of God, which does not eat, drink, or speak, but there were two stone tablets in it, and he kindled one lamp on its behalf and he merited to be blessed for honoring it, you, our brethren, residents of Usha, all the more so.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai entered and expounded: “It was one day that Elisha traveled to Shunem and there was a prominent woman and she implored him to eat bread” (II Kings 4:8). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said to him: Because it wrote “she implored him to eat bread,” she merited having her son revived. Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira, and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, said: So great is sustenance that it causes the revival of the dead to occur not at its appointed time. The woman from Tzorfat, because she fed Elijah, merited having her son revived. The Shunamite, because she fed Elisha, merited having her son revived.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: Even lamps, even wicks, Elijah would take from place to place so as not to impose upon any person. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Did he eat from her food? Did not both she and he eat from his food, as it is written: “She and he ate” (I Kings 17:15). “He and she” is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, the verse is written such that it states “he and she ate,” but when reading the verse one reads it as though it states “she and he ate.” This is because she was the host, but the sustenance was provided by God in Elijah’s merit.</i> Rather, because she welcomed him hospitably and served him, she merited having her son revived. And you, residents of Usha, who perform acts of kindness, all the more so.<br>Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili entered and expounded: “Saul said to the Kenite: Go, withdraw, descend from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you performed kindness with all the children of Israel when they ascended from Egypt’" (I Samuel 15:6). Did Yitro,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The Kenites are identified as the descendants of Yitro.</i> in fact, perform kindness with all the children of Israel? Was it not with Moses alone that he performed it? Rabbi Elazar said: Yitro certainly performed kindness with Moses; that is what is written: “Call him and let him eat bread” (Exodus 2:20). Rabbi Simon said: That is not so. He fed him as his wages. As it is written: “He also drew water for us [and watered the flock]” (Exodus 2:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states “drew water” with a double Hebrew term, <i>dalo dala</i>. The midrash expounds the significance of that double term.</i> Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda said: He drew for us and for our fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The daughters of Yitro had their own sheep in addition to the sheep of their father Yitro (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: He drew for us and for the shepherds.

And you say that he performed kindness with all of Israel? Rather, it is to teach you that anyone who performs kindness for one of the prominent leaders of Israel, they ascribe him credit as though he did so to all of Israel, and you, our brethren, residents of Usha, all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">You residents of Usha performed kindness for numerous prominent scholars, and you did not owe them a previous debt of gratitude like Yitro owed Moses.</i> <br>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov entered and expounded: “Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying: Pay attention and hear Israel, this day you have become a people [to the Lord your God]” (Deuteronomy 27:9). Was it that day that they received the Torah? Had it not been forty years already since they received the Torah, and you say “this day”? Rather, it teaches that since Moses reviewed the Torah for them and they received it welcomingly, the Torah ascribed them credit as though they had received it that day from Mount Sinai. That is why it is stated: “This day you have become a people to the Lord your God.” And you, our brethren, residents of Usha, who hospitably welcomed our Rabbis, all the more so.

<b>“His left is under my head and his right embraces me” (Song of Songs 2:6).</b><br>“His left is under my head,” these are the first tablets; “and his right embraces me,” these are the second tablets. Alternatively, “his left is under my head,” these are ritual fringes; “and his right embraces me,” these are phylacteries. Alternatively, “his left is under my head” this is the reciting of <i>Shema</i>; and his right embraces me,” this is the <i>Amida</i> prayer. Alternatively, “his left is under my head,” this is <i>sukka</i>; “and his right embraces me,” this is the cloud of the Divine Presence in the future.

Some say: One during the days of Amram; one in the generation of persecution; one during the days of ben Kozeva; and one during the days of Shutelaḥ ben Ephraim, as it is stated: “The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows.” They had calculated the decree was issued when the Holy One blessed be He spoke with Abraham our patriarch between the pieces, but it began when Isaac was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">God told Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land for four hundred years, and they would be enslaved (Genesis 15:13). Members of the tribe of Ephraim assumed that the four hundred years began from when God spoke to Abraham, but in fact they began thirty years later, when Isaac was born.</i> What did they do? They gathered and went to war and they suffered many casualties. Why? It is because they did not believe in the Lord and did not trust His salvation. They violated the end of days and they violated the oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">They attempted to forcefully bring about redemption before the proper time.</i> <br>“That you will not awaken, and you will not rouse [love, until it pleases],” Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Yudan said: The love that Isaac had for Esau, as it is stated: “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28). What is “until it pleases”? Until it becomes the wish of the elder.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">From the fact that the verse does not say “you will not rouse the end of days,” or “you will not rouse redemption,” the midrash derives the idea that the love referred to in the verse is a factor that prevents the redemption of Israel. Thus, the midrash states that Isaac’s love for Esau, which was due to the honor he accorded Isaac, is a source of merit for Esau’s descendants, and prevents Israel from being redeemed from their dominion. This will be the case “until it becomes the wish of the elder,” i.e. Isaac, meaning until the merit of Esau has been used up (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: The love that the Holy One blessed be He had for Israel, as it is stated: “I have loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is now interpreting the love mentioned in the verse as a cause of redemption for Israel.</i> What is “until it pleases”? [Until it pleases] the heavenly kingdom: When the attribute of justice will so desire in and of itself, I will bring it with loud voice and will not delay. Therefore, it says: “Until it pleases.”

Chapter 8

<b>“The sound of my beloved! Behold, he approaches, he leaps over the mountains and bounds over the hills” (Song of Songs 2:8).</b><br>“The sound of my beloved! Behold, he approaches,” Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: “The sound of my beloved! Behold, he approaches,” this is Moses at the moment when he came and said to Israel: ‘During this month you will be redeemed.’ They said to him: ‘Moses our master, how will we be redeemed? Did the Holy One blessed be He not say to Abraham: “They will enslave them and afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13)? But we have only two hundred and ten years.’ He said to them: ‘Since He desires your redemption, He does not look at your calculations, but rather “he leaps over the mountains.” The mountains and hills mentioned here are nothing other than terminuses and intercalations. He leaps over calculations and over terminuses and intercalations, and during this month you will be redeemed, as it is stated: “This month is for you the beginning of the months” (Exodus 12:2).’<br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: “The sound of my beloved! Behold he approaches,” this is Moses at the moment that he came and said to Israel: ‘During this month you will be redeemed.’ They said to him: ‘Moses our master, how will we be redeemed? We do not have to our credit any good deeds.’ He said to them: ‘Since He desires your redemption, He does not look at your evil deeds. At whom does He look? At the righteous in your midst, and their actions, such as Amram and his court.’
<br>“He leaps over the mountains and bounds over the hills,” mountains are nothing other than courts, just as it says: “I will go and descend upon the mountains” (Judges 11:37).<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that Yiftaḥ’s daughter sought a court to abrogate her father’s vow.</i> During this month you will be redeemed, as it is stated: “This month is for you the beginning of the months.”<br>The Rabbis say: “The sound of my beloved! Behold he approaches,” this is Moses. When he came and said to Israel: ‘During this month you will be redeemed,’ they said to him: ‘Moses our master, how will we be redeemed, when all of Egypt is contaminated with our idol worship?’ He said to them: ‘Since He desires your redemption, He does not look at your idol worship, but rather “he leaps over the mountains.” Mountains are nothing other than idol worship, just as it says: “On the mountaintops they slaughter and on the hills they burn incense” (Hosea 4:13). And during this month you will be redeemed, as it is stated: “This month is for you.”<br>Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Ḥunya in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov say: “The sound of my beloved! Behold, he approaches,” this is the messianic king. When he says to Israel, ‘this month you will be redeemed,’ they will say to him: ‘How will we be redeemed? Did the Holy One blessed be He not take an oath that He will subjugate us to seventy nations?’<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 20:23. Their argument is that since they have not been subjugated to each of the seventy nations, it is not yet time for them to be redeemed.</i> He responds to them [and gives] two answers, saying to them: ‘One of you was exiled to Barbary and one of you was exiled to Smatrya, and it is as though all of you were exiled [there]. Moreover, this kingdom [Rome] imposes levies upon the entire world, from each and every nation. If a certain Cuthean or a certain Barbarian comes and subjugates you,<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">If a Cuthean or a Barbarian employed by the Roman empire exerts authority over you, it is as though you were exiled to their land.</i> it is as though you were subjugated to their entire nation, and [thus] it is as though you were subjugated to seventy nations. During this month you will be redeemed, as it is stated: “This month is for you the beginning of the months.”’

Chapter 9

<b>“My beloved is like a gazelle or a fawn; behold, he is standing behind our wall, gazing from the windows, peering through the lattice” (Song of Songs 2:9).</b><br>“My beloved [<i>dodi</i>] is like a gazelle,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He, ‘Master of the universe, You said to us: Come, come [<i>deyu deyu</i>]. You come to us first.’<br>“My beloved is like a gazelle,” just as this gazelle leaps from mountain to mountain, from valley to valley, from tree to tree, from booth to booth, and from fence to fence, so too, the Holy One blessed be He leapt from Egypt to the sea, and from the sea to Sinai, and from Sinai to the future. In Egypt they saw Him, as it is stated: “I will pass through the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). At the sea they saw Him, as it is stated: “Israel saw the great hand…” (Exodus 14:31); “this is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). At Sinai they saw Him, as it is written: “The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain” (Deuteronomy 5:4), and it is written: “The Lord came from Sinai” (Deuteronomy 33:2).<br>“Or a fawn,” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Like the offspring of a hind. “Behold, he is standing behind our wall,” behind our wall at Sinai. That is what is written: “For on the third day the Lord will descend” (Exodus 19:11). “Gazing through the window,”—“the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain” (Exodus 19:20). “Peering through the lattice,”—“God spoke all these matters” (Exodus 20:1);<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “gazing through the window, peering through the lattice” is understood to mean that God seeks to establish a connection with Israel. The midrash asserts that this was done through the giving of the Torah.</i> “my beloved spoke up, and he said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10)—what did He say to me? “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2).
Another matter, “My beloved is like a gazelle,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You said to us: Come, come. You come to us first.’<br>“My beloved is like a gazelle,” just as this gazelle leaps from mountain to mountain, from valley to valley, from tree to tree, from booth to booth, and from fence to fence, so too, the Holy One blessed be He leaps from this synagogue to that synagogue, from this study hall to that study hall. Why to that extent? In order to bless Israel. By what merit? By the merit of Abraham; that is what is written: “The Lord appeared to him at the terebinths of Mamre [and he was sitting at the entrance of the tent]” (Genesis 18:1). Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: “Was sitting [<i>yoshev</i>],” [the word] <i>yoshev</i> is written without a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that there was something incomplete about his sitting, because he had begun to get up (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Abraham sought to stand, [but] the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Sit, Abraham, you are a model for your descendants. Just as you are sitting and I am standing, so will it be for your descendants when they enter the synagogue and the study hall and recite <i>Shema</i>; they will be sitting, and My glory will stand in their midst.’ What is the source? “God stands [<i>nitzav</i>] in the congregation of God” (Psalms 82:1). Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: “God stands [<i>omed</i>]” is not written, but rather, <i>nitzav</i>. What is <i>nitzav</i>? It is standing at the ready, just as it says: “You shall stand [<i>venitzavta</i>] there for Me atop the mountain” (Exodus 34:2), and it is written: “It will be, before they call [I will answer, while they yet speak I will hear]” (Isaiah 65:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that God stands at the ready, anticipating Israel’s prayers.</i> Rabbi Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: With each and every praise with which Israel lauds the Holy One blessed be He, the Holy One blessed be He sits in their midst, as it is written: “You are holy, sitting upon the praises of Israel” (Psalms 22:4).<br>“Or a fawn,” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Like the offspring of a hind. “Behold, he is standing behind our wall,” behind the walls of synagogues and study halls. “Gazing through the window,” from between the priests’ shoulders. “Peering through the lattice,” from between the priests’ fingers. “My beloved spoke up, and he said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10), what did He say to me? “May the Lord bless you and keep you” (Numbers 6:24).
Another matter, “my beloved is like a gazelle,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You said to us: Come, come. You come to us first.’ “My beloved is like a gazelle,” just as this gazelle appears and is then obscured, appears and is then obscured, so too, the first redeemer [Moses] appeared, was obscured, and appeared again. How long was he obscured from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Three months. That is what is written: “They encountered Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 5:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">This verse, written about the Israelite foremen, implies that they had not seen Moses and Aaron for some time. This is because they were in Goshen, where most of the Israelites lived, whereas Aaron was in the Egyptian capital and Moses had returned briefly to Midian (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Yehuda ben Rabbi said: [They encountered Moses] from time to time. So too, the ultimate redeemer will appear to them and will then be obscured from them. For how long will he be obscured from them? Forty-five days; that is what is written: “From the time of the abolishing of the continual offering, and the setting of the desolating detestable thing, there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits, and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days” (Daniel 12:12). These extra days, what are they? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Ketzarta said in the name of Rabbi Yona: These are the forty-five days that he will be obscured from them, and during those days Israel will pick saltwort and juniper roots as food. That is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from bushes, and the roots of the broom are their food” (Job 30:4).<br>To where will he lead them? There is one who says: To the wilderness of Judah, and one who says: To the wilderness of Siḥon and Og. The one who says to the wilderness of Judah; that is what is written: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the days of old” (Hosea 12:10). The one who says: To the wilderness of Siḥon and Og [derives it] from what is written: “Therefore, behold, I will seduce her, and I will lead her to the wilderness and I will speak to her heart. I will give her her vineyards” (Hosea 2:16–17). Anyone who believes in him, follows him, and waits; he will live, and anyone who does not believe in him, and goes to the nations of the world; ultimately, they kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: At the conclusion of forty-five days, he will appear to them and cause manna to fall for them; “there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).
Another matter, “or a fawn,” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Like the offspring of a hind. “Behold, he is standing behind our wall,” behind the Western Wall of the Temple. Why? Because the Holy One blessed be He took an oath that it will never be destroyed. The Priests’ Gate and Ḥulda Gate will never be destroyed until the Holy One blessed be He refurbishes them. “Gazing through the window,” this is the merit of the patriarchs. “Peering through the lattice,” this is the merit of the matriarchs.
<b>“My beloved spoke up, and he said to me: Rise, my love, my fair one, and go” (Song of Songs 2:10).</b><br>“My beloved spoke up [<i>ana</i>], and he said [<i>ve’amar</i>] to me,” what did He say to me? “This month is for you the beginning of the months” (Exodus 12:2). Alternatively, “my beloved spoke up, and he said to me,” Rabbi Azarya said: Is speaking not the same as saying? Rather, he answered [<i>ana</i>] me by means of Moses, and said [<i>ve’amar</i>] to me by means of Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">God sent Moses in response to Israel’s pleas for help, and He spoke to them by means of Aaron, who served as Moses’ spokesman (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> What did He say to me? “Rise, my love, my fair one, and go.” “Rise,” hurry yourself.<br>Another matter, “rise [<i>kumi lakh</i>]” daughter of Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “Go [<i>lekh lekha</i>] from your land and from your birthplace” (Genesis 12:1). “My love [<i>raayati</i>], my fair one [<i>yafati</i>],” daughter of Isaac, who endeared [<i>sheria</i>] himself to Me and exalted [<i>yipa</i>] Me upon the altar. “And go,” daughter of Jacob, who obeyed his father and his mother, as it is stated: “Jacob obeyed his father and mother and went to Padan Aram” (Genesis 28:7).

Similarly, the main enslavement of Israel was eighty-six years, from the time Miriam was born. <Explanatory note: This is why she was named Miriam, because it is stated: “They embittered [<i>vaymareru</i>] their lives” (Exodus 1:14), as Miriam is an expression of bitterness [<i>maror</i>]>.

The time for the sea to have its water split has arrived, as it is stated: “The water split” (Exodus 14:21). The time for song has arrived, as it is stated: “Then Moses…sang” (Exodus 15:1).

Rabbi Beivai said: “Your statutes were paeans to me” (Psalms 119:54). ”The sound of the turtledove [<i>hator</i>] is heard in our land,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The voice of a good explorer [<i>tayar</i>] was heard in our land; this is Moses, at the time that he said: “Moses said: So said the Lord: At about midnight” (Exodus 11:4).

Chapter 13

<b>“The fig tree has formed its unripe figs, and the vines in blossom have emitted fragrance. Rise, my love, my fair one, and go” (Song of Songs 2:13).</b><br>“The fig tree has formed its unripe figs,” these are the Jewish sinners who died during the three days of pitch darkness, as it is stated: “Moses extended his hand at the heavens and there was [pitch] darkness…they did not see one another” (Exodus 10:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 14:3.</i> “The vines in blossom have emitted fragrance,” these are the remainder, who repented and were redeemed.

Another matter, “my beloved spoke up [<i>ana</i>], and he said [<i>ve’amar</i>] to me” (Song of Songs 2:10). Rabbi Azarya said: Is speaking not the same as saying? Rather, he answered [<i>ana</i>] me by means of Moses and said to me by means of Aaron. What did He say to me?

That is what is written: “The days that we went from Kadesh Barnea…[were thirty-eight years]…the hand of the Lord was against them…it was when [the death of all the men of war] was concluded (Deuteronomy 2:14–16). Immediately, “the Lord spoke to me saying” (Deuteronomy 2:17).<br>“The blossoms [<i>hanitzanim</i>] have appeared in the land” (Song of Songs 2:12), the administrators [<i>hanatzoḥot</i>] have appeared in the land; these are the princes, as it is stated: “And one prince from each [tribe]” (Numbers 34:18). “The time of the nightingale [<i>hazamir</i>] has arrived” (Song of Songs 2:12), the time for the foreskin to be cut off [<i>shetizamer</i>] has arrived, the time for the Canaanites to be cut off has arrived, the time for the Land of Israel to be divided among Israel has arrived, as it is stated: “To these, the Land shall be divided” (Numbers 26:53). “The sound of the turtledove [<i>hator</i>] is heard in our land” (Song of Songs 2:12), Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The voice of a good explorer [<i>tayar</i>] was heard in our land; this is the voice of Joshua, at the time that he said: “Pass through the midst of the camp” (Joshua 1:11). “The fig tree has formed its unripe figs” (Song of Songs 2:13), these are the baskets of first fruits. “The vines in blossom have emitted fragrance” (Song of Songs 2:13), these are the libations.
“My beloved spoke up, and he said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10). He answered me by means of Daniel, and said to me by means of Ezra. What did He say to me? “Rise, my love, my fair one” (Song of Songs 2:10). “For, behold, the winter is past” (Song of Songs 2:11), these are the seventy years that Israel spent in the Diaspora. “The rain is over and gone” (Song of Songs 2:11), these are the fifty-two years from when the Temple was destroyed until the kingdom of the Chaldeans was uprooted.

Who are they? Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is written: “The Lord showed me four craftsmen” (Zechariah 2:3), these are: Elijah, the messianic king, Malki Tzedek, and the one anointed for war.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">This term is generally used for the priest who would address soldiers before a battle (see Deuteronomy 20:2). However, in this context it presumably refers to Messiah ben Yosef, as stated explicitly in <i>Sukka</i> 52b (Maharzu).</i> <br>“The time of the nightingale [<i>zamir</i>] has arrived” (Song of Songs 2:12), the time for Israel to be redeemed has arrived, the time for the foreskin to be cut off [<i>shetizamer</i>] has arrived, the time for the Cuthean kingdom to be eliminated has arrived, the time for the kingdom of Heaven to be revealed has arrived, as it is stated: “The Lord will be king over the entire earth” (Zechariah 14:9). “The sound of the turtledove [<i>hator</i>] is heard in our land” (Song of Songs 2:12), what is that? It is the voice of the messianic king who proclaims and says: “How pleasant are the footsteps of the herald on the mountains” (Isaiah 52:7).<br>“The fig tree has formed its unripe figs” (Song of Songs 2:13), Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Just before the messianic era, a great pestilence will come to the world and the wicked will be eliminated. “The vines in blossom have emitted fragrance” (Song of Songs 2:13), these are those who remain, and in their regard it is written: “[Of] the remaining in Zion and the remnant in Jerusalem, [holy will be said]” (Isaiah 4:3).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Sabbatical cycle during which the son of David comes, in the first year it will be fulfilled what is stated: “I will bring rain upon one city and will not bring rain upon another city” (Amos 4:7).

Rabbi Neḥemya says: Prior to the messianic era, poverty will proliferate, prices will be high, the vine will produce its fruit but the wine will spoil, and the entire monarchy will be transformed to heresy, but there will be no rebuke. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The son of David will come only in a generation whose face is like that of a dog. Rabbi Levi said: The son of David will come only in a generation whose face is impudent and which is deserving of elimination. Rabbi Yanai said: If you see generation after generation reviling and blaspheming God, anticipate the footsteps of the messianic king. That is what is written: “For Your enemies revile the Lord; they revile the footsteps of Your anointed one” (Psalms 89:52). What is written thereafter? “Blessed be the Lord forever, amen and amen” (Psalms 89:53).

Chapter 14

<b>“My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff: Show me your appearance, let me hear your voice, for your voice is pleasant, and your appearance is lovely” (Song of Songs 2:14).</b><br>“My dove, in the clefts of the rock.” What is “my dove, in the clefts of the rock”? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I call Israel dove, as it is written: “Ephraim was like a foolish dove with no understanding” (Hosea 7:11). For me, they are like a dove; however, for the nations of the world they are like beasts,’ as it is written: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9), “Naphtali is a hind let loose” (Genesis 49:21), “Dan will be a serpent on the road” (Genesis 49:17), “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf” (Genesis 49:27). All twelve tribes are analogized to beasts, because the nations wage war with Israel and say to Israel: ‘What do you want from Shabbat and from circumcision?’ The Holy One blessed be He fortifies Israel, and they become like beasts before the nations of the world in order to subdue them before the Holy One blessed be He, and before Israel. However, for the Holy One blessed be He they become like an innocent dove and they heed Him. That is what is written: “The people believed and they heard that the Lord remembered” (Exodus 4:31).<br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Moses, why are you standing and shouting? That is what is written: “Why are you shouting to Me?” (Exodus 14:15). The children of Israel do not need you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">I have already heard their own pleas for help, for their “voice is pleasant.”</i> Therefore the Holy One blessed be He said: “My dove, in the clefts of the rock.”<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He said of Israel: ‘For Me they are innocent like doves; however, for the nations of the world they are as cunning as snakes’—that is what is written: “Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego spoke, saying to the king: Nebuchadnezzar…” (Daniel 3:16). If “the king,” why “Nebuchadnezzar,” if “Nebuchadnezzar,” why “the king”? Rather, this is what they said to him: ‘With regard to municipal tax, head tax, state tax, and produce tax, you are our king; that is what is written: “To the king: Nebuchadnezzar.” But with regard to this matter, that you are telling us to prostrate ourselves to your idol, you are Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar is your name; this man and [a dog] who barks are equal to us.’ Nebuchadnezzar barks [<i>navaḥ</i>] like a dog, inflates like a [leather] jug [<i>kad</i>], and chirps [<i>nazar</i>] like a cricket. Immediately, he barked like a dog, inflated like a jug, and chirped like a cricket.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">These terms are employed to describe Nebuchadnezzar’s furious reaction to their refusal to accept his command.</i> It is written: “I observe the king’s directive” (Ecclesiastes 8:2). Rabbi Levi said: I will observe the directive of the King of kings. The mouth that said to us at Sinai: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), “And the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2), based on: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, they said to Nebuchadnezzar that they are bound to observe the oath they took to God to accept Him as God, and to not worship any other being.</i>
The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: When the Israelites departed Egypt, to what were they comparable? To a dove that was fleeing a hawk, entered the crevice of a rock, and encountered a nesting serpent. It was unable to enter, as the serpent was still nesting. It would be unable to reverse its course because the hawk was positioned outside. What did the dove do? It began shrieking and striking itself with its wings so that the owner of the dovecote would come and rescue it. This is what the Israelites were analogous to at the sea. They were unable to descend into the sea because the sea had not yet been split for them. They were unable to reverse their course because Pharaoh was approaching. What did they do? “They were very frightened and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10). Immediately, “The Lord saved [Israel] on that day” (Exodus 14:30).<br>Rabbi Yehuda [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama of the village of Teḥumin: This is analogous to a king who had an only daughter, and he desired to hear her speak [to him]. What did he do? He issued a proclamation and said: The entire people shall emerge to the assembly grounds. When they emerged, what did he do? He signaled to his servants and they suddenly attacked her like bandits. She began screaming: ‘Father, father, save me!’ Similarly, when the Israelites were in Egypt, the Egyptians enslaved them and they began screaming and directing their eyes to the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “It was during those many days, and the king of Egypt died. The children of Israel sighed due to the work and they cried out” (Exodus 2:23). Immediately, “God heard their groaning” (Exodus 2:24). The Holy One blessed be He heard their prayer and took them out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. The Holy One blessed be He desired to hear their voices, but they were unwilling. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he pursued them. That is what is written: “The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued…” (Exodus 14:8), and it is written: “Pharaoh approached” (Exodus 14:10). What is “approached [<i>hikriv</i>]”? He brought Israel closer [<i>hikriv</i>] to repentance. When they saw [Pharaoh and his army], they directed their sights to the Holy One blessed be He, and they cried out before Him, as it is stated: “The children of Israel raised their eyes and, behold, the Egyptians were traveling after them and they were very frightened; the children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10) with the same cry that they cried out in Egypt. Once the Holy One blessed be He heard, He said: ‘Had I not done so to you, I would not have heard your voice.’ Regarding that moment, He said: “My dove, in the clefts of the rock.” “Let me hear a voice,” is not written here, but rather, “your voice,” the voice that I heard in Egypt. When the children of Israel cried out before the Holy One blessed be He, immediately, “The Lord saved [Israel] on that day” (Exodus 14:30).
Rabbi Elazar interpreted the verse regarding Israel when they stood at the sea. “My dove, in the clefts of the rock,” as they were shadowed in the recesses of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">They were in danger of being flushed into the sea and destroyed.</i> “Show me your appearance,” this is what is written: “Stand and see the salvation of the Lord” (Exodus 14:13). “Let me hear your voice,” this is the song, as it is stated: “Then Moses [and the children of Israel] sang” (Exodus 15:1). “For your voice is pleasant,” this is the song. “And your appearance [<i>marekh</i>] is lovely,” as Israel would point [<i>marin</i>] with a finger and say: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2).
Rabbi Akiva interpreted the verse regarding Israel when they stood before Mount Sinai. “My dove, in the clefts of the rock,” as they were shadowed in the recesses of Sinai. “Show me,” as it is stated: “The entire people saw the thunder” (Exodus 20:15). “Let me hear your voice,” this is the sound before the commandments, as it is stated: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). “For your voice is pleasant,” this is the sound after the commandments, as it is stated: “The Lord heard the sound of your words, when you spoke to me…they did well in all that they spoke” (Deuteronomy 5:25). What is “they did well [<i>heitivu</i>] in all that they spoke”? Ḥiyya bar Ada and bar Kappara, one said it was well done like the removal [<i>hatava</i>] of ashes from the lamps of the candelabrum,<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">This process, referred to as <i>hatava</i> (see Exodus 30:7), is performed after the flames are extinguished, a reference to what Israel said after the commandments.</i> and one said it was well done like the preparation [<i>hatava</i>] of the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">This is performed before the incense is burned, a reference to what Israel said before the commandments.</i> “And your appearance is lovely,” as it is stated: “The people saw and they trembled, and they stood at a distance” (Exodus 20:15).
Rabbi Yosei HaGelili interpreted the verse regarding the kingdoms. “My dove, in the clefts of the rock,” as [Israel is] shadowed in the recesses of the kingdoms. “Show me your appearance,” this is [Torah] study. “Let me hear your voice,” this is a good deed. They already once voted in the house of Aliyat Arim in Lod and they said: ‘Which is greater, study or action?’ Rabbi Tarfon said: ‘Action is greater.’ Rabbi Akiva said: ‘Study is greater.’ They voted and concluded: Study is greater, as it engenders action. “For your voice is pleasant,” this is study. “And your appearance is lovely,” this is a good deed.
Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa bat Ḥanina interpreted the verse according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir regarding the Tent of Meeting. “My dove, in the clefts of the rock,” as they were hidden in the shelter of the Tent of Meeting. “Show me your appearance,” as it is stated: The congregation assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 8:4). “Let me hear your voice,” “the people saw and they sang songs of praise” (Leviticus 9:24), they recited a fine song. Because they saw something new, they sang a new song. “For your voice is pleasant,” this is the song. “And your appearance is lovely,” just as it says: “The entire congregation approached and stood before the Lord” (Leviticus 9:5).<br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: They interpreted it according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir regarding the Tent of Meeting; I, too, will interpret it according to the opinion of the Rabbis regarding the Temple. “My dove, in the clefts of the rock,” as they were hidden in the shelter of the Temple. “Show me your appearance,” just as it says: “Then Solomon assembled [the elders of Israel… and all the men of Israel assembled themselves to Solomon]” (I Kings 8:1–2). “Let me hear your voice,” just as it says: “It was when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to sound one voice” (II Chronicles 5:13). Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Abba Kohen ben Delaya: It is written: “The entire people responded together” (Exodus 19:8), and it is written: “The entire people responded in one voice and said” (Exodus 24:3). Until when did that voice stand to their credit? Until, “it was when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to sound one voice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Because Israel had united in accepting the Torah, they merited to unite to sing praise to God at the building of the Temple (Maharzu).</i> “For your voice is pleasant,” this is the song. “And your appearance is lovely,” these are the offerings, just as it says: “Solomon brought the peace offering that he offered to the Lord, cattle” (I Kings 8:63). What cattle? It was “four of the wagons and eight of the cattle” (Numbers 7:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">These cattle had been used to transport the Tabernacle through the wilderness. Once the Temple was built and the Tabernacle was no longer in use, Solomon offered the cattle as offerings (Maharzu).</i>
Rabbi Eliyahu interpreted the verse regarding the festival pilgrims. “Show me your appearance,” these are the festival pilgrims, as it is stated: “Three times a year they shall be seen” (Deuteronomy 16:16). “Let me hear your voice,” this is the melodious recitation of <i>Hallel</i>.” When Israel recites <i>Hallel</i>, their voice ascends On High. The parable says: The paschal offering is in the house and <i>Hallel</i> bursts outward. “And your appearance is lovely,” this is the platform.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">The platform on which the Levites would stand when they sang in the Temple.</i>
Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: Why did Rebecca become barren? It was so the nations of the world would not say: ‘Our prayer produced results,’ as they said to her: “Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads” (Genesis 24:60). This was until Isaac prayed on her behalf, and she was remembered. That is what is written: “Isaac entreated the Lord on behalf of his wife” (Genesis 25:21).<br>Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so they would not rely on their husbands due to their beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">They would not be fully confident in their relationship with their husbands, despite their great beauty, because their husbands would be frustrated by their barrenness. Therefore, they would place their trust in God (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so most of the years would elapse without enslavement.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">In the covenant of the pieces Abraham was told that the four hundred years, beginning with Isaac’s birth, would contain elements of being strangers, enslavement, and oppression (Genesis 15:13). The fact that the matriarchs were barren, together with the fact that the enslavement in Egypt did not begin until after Joseph and his brothers died, ensured that the majority of the four hundred years elapsed without slavery (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Ḥoni [said] in the name of Rabbi Meir: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so their husbands would enjoy their beauty, for when a woman becomes pregnant, she becomes ugly and revolting. Know that it is so, as all the years that Sarah our matriarch was barren she would sit in her house like a bride under her wedding canopy. When she became pregnant, her luster was altered, just as it says: “With pain you shall bear children” (Genesis 3:16). Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shila of the village of Ḥamarta, and Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It is because the Holy One blessed be He desired to hear their speech. He said to them: ‘My dove, I will tell you why I rendered you barren; it is because I desired to hear your speech.’ That is what is written: “For your voice is pleasant, and your appearance is lovely.”

Chapter 15

<b>“Catch foxes for us, little foxes that ruin the vineyards, as our vineyards are in bloom” (Song of Songs 2:15).</b><br>“Catch foxes for us.” When [God] analogizes the kingdoms, He analogizes them only to fire; that is what is written: “I will direct My attention against them; they have emerged from the fire, but fire will consume them” (Ezekiel 15:7). But when He analogizes the Egyptians, he analogizes them with something that is consumed by fire. That is what is written: “It dwindled and extinguished like flax” (Isaiah 43:17). When He analogizes the kingdoms, He analogizes them only to silver and gold, is that not what is written: “That image, its head was of fine gold” (Daniel 2:32). When He analogizes the Egyptians, He analogizes them only to lead, as it is stated: “They sank like lead” (Exodus 15:10).<br>When He analogizes the kingdoms, he analogizes them only to cedars, is that not what is written: “Behold, Assyria is a cedar in Lebanon” (Ezekiel 31:3); and it is written: “The tree that you saw that grew [and was strong, whose height reached to heaven]” (Daniel 4:17); and it is written: “I destroyed the Emorite from before them, [whose height was like the height of cedars]” (Amos 2:9). When He analogizes the Egyptians, He analogizes them only to straw, as it is stated: “He will consume them like straw” (Exodus 15:7).<br>When He analogizes the kingdoms, He analogizes them only to beasts, as it is stated: “Four great beasts arose from the sea, each different from the other” (Daniel 7:3); and it is written: “The first was like a lion” (Daniel 7:4). When He analogizes the Egyptians, He analogizes them only to foxes, as it is stated: “Catch [<i>eḥezu</i>] foxes for us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is interpreted by the midrash to mean: “Foxes would catch us.” Thus, the Egyptians are compared to foxes.</i> [The Egyptians] monitored them to cast them into the Nile.<br>Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: The Egyptians were cunning; therefore He likens them to foxes. Just as the fox looks behind itself, so the Egyptians would look to their end and say: ‘How shall we destroy them? [If] we destroy them in fire, is it not already stated: “For the Lord will judge with fire”? (Isaiah 66:16). [If] we destroy them by the sword, is it not written: “And with His sword all flesh”? (Isaiah 66:16). Rather, let us destroy them in water, as the Holy One blessed be He has already taken an oath that He will never again bring a flood to the world, as it is written: “For this is for Me like the waters of Noah; [as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would no longer pass over the earth]”’ (Isaiah 54:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘By your lives, I will drag each and every one of you to his own flood,’ as it is stated: “They will be hurled [<i>yagiruhu</i>] to the sword [<i>ḥarev</i>]; they will be a portion for the foxes [<i>shualim</i>]” (Psalms 63:11).“They will be hurled to the sword [<i>ḥarev</i>],” these are the wicked, who will be dragged to the dry seabed.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse to mean: He will entice [<i>yegareh</i>] them with dry land [<i>ḥorev</i>], into the waters of the sea [<i>sha’al yam</i>].</i> “They will be a portion for the foxes,” let this portion be designated for the foxes.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: The first instance of foxes [<i>shualim</i>] is written full and the second defective;<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The first instance is written with a <i>vav</i>, and the second is written without a <i>vav.</i> However, it should be noted that traditionally the text appears with both words missing the <i>vav</i>.</i> the foxes [<i>shualim</i>] will descend to the seabed [<i>shaal yam</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">The first appearance of the word includes the <i>vav</i> so that it must be read <i>shualim</i>¸ whereas the second time it does not include the <i>vav</i> so that it may be read <i>shaalim</i>, or <i>sha’al yam</i>.</i>
Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: It is written: “Who makes a way in the sea” (Isaiah 43:16); that is not a difficult feat. “And a path in mighty waters” (Isaiah 43:16); this is not a difficult feat. Rather, what is a difficult feat? “Who brings out chariots and horse, an army, and a mighty force” (Isaiah 43:17). Rabbi Yudan said: A great hunt and pursuit would begin from the archers. Each would push and chase the other, and [their horsemen] would drive them into the sea.<br>Rabbi Ḥanan said: What did the virtuous and modest daughters of Israel do? They would take their sons and conceal them in burrows and the wicked Egyptians would take their small children and bring them into the Israelite houses and pinch them.

Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Yudan said: “Little foxes,” these are Esau and his noblemen, just as it says: “Behold, I made you small among the nations” (Obadiah 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">This prophecy is said regarding Edom, the descendants of Esau. The Sages identified Edom with Rome.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: This is analogous to a province that would produce great swordsmen for the king. There was a certain woman there who gave birth to a puny son, and she would call her son: Tall and Quick. She said to them: ‘My son is tall and quick and you do not make him a great swordsman?’ They said to her: ‘If, in your eyes, he is tall and quick, in our eyes he is puniest of the puny.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This wicked Esau, his father called him great [<i>gadol</i>],’ as it is stated: “He called Esau, his elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son” (Genesis 27:1). His mother called him great, as it is stated: “The garments of Esau, her elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son (Genesis 27:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If, in your eyes, he is great, in My eyes, he is small,’ as it is stated: “Behold, I made you small among the nations” (Obadiah 1:2). And if he is great, the slaughterer corresponds to the bull. That is what is written: “There is a sacrifice for the Lord in Botzra and a great slaughter in the land of Edom” (Isaiah 34:6). “That ruin the vineyards,” this is Israel, as it is written: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7). “As our vineyards are in bloom,” just as it says: “There is no cluster to eat, or a first fruit that my soul desires” (Micah 7:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">The Romans are able to persecute Israel, compared to a vineyard, because the fruits of the vineyard are just beginning to bloom, but there are none that are fully formed yet.

Chapter 16

<b>“My beloved is mine, and I am his, who herds among the lilies” (Song of Songs 2:16).</b><br>“My beloved is mine, and I am his,” He is God for me, and I am a nation for Him. He is God for me, “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2). I am a people and a nation for Him, as it is stated: “Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation” (Isaiah 51:4). He is a father to me, and I am a son to Him. He is a father to me, “For You are our Father” (Isaiah 63:16). I am a son to Him, “My son, My firstborn, Israel” (Exodus 4:22). He is a shepherd to me, “Shepherd of Israel, listen” (Psalms 80:2). I am His flock, “you, My flock, flock of My pasture” (Ezekiel 34:31). He is my guardian, “Behold, the Guardian of Israel does not slumber and does not sleep” (Psalms 121:4). I am His vineyard, as it is stated: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7).<br>He is for me against those who provoke me, and I am for Him against those who anger Him. He is for me against those who provoke me, as He smote the firstborn of Egypt, as it is stated: “I will pass in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12); “it was at midnight and the Lord smote every firstborn” (Exodus 12:29). I am for Him against those who anger Him, as I slaughtered the gods of Egypt, and likewise, “against all the gods of Egypt I will administer punishment” (Exodus 12:12), and I slaughtered them to Him, as it is stated: “Behold, will we slaughter the abomination of Egypt before their eyes, and they will not stone us?” (Exodus 8:22). Likewise, “they shall each take for them a lamb for each patrilineal home” (Exodus 12:3).<br>He said to me: ‘Let the proportion [<i>hamazeg</i>] not be skewed,’ as it is stated: “Your navel is a moon-shaped goblet, may it not lack mixed wine [<i>hamazeg</i>]” (Song of Songs 7:3). I said to Him: ‘You are my good beloved, if only Your goodness will never be lacking from me,’ just as it says: “The Lord is my Shepherd, I will not lack” (Psalms 23:1).<br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Ilai said: He sang to me and I sang to Him; He lauded me and I lauded Him. He called me: “My sister, My love, My faultless dove” (Song of Songs 5:2), and I said to Him: “This is my beloved and this is my companion” (Song of Songs 5:16). He said to me: “Behold you are fair my love” (Song of Songs 4:1), and I said to Him: “Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too” (Song of Songs 1:16). He said to me: “Happy are you Israel, who is like you?” (Deuteronomy 33:29). I said to Him: “Who is like You among the powers, Lord?” (Exodus 15:11). He said to me: “Who is like Your people Israel, one nation in the land” (I Chronicles 17:21). I declare the unity of His name twice daily: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). When I require something, I seek it only from His hand, as it is stated: “It was during those many days, that the king of Egypt died; [the children of Israel sighed due to the bondage, and they cried out, and their plea rose to God due to the bondage.] God heard their groaning…God saw the children of Israel” (Exodus 2:23–25). When He requires something, he seeks it only from me and from my hand, as it is stated: “Speak to the entire congregation of Israel, saying: [In the tenth day of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb]” (Exodus 12:3). When I require something, I seek it only from His hand, as it is stated: “Pharaoh approached and the children of Israel raised [their eyes and…the Egyptians were traveling after them… the children of Israel cried out to the Lord]” (Exodus 14:10). When He requires something, He seeks it only from me, as it is stated: “Speak to the children of Israel and let them take a gift for Me” (Exodus 25:2). When I had trouble, I sought [salvation] only from Him: “The Children of Israel cried out to the Lord, as he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the Children of Israel forcefully…” (Judges 4:3). What is forcefully? It was with cursing and blaspheming. When He required something, He sought it only from me, as it is stated: “They shall make a sanctuary for Me” (Exodus 25:8).
“Who herds among the lilies,” Rabbi Yoḥanan was afflicted and suffered from a fever for three and a half years. Rabbi Ḥanina ascended to visit him. He said to him: ‘How much are you [suffering]?’ He said to him: ‘I am [suffering] more that I can bear.’ He said to him: ‘Do not say that. Rather, say: Faithful God.’ When his suffering was difficult for him, he would say: ‘Faithful God.’ When his suffering was more difficult than he could bear, Rabbi Ḥanina would ascend and say something for him, and his soul would be restored.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Ḥanina would recite an incantation that would give Rabbi Yoḥanan relief (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Sometime later, Rabbi Ḥanina fell ill. Rabbi Yoḥanan ascended to visit him. He said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘How much are you [suffering]?’ [Rabbi Ḥanina] said to him: ‘How difficult is the suffering!’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘And how great is their reward!’ [Rabbi Ḥanina] said to him: ‘I want neither them nor their reward.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘Why do you not say that word that you would say for me, and which restored my soul?’ [Rabbi Ḥanina] said: ‘When I was on the outside, I was responsible for others. Now that I am on the inside, do I not require someone else to be responsible for me?’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘It is written: “Who herds among the lilies.” The rod of the Holy One blessed be He comes often only upon people whose hearts are soft as lilies.’<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">God brings suffering upon people who are able to accept God’s decree with love (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar said: [This is analogous] to an owner who had two cows, one that had great strength and one that had minimal strength. Which one does he exert? Is it not the one that has great strength? So too, the Holy One blessed be He does not subject the wicked to ordeals. Why? Because they would not be able to withstand it, as it is written: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea” (Isaiah 57:20). Whom does He subject to an ordeal? The righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord will test the righteous” (Psalms 11:5); “It was after these matters that God subjected Abraham to an ordeal” (Genesis 22:1); “It was after these matters that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph” (Genesis 39:7).<br>Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: A flax worker, when his flax is hard, he does not beat it very much. Why? Because it will break. When his flax is fine, the more he beats it, the more it improves. So too, the Holy One blessed be He does not subject the wicked to ordeals, as they cannot withstand it, but he subjects the righteous to ordeals, as it is stated: “The Lord will test the righteous.”<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A potter, when he checks his kiln, does not check with the flimsy jugs. Why? Because if he would tap on them they would break. With which does he check? With the sturdy jugs, as even were he to tap on them several times, they would not break. So too, the Holy One blessed be He does not subject the wicked to ordeals. Whom does He subject to ordeals? The righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord will test the righteous.”

Chapter 1

<b>“On my bed at nights I sought the one whom my soul loves; I sought him, but did not find him” (Song of Songs 3:1).</b><br>“On my bed at nights.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: What is “on my bed at nights”? During my illness, just as it says: “And he does not die but falls into bed” (Exodus 21:18). Rabbi Levi said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, in the past You would illuminate for me between nights and nights; between the night of Egypt and the night of Babylon, between the night of Babylon and the night of Media, between the night of Media and the night of Greece, and between the night of Greece and the night of Edom.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Edom refers to Rome. The meaning of Rabbi Levi’s statement is that there would be a bright period between periods of persecution.</i> But now that I have slumbered from the Torah and the mitzvot, nights have become consecutive for me. “On my bed at nights,” Rabbi Alexandra said: When I slumbered from the Torah and the mitzvot, my nights became consecutive for me. “On my bed at nights [<i>balelot</i>],” the nights came [<i>ba’u lelot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The nights, meaning the periods of persecution, came consecutively.</i>
Another matter, “on my bed at nights,” this is the night of Egypt. “I sought the one whom my soul loves,” this is Moses.” I sought him, but did not find him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is because Moses returned from Egypt to Midian for three months (see <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i> 2:9).</i>

Chapter 2

<b>“I will rise now, and circulate in the city, in the streets and in the squares. I will seek the one whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him” (Song of Songs 3:2).</b><br>“I will rise now, and circulate in the city, in the streets and in the squares,” in the cities and in the provinces. “I will seek the one whom my soul loves,” this is Moses; “I sought him, but I did not find him.”

Chapter 3

<b>“The watchmen who patrol the city found me: Have you seen the one whom my soul loves?” (Song of Songs 3:3).</b><br>“The watchmen who patrol,” this is the tribe of Levi, just as it says: “Pass back and forth from gate to gate” (Exodus 32:27). “The one whom my soul loves,” this is Moses.

Chapter 4

<b>“I had almost passed them when I found the one whom my soul loves; I held him and would not release him until I brought him to my mother's house, and to the chamber of the one who conceived me” (Song of Songs 3:4).</b><br>“I had almost passed them when I found the one whom my soul loves,” this is Moses. “I held him and would not release him until I brought him to my mother's house,” this is Sinai. “And to the chamber of the one who conceived me,” this is the Tent of Meeting, as it is from there that Israel became liable for teachings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although they received the mitzvot at Sinai, liability for transgression began with the construction and dedication of the Tent of Meeting.</i>
Another matter, “on my bed at nights,” this is the night of Babylon. “I sought the one whom my soul loves,” this is Daniel; “I sought him, but did not find him.” “I will rise now, and circulate in the city, in the streets and in the squares. I will seek the one whom my soul loves,” this is Daniel. “I sought him, but I did not find him.” “The watchmen…found me,” these are the Chaldeans; “the one whom my soul loves,” this is Daniel. Where did he go? One says to a fast; and one says to a feast. The one who says to a fast, as he was pleading for mercy regarding the destruction of the Temple: “Now, our God, heed the prayer of Your servant” (Daniel 9:17). The one who says to a feast; to read the writing of Belshatzar; that is what is written: “<i>Mene mene tekel ufarsin</i>” (Daniel 5:25). Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta, Rabbi Ḥiyya said: <i>Mene</i>: <i>mem, mem, tav, vav, samekh</i>; <i>nun, nun, kof, peh, yod</i>; <i>alef, alef, lamed, resh, nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The letters were ordered in columns of three and the final word divided into two columns, the result being:<br>ננקפי<br>Thus, in order to understand the writing, Daniel had to read each column from top to bottom. This is an allusion to the fact that the message came down from above.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: <i>Yod, tet, tav</i>; <i>yod, tet, tav</i>; <i>alef, dalet, kaf</i>; <i>peh, vav, gimmel, ḥet, mem, tet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This inverts all the letters on the basis of the <i>at bash</i> cipher, in which <i>alef</i>, the first letter of the alphabet, is replaced with <i>tav</i> [<i>at</i>], the last letter; <i>beit</i> is replaced with <i>shin</i>, etc. This is also an allusion to the divine source of the message.</i> The Rabbis say: <i>Alef, nun, mem; alef, nun, mem; lamed, kof, tav; nun, yod</i>, <i>samekh, resh, peh, vav.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion, the order of the letters in each word was reversed.</i></i> Rabbi Meir says: In accordance with its plain meaning. <i>Mene mene tekel ufarsin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The words were written as they appear, and not in code. The reason the scholars other than Daniel could not decipher it is because the Hebrew letters were written in the Assyrian script, which was then adopted as the regular Hebrew script, and not in the more familiar ancient Hebrew script.</i> God has counted [<i>mana</i>] the years of your kingdom and it has been completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mene</i> is written twice to indicate that God counted at the outset and counted again at present, and the time for the Babylonian kingdom had elapsed.</i> God weighed [<i>tekel</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tav</i> in Aramaic replaces the Hebrew <i>shin</i>; therefore <i>tekel</i> is the equivalent of <i>shakal</i> – weighed.</i> on the scale...<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He weighed your good deeds and evil deeds and the result is that you do not have the requisite virtue to remain in power.</i> He has divided [<i>paras</i>] your kingdom and given it…<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He has given it to the Medes and the Persians.</i><br>At that moment all Israel assembled near Daniel and said to him: ‘Our master Daniel, all the dire and harsh prophecies that Jeremiah prophesied befell us, and the one positive prophecy that he prophesied in our regard: “For at the completion of seventy years for Babylonia, [I will remember you]” (Jeremiah 29:10), has not yet transpired.’ He said to them: ‘Bring me the book of Isaiah.’ He began reading until he reached this verse: “A prophecy of the wilderness of the sea, like gale force winds in the south” (Isaiah 21:1). If sea, why wilderness, if wilderness, why sea? Rather, these are the four kingdoms that are likened to beasts, as it is written: “And four great beasts” (Daniel 7:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the four kingdoms who would subjugate Israel, of which Babylonia was the first.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Each different from the other” (Daniel 7:3); the damage that each causes is different from the other. If you merit, from the sea; if not, from the forest; just as these beasts, that ascend from the sea, do not cause damage and those that emerge from the forest do cause damage, so too, if you merit, the nations will not rule over you. On a similar note, “the boar from the forest [<i>miyaar</i>] will gnaw at it” (Psalms 80:14). There is a suspended <i>ayin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>ayin</i> in the word <i>miyaar</i> is written such that it is small and suspended over the other letters. This is so that the word can be read without the <i>ayin</i>, as river [<i>yeor</i>], or with the <i>ayin</i>, as forest [<i>yaar</i>].</i> If you merit, it will be from the river [<i>yeor</i>] and if not, from the forest [<i>yaar</i>]. Just as the beast that ascends from the sea does not cause damage, [and that which] emerges from the forest causes damage, so it is.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">With the nations of the world.</i><br>“Like sweeping gale force winds in the south” (Isaiah 21:1), Rabbi Levi said: You do not have any windstorm that is as severe as the windstorm that comes from the north and causes the people located in the south to turn white from terror. What is this?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">What is the prophet referring to with this imagery?</i> This is Nebuchadnezzar, who arose from the north and destroyed the Temple that was located in the south. “Coming from the wilderness [from a fearful land]” (Isaiah 21:1). From where did he come? Rabbi Ḥanina said: He came from a desolate path in the wilderness, [as it is stated]: “Coming from the wilderness from a fearful land.”<br>“A harsh vision was told to me” (Isaiah 21:2). There are ten expressions for prophecy: Vision [<i>ḥazon</i>], prophecy [<i>nevua</i>], preaching [<i>hatafa</i>], speech [<i>dibur</i>], saying [<i>amira</i>], command [<i>tzivui</i>], burden [<i>masa</i>], parable [<i>mashal</i>], poetry [<i>melitza</i>], riddle [<i>ḥida</i>]. Which is the harshest of all? Rabbi Eliezer says: Vision [<i>ḥazon</i>] is the harshest, as it is stated: “A harsh vision [<i>ḥazut</i>] was told to me” (Isaiah 21:2). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Speech [<i>dibur</i>] is the harshest, as it is stated: “The man, lord of the land, spoke [<i>diber</i>] harshly with us” (Genesis 42:30). The Rabbis say: Burden [<i>masa</i>] is the harshest, in its plain sense: “Like a heavy burden [<i>masa</i>]” (Psalms 38:5).<br>“The traitor betrays and the plunderer plunders. Ascend [<i>ali</i>], Eilam! Besiege, Media!” (Isaiah 21:2). The trouble of Eilam has already disappeared [<i>nitalem</i>]. “Besiege [<i>tzuri</i>], Media,” the trouble [<i>tzara</i>] of Media has already been created [<i>notzera</i>]. “All its sighing I ended” (Isaiah 21:2); all the sighing caused by Babylon. “Therefore my loins are filled with trembling” (Isaiah 21:3), Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Because they sensed some of the trouble that the kingdoms would cause, our ancestors became restive. Initially, “…to circumvent the land of Edom, and the soul of the people grew restive” (Numbers 21:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">They grew uneasy as they traveled past Edom because they sensed the troubles that Edom, identified as Rome, would cause the Jewish people.</i> Jeremiah said: “We bring our bread at the peril of our lives” (Lamentations 5:9). Daniel said: “I, Daniel, my spirit was distressed” (Daniel 7:15). Isaiah said: “Therefore my loins are filled with trembling” (Isaiah 21:3). We, who are engulfed within their innards for many days, many years, many eras, and many epochs, all the more so.<br>“Therefore, my loins are filled with trembling; pains have overcome me, like the pains of a woman in childbirth. I am confounded from hearing; I am frightened from seeing” (Isaiah 21:3). “I am confounded from hearing”—the sounds of blasphemies and curses of the wicked; that is what is written: “You have been haughty toward the Lord of heaven: and the vessels of His House…” (Daniel 5:23).<br>“I am frightened from seeing,” from seeing the tranquility of that wicked one; that is what is written: “King Belshatzar made a great banquet” (Daniel 5:1). What is “great”? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: Greater than that of his God. He said to them: ‘Your <i>omer</i>, how was it prepared for sacrifice?’ They said: ‘With thirteen sifters.’ He said to them: ‘But mine is with fourteen sifters.’<br>“My heart is bewildered” (Isaiah 21:4), this is the court, which erred in the calculation of one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">They erred in the calculation of the end of the Babylonian exile, and were therefore bewildered as to why it had not yet ended. Their calculation as to the day of their redemption was incorrect.</i> “Terror [<i>palatzut</i>] has frightened me” (Isaiah 21:4), Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua said: You enjoyed my cup [<i>peyali</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They ate and drank using the Temple vessels.</i> Alternatively, <i>palatzut</i>, the mouth [<i>peh</i>] that spreads words of cynicism [<i>letzut</i>]; alternatively, “terror [<i>palatzut</i>] has frightened me,” because words of cynicism emerged.<br>“My night of desire, he has transformed into horror” (Isaiah 21:4), the night regarding which my soul was yearning for, for redemption, has been transformed into horror. “Setting the table” (Isaiah 21:5), you set the table,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash merely translated this Hebrew expression into Aramaic. The prophet is describing Belshatzar’s arrogant and elaborate feast in celebration of the fact that Israel, he assumed, would never be redeemed.</i> “kindling the candelabrum” (Isaiah 21:5), you set up the candelabrum, you kindled the lamps.<br>“Arise princes” (Isaiah 21:5), these are Cyrus and Darius; “anoint the shield” (Isaiah 21:5), receive the kingdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Belshatzar arrogantly celebrated, but ultimately he was supplanted by Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian.</i> Cyrus had said to Darius: ‘Reign before me.’ Darius said to Cyrus: ‘That is not what Daniel articulated: “Your kingdom is divided and given to Media and Persia” (Daniel 5:28), to Media first and to Persia thereafter. You should reign before me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that Media would rule before Persia. According to the extant text of the midrash, this is difficult to understand, as Cyrus the Persian would have been correct in offering Darius the first rule. Apparently the correct version is that Darius offered Cyrus first rule, and Cyrus responded that Darius should rule first based on the order implied in the verse in Daniel (Maharzu).</i> When that wicked one<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Belshatzar.</i> heard, he dispatched and said to his armies: ‘Any nation and kingdom that rebelled against me, we will invade them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, you sent to everyone,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">You sent threats to all the nations who rebelled.</i> did you perhaps send to me?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Did you repent your sins in an attempt to revoke the decree that you will be stripped of your kingdom?</i> By your life, the punishment of that man<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Belshatzar.</i> will not come from anywhere else, but rather from Me.’ That is what is written: “For it is not from the east or the west…but God is the Judge; He humbles this one and elevates that one” (Psalms 75:7–8), He will humble Belshatzar and elevate Cyrus and Darius.<br>Cyrus and Darius were Belshatzar’s gatekeepers. When he heard these verses, he said to them: ‘Anyone whom you see here tonight, even if he says to you: I am the king, remove his head.’ It is not the way of kings to situate their lavatories within their halls, but rather outside their halls. His bowels were loose all that night and he went out and they did not notice him. When he entered, they noticed him. They said to him: ‘Who are you?’ He said to them: ‘I am the king.’ They said to him: ‘Is this not what the king commanded, that anyone whom we see here this night, even if he says to you: I am the king, remove his head?’ What did they do? They took a branch from the candelabrum and pierced his brain. That is what is written: “On that night, Belshatzar the Chaldean king was killed (Daniel 5:30).<br>At what hour was he killed? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: At the time when sleep begins. Rabbi Shmuel said: When one can distinguish between a wolf and a dog. They do not disagree. The one who says: When sleep begins [says that Belshatzar] was convulsing that entire day, as it was attributed to him as part of his reign.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">He was struck at the beginning of the night, but since his reign included the calendar day that began that night, he did not actually die until the beginning of the following night (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). Some suggest that the text should read that he was convulsing all night and died in the morning (Rabbi David Luria).</i> The one who says: When one can distinguish between a wolf and a dog [says that] he was dying all that night, as it was attributed to him as part of his reign.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He was struck at the beginning of the night and convulsed into the morning, when there is enough light to recognize the difference between a wolf and a dog (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Rabbi Binyamin ben Levi said: Like the time between one cup and another cup, one kingdom was replaced by another kingdom. That is what is written: “For a cup is in the hand of the Lord with foaming wine…He pours from it. [But the dregs are sucked, drunk by all the wicked of the earth]” (Psalms 75:9).<br>This is why the prophet mocks and says: “Go down and sit on the dust” (Isaiah 47:1). The punishment fits the crime; just as there: “The elders of the daughter of Zion will sit silently on the ground” (Lamentations 2:10), so here: “Go down and sit on the dust.” Rabbi Ḥunya said: So said Jerusalem to the daughter of Babylon: Old, worn out, repulsive harlot, go down. You consider yourself a virgin; you are old. “Sit on the ground without a chair” (Isaiah 47:1), your meriting that throne is null and void.<br>What merit did he have?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">By what merit did the Babylonian kings rule until that point?</i> “At that time Merodakh Baladan, [son of Baladan, king of Babylon], sent [scrolls and a gift to Hezekiah; he had heard that he had become ill and recovered]” (Isaiah 39:1).

He sought to kill all of his guards. He said to them: ‘You let me sleep all day and all night?’ They said to him: ‘The day receded.’ He said to them: ‘Who was the God who caused it to recede?’ They said: ‘The God of Hezekiah caused it to recede.’ He said to them: ‘Is there a god greater than my god?’ They said to him: ‘The God of Hezekiah is greater than your god.’ He immediately sent scrolls and a gift to Hezekiah. That is what is written: “At that time Merodakh Baladan…sent.”<br>What did he write in them? Greetings to Hezekiah, greetings to the great God, greetings to Jerusalem. When the letters had been dispatched he reconsidered and said: ‘I acted improperly. I had the greetings to Hezekiah precede those to his God.’ Immediately, he arose from his throne, took three steps, recalled the letters and wrote other letters in their place. He wrote in them: Greetings to the great God of Hezekiah, greetings to Hezekiah, and greetings to Jerusalem. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You arose from your throne and took three steps in My honor; by your life, I will establish three cosmopolitan kings from you who will rule from one end of the world to the other.’ These are they: Nebuchadnezzar, Evil Merodakh, and Belshatzar. When they arose and blasphemed, the Holy One blessed be He eliminated any vestige of them from the world, and established others in their stead.<br>It is written: “Hezekiah rejoiced over them and he showed them his treasure house [<i>beit nekhoto</i>]” (Isaiah 39:2). What is <i>beit nekhoto</i>? Rabbi Imi said: It is the bite [<i>nekhita</i>] that he took from Sennacherib, and the plunder that he plundered from Sennacherib.

Had He not “sent fire into my bones” (Lamentations 1:13), could you have overcome me?

<b>“Who is this ascending from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, and with all the powders of the merchant?” (Song of Songs 3:6).</b><br>“Who is this ascending from the wilderness,” its ascent was in the wilderness;<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Israel was elevated in the wilderness, as the midrash goes on to explain.</i> its removal <alternate reading, its distribution><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The division of the camp based on tribal units, which would eventually become the basis of the distribution of the Land of Israel to the tribes.</i> was in the wilderness; its death was in the wilderness, just as it says: “In this wilderness they will cease to exist” (Numbers 14:35). Torah [was given] from the wilderness, the Tabernacle from the wilderness, Sanhedrin from the wilderness, priesthood from the wilderness, Levites from the wilderness, royalty from the wilderness, as it is stated: “You will be for Me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6); and all the fine gifts that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Israel were from the wilderness. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: In the wilderness they loaded,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">They received the Torah.</i> and in the wilderness they unloaded.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">When they sinned.</i> Prophecy is from the wilderness. That is, its ascent is from the wilderness.
“Like columns of smoke.” Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: When Israel was wandering from journey to journey, the pillar of cloud would descend and the pillar of fire would ascend, and the smoke from the arrangement of wood [on the altar] would ascend like two sparks of fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">From the two altars, the copper altar used for sacrificial offerings and the gold altar used for incense.</i> They would emerge from between the two staves of the Ark and burn before them snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions. The nations of the world would see and say: ‘They are gods and all their actions are performed with fire.’ Due to their terror of Israel, fear and trembling would beset them. That is what is written: “Terror and fear will beset them” (Exodus 15:16). “Beset them” is not written, but rather “will beset them”—from here and on.<br>“Perfumed with myrrh,” this is our patriarch Abraham. Just as myrrh is the first of all the spices,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 30:23.</i> so too, Abraham our patriarch was the first of all the righteous. Just as myrrh, anyone who gathers it, his hands have a bitter residue, so too, Abraham our patriarch would embitter and torment himself with suffering. Just as myrrh emanates its fragrance only in fire, so Abraham divulged his good deeds only in the fiery furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was thrown into a fiery furnace due to his rejection of idolatry (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 38:13).</i> <br>“And frankincense,” this is our patriarch Isaac, who was sacrificed like a handful of frankincense on the altar. “With all the powders of the merchant,” this is Jacob our patriarch, whose bed was unflawed and no waste was found among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob’s sons were righteous.</i><br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Just as there are all kinds of spices in the peddler’s box, so too, priesthood is from Jacob, and Levites and royalty from Jacob. Isaac, Abraham gave him everything that was his, as it is stated: “Abraham gave everything that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5). However, all of Jacob’s wares were only from the dust that was beneath his feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He solidified his hold on the blessings he received only in the aftermath of his struggle with Esau’s angel, symbolized by dust [<i>avak</i>], as the verse states: “A man wrestled [<i>vaye’avek</i>] with him there” (Genesis 32:25). See Genesis 32:25–30. (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said two [statements]. Rabbi Yudan said: All the wares with which Israel engages and is successful in this world are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Yudan said another: All the merchandise<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is using the term merchandise to refer to large-scale business, as opposed to “wares,” which is seen as small-scale peddling.</i> that Israel produces and succeeds with in this world are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Azarya said two [statements]: All the wars in which Israel engages and succeeds are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Azarya said another: All the Torah that Israel performs in this world is due to the merit of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Abahu: That dust, the Holy One blessed be He took it and placed it under His throne of glory. That is what is written: “The Lord, his way is in the tempest and in the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet” (Nahum 1:3).
Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: It is written: “A man wrestled with him” (Genesis 32:25). We do not know who was dominated by whom; whether the angel was dominated by Jacob or Jacob was dominated by the angel, except from what is written: “He said: Release me, as dawn has broken” (Genesis 32:27). The angel said to Jacob: ‘Release me, as the time for my lauding has arrived.’ Thus, the angel was dominated by Jacob.<br>In what guise did he appear to him? Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: He appeared to him in the guise of Esau’s guardian angel. That is what is written: “For I have therefore seen your face like seeing the face of an angel” (Genesis 33:10). [Jacob] said to [Esau]: ‘Your face is like that of your angel.’ This is analogous to a king who had a tamed lion and a wild dog. What did the king do? He brought the lion and incited it against his son. He would say: If the dog comes upon my son, my son will say: If I overcame the lion will I not be able to overcome the dog? So too, when the nations of the world come upon Israel, the Holy One blessed be He says to then: ‘Your guardian angel was not able to withstand their ancestor, will you be able to overcome them?’<br>Rabbi Huna said: He appeared to him as a herdsman; this one had flocks and that one had flocks, this one had camels and that one had camels. He said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The angel said to Jacob.</i> ‘Cross mine and I will cross yours.’<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Help me cross the stream with my livestock, and I will help you cross with your livestock. Some suggest that the text should read: Cross yours and I will cross mine. This is consistent with the version of the text in <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 77:3 and with the continuation of the midrash here (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> After Jacob our patriarch crossed his, he said: ‘Let us return and see, perhaps we forgot something.’ Once he returned, “a man wrestled with him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The angel, appearing as a herdsman, fought with Jacob under the pretense that after crossing his own livestock, Jacob had come to take some of his livestock.</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi were engaged in commerce and were dealing silk fabric. They entered Tyre and engaged in their labor. When they exited the city gates, they said: ‘Let us return and see, perhaps we forgot something.’ They returned and found a bundle of silk fabric. They said: This matter is from Jacob our grandfather, as it is written: “A man wrestled with him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This event occurred after Jacob had returned to see if he forgot anything. They derived from Jacob’s behavior that checking if one forgot anything is a good habit.</i> <br>The Rabbis say: He appeared to him as an arch robber; this one had flocks and that one had flocks, this one had camels and that one had camels. He said to him: Cross mine and I will cross yours. The angel crossed Jacob’s flocks in the blink of an eye. Our patriarch Jacob was crossing the flocks of the angel, and he was returning and finding other flocks all that night. What did Jacob our patriarch do? Rabbi Pinḥas said: At that moment, Jacob wrapped a soft woolen scarf around his neck. He said to him: ‘Sorcerer, sorcerer, you are a wizard, but wizardry is not effective at night.’ Rabbi Huna said: At that moment the angel said: ‘Shall I not inform him with whom he is dealing?’ What did he do? He placed a finger on a rock and it began bursting into flames. [Jacob] said to him: ‘With this you are seeking to frighten me? I am constituted entirely from it,’ as it is stated: “The house of Jacob will be fire” (Obadiah 1:18).<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Esau’s guardian angel: ‘Are you standing against him? He is coming against you with five amulets in his hand: His merit, the merit of his father, the merit of his mother, the merit of his grandfather, and the merit of his grandmother. Assess yourself relative to him, as you are unable to stand even against his own merit.’ Immediately, “he saw that he could not overcome him” (Genesis 32:26). Rabbi Levi said: He saw in the Divine Presence that he could not overcome him. [This is analogous] to an arch robber who was struggling with the son of a king. He lifted his eyes and saw that his father the king was standing over him, and he submitted to him. So too, when the angel saw the Divine Presence standing over Jacob, he submitted before him. That is what is written: “He saw that he could not overcome him.” Rabbi Levi said: He saw in the Divine Presence that he could not overcome him.<br>“He touched the socket of his thigh” (Genesis 32:26), the righteous men and the righteous women and the prophets and the prophetesses who were destined to emerge from him and his sons. What is that? It is the generation of persecution.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The generation that lived after the destruction of the Temple, when the Romans persecuted the residents of the Land of Israel.</i> “The socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated [<i>vateka</i>]” (Genesis 32:26), Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Eliezer says: He smoothed it.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The bone that protrudes from the thigh no longer protruded.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rav Asi:<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text says Ravasa, which is short for Rav Asi.</i> He fractured it like [one splits] a fish.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Lengthwise.</i> Rabbi Naḥman bar Yaakov said: He dislocated it, just as you say: “My soul was alienated [<i>vateka</i>] from her” (Ezekiel 23:18).
Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse: “Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, and with all the powders of the merchant” regarding the incense of the house of Avtinas,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The incense in the Temple was prepared by the priestly house of Avtinas; see, e.g., Mishna <i>Shekalim</i> 5:1; <i>Yoma</i> 3:11.</i> and this is one of the eleven spices that they would place in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to myrrh, although frankincense, which is also mentioned in the verse here, was also an ingredient in the incense.</i> Rav Huna interpreted it: “The Lord said to Moses: Take spices for you” (Exodus 30:34), that is two;<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The word spices is plural, indicating at least two spices.</i> “stacte, onycha, and galbanum” (Exodus 30:34), that is five; “spices” (Exodus 30:34), if you say that this is two, but did it not already say “spices”? “Each part shall be equal” (Exodus 30:34), these are five corresponding to the five, that is ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the phrase “each part shall be equal,” the midrash interprets the second mention of “spices” to refer to an additional five types of spices.</i> “And pure frankincense” (Exodus 30:34), these are eleven spices. From here the Sages examined and found that only these eleven spices are ideal for incense.<br>It is taught: The house of Avtinas were experts in the preparation of the incense, in the blending of the incense, and it would generate a column of smoke, but they were unwilling to teach it.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">They were unwilling to teach others how to prepare the incense such that it would rise in a straight column of smoke.</i> The Sages sent and brought craftsmen from Alexandria who were expert in the preparation of the incense, but were not expert in generating a column of smoke.

And when they would marry a woman from another place they would make an agreement with her that she would never perfume herself, so that Israel would not say that they were perfuming themselves from the blending of the incense, to fulfill what is stated: “You shall be vindicated before God and before Israel” (Numbers 32:22), and it says: “you will find grace and good favor in the eyes of God and man” (Proverbs 3:4).<br>Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon ben Loga related to me: I and a child from the descendants of the house of Avtinas were gathering herbs in the field, and I saw that he cried and laughed.

I said to him: ‘What is that in your hand?’ He said to me: ‘When they were discreet, the members of my patrilineal house would pass the scrolls one to another, but now, here it is for you, but be careful with it, as it is a scroll of spices.’ When I came and related the matters before Rabbi Akiva, his tears flowed.

Because they sought to increase their glory and diminish the glory of the Omnipresent, their glory diminished and the kingdom of Heaven remains in its place. Moreover, they have no descendant or offspring among Israel. Regarding the first ones, it is stated: “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7), and regarding these it is stated: “and the name of the wicked will rot” (Proverbs 10:7).

<b>“Behold the bed of Solomon: sixty valiant men surround it, from the valiant of Israel, each armed with a sword, trained in war; each man, a sword on his thigh, from fear in the nights” (Song of Songs 3:7–8).</b><br>“Behold the bed of Solomon: sixty valiant men surround it,” Rabbi Beivai in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei interpreted the verse regarding the Priestly Benediction. “Behold the bed [<i>mitato</i>],” behold his tribes [<i>matotav</i>] and his clans, just as it says: “The oaths to the tribes [<i>matot</i>]” (Habakkuk 3:9); “of Solomon [Shlomo],” of the king [of Whom it may be said that] peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His; “sixty valiant men surround it,” these are the sixty letters in the Priestly Benediction; “from the valiant of Israel,” as they bolster Israel.<br>“Each armed with a sword,” Rabbi Azarya said: Matters that are blessed with Might,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Each blessing contains the name of the mighty God.</i> “may the Lord bless you” (Numbers 6:24), “may the Lord shine” (Numbers 6:25), “may the Lord lift” (Numbers 6:26). “Trained in war,” as they battle all sorts of calamities that exist in the world. “Each man, a sword on his thigh from fear in the nights,” for even if a person sees in his dream a sword cutting his thigh, what shall he do? He shall go to the synagogue, recite <i>Shema</i>, pray his prayer, hear the Priestly Benediction, and answer amen after them, and no evil matter will harm him. Therefore, He cautions the sons of Aaron and says to them: “So you shall bless the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:23).
Rabbi Simlai interpreted the verse regarding the priestly watches. “Behold the bed [<i>mitato</i>],” behold his tribes [<i>matotav</i>] and his clans, just as you say: “The oaths to the tribes [<i>matot</i>], sela” (Habakkuk 3:9); “of Solomon [Shlomo],” to the king [of Whom it may be said] that peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His; “sixty valiant men surround it,” these are the twenty-four priestly watches, the twenty-four Levite watches, and the twelve divisions; “from the valiant of Israel,” as they protect Israel. “Each armed with a sword,” Rabbi Ze’eira and Rabbi Yehuda [said] in the name of Shmuel: These are the Torah scholars who teach the priests ritual slaughter and the laws of sprinkling and collecting,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Sprinkling and collecting the blood of animal offerings.</i> and of the handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The handful taken from the meal offering and burned on the altar.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said in the name of Rabbi Ami: These are the inspectors of the blemishes of sacrificial animals, who collect their wages from the collection of the chamber.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Each man would donate a half-shekel per year to the Temple treasury.

Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding the Sanhedrin. “Behold the bed [<i>mitato</i>],” his tribes [<i>matotav</i>] and his clans, just as you say: “The oaths to the tribes [<i>matot</i>]” (Habakkuk 3:9); “of Solomon [Shlomo],” of the king [of Whom it may be said] that peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His; “sixty valiant men,” these are the sixty people from the people of the land; that is what is written: “And sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city” (II Kings 25:19); “from the valiant of Israel,” these are the eleven men; that is what is written: “The captain of the guards took Seraya the chief priest, Tzefanyahu the deputy priest, and the three gatekeepers. From the city he took one official [<i>saris</i>] (II Kings 25:18–19),” this is the most distinguished member of the court. Why is he called <i>saris</i>? It is because he reorders and resolves [<i>mesares</i>] the <i>halakha</i>; “and five men of those who see the king's face (II Kings 25:19),” this is eleven. When it says “seven [men of those who see the king’s face]” (Jeremiah 52:25), that is to add two scribes of the judges who sit before them. “From the valiant of Israel,” as they benefit Israel with their might.<br>“Each armed with a sword,” Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Meir says: They would all study <i>halakha</i> like a sword, so if an incident comes before them, the <i>halakha</i> would not be dull for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">They studied intensely, so that they would be sharp and clear in their halakhic rulings and analyses.</i> Rabbi Yosei says: During a trial, all of them deliberate how best to issue a verdict regarding the incident, and they fear the judgment of Gehenna.<br>Rabbi Menaḥem son-in-law of Rabbi Elazar bar Avuna [said] in the name of Rabbi Yaakov bar Avina: If a woman comes before you to the study hall to ask you a question regarding her stain or her menstruation, look upon her as though she emerged from your loins and do not look at her covetously; fear the judgment of Gehenna.
The Rabbis interpreted the verse regarding those who departed from Egypt. “Behold the bed [<i>mitato</i>],” his tribes [<i>matotav</i>] and his clans, just as it says: “The oaths of the tribes [<i>matot</i>]” (Habakkuk 3:9); “of Solomon [Shlomo],” of the king [of Whom it may be said] that peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His; “sixty valiant men,” these are the six hundred thousand who departed Egypt from twenty years of age and above; “from the valiant of Israel,” these are the six hundred thousand who departed Egypt from twenty years of age and below.<br>“Each armed with a sword, trained in war; each man, a sword on his thigh,” for when Moses said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He told me the following principle: “All uncircumcised shall not eat from it”’ (Exodus 12:48); immediately, each and every one took his sword on his thigh and circumcised himself.<br>Who circumcised them? Rabbi Berekhya said: Moses was the circumciser, Aaron uncovered the skin,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">After the foreskin is severed, one pulls back a thin membrane under it and uncovers the corona.</i> and Joshua gave them to drink. Some say: Joshua was the circumciser, Aaron uncovered the skin, and Moses gave them to drink; that is what is written: “At that time, the Lord said to Joshua: Make flint knives for yourself and circumcise the children of Israel again, a second time” (Joshua 5:2). Why “a second time”? From here [it may be derived] that he circumcised them the first time. Immediately, “Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins” (Joshua 5:3). What is “at the Hill of the Foreskins”? Rabbi Levi said: From here [it may be derived] that they made that hill out of foreskins.
It is taught: Until a person sins, he is given terror and fear and creatures are afraid of him. Once he sins, terror and fear are imposed upon him and he is afraid of others. Know that it is so, as Rabbi said: Until Adam the first man sinned, he would hear the voice of divine speech while standing on his feet and was not afraid. Once he sinned, when he heard the voice of divine speech, he was afraid and hid, as it is stated: “I heard your voice…” (Genesis 3:10); “the man hid” (Genesis 3:8). Rabbi Aivu said: At that moment the height of Adam’s stature diminished and it became only one hundred cubits. Rabbi Levi said: Until Adam the first man sinned, he would hear a soothing divine voice. Once he sinned, he would hear a thundering voice.<br>Until Israel sinned, they would see<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">They would see the glory of God.</i> through the consecutive partitions and they were not afraid, shocked, and frightened. Once they sinned, they could not have even looked at an intermediary. That is what is written: “They saw the skin of Moses’s face, that it was radiant” (Exodus 34:35), and it is written: “They feared to approach him” (Exodus 34:30).<br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Avun said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin: Even the intermediary was affected with them in that transgression. Until Israel sinned, what is written? “The kings of armies flee again and again” (Psalms 68:13). Rabbi Aivu said: “Angels [<i>malakhei</i>] of armies” is not written, but rather “kings [<i>malkhei</i>] of armies”—the kings of the angels. Which is they? They are Mikhael and Gavriel. They were unable to look at Moses’s face. Once [the Israelites] sinned, [Moses] was unable to look even at the most ordinary among [the angels]. That is what is written: “For I was in dread of the wrath and the fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19).<br>Until that incident befell David,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to David’s sin with Batsheva. See II Samuel chap. 11.</i> it is written: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (Psalms 27:1). Once it befell him, it is written: “I will come upon him, and he will be weary and discouraged” (II Samuel 17:2). Until Solomon sinned, he would subjugate <i>sharim</i> and <i>sharot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of these words is unclear. Perhaps it may be read <i>sarim</i> and <i>sarot</i>, in which case it means princes and princesses. Alternatively, some suggest that the text should read <i>shedim veshedot</i>, male and female demons. That is the text found in a parallel midrash in <i>Yalkut Shimoni Tehillim</i> 795.</i> That is what is written: “I acquired for myself male and female singers [<i>sharim vesharot</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 2:8), male singers [<i>meshorerim</i>] and female singers [<i>meshorerot</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In this phrase, the midrash has merely translated the terms used in the verse to more familiar forms of the words.</i> “and the pleasures of people” (Ecclesiastes 2:8), bathhouses; “chests [<i>shida</i>] and wagons [<i>shidot</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 2:8), male and female demons [<i>sheda veshedta</i>] who would heat them. Once he sinned, he appointed for him “sixty valiant men…from the valiant of Israel” and positioned them to protect his bed. That is what is written: “Behold the bed…each armed with a sword,” because he was afraid of the spirits.

Chapter 8



Chapter 9

<b>“King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the timber of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 3:9).</b><br>“Made himself a palanquin,” Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon interpreted the verse regarding the Tabernacle. “Palanquin,” this is the Tabernacle. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: [This is analogous] to a king who had a young daughter. Until she matured and signs of puberty appeared, he would see her in the street and speak with her in public, in an alleyway, and in a courtyard. Once she grew and signs of puberty appeared, the king said: ‘It is not befitting my daughter’s honor to speak with me in public; make her a partition, and when I need to speak with her I will speak with her from behind the partition.’ So it is written: “Because Israel is a lad and I loved him,” (Hosea 11:1). In Egypt, they saw Him in public, as it is stated: “The Lord will pass to smite Egypt” (Exodus 12:23). At the sea they saw Him in public, as it is stated: “Israel saw the great power” (Exodus 14:31), and the toddlers would point to Him with their fingers and say: “This is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). At Sinai they saw Him face to face, as it is stated: “The Lord came from Sinai…” (Deuteronomy 33:2). When Israel stood at Mount Sinai, received the Torah, and said: “Everything that God spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), they became His complete nation. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘It is not befitting the honor of My children that I will speak to them in public; rather, let them craft a Tabernacle for Me and when I need to speak with them, I will speak with them from within the Tabernacle.’ That is what is written: “When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Him” (Numbers 7:89). “King Solomon [Shlomo] made,” the King [of Whom it may be said] that peace [<i>shalom</i>] is His; “of the timber of Lebanon,” just as it says: “You shall make the planks for the Tabernacle of acacia wood, standing” (Exodus 26:15).

Chapter 10

<b>“He made its pillars of silver, its cushion of gold, its seat of purple wool; its interior is plated with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem” (Song of Songs 3:10).</b><br>“He made its pillars of silver,” these are the pillars, as it is stated: “The hooks of the pillars and their bands, silver” (Exodus 27:11). “Its cushion of gold” as it is stated: “You shall plate the planks with gold” (Exodus 26:29). “Its seat of purple wool,” as it is stated: “You shall make a curtain of blue wool and purple” (Exodus 26:31). “Its interior is plated with love,” Rabbi Yudan says: This is the merit of the Torah and the merit of the righteous who engage in it. Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yuda in the name of Rabbi Simon: This is the Divine Presence.<br>One verse says: “The priests were unable to stand and serve [due to the cloud]” (I Kings 8:11), and one verse says: “And the courtyard was filled with the aura of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 10:4). How can the two verses be reconciled? Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: To what was the Tent of Meeting comparable? To a cave that was adjacent to the sea. The sea raged and inundated the cave. The cave was filled [with water], but the sea was missing nothing. So too, the Tent of Meeting was filled with the aura of the Divine Presence, but the world was missing nothing of the Divine Presence. When did the Divine Presence rest in the world? On the day that the Tabernacle was erected, as it is stated: “It was on the day that Moses finished [erecting the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1).
Rabbi Yuda ben Rabbi Ilai interpreted the verse regarding the Ark. “Palanquin” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is the Ark. What is a palanquin? It is a litter.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a covered litter provides an honorable covering for its occupant, the Ark provided a beautiful covering for the tablets.</i> This is analogous to a king who had an only daughter, who was fair, pious, and praiseworthy. The king said to his servants: ‘My daughter is fair, pious, and praiseworthy and you do not craft a litter for her? Craft a litter for her, for it is preferable that my daughter’s beauty be seen from within the litter.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘My Torah is fair, pious, and praiseworthy, and you do not craft an ark for it? It is preferable that the beauty of My Torah will be seen from within the Ark.’<br>“King Solomon [Shlomo] made himself” (Song of Songs 3:9), the King [of Whom it may be said] that peace is His; “from the timber of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 3:9), just as it says: “Betzalel made the Ark of acacia wood” (Exodus 37:1). “He made its pillars of silver” (Song of Songs 3:10), these are the two pillars that were inside it, that were of silver. “Its cushion of gold” (Song of Songs 3:10), as it is stated: “He plated it with pure gold” (Exodus 37:2). “Its seat of purple wool” (Song of Songs 3:10), Rabbi Tanḥuma said: This is the curtain that is adjacent to it. Rabbi Beivai said: This is the Ark cover, whose gold is similar to purple. “Its interior is plated with love from the daughters of Jerusalem” (Song of Songs 3:10), Rabbi Yudan said: This is the merit of the Torah and those who study it. Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yuda in the name of Rabbi Simon: This is the Divine Presence.<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “I will commune with you there…” (Exodus 25:22), to teach you that even what was behind the Ark cover was not empty of the Divine Presence. One idolater asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, he said to him: ‘Why did the Holy One blessed be He speak from within the bush and not from another tree?’ He said to him: ‘Had He spoken from within a carob or within a sycamore, you would have asked me and I would have answered you. Now, to dismiss you with nothing is impossible.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Even if God had chosen to speak from within a larger, more impressive tree, you would have asked me why He picked specifically that tree, and therefore I do not really need to answer you. Nonetheless, now that you have asked, I do not want to dismiss you without any response.</i> It is to teach you that there is no place on earth that is empty of the Divine Presence, as even from within the bush He was speaking to Him.’
Another matter, “palanquin” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is the Temple. “King Solomon made himself” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is certainly Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contrast to previous explanations in the midrash, which interpreted the reference to King Solomon as actually alluding to God.</i> “Of the timber of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 3:9), as it is stated: “We will cut timber from Lebanon” (II Chronicles 2:15). “He made its pillars of silver” (Song of Songs 3:10), as it is stated: “He established the pillars for the hall of the Sanctuary” (I Kings 7:21). “Its cushion of gold” (Song of Songs 3:10), like that which we learned that the entire Temple was plated with gold except for the backs of the doors. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This <i>baraita</i> that we learned was regarding the second Temple; however, in the first Temple, even the backs of the doors were plated with gold.<br>We learned: They were seven types of gold in [the Temple]: Fine gold, pure gold, chased gold, beaten gold, glittering gold, refined gold, <i>parvayim</i> gold. Fine gold, in its plain sense, just as it says: “The gold of that land was fine” (Genesis 2:12). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is fine when one is in the house and it is fine when one lodges with it accompanying him.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Gold is of great value when one is at home and is also very useful to take with when one travels, as a small amount of it is of great value.</i> Pure gold, such that they would place it in a crucible and it would [come out] lacking nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">There would be no impurities found in the gold were it to be refined.</i> Rabbi Yuda [said] in the name of Rabbi Ami: Solomon placed one thousand gold talents into the fire one thousand times until he rendered it one talent.<br>Was it not taught: Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Yehuda said: It happened that the candelabrum in the Temple was [found to be] one Gordian dinar greater than the candelabrum of the wilderness, and it was placed in the fire eighty times until it lost [this excess weight]? Rather, initially it lost a significant [amount of dross]; after that, it would lose only a minimal amount.<br>Beaten gold is drawn like wax. Hadrian had the weight of an egg-bulk. Diocletian had the weight of a Gordian dinar.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The egg-bulk is significantly larger.</i> The current government has none of it and never had any of it.<br>Chased gold [<i>sagur</i>] would cause all the goldsmiths to close [<i>soger</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Gold of such quality was so rare that if someone was selling it, others who were selling gold could not compete.</i> But is it not written: “And seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses” (I Chronicles 29:4)? Was it silver? Was it not gold? Why do they call it silver [<i>kesef</i>]? It is because it would put to shame [<i>makhsif</i>] all the owners of gold, and all the basins, the pots, the shovels, the firepans, the forks, the spoons, and the <i>potot</i> were made from it. Rabbi Yitzḥak of Migdal said: These [<i>potot</i>] are the teeth of keys [<i>ḥafifot</i>]. Rabbi Simai said: It is the cup [<i>pota</i>] under the hinge, to teach you that the Temple was not lacking [for gold] even for insignificant matters.<br>Glittering [<i>mupaz</i>] gold, Rabbi Patriki, brother of Rabbi Derosa said in the name of Rabbi Abba ben Rabbi Buna: It is like sulfur that is enflamed in fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The gold glitters like flames that are jumping [<i>mefazez</i>].</i> Rabbi Avun said: It is named after the country where it is [mined]; it is from Ufaz [<i>me’ufaz</i>].<br>Refined gold, the house of Rabbi Yannai and the house of Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon, the house of Rabbi Yannai says: It is because they cut it like olives, feed it to ostriches, and it emerges refined. The house of Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon says: They conceal it in dung for seven years and it emerges refined.<br><i>Parvayim</i> gold, Reish Lakish said: It is red like the blood of a bull [<i>par</i>], and some say that it produces fruits. When Solomon built the Temple, he crafted with it all sorts of trees. When the trees in the field would produce fruit, those [gold trees] in the Temple would produce fruit. The fruit would fall, and they would gather them and set them aside for Temple maintenance. When Menashe placed an idol in the Sanctuary, all those trees dried up. That is what is written: “The flower of Lebanon withers” (Nahum 1:4). However, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will restore them. That is what is written: “It will blossom and will rejoice, even with joy and song” (Isaiah 35:2). “Its seat of purple wool” (Song of Songs 3:10), just as it says: “He made the curtain of sky-blue, purple, and crimson wool, and fine linen” (II Chronicles 3:14). “Its interior is plated with love” (Song of Songs 3:10), Rabbi Yudan said: This is the merit of the Torah and the merit of the righteous people who study it. Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Simon: This is the Divine Presence.
Another matter, “palanquin” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is the world. “King Solomon [Shlomo] made himself” (Song of Songs 3:9), the King [of Whom it may be said] that peace is His. “Of the timber of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 3:9), it was constructed from the location of the Holy of Holies below, as we learned: After the Ark was taken, there was a rock from the days of the early prophets, and it was called Foundation. Why was it called Foundation? It is because the entire world was founded from it. That is what is written: “From Zion, the perfection of beauty” (Psalms 50:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the world was created by being expanded from the rock in the location of the Holy of Holies. This is alluded to by the phrase “timber of Lebanon,” because Solomon built the Temple with wood from Lebanon (see I Kings 5:16–28).</i> <br>“He made its pillars of silver” (Song of Songs 3:10), this is the family tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish families of pure lineage are pillars of the world (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> “Its cushion of gold” (Song of Songs 3:10), these are fruits of the ground and fruits of the tree that are sold for gold. “Its seat of purple wool” (Song of Songs 3:10), just as it says: “Who rides the heavens in your assistance” (Deuteronomy 33:26). “Its interior is plated with love” (Song of Songs 3:10), Rabbi Yudan said: This is the merit of the Torah and the merit of the righteous people who study it. Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Simon: This is the Divine Presence.<br>Another matter, “palanquin” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is the Throne of Glory. “King Solomon [Shlomo] made himself” (Song of Songs 3:9), the King [of Whom it may be said] that peace is His. “Of the timber of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 3:9), this is the location of the Holy of Holies On High, which is opposite the location of the Holy of Holies below. That is what is written: “The place [<i>makhon</i>] of Your dwelling” (Exodus 15:17), corresponding [<i>mekhuvan</i>] to Your dwelling.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The place of God’s dwelling On High is opposite the Holy of Holies, which is the place of His dwelling on earth.</i> <br>“He made its pillars of silver” (Song of Songs 3:10), just as it says: “The pillars of heaven sag” (Job 26:11). “Its cushion of gold” (Song of Songs 3:10), these are matters of Torah, as it is stated: “They are more desirable than gold and fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). “Its seat of purple wool” (Song of Songs 3:10), just as it says: “To the Rider of the ancient heavens of heavens” (Psalms 68:34). “Its interior is plated with love” (Song of Songs 3:10), Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Bon [said] in the name of Rabbi Abahu: There are four who are proud: The proudest of the birds is the eagle; the proudest of the domesticated animals is the bull; the proudest of the beasts is the lion; the proudest of them all is man. The Holy One blessed be He took all of them and carved them into the Throne of Glory,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 1:10.</i> as it is stated: “The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, [and His kingship rules over all]” (Psalms 103:19). From the fact that He established His throne over the proud, you know that “His kingship rules over all.”

Chapter 11

<b>“Emerge, daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart” (Song of Songs 3:11).</b><br>“Emerge, daughters of Zion, and gaze,” sons who are conspicuous [<i>metzuyanim</i>] for me in haircut, in circumcision, in ritual fringes; “at King Solomon [Shlomo],” at the King who created perfect [<i>shelemot</i>] creations. He created the sun and the moon in their completeness, the stars and the constellations in their completeness. Bar Kappara said: Adam and Eve were created as at the age of twenty. “At King Solomon [Shlomo],” at the King [of Whom it may be said] that peace is His.<br>Another matter, “at King Solomon [Shlomo],” the King who made peace between His works and His creatures. How so? He made the fire be at peace with our patriarch Abraham; He made the sword be at peace with Isaac; He made the angel be at peace with Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">God saw to it that Abraham was not harmed when he was thrown into the fiery furnace; that Isaac was not harmed when Abraham was about to slaughter him; and that Jacob was not harmed when he struggled with the angel.</i> <br>Another matter, “at King Solomon [Shlomo],” the King who made peace between His creations. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The firmament is of snow and the [celestial] creatures are of fire. The firmament is of snow, as it is stated: “Over the heads of the creature there was the likeness of a firmament, resembling the awesome ice” (Ezekiel 1:22). The creatures are of fire, as it is stated: “The likeness of the creatures, their appearance was like fiery coals” (Ezekiel 1:13), and it is written: “The creatures were darting to and fro like the appearance of a flash” (Ezekiel 1:14). This one does not extinguish that one, and that one does not extinguish this one. Mikhael is the angel of snow and Gabriel of fire; this one does not extinguish that one, and that one does not harm this one.<br>Rabbi Avin said: This is not merely between angel and angel, but even within one angel that is half snow and half fire, the Holy One blessed be He makes peace between them. It has five descriptions, and they are: “His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning” (Daniel 10:6);<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse states: “His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.” Thus it is described as like beryl, lightning, torches of fire, burnished brass, and the voice of a multitude—five descriptions.</i> and one does not harm the other.<br>One verse says: “He covers His upper chambers with water” (Psalms 104:3), and one verse says: “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24), and it is written: “His throne was sparks of fire” (Daniel 7:9). This one does not harm that one, and that one does not harm this one. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “He makes peace in His high places” (Job 25:2), the firmament is of water and the stars of fire and they do not harm each other. The sun has never seen the defect of the moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The deficient side of the moon’s crescent never faces the sun. This is taken as an indication that God causes there to be peace between them.</i> <br>Rabbi Yaakov of the village of Ḥanin said: It is written: “Dominion and fear are with Him” (Job 25:2). “Dominion,” this is Mikhael, “and fear,” this is Gavriel, “with Him,” what is “with Him”? They are at peace for Him. Rabbi Levi said: No constellation ever passed another on their ascent. There is no star that sees what is above it, but rather what is below it, like a person who descends a ladder and does not look behind him.<br>Even regarding the plagues of Pharaoh, the Holy One blessed be He brought about peace, as it is stated: “There was hail, and fire aflame within the hail” (Exodus 9:24). Rabbi Yuda, Rabbi Neḥemya<i>,</i> and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yuda said: Bowls of hail filled with fire; this one did not extinguish that one, and that one did not extinguish this one. Rabbi Ḥanin said: That [description] of Rabbi Yuda is similar to a pomegranate aril, as [the seed] inside each aril can be seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the seed is visible from outside the aril, the hail contained fire that was visible despite being surrounded by ice.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: Fire and hail intermingled with each other. Rabbi Ḥanin said: That [description] of Rabbi Neḥemya is similar to the bowl of an oil lamp, where water and oil are intermingled and it continues to burn. This one does not extinguish that one, and that one does not extinguish this one. The Rabbis say:<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Expounding the word “aflame” [<i>mitlakaḥat</i>].</i> Death [<i>mita</i>] and reassembly [<i>mitkalha</i>], death and reassembly in order to perform the will of their Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The ice and fire would continually eliminate each other and be restored.</i> Rabbi Aḥa said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two powerful legions and they were enemies with each other. Once they saw that the king’s war was intensifying, they made peace with one another in order to wage the king’s war. So too, fire and hail are enemies with each other. When they saw the war of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, which was the war against the Egyptians, they made peace between them and waged the war of the Holy One blessed be He against Egypt. That is what is written: “There was hail and fire aflame within the hail”—a miracle within a miracle.
“At the crown with which his mother crowned him,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai asked Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei, he said to him: ‘Have you possibly heard from your father what is: “At the crown with which his mother crowned him”?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘What?’ He said to him: ‘[It is analogous] to a king who had an only daughter and he loved her exceedingly much and would call her: My daughter. He did not stop loving her until he called her: My sister. He did not stop loving her until he called her: My mother. So too, the Holy One blessed be He loved Israel exceedingly much, and called them My daughter; that is what is written: “Hear, My daughter, and see” (Psalms 45:11); He did not stop loving them until He called them My sister, as it is stated: “Open for me, my sister, my lover” (Song of Songs 5:2); He did not stop loving them until he called them My mother, as it is stated: “Heed Me My people, listen to Me My nation [<i>uleumi</i>]” (Isaiah 51:4), My mother [<i>ule’imi</i>] is written.’<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The verse already mentioned “people” such that “nation” is extraneous. The midrash explains that the verse mentions the word nation [<i>le’umi</i>] because when written without a <i>vav</i>, it can be read “my mother” [<i>le’imi</i>] (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai stood, kissed him on his head, and said: ‘Had I come only to hear from you this explanation, it would have sufficed for me.’<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: We have reviewed the whole Bible in its entirety and we have not found that Batsheva crafted a crown for Solomon her son, and you say: “At the crown with which his mother crowned him”?

Alternatively, “on the day of his wedding,” this is the Tent of Meeting. “And on the day of the rejoicing of his heart,” this is the Temple.

“Your eyes are doves” – your eyes are the Sanhedrin, who are the eyes of the congregation. That is what is written: “It shall be, if from the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). There are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person, and all of them come and go only after the eyes. So too, Israel is unable to do anything without their Sanhedrin. “Doves” – just as this dove is faultless, so too, Israel is pleasant as they walk when they ascend on the occasions of the pilgrimage festivals. Just as the dove is conspicuous, so too, Israel is conspicuous in haircut, circumcision, and ritual fringes. Just as the dove is modest, so too, Israel is modest. Just as a dove extends its neck for slaughter, so too, Israel: “For we are killed for You all day” (Psalms 44:23). Just as the dove atones for evils, so too, Israel atones for the nations, as all the seventy bulls that they sacrifice on the festival [of <i>Sukkot</i>] correspond to the seventy nations, so that the world will not be bereft of them. That is what is written: “In return for my love, they accuse me; but I am all prayer” (Psalms 109:4).<br>Just as the dove, from the time it meets its mate, it does not exchange it for another, so too Israel, from the time they came to know the Holy One blessed be He, they did not exchange Him for another. Just as the dove enters its nest and knows its nest, its dovecote, its fledglings, its chicks, and its windows, so are the three rows of Torah scholars when they sit before them,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Three rows of scholars would sit before the members of the Sanhedrin when the Sanhedrin would deliberate. When new judges for the Sanhedrin were needed, they were chosen from these scholars (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 37a).</i> each and every one knows his place. Just as the dove, even though you take its fledglings from beneath it, it will never forsake its dovecote, so too Israel, even though the Temple was destroyed, the three annual pilgrimage festivals were not abrogated. Just as the dove produces a new brood each and every month, so too Israel renew for themselves Torah, mitzvot, and good deeds each month. Just as the dove travels far afield and returns to its dovecote, so too Israel; that is what is written: “They will stir like a bird from Egypt” (Hosea 11:11) – this is the generation of the wilderness; “and like a dove from the land of Assyria” (Hosea 11:11) – these are the Ten Tribes. These and those, “I will settle them in their houses, the utterance of the Lord” (Hosea 11:11).<br>Rabbi says: There is a type of dove that they feed it, and its counterparts smell it and come to its dovecote. So too, when an elder sits and teaches, many proselytes convert at that time, such as Yitro, who heard and came, and Raḥav heard and came. So too Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, many proselytes converted at that time. What is the reason? “When he sees his children” (Isaiah 29:23); what is written thereafter? “Those of misguided spirit will attain understanding” (Isaiah 29:24).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] was sitting and expounding, and the audience was dozing. He sought to rouse them. He said: A certain woman in Egypt bore six hundred thousand in a single womb. There was one student there, Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei was his name. He said to [Rabbi]: ‘For whom was it so?’ [Rabbi] said to him: ‘This is Yokheved, who bore Moses, who is the equivalent of six hundred thousand of Israel. That is what is written: “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel” (Exodus 15:1). “The children of Israel did according to everything that the Lord commanded Moses, so they did” (Numbers 1:54).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The verse does not say that God commanded Israel, but rather that He commanded Moses and Israel did what He commanded.</i> “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10).’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is formulated such that the last phrase quoted here can be translated as “Israel is like Moses.”</i><br>“Your eyes are doves” – like doves; your characteristic is like that of a dove; just as this dove brought light to the world, so too, Israel brings light to the world, as it is stated: “Nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). When did the dove bring light to the world? In the days of Noah. That is what is written: “The dove came to him in the evening, and there was an olive leaf plucked in its mouth…” (Genesis 8:11). What is plucked [<i>taraf</i>]? Dead, just as you say: “Joseph has been torn apart [<i>tarof toraf</i>]” (Genesis 37:33). Rabbi Berekhya said: Had it not killed it,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Had the dove not plucked the olive leaf.</i> it would have become a great tree.<br>From where did it bring it? Rabbi Levi said: It brought it from the branches of the Land of Israel. That is what people say: The Land of Israel was not stricken with the water of the Flood. That is what was stated by Ezekiel: “Son of man, say to it: You are a land that has not been cleansed, that has not been rained upon on the day of fury” (Ezekiel 22:24). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even the upper millstones were dissolved in the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This strengthens the question: If the destruction was so great, where did the dove find an olive branch (Maharzu). Alternatively, this supports Rabbi Levi’s answer: Since the destruction was so great, it must be that the olive branch was found in a place that remained unaffected by the Flood (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Taryi said: The gates of The Garden of Eden were opened for it, and from there it brought it. Rabbi Aivu said to him: Had it brought it from the Garden of Eden, should it not have brought a quality item such as cinnamon or balsam? Rather, it was hinting to Noah as though saying to him: My master Noah, [it is preferable to have] something bitter like this from the hand of the Holy One blessed be He and not something sweet from you.
“Behind [<i>mibaad</i>] your braid” – Rabbi Levi said: Any bride whose eyes are ugly, her entire body requires examination. One whose eyes are beautiful, her entire body does not require examination. When a woman braids her hair behind her, it is an ornament for her. So was the Great Sanhedrin, which convened behind the Temple, and it was an ornament of the Temple. Rabbi Abbahu said: They appeared crowded, but it was spacious for them, as in the great colloquium in Tzippori. Rabbi Levi said: [The word <i>mibaad</i>] is Arabic. When he wants to say: Make room for me, he says: <i>Maved li</i>.<br>“Your hair is like a flock of goats that streams down [<i>shegaleshu</i>] from Mount Gilad” – the mountain from whose midst I directed away streams [<i>shegalashti</i>], I rendered a memorial [<i>galed</i>] for the nations of the world. Which is that? It is the Red Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the splitting of the sea.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The mountain from whose midst you streamed. When a woman’s hair grows too much, she thins it [<i>galshin</i>]. When the flame in a lamp burns too bright, one thins [the wick].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">These statements are cited in order to demonstrate that the root <i>gimmel-lamed-shin</i> means to thin out or strip away.</i><br>What is it that I took away [<i>higlashti</i>] from its midst? “Your teeth are like a flock of ordered [<i>ketzuvot</i>] ewes” – defined [<i>ketzuvin</i>] matters, the plunder of Egypt and the plunder of the sea. “That have come up from bathing” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai: Before the song [of Deborah], it is written: “The children of Israel continued to do what was evil in the eyes of the Lord” (Judges 3:12). After the song it is written: “The children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord” (Judges 6:1). Was this the beginning of their action?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier it says they continued to do what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, indicating that they had already been doing so previously. But after the song it does not say they continued, rather only that they did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, implying that this was the beginning of their evil behavior.</i> It is because the song had already atoned for the past. On a similar note it says: “These are David’s last words” (II Samuel 23:1). The first ones, where are they? Rather, the song<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The song of David (II Samuel chap. 22).</i> atoned for the past.<br>“That are all paired [<i>matimot</i>]” – as they are all in the middle [<i>metuamim</i>] between the Divine Spirit and the angel. That is what is written: “The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved [and went behind them]” (Exodus 14:19). “And there is none missing among them” – that not one of them was harmed.

<b>“Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your speech is lovely; your temple is like a pomegranate slice behind your braid” (Song of Songs 4:3).</b><br>“Your lips are like a scarlet thread” – when they sang the song: “Then sang Moses [and the children of Israel]” (Exodus 15:1). “Your speech is lovely [<i>naveh</i>]” – that they point with their finger and say: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>ve’anvehu</i>]” (Exodus 15:2). At that moment, Moses began praising them: “Your temple [<i>rakatekh</i>] is like a pomegranate slice” – even the empty [<i>hareikan</i>] among you is packed with mitzvot like this pomegranate. It goes without saying: “Behind your braid [<i>letzamatekh</i>]” – regarding the modest and the fervent [<i>metzumatin</i>] among you.

They stated a parable: to what is this matter analogous? It is to a group of people who seek to recite a hymn to the king. The king said: You are all pleasant, you are all pious, you are all qualified to recite a hymn before me. However, so-and-so will recite it on behalf of all of you. Why? Because his voice is sweet. So too, when ten righteous people sought to recite the book of Psalms, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: You are all pleasant, pious, and qualified to recite a hymn before Me; however, David will recite it on behalf of all of you. Why? Because his voice is sweet. That is what is written: “The sweet singer of Israel” (II Samuel 23:1). Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Who sweetly sings the psalms of Israel?

Rabbi Aḥa and Rabbi Mesharshiya say in the name of Rabbi Idi: In all the additional offerings it is written: “And one goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 28:15), “and [one] goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 28:22). However, regarding <i>Shavuot</i> it is not written that there is a sin offering, to teach you that they did not have sin or iniquity attributed to them.<br>“That are all paired” (Song of Songs 4:2) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: On the day that the Lord descended onto Mount Sinai to give the Torah to Israel, six hundred thousand ministering angels descended with him, and in the hand of each and every one of them was a crown with which to crown an Israelite, [one] for each and every one of Israel. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: One million two hundred thousand ministering angels descended with the Holy One blessed be He to Sinai; one would adorn [an Israelite] with a crown and one would gird a <i>zoni</i> on him.

It goes without saying: “Behind your braid [<i>letzamatekh</i>]” (Song of Songs 4:3) – regarding the modest and the fervent [<i>metzumatin</i>] among you.<br>“Like the tower of [<i>kemigdal</i>] David” – regarding which [David] elevated [<i>gidel</i>] you in his book. Regarding what did David elevate you in his book? “Siḥon king of the Emorites.… and Og king of the Bashan.… and gave their land as an inheritance” (Psalms 136:19–21).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">These verses state that God gave the land of Siḥon to Israel as an inheritance. Included in this territory was the land of Midian. The fact that Israel merited to inherit the land of Midian speaks positively of them.</i> “Built magnificently [<i>letalpiyot</i>]” – a book that was stated by many mouths [<i>piyot</i>].<br>“One thousand bucklers are hung upon it” – all those tens of thousands and those thousands who went to the Midianite war and I defended them. I defended them only because of the merit of what came after one thousand generations. Not only you alone relied upon it, but rather, “all the shields of the mighty” – everyone who arises and controls and overcomes his inclination, is called mighty, like Moses in his time, David in his time, Ezra in his time. Their entire generation depends upon them. By means of whom was the Midianite war waged? It was by means of “your two breasts” (Song of Songs 4:5) – these are Moses, the head of the Sanhedrin, and Pinḥas.
Rabbi Huna interpreted the verse regarding the Jordan. “Your hair is like a flock of goats” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the flocks that crossed the Jordan crossed only due to the merit of Jacob our patriarch. That is what is written: “You shall inform your children, saying: Israel crossed [this Jordan] on dry land” (Joshua 4:22). Rabbi Huna said: Israel the patriarch.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the verse mentions Israel instead of the more common term for the nation, “children of Israel,” is meant to hint to the fact that they crossed in the merit of Israel, i.e., Jacob.</i> Rabbi Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: We find in three places, in the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings, that Israel crossed the Jordan due only to the merit of Jacob our patriarch. In the Torah: “For with my staff I crossed this Jordan” (Genesis 32:11); in the Prophets: “You shall inform your children, saying: Israel crossed this Jordan on dry land” (Joshua 4:22) – Israel the patriarch; in the Writings: “What is it, sea, that makes you flee? The Jordan, [that you turn back?]” (Psalms 114:5). [It retreats] “from before the God of Jacob” (Psalms 114:7).<br>“That streams down [<i>shegaleshu</i>] from Mount Gilad” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the mountain from whose midst you took away [<i>shegelashten</i>], I rendered it a memorial for the nations of the world. Which is this? This is the Jordan. What is it that you took away from its midst? “Your teeth are like a flock of ordered ewes” (Song of Songs 4:2) – the plunder of Siḥon and Og.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the reference to ordered ewes as referring to the rows of soldiers who fought against Siḥon and Og (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). This occurred before the Israelites crossed the Jordan.</i> <br>“That have come up from bathing” (Song of Songs 4:2) – Rabbi Elazar said: The land of Canaan was conquered with sixty thousand.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Commentaries struggle to explain how this is derived from the phrase of the verse cited here. Some suggest that the text should read “like a flock of ordered ewes” (Song of Songs 4:2). Rabbi Elazar then states that if this is an allusion to the army that conquered Canaan, they must have been sixty thousand, because if there were more they would not have been “ordered” and organized (<i>Yefei Kol</i>).</i> This is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: Every war that involves more than sixty thousand is a war of pandemonium. Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Ḥizkiya: Wherever it states about ten, about twenty, about thirty, about forty, it is saying either more or less. There it is stated: “About forty thousand, the vanguard of the army” (Joshua 4:13), and here it is stated: “Forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty” (I Chronicles 5:18). Rabbi Aḥa said: They were complete thousands, and the rest perished on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Forty-five thousand soldiers actually went out to battle, but forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty returned. The verse in Joshua refers to this number as forty thousand.</i> Those fifteen thousand, where are they?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The total number that went out to battle was forty-five thousand, whereas Rabbi Elazar said they would go out with sixty thousand.</i> [Rabbi Elazar] said to them: They were guards of the equipment, and the verse did not include them in the tally. “That are all paired [<i>matimot</i>]” (Song of Songs 4:2) – as they were in the middle [<i>metuamim</i>] between the vanguard and the rearguard. That is what is written: “And the vanguard goes […and the rearguard goes]” (Joshua 6:9). “And there is none missing among them” (Song of Songs 4:2) – that not one of them was harmed.<br>“Your lips are like a scarlet thread” (Song of Songs 4:3) – when they said to Joshua: “Everything that you commanded us we will perform…” (Joshua 1:16). “Your speech is lovely” (Song of Songs 4:3) – as they said to him: “Anyone who will defy your word…will die” (Joshua 1:18). At that moment, Joshua began praising them: “Your temple [<i>rakatekh</i>] is like a pomegranate slice” (Song of Songs 4:3) – even the empty [<i>hareikan</i>] among you is packed with Torahs like this pomegranate. It goes without saying: “Behind your braid [<i>letzamatekh</i>]” (Song of Songs 4:3) – regarding the modest and the fervent [<i>metzumatin</i>] among you.<br>“Your neck is like the tower of [<i>kemigdal</i>] David” – how did David elevate [<i>gidel</i>] you in his book: “Who smote great kings” (Psalms 136:17)! “Built magnificently [<i>letalpiyot</i>]” – a book that was stated by many mouths [<i>piyot</i>].<br>“One thousand bucklers” – all those thousands and tens of thousands who crossed the Jordan and I defended them.

Another matter: “Behind your braid your hair is like a flock of goats that streams down [<i>shegaleshu</i>] from Mount Gilad” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the mountain from whose midst you took away [<i>shegelashtem</i>], I rendered a memorial for the nations of the world. Which is this? This is the Temple, as it is stated: “You are awesome, God, from Your Temple” (Psalms 68:36). From where does awe emerge? Is it not from the Temple? This is what it says: “You shall observe My Sabbaths and you shall revere My Sanctuary” (Leviticus 26:2) – as it is sanctified in its destruction just as it was sanctified while it was built. The matters can be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If to His Temple the Holy One blessed be He did not show favor, when He will come to exact punishment upon its destroyers all the more so.<br>What is it that you took away from its midst? “Your teeth are like a flock of ordered ewes” (Song of Songs 4:2) – defined matters, these are the vestments of the High Priesthood, as we learned there:<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 71b</i> The High Priest serves in eight vestments and the common [priest] in four: tunic, trousers, mitre, and sash.

According to one opinion, it contained wool and linen (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 84:8). At the very least, its stripes could be reminiscent of different types of materials. The midrash takes this as an allusion to the fact that the tunic of the High Priest atones for the transgression of diverse kinds.</i> The trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, just as it states: “Make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness” (Exodus 28:42). The mitre atones for the haughty, just as you say: “You shall place the mitre on his head” (Exodus 29:6). For what did the sash atone? For those with criminal thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently text should be added here such that this sentence reads: For thieves, and some say for criminal thoughts (see <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 10:6).</i> The reason for the one who says for the thieves, it is because it was hollow, corresponding to thieves who perform their actions clandestinely.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">There was space inside the sash, like a secret hiding place.</i> According to the one who says it was for criminal thoughts, Rabbi Levi said: It was thirty-two cubits long, and he would twist it to this side and that.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">He would wrap it all the way around himself multiple times, representing the twisted thoughts of those with criminal and dishonest intent.</i> The breastplate would atone for those who distort justice, just as it says: “You shall place in the breastplate of judgment” (Exodus 28:30).

There was no atonement for evil speech, but the Torah designated atonement for it: the bell of the robe, as it is stated: “It shall be upon Aaron to serve, and its sound shall be heard…” (Exodus 28:35). Let the sound come and atone for the sound of evil speech. There was no atonement for one who murders unwittingly, but the Torah designated atonement for it, this is the death of the High Priest, as it stated: “He shall dwell in it until the death of the High Priest” (Numbers 35:25). The frontplate would atone for the impudent, and there is one who says for the blasphemers. The one who says for the impudent, just as it says: “On Aaron’s forehead [<i>metzaḥ</i>]” (Exodus 28:38), and below it says: “Yet you had the impudence [<i>metzaḥ</i>] of a harlot…” (Jeremiah 3:3).

He said to [Rabbi Yonatan]: ‘Where are you going?’ [Rabbi Yonatan]said to him: ‘To pray in Jerusalem.’ He said to [Rabbi Yonatan]: ‘Would it not be preferable for you to ascend and pray on this blessed mountain and not pray in those ruins [in Jerusalem]?’ [Rabbi Yonatan] said to him: ‘Why is this mountain blessed?’ He said to [Rabbi Yonatan]: ‘Because it was not flooded with the Flood waters.’ That is what people say: The Land of Israel was not flooded with the Flood waters. An answer slipped the mind of Rabbi Yonatan at that moment and he did not respond to him. His donkey driver said to him: ‘Rabbi, allow me, and I will respond to him.’ He said to him: ‘Respond to him.’ He said to that Cuthite: ‘This mountain, what do you consider it? If it is one of the high mountains, is it not written: “All the high mountains were covered” (Genesis 7:19)? If it is one of the low mountains, it is written: “Fifteen cubits upward the waters intensified, and the mountains were covered” (Genesis 7:20). The verse did not address the low mountains. If regarding the high mountains it is written: “All the mountains were covered,” all the more so regarding the low ones.’ At that moment the Cuthite fell silent and was unable to find a response. At that moment, Rabbi Yonatan dismounted and drove his donkey driver three <i>mil</i>, and he read in his regard three verses: “You will be the most blessed of all the peoples; there will be no male or female infertile among you or among your animals” (Deuteronomy 7:14), even among those of you who work with animals; and this: “Any weapon crafted against you will not succeed…” (Isaiah 54:17); and this: “your temple is like a pomegranate slice [<i>rakatekh</i>]” (Song of Songs 4:3) – even the empty [<i>reikan</i>] among Israel is packed with answers like a pomegranate. “Behind your braid [<i>letzamatekh</i>]” – and it goes without saying regarding the modest and the fervent [<i>metzumatin</i>] among you.
Another matter: “Your hair is like a flock of goats that streams down [<i>shegaleshu</i>] from Mount Gilad” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the mountain from whose midst you took away [<i>shegelashten</i>], I rendered a memorial for the nations of the world. Which is this? These are the priestly watches.

On Shabbat they would recite: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day” (Psalms 92:1) – for the future, for the day that will be entirely Shabbat and rest for everlasting life.
Another matter: “Your hair is like a flock of goats that streams down [<i>shegaleshu</i>] from Mount Gilad” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the mountain from whose midst you took away [<i>shegelashten</i>], I rendered a memorial for the nations of the world. Which is this? These are the sacrificial offerings.

The midrash is calling attention to the fact that there were clear guidelines delineating all of these aspects of the offerings, and that the guidelines were tailored to the particular offering under discussion.</i> “And there is none missing among them” (Song of Songs 4:2) – as we learned: The intestines, the fine flour, and the wine are carried by three each (<i>Yoma</i> 26b).
Another matter: “Your hair is like a flock of goats” (Song of Songs 4:1) – the mountain from whose midst you took away, I rendered a memorial for the nations of the world. Which is this?

Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yuda: Just as the red line separates between the upper and the lower blood, so the Sanhedrin distinguishes between impurity and purity, between the prohibited and the permitted, between exemption and liability.

Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said: In its destruction it produced for Me righteous people and when it was standing it produced for Me wicked people. In its destruction it produced for Me righteous people: Daniel and his associates, Mordekhai and his associates, Ezra and his associates. When it is standing it produced for Me wicked people such as Aḥaz and his associates, Menashe and his associates, Amon and his associates. Rabbi Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan regarding this [statement] of Rabbi Levi: “For the children of the desolate are more than the children of the married woman” (Isaiah 54:1).

Those standing in the Land of Israel turn their faces toward Jerusalem and pray, as it is stated: “They shall pray to you by way of this city” (II Chronicles 6:34). Those standing and praying in Jerusalem turn their faces toward the Temple, as it is stated: “He shall pray toward this house” (I Kings 8:42). Those standing on the Temple Mount turn their faces toward the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “They shall pray toward this place” (I Kings 8:35). Thus, those standing in the north, their faces are to the south; those standing in the south, their faces are to the north; those standing in the east, their faces are to the west; and those standing in the west, their faces are to the east. The result is that all of Israel are praying toward one place. From where is it derived that all of Israel pray toward one place? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: “This is the Sanctuary to the front [<i>lifnai</i>]” (I Kings 6:17) – this is the Sanctuary toward which all the faces [<i>hapanim</i>] are directed.<br>To this point, when it is standing;<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">It has been proven that one prays facing the Temple when it is standing.</i> in its destruction, from where is it derived?

Rather, His face is on High and His heart is below, as it is taught: A person should direct his heart toward the Holy of the Holies. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: Toward the supernal Holy of Holies; and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: Toward the earthly Holy of Holies. Rabbi Pinḥas said: I will uphold both of your statements: Toward the supernal Holy of Holies, which is aligned with the earthly Holy of Holies. That is what is written; “The place [<i>makhon</i>] You fashioned for Your dwelling, Lord” (Exodus 15:17) – it is aligned [<i>mekhuvan</i>] with your dwelling place, this is the supernal Temple.<br>Mount Moriah – Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Yannai: one said: Because bitterness [<i>mara</i>] emerged to the world from there;<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">It is called Mount Moriah because bitterness was destined to emerge from there due to the destruction of the Temple.</i> and the other said: Because awe emerged to the world from there. Ark [<i>aron</i>] – Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yannai: one said: Because light [<i>ora</i>] emerged from there to the world; and one said: Because a curse [<i>arira</i>] emerged from it to the nations of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The ark holds the Torah, and the nations of the world are at a disadvantage because they refused to accept the Torah.</i> Sanctum [<i>devir</i>] – Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Yannai: one said: Because a plague [<i>dever</i>] emerged from there to the nations of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This is because they demeaned the Torah and destroyed the Temple.</i> One said: Because the precepts [<i>diberot</i>] emerged from there to the world.<br>“One thousand bucklers are hung upon it” – Rabbi Berekhya said: The Holy One blessed be He said: I shortened one thousand generations and I brought them that protection that their hearts desired.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah was meant to be given after one thousand generations, but it was given after twenty-six generations.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, You have been a shield for me, but will You not be a shield for My children?<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This question was in light of God’s statement to Abraham: “I am a shield for you” (Genesis 15:1), in which He did not mention Abraham’s descendants.</i> . The Holy One blessed be He said to him: I have been one shield for you, as it is stated: “I am a shield for you” (Genesis 15:1), but for your children I will be many shields. That is what is written: “One thousand bucklers are hung upon it, all the shields of the mighty” – this is the priesthood and the monarchy.

Chapter 5

<b>“Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that graze among the lilies” (Song of Songs 4:5).</b><br>“Your two breasts” – these are Moses and Aaron. Just as the breasts are the splendor and the glory of a woman, so too, Moses and Aaron are the splendor and the glory of Israel. Just as the breasts are the beauty of the woman, so too, Moses and Aaron are the beauty of Israel. Just as the breasts are the honor and praise of a woman, so too, Moses and Aaron are the honor and the praise of Israel. Just as the breasts are filled with milk, so too, Moses and Aaron fill Israel with Torah. Just as the breasts, everything that the woman eats, the baby eats and suckles from them, so too, all the Torah that Moses our master studied, he taught to Aaron; that is what is written: “Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord” (Exodus 4:28). The Rabbis say: He revealed to him the ineffable name. Just as the breasts, one of them is not larger than the other, so it was with Moses and Aaron. That is what is written: “That Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 6:27), and it is written: “That Aaron and Moses” (Exodus 6:26). Moses was not greater than Aaron, and Aaron was not greater than Moses in Torah.<br>Rabbi Abba said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two fine pearls, and he placed them on the pans of a balance scale; this one was not greater than that one and that one was not greater than this one. So too, Moses and Aaron were equal. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Blessed is the Omnipresent who selected these two brothers, who were created only for the Torah and for the glory of Israel. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: There were two families of priests in Alexandria; the body temperature of one was cold and [that] of the other one’s was hot. There was an incident where doctors sent for some of them and they prepared a suspension from them with which they would heal.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">They took tissue from bodies in each family, and the combination was just right and could be used as a healing ointment. So too, Moses and Aaron complemented each other in leading Israel.</i> <br>Rava in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Flesh and blood does not prepare a dressing until he sees the wound; however, He who spoke and the world came into being is not so, but rather He prepares the dressing and then strikes. That is what is written: “Behold I am bringing it a remedy and a cure, and I will heal them…” (Jeremiah 33:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">He prepared the cure for Jerusalem before He struck it.</i> and it is written: “When I will heal Israel” (Hosea 7:1). The Holy One blessed be He said: I came to heal the iniquities of Israel, “and the iniquity of Ephraim and the evils of Samaria will be revealed” (Hosea 7:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Only after preparing the cure will they be taken to task for their wickedness.</i> However, the nations of the world, He strikes them and only then heals them, as it is stated: “The Lord will strike Egypt, striking and healing” (Isaiah 19:22). Striking by means of Aaron and healing by means of Moses. Blessed are these two brothers who were created only for the glory of Israel. That is what the prophet Samuel said: “The Lord who produced Moses and Aaron” (I Samuel 12:6). That is “your two breasts” – these are Moses and Aaron.
“Twins of a gazelle” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: Just as these twins, when one of them withdraws from the breast, the breast is blocked, so it is written: “I will eliminate the three shepherds in a single month” (Zechariah 11:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</i> But is it not so that they died only within the same year?<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">They died in one year, but not in the same month.</i> Rather, in a single month, the decree was issued regarding the three of them. That is what is written: “The great ones of the people were gathered” (Psalms 47:10).<br>Rabbi Yosei says: Three great providers arose for Israel, and these are: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Through their merit, three great gifts were given to them: The well, the manna, and the clouds of glory. The manna, through the merit of Moses; the well through the merit of Miriam; and through the merit of Aaron, the clouds of glory. Miriam died and the well ceased, and they said: “Not a place of seed, fig [and pomegranate, and there is no water to drink]” (Numbers 20:5). But it was restored due to the merit of Moses and Aaron. Aaron died, and the clouds of glory disappeared. That is what is written: “The entire congregation saw [<i>vayiru</i>] that Aaron had perished” (Numbers 20:29). Do not read it as “they saw [<i>vayiru</i>],” but rather as “they feared” [<i>vayire’u</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">They were afraid because the protection of the clouds of glory had disappeared.</i> They were restored through the merit of Moses. Moses died and all three of them disappeared and they were not restored. The hornet did not cross the Jordan with them<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">God promised to send hornets to assist in expelling the Canaanite nations (see Exodus 23:28). However, in the absence of Moses they did not cross the Jordan and assisted with Israel’s battles only east of the Jordan.</i> and Israel did not experience peace of mind from that time forward.<br>“That graze [<i>haro’im</i>] among the lilies” – Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Miriam and Yokheved were the midwives of Israel, and they would provide for [<i>ro’ot</i>] Israel as their hearts were as soft as lilies. Where was the pasture of Israel? It was in Egypt until the Red Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">It was there that Miriam and Yokheved tended to the needs of the birthing mothers and their offspring.</i>

Chapter 6

<b>“Until the day is great and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense” (Song of Songs 4:6).</b><br>“Until the day is great” – Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Levi: one said: When Abraham our patriarch circumcised himself, his sons, and the members of his household, he made a hill of their foreskins, and the sun shone upon it and they became infested with worms. Their scent ascended before the Holy One blessed be He like the fragrance of the incense of spices and like the fragrance of the handful of frankincense that is burned upon the fires.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">It was as pleasing to God as the scent of the incense and the frankincense burned together with a portion of the meal offering in the Temple.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: When this one’s descendants will commit sins and evil deeds, I will remember this scent and I will be filled with mercy toward them and I will transform the attribute of justice into the attribute of mercy. What is the reason? “I will go to the mountain of myrrh [and to the hill of frankincense].”<br>Rabbi Levi said: When Joshua circumcised the children of Israel, he made a hill of their foreskins, and the sun shone upon it and they became infested with worms. Their scent ascended before the Holy One blessed be He like the fragrance of the incense of the spices and like the fragrance of the handful of frankincense that is burned upon the fires. At that moment the Holy One blessed be He said: When the descendants of these will commit sins and evil deeds, I will remember this scent and I will be filled with mercy over them and I will transform the attribute of justice into the attribute of mercy. What is the reason? “I will go to the mountain of myrrh [and to the hill of frankincense].”<br>It is written: “On that very day, Abraham was circumcised” (Genesis 17:26). Rabbi Berekhya said: Had Abraham circumcised himself at night, his generation would have said: Had we seen him we would not have allowed him. Instead, “on that very day Abraham was circumcised” – anyone who is bothered by it, let him speak.<br>Rabbi Abbahu bar Kahana and Rabbi Levi:<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">These Sages address the question of why the verse states that Abraham “was circumcised” rather than stating that he circumcised himself.</i> Rabbi Abbahu said: He felt it and he suffered,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states that Abraham “was circumcised” in order to indicate that he suffered like anyone else who undergoes circumcision.</i> so that the Holy One blessed be He would multiply his reward. It is written: “One born in your house or purchased with your money shall be circumcised [<i>himol yimol</i>]” (Genesis 17:13). The Holy One blessed be He said: Shall one impure come and tend to one who is pure; is that possible?<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Shall an uncircumcised person circumcise one who is in the process of purification?</i> Rather, one who is circumcised [<i>hamul</i>] shall circumcise [<i>yimol</i>]. I am pure and Abraham is pure; it is appropriate for the pure to tend to the pure. Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: The Holy One blessed be He joined His right hand to Abraham’s and circumcised him, as it is stated: “You established the covenant with him” (Nehemiah 9:8).
“Another matter: “I will go to the mountain of myrrh” – this is Abraham, who is the first of all the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Just as myrrh is the first of the spices in the anointing oil (see Exodus 30:23).</i> “And to the hill of frankincense” – this is Isaac, who was sacrificed like a handful of frankincense on the altar.

Chapter 7

<b>“All of you is fair, my love, and there is no blemish in you” (Song of Songs 4:7).</b><br>“All of you is fair, my love” – this is Jacob our patriarch, whose bed was unflawed and no waste was found among it.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike his father and grandfather, all his offspring were righteous.</i><br>What is, “all of you is fair, my love”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: When Israel stood before Mount Sinai and said: “Everything that God spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), at that moment there were in their midst neither <i>zav</i>, nor leper, nor lame, nor blind, nor mute, nor deaf, nor imbecile, nor depressed, nor fool, nor doubter. Regarding that moment it is stated: “All of you is fair, my love.” When they sinned, there were not easy times, and there were in their midst <i>zav</i>, leper, lame, blind, mute, deaf, imbecile, and fool. At that moment it is stated: “They shall banish from the camp every leper and every <i>zav</i>” (Numbers 5:2).<br>Rabbi Ḥelbo said: It is written: “The one who presented his offering on the first day was [Naḥshon son of Aminadav of the tribe of Judah. And his offering was…]” (Numbers 7:12–13). “On the second day, presented Netanel [son of Tzuar].… his offering was…” (Numbers 7:18–19). Why did the Torah depict Judah as secondary?<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In relating Naḥshon’s offering the Torah uses a <i>vav</i>, meaning “and,” in the term <i>vekorbano</i>, “and his offering was,” indicating that there had been someone before him, although there had not been. Regarding Netanel the Torah does not use a <i>vav</i> even though there had been someone before him.</i> It is so Judah would not become arrogant and say: I presented first, I am the greatest of them all. Rather, the Holy One blessed be He treated them as though they all presented on the first day and on the last day.<br>Rabbi Elazar said: It is written: “This was the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed” (Numbers 7:84). But did each of them not offer one bowl, one ladle? Why does the verse state: “twelve silver bowls, twelve silver basins, twelve golden ladles” (Numbers 7:84)? It was so that Judah would not say: I presented first, I am the greatest of them all. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He treated them as though they all presented on the first day and on the last day.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: It is written: “All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, [and this is that which their father spoke to them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them]” (Genesis 49:28). After he blessed them did he bless them again? Rather, it teaches that Jacob our patriarch sat and likened them to beasts. He likened Judah to a lion, as it is stated: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). Dan to a snake, as it is stated: “Dan will be a serpent on the road” (Genesis 49:17). Naphtali to a hind, as it is stated: “Naphtali is a hind let loose” (Genesis 49:21). Benjamin to a wolf, as it is stated: “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf” (Genesis 49:27). Then he called them all wolves, all of them snakes, all of them fiery serpents, all of them scorpions. Know that it is so, as Dan, whom he called a snake, he<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Moses</i> then called a lion, as it is stated: “Dan is a lion cub” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Rabbi Idi said: We have found in the offerings of the princes that what this one offered that one offered. This one sacrificed a burnt offering, and that one sacrificed a burnt-offering; this one a meal offering and that one a meal offering; this one a sin offering and that one a sin offering; this one a peace offering and that one a peace offering. Why? It is because all of them are faultless and equal to one another.<br>What led the verse to delineate their genealogy in the book [of Exodus], Reuben, Simeon, and Levi?<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The verses delineate the genealogies of only these three tribes (see Exodus 6:14–25).</i> Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Levi: one said: It is because their father reprimanded them,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">When Jacob gave blessings to his sons before his death, he reprimanded Reuben, Simeon, and Levi (see Genesis 49:3–7). In order to emphasize that these tribes were not inferior, the verses list their genealogies as they introduce Moses and Aaron.</i> and one said: It was because it delineated the genealogy of Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Because the Torah sought to address the genealogy of Aaron and Moses from the tribe of Levi, it began with Reuben, the first of the tribes, and continued through Levi.</i> We do not know who said this and who said that. However, from the fact that Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Huna: “An ear that heeds life’s reprimand will rest among the wise” (Proverbs 15:31), it is Rabbi Huna<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">This is possibly an alternate pronunciation of the name of Rabbi Ḥanina. Alternatively, the text should either state Rabbi Ḥanina here or Rabbi Huna above.</i> who said because their father reprimanded them. Because they accepted their father’s reprimand they were privileged to have their genealogy delineated alongside Moses and Aaron. That is why it is stated: “All of you is fair.”<br>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yehuda said: It is because all the tribes did not preserve their genealogies in Egypt, but Reuben, Simeon, and Levi preserved their genealogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">They married only with families that could prove they were of pure lineage.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: It is because all the tribes engaged in idol worship in Egypt, but the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi did not engage in idol worship. The Rabbis say: It is because the other tribes did not exercise authority in Egypt, but these tribes exercised authority. How so? When Reuben died,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph had been the authority figure among the brothers and their descendants in Egypt, but he died before his brothers. At that point, Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob, became the authority figure.</i> authority was transferred to Simeon. When Simeon died, authority was transferred to Levi. When Levi died, authority was going to be transferred to Judah. A Divine voice emerged and said: Leave it until its time arrives. When did its time arrive? After the death of Joshua. That is what is written: “It was after the death of Joshua.… the Lord said: Judah shall ascend” (Judges 1:1–2). He was called three names: Judah, Otniel, and Yabetz. Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina: This<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Yabetz</i> is Boaz. Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: This<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Yabetz</i> is Otniel.<br>It is written: “Son of man, the House of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all…” (Ezekiel 22:18). Zechariah said: I saw them, and they were pure gold: “I saw, and behold, a candelabrum of gold in its entirety, with a bowl [<i>gulah</i>] atop it.… and there are two olive trees over it” (Zechariah 4:2–3). There were two <i>amora’im</i>; one said exile [<i>gola</i>], and one said their Redeemer [<i>go’alah</i>]. The one who said <i>gola</i>: As they were exiled to Babylon, and the Divine Presence was exiled with them. The one who said <i>go’alah</i>: It is their redemption, as it is written: “Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is His name…” (Isaiah 47:4). The Holy One blessed be He said: Since that is the case:<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Since in the future they will all be comparable to pure gold, as envisioned by Zechariah.</i> “All of you is fair, my love, and there is no blemish in you.”

Chapter 8

<b>“Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; look from the peak of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Ḥermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards” (Song of Songs 4:8).</b><br>“With me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon” – the Holy One blessed be He said: Come with Me from Lebanon.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The term Lebanon [<i>Levanon</i>] is expounded to mean bricks [<i>levenim</i>].</i> We learned there: One gives a virgin twelve months from when the husband asked to marry her in order to provide for herself (<i>Ketubot</i> 57a).<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">She is to provide herself with all her needs for the wedding and marriage.</i> But I did not do so; rather, while you were still engaged in mortar and bricks, I hastened and redeemed you. The repugnant opinion of Aḥashverosh said: “Six months with myrrh oil [<i>shemen hamor</i>], [and six months with perfumes, and with women’s cosmetics]” (Esther 2:12). Rabbi Yehuda bar Yeḥezkel said: [<i>Shemen hamor</i>] is oil of the boxwood. Rabbi Yannai said: It is the oil of unripe olives, which removes the hair and softens the flesh of the body. But I did not do so.<br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Rabbi Levi ben Sisi expounded in Neharde’a<i>:</i> “They saw the God of Israel, and under His feet [was like the craftsmanship [<i>kemaaseh</i>] of sapphire brickwork]” (Exodus 24:10). That was before they were redeemed; however, after they were redeemed, where was it? It was placed in the location where it is appropriate to place a brick.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">After the redemption from Egypt, the heavenly brick, representing the bricks of enslavement, was stored away.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya said: It is not written here, “the craftsmanship [<i>maaseh</i>],” but rather, “like the craftsmanship [<i>kemaaseh</i>]” – it and all its accessories were placed there; it, its basket, and its trowel were placed. Bar Kappara said: Until Israel departed from Egypt, its impression was in the sky. Once Israel departed from Egypt, it was no longer visible in the cloud. What is the reason? “And like the very heavens in purity” – as it is when it is clear of clouds.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> (Exodus 24:10).</i><br>The Holy One blessed be He said to them: When you were exiled to Babylon, I was with you, as it is stated: “For your sake I was sent to Babylon” (Isaiah 43:14). When you return to the chosen House<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple</i> in the near future, I am with you. That is what is written: “With me from Lebanon,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The Temple is referred to as Lebanon because the first Temple was built with the cedars of Lebanon.</i> my bride.”<br>Rabbi Levi said: The verse should have rather said: “With me to Lebanon, my bride,” but you say, “from Lebanon”? Rather, initially, He bounds from the Temple, and then He exacts retribution from the nations of the world.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: At three junctures the Holy One blessed be He exacts retribution from Esau and his chieftains. What is the reason? “Now I will arise, the Lord will say, [now I will ascend, now I will be exalted]” (Isaiah 33:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">There are three verbs each accompanied by the adverb “now,” referring to three different times.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Yannai: “Now I will arise” – as long as [Israel] is wallowing in the ashes, as it were, so is [the Holy One blessed be] He. That is what Isaiah said: “Shake the dust from you, arise and sit, Jerusalem” (Isaiah 52:2). At that moment, “Be silent all flesh before the Lord” (Zechariah 2:17). Why? “For He is roused from His holy abode (Zechariah 2:17); Rabbi Aḥa said: Like this hen that shakes its wings free from the midst of the ashes.
“Look from the peak of Amana” – Rabbi Ḥunya said in the name of Rabbi Yusta: The exiles are destined to reach Mount Amana<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">This is the same as the Mount Hor mentioned in Numbers 34:7–8 (see <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> there).</i> and recite song, and the nations of the world are destined to bring them like ministers to the messianic king. What is the reason? “Look [<i>tashuri</i>] from the peak of Amana.” <i>Tashuri</i> means nothing other than offering, just as it says: “We have no gift [<i>teshura</i>] to bring to the man” (I Samuel 9:7). It is fitting, but it is not fitting for Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated from the perspective of God: Whereas it is fitting for the nations of the world to bring valuable gifts to the messianic king, that is not sufficient from God’s perspective.</i> Did I not do this to you already in the days of Ḥazael? “Ḥazael went to meet him, taking with him as tribute all the good of Damascus, forty camel-loads” (II Kings 8:9). Rabbi Yehuda said: Was all the good of Damascus a burden borne by forty camels? Rather, it is to teach you that he had in his possession a gem and pearls that were worth the monetary value of all the good of Damascus, and [thus] it says: “Taking with him as tribute all the good of Damascus.”<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">If it already occurred that Ḥazael brought such a valuable gift to Elisha, the gift to the messianic king will have to be that much greater. Therefore, the nations of the world will bring him the Jewish exiles as a gift.</i> <br>Rather, they are destined to bring [the Jews] themselves as gifts to the messianic king. What is the reason? “They will bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the Lord, with horses and with chariots and with covered wagons [<i>uvakirkarot</i>]” (Isaiah 66:20). What is <i>uvakirkarot</i>? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: Like those elders who are unable to ride covered wagons and they carry them on sedan chairs. That is what is written: “Render to the Lord, families of the peoples, [render to the Lord glory and splendor]” (Psalms 96:7). Rabbi Aḥa said: It is not written here, “Peoples, render to the Lord families,” but rather, “families of the peoples, render to the Lord glory and splendor” – when you bring them, do not bring them in a demeaning way, but rather with glory and splendor.<br>By what merit? By the merit that they recited song at the sea. Rav Naḥman said: By the merit of the faith that Abraham had, as it is stated: “And he believed in the Lord” (Genesis 15:6). Rabbi Ḥelbo said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “Israel saw the great power […and they believed in the Lord]” (Exodus 14:31). He was still leading them; could they not believe? Is there a person who sees and does not believe? Rather, it is due to the merit of the faith that Israel had while in Egypt, as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31).
Another matter: “Look from the peak of Amana” – this is Abraham in whose regard it is written: “And he believed in the Lord” (Genesis 15:6). “From the peak of Senir” – this is Isaac. Just as Senir is hostile to plowing [<i>soneh nir</i>], so too, Isaac was subject to an ordeal only once. “And Ḥermon” – this is Jacob. Just as all the good of the Ḥermon is in its lower reaches, so too, priesthood is from Jacob, Levites are from Jacob, kingdom is from Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob was the last of the patriarchs.</i><br>“From the dens of lions” – these are Siḥon and Og; just as the lion is haughty, so Siḥon and Og were haughty and mighty, as there was a distance of only one day’s walk between this one and that one, and this one did not come to the aid of that one, and that one did not come to the aid of this one. “From the mountains of leopards” – these are the Canaanites. Just as this leopard is impudent, so the Canaanites were impudent. That is what is written: “Not a man remained in the Ai [or Beit El who did not come out after Israel]” (Joshua 8:17).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: It would have been fitting for Israel to have sung song over the downfall of Siḥon and Og, and it would have been fitting for Hezekiah to have sung song over the downfall of Sennacherib, as it is written: “But Hezekiah did not reciprocate according to the reward bestowed upon him” (II Chronicles 32:25). <Why?> “As his heart had grown haughty” (II Chronicles 32:25). You see Hezekiah, a king and a righteous man, and you say “as his heart had grown haughty”? Rather, his heart had grown too haughty to sing a song. Isaiah came to Hezekiah and his associates. He said to them: “Sing to the Lord” (Isaiah 12:5). They said to him: Why? “For He has performed grandeur” (Isaiah 12:5). They said to him: It is already “known throughout the land” (Isaiah 12:5). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Hezekiah said: The Torah in which I engage atones for the [absence of] song.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Hezekiah thought that because he had caused Torah to be known throughout the land, he was above singing songs of praise.</i> <br>Rabbi Levi said: Hezekiah said: Why do we need to recount the miracles and mighty exploits of the Holy One blessed be He? They are already known from one end of the world to the other. Has the sun not stood in the middle of the sky<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings 20:11.</i> and they [thus] saw the miracles and mighty exploits of the Holy One blessed be He to the end of the world?<br>Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Abba: Pharaoh king of Egypt and Tirhaka king of Kush were already involved in that miracle and came to aid Hezekiah. Sennacherib sensed their presence. What did the wicked Sennacherib do to them? At nightfall he bound them; at midnight, the angel emerged and struck Sennacherib’s troops. That is what is written: “The angel of the Lord emerged and smote the Assyrian camp” (Isaiah 37:36). In the morning, Hezekiah arose early and found them bound. He said: It seems that these came only to aid me. He untied them and they went and related the miracles and mighty exploits of the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Thus says the Lord: The product of Egypt and the merchandise of Kush” (Isaiah 45:14). “The product of Egypt” – this is Pharaoh king of Egypt; “and the merchandise of Kush” – this is Tirhaka king of Kush. “And the Sabeans, men of stature” (Isaiah 45:14) – these are their armies. “Will pass over to you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is Hezekiah and his associates. “They will be yours (Isaiah 45:14)” – they are already at peace with you. “They will follow you and pass in chains (Isaiah 45:14)” – in manacles. “They will prostrate themselves to you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is Jerusalem. “They will pray before you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is the Temple. What would they say? “There is only God with you; there is none other except for God” (Isaiah 45:14). Isaiah said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, “indeed [<i>akhen</i>] You are God who conceals Himself” (Isaiah 45:15). What is “<i>akhen</i>”? Where [<i>ekhan</i>] are You hiding, God? Indeed, You have the dynamism, and You conceal Yourself? [God] said to him: “God of Israel, Savior” (Isaiah 45:15) – I will then take vengeance.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Had Hezekiah recited song over the downfall of Sennacherib, he would have become the messianic king and Sennacherib [would have been] Gog and Magog, but he did not do so. Rather, he said: “Now I know that the Lord has rescued His anointed one.… Some come on chariots [and some on horses but we will make mention of the name of the Lord our God]” (Psalms 20:7–8). What is written thereafter? “Deliver us, Lord. The King will answer us on the day we call” (Psalms 20:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">These verses are attributed here to Hezekiah, and he refers to a future king as “His anointed one [<i>meshiḥo</i>],” an allusion to the Messiah, in realization that he himself would no longer be able to be the Messiah (Maharzu).</i>

<b>“How fair is your loving, my sister, my bride; how much better is your loving than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than all spices”</b> (Song of Songs 4:10).<br>“How fair is your loving, my sister, my bride” – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: In ten places Israel is called bride; six here and four in the prophets. Six here: “With me from Lebanon, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:8), “you have charmed me, my sister, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:9), “how fair is your loving, my sister, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:10), “your lips drip [nectar] my bride (Song of Songs 4:11), “a locked garden is my sister, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:12), “I came to my garden, my sister, my bride (Song of Songs 5:1); these are six. And four in the prophets: “The sound of gladness and the sound of joy, the sound of a groom and the sound of a bride” (Jeremiah 33:11), “like a bride who bedecks herself with her jewelry” (Isaiah 61:10), “you will tie them like a bride” (Isaiah 49:18), “like a bridegroom rejoicing over his bride” (Isaiah 62:5).<br>Corresponding to them, the Holy One blessed be He donned ten garments. “The Lord reigns; He is clothed in grandeur” (Psalms 93:1); this is one. “The Lord is clothed with strength” (Psalms 93:1); this is two. “Girded” (Psalms 93:1); this is three. “He donned righteousness like armor” (Isaiah 59:17); this is four. “He donned garments of vengeance” (Isaiah 59:17); this is five. “Attire” (Isaiah 59:17); this is six. “He clothed Himself with zealotry like a coat” (Isaiah 59:17); this is seven. “This that is majestic in attire” (Isaiah 63:1); this is eight. “Why is there red on Your attire” (Isaiah 63:2); this is nine. “You are clothed in splendor and glory” (Psalms 104:1); this is ten.

<b>“Your lips drip nectar, my bride, honey and milk are under your tongue, and the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon”</b> (Song of Songs 4:11).<br>“Your lips drip nectar, my bride” – Rabbi Derosa and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: Six hundred thousand prophets arose for Israel in the days of Elijah. Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: One million two hundred thousand, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From Gevat to Antipatris<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">These are the borders of the kingdom of Judah.</i> were six hundred thousand cities.

However, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will bring them and publicize their prophecy. That is what is written: “The Lord my God will come, all the holy ones with You” (Zechariah 14:5). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Just as six hundred thousand prophets arose for Israel, so too, six hundred thousand prophetesses arose for them.

“Honey and milk are under your tongue” – Rabbi Berekhya said: There is no beverage that is more disgusting than a beverage that is under the tongue, and you say: “Honey and milk are under your tongue”?

Rabbi Levi said: Even one who reads a verse in its pleasantness and in its melody, the verse says in his regard: “Honey and milk are under your tongue.”<br>“And the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon” – it is written: “He came near, and he kissed him. He smelled the scent of his garments” (Genesis 27:27). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You have no item whose odor is fouler and harsher than washed goatskin, and it says: “He smelled the scent of his garments”? Rather, when Jacob our patriarch entered, the Garden of Eden entered with him. That is what he said to him: “See, the scent of my son is as the scent of a field that the Lord blessed” (Genesis 27:27). When the wicked Esau entered to his father, Gehenna entered with him.

He said to him: ‘But did they not grow?’ He said to him: ‘Go out and learn from the snail, for as long as it grows, its shell grows with it.’ He said to him: ‘Did they not require laundering?’ He said to him: ‘The cloud would rub them clean and iron them.’ He said to him: ‘But would they not burn?’<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">From contact with the cloud that was fire.</i> He said to him: ‘Go out and learn from this garment made of stone fibers, which is ironed only in fire.’ He said to him: ‘But did they not grow lice?’ He said to them: ‘If in their deaths they did not,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">The bodies of everyone who heard the voice of God at Sinai were not infested with worms and maggots after their deaths (<i>Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer</i> 41).</i> did they in their lifetimes?’ [Rabbi Elazar asked:] ‘Did they not give off a foul odor from the perspiration of their bodies?’ He said to him: ‘They would roll in the grass [produced due to the water of] the well.

Chapter 12

<b>“A locked garden is my sister, my bride; a locked fountainhead, a sealed spring. Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates, with delicious fruit, henna with nard”</b> (Song of Songs 4:12–13).<br>“A locked garden is my sister, my bride” – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [This is analogous] to a king who had two daughters, one older and one younger, and he did not devote attention to arranging their marriages. The king left them for many years and went overseas. The girls arose and asserted themselves and married themselves to men. Each of them would take her husband’s seal and his signet. Years later, the king returned from overseas and he heard the voices of the people slandering his daughters and saying that the king’s daughters had engaged in licentiousness. What did he do? He issued a proclamation and said: The entire people shall go out to the assembly hall. He came and sat in the vestibule. He said to them: ‘My daughters, is this what you have done; have you tainted yourselves?’ Immediately, each of them produced her husband’s seal and his signet. He called his son-in-law and said to him: ‘To whom are you a bridegroom?’ He said to him: ‘I am your first son-in-law, [married] to your older daughter.’ He said to him: ‘What is this?’ He said to him: ‘This is my seal and this is my signet,’ and likewise [occurred with] the second [son-in-law].<br>At that moment, the king said: My daughters are sheltered from immorality and you slander and demean them? By your lives, I will administer justice against you. So it is with the nations, because they would taunt Israel and say: “Egypt enslaved the children of Israel [with harshness]” (Exodus 1:13); if they compelled them to perform labor, all the more so [they must have dominated] their bodies and their wives. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: My sister, My bride, a locked garden. What is a locked garden? The Holy One blessed be He said: My garden is locked and it is being condemned?<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">This is a metaphor meaning: The women of Israel have not had relations with anyone other than their husbands, and yet they are being maligned?</i> Rabbi Pinḥas said: At that moment the Holy One blessed be He called the angel appointed over pregnancy and said: Go and shape [the children] with all the features of their fathers. Who did the fathers themselves resemble? The paterfamilias of the families. That is what is written regarding Reuben: “The families of the Reubenites [<i>haReuveni</i>]” (Numbers 26:7). Rabbi Hoshaya said: Reuben, Reubenite [<i>haReuveni</i>], Simeon, Simeonite [<i>haShimoni</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 26:14.

Just as Baronite means a member of the Baron family, the same is true of Reubenite. Alternatively, Rabbi Marinos is disputing Rabbi Hoshaya’s point and saying that just as members of any family can be referred to in this manner, the term Reubenite does not mean anything special (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Idi: <i>Heh</i> at the beginning of the word and <i>yod</i> at the end; God [<i>yod-heh</i>] attests for them that they were indeed the sons of their fathers.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas said: “A locked garden” – these are the virgins. “A locked fountainhead” – these are the non-virgins.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Although there is an opening – <i>gal</i> means door in Aramaic – it remains locked before men other than her husband.</i> “A sealed spring” – these are the males.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">They did not engage in illicit sexual activity.</i> It was taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: “A locked garden, a locked fountainhead” – why was it [written] twice?

They did not change their name: Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt]; Reuben and Simeon ascended. They did not call Reuben Rufus, they did not call Simeon Luleyani, Joseph, Listis, or Benjamin, Alexandra.<br>They did not change their language. There, it is written: “The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew” (Genesis 14:13), and here it is written: “The God of the Hebrews has called upon us” (Exodus 5:3), and it is written: “That it is my mouth speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12), in the sacred tongue.<br>They did not speak slander, as it is stated: “Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask each man from his neighbor” (Exodus 11:2). You find that this matter had been entrusted to them for twelve months, and not one of them was found to have informed on his counterpart.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites knew twelve months before the Exodus that they would ask to borrow goods from the Egyptians and that they would then leave Egypt never to return.

Joseph descended to Egypt and sheltered himself from licentiousness, and all the males were sheltered by his merit.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The sheltering from licentiousness was itself sufficient that by its merit Israel would have been redeemed from Egypt. What is the reason? “A locked garden is my sister, my bride.” What is written thereafter? “Your branches [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">They merited to be sent [<i>lehishalaḥ</i>] from Egypt.</i> are an orchard of pomegranates.”<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: [This is analogous] to one to whom an inheritance fell at the site of a garbage dump. The heir was indolent and he sold it at a minimal price. The purchaser went and industriously excavated there and found a treasure. He built a large palace. The purchaser began walking in the marketplace with servants following him [all due] to the treasure that he had purchased there. The seller saw and was sorrowful, saying: Woe is me over what I lost. So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved in mortar and bricks and they were contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they saw their flags encamped at the sea in the array of a royal army, the Egyptians became sorrowful, saying: Woe are we, what did we send from our land? This is as it is stated: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh sent (Exodus 13:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh shouted woe [<i>vay</i>] is me.</i><br>Rabbi Yonatan said: [This is analogous] to one who had a field capable of producing a <i>kor</i>, and he went and sold it at a minimal price.

What is that?<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">What is the source of water with which God will accomplish this?</i> It is the well. From where did Israel pour libations all the forty years that they spent in the wilderness? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the well,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Most libations in the Tabernacle and Temple were from wine. The midrash is saying that the well facilitated the growth of vineyards in the wilderness.</i> and most of their pleasure was from there, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The well would produce for them types of vegetation, types of grains, types of trees. Know that it is so, as when Miriam died and the well ceased for them, they would say: “Not a place of seed, figs, or wine” (Numbers 20:5).<br>Rabbi Levi said: From the cluster, on the basis of: “They cut from there a vine with one cluster of grapes [and they bore it upon a pole between the two]” (Numbers 13:23). Is that possible? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Fruits were larger at that time. The Rabbis say: It was from what the idolatrous merchants would sell to Israel. Rabbi Yishmael taught: The wine of idolaters had not yet been forbidden for Israel.
Another matter: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>]” – the Holy One blessed be He is destined to transform your desolation [<i>sheluḥayikh</i>] into a pomegranate orchard in the future. What is that? It is the stream, as it is written: “Along the stream upon its bank…and its leaf for healing” (Ezekiel 47:12). What is “for healing [<i>litrufa</i>]”? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is for a laxative [<i>litrafyon</i>]; one sucks its leaves and his food will be expelled. Rav and Shmuel: one said it is to open the upper mouth, and one said the lower mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Litrufa</i> is a portmanteau of <i>lehatir peh</i>, to open the mouth.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Their two opinions correspond to the opinions of Rav and Shmuel.</i> one said: To open the mouth of the mute, and one said: To open the mouth of barrenness.
Another matter: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>]” – the Holy One blessed be He is destined to transform your rejected ones [<i>shiluḥayikh</i>] into a pomegranate orchard in the future. What is that? This is Elijah of blessed memory, as we learned there: There was a family from Beit Tzereifa on the eastern side of the Jordan, and the people of Zion admitted it by force, and there was another that they rejected by force.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">The family from Beit Tzereifa was of tainted lineage and should not have been allowed to freely marry other Jews, but the leaders of that time forcefully prevented publicity of this fact. A different family was of pure lineage, but their reputation was besmirched and they became known as being of tainted lineage.</i> In circumstances like these, Elijah will come to purify, to impurify, to reject, and to admit. Rabbi Yehuda said: To admit and not to reject. Rabbi Shimon said: [Elijah will come] to resolve disputes. The Sages say: Not to admit and not to reject, but to bring peace in the world, as it is stated: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet.… and he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children [and the heart of the children to their fathers]” (Malachi 3:23–24).

Rabbi Abbahu said: From the manna; that is what is written: “Myrrh, aloes, and cassia were on all your garments [as you went from ivory [<i>shen</i>] halls]” (Psalms 45:9) – from what is placed under the tooth [<i>shen</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the manna.

It is written: “For, behold, the Lord commands, and He will strike the great house into splinters [and the small house into chips]” (Amos 6:11).

That is what is written: “A garden spring, a well of fresh water.” “And flowing streams from Lebanon” – Rabbi Azarya said: This one contributes a trickle toward the matter, and that one contributes a trickle toward the matter, until the <i>halakha</i> emerges as though from Lebanon.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Lebanon is expounded as though it is from the word <i>lavan</i>, white.

<b>“Awake, north wind, and come, south wind; blow upon my garden, that its perfume will spread.

Rabbi Yosei said: The descendants of Noah sacrificed burnt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">All agree that Noah and his descendants sacrificed burnt offerings, as this is explicit in the text (see, e.g., Genesis 8:20). The dispute is whether they also sacrificed peace offerings.</i> Rabbi Elazar raised an objection to Rabbi Yosei: “Abel, too, brought from the firstborn of his flock and from the choicest of them [<i>umeḥelvehen</i>]” (Genesis 4:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The understanding is that Abel sacrificed offerings from which only the fats [<i>ḥelev</i>] are burned, i.e., peace offerings.</i> What does Rabbi Yosei do with this? He says: From the fattest among them. Rabbi Elazar raised an objection to Rabbi Yosei: “He sent the young men of the children of Israel [and they offered up burnt offerings and they slaughtered peace offerings [<i>shelamim</i>] of oxen to the Lord]” (Exodus 24:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">This verse explicitly states that they offered peace offerings, despite the fact that this took place before the giving of the Torah, when even the Israelites were considered no more than descendants of Noah (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> What does Rabbi Yosei do with this? Their bodies were whole [<i>shelemim</i>], without flaying and cutting.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contrast to standard burnt offerings, which require flaying and cutting.</i> Rabbi Elazar raised an objection: It is written: “Yitro took…a burnt offering and a peace offering” (Exodus 18:12), a burnt offering for the sake of a burnt offering and a peace offering for the sake of a peace offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The offerings were sacrificed properly. If an offering is sacrificed with the understanding that it is a different offering, e.g., if an animal designated as a burnt offering is sacrificed as a peace offering, one has not fulfilled one’s vow to bring the burnt offering.</i> What does Rabbi Yosei do with this? He would say to you: Two <i>amora’im</i> disagree. One says: Yitro came after the giving of the Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">When there were both burnt offerings and peace offerings.</i> the other says: Yitro came before the giving of the Torah. The one who said Yitro came before the giving of the Torah [must hold that] the descendants of Noah sacrificed peace offerings. The one who said: Yitro came after the giving of the Torah [holds that] the descendants of Noah sacrificed [only] burnt offerings.<br>This supports Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina: “Awake, north wind, and come, south wind.” “Awake north wind” – this is the burnt offering, which is slaughtered in the north.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">The north side of the Temple Courtyard.</i> Why was the term “awake” addressed to it?

Because it was something new.<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa, and Rabbi Yehoshua say in the name of Rabbi Levi: This verse, too, supports Rabbi Yosei. “This is the law of the burnt offering; it is the burnt offering” (Leviticus 6:2) that the descendants of Noah sacrificed initially. When it arrives at the peace offering, it says: “This is the law of the peace offering [that one shall offer to the Lord]” (Leviticus 7:11). It is not written here, “that they offered,” but rather, that they shall offer, from here forward.<br>How does Rabbi Elazar interpret this verse: “Awake, north wind, and come, south wind”? When the exiles situated in the north will awaken and they will come and encamp in the south, just as it says: “Behold, I am bringing them from the land of the north, and I will gather them from the ends of the earth” (Jeremiah 31:7). When Gog and Magog, which are situated in the north, will awaken and come and fall in the south, just as it says: “I will lead you astray and I will entice you, and I will take you up” (Ezekiel 39:2). When the messianic king, who is situated in the north, will awaken and come build the Temple, which is located in the south, just as it says: “I have roused one from the north and he came” (Isaiah 41:25).<br>“Blow upon my garden, that its perfume will spread” – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Binyamin bar Levi: Because in this world when the southern wind blows the northern wind does not blow, and when the northern wind blows the southern wind does not blow. However, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will bring an unusual wind to the world, and it will lead two winds simultaneously and both will serve. That is what is written: “I will say to the north: Give, and to the south: Do not withhold” (Isaiah 43:6).<br>“Let my beloved come to his garden” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Torah teaches you proper etiquette, that a bridegroom should not enter the wedding canopy until the bride gives him permission.

<b>“I came to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gathered my myrrh with my perfume; I ate my honeycomb with my honey; I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends; drink abundantly, beloved ones” (Song of Songs 5:1).</b><br>“I came to my garden” – Rabbi Menaḥem, son-in-law of Rabbi Elazar bar Avuna, said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Yosena: It is not written here, “I came to a garden,” but rather “to my garden [<i>legani</i>]” – to My wedding canopy [<i>leginuni</i>], to the place that was the site of My initial appearance. Was not the first appearance of the Divine Presence in the lower realm? That is what is written: “They heard the voice of the Lord God moving about in the garden” (Genesis 3:8). Rabbi Abba said: It is not written here, “walking [<i>mehalekh</i>],” but rather moving about [<i>mithalekh</i>], leaping and ascending, leaping and ascending.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It gradually ascended from the lower, earthly realm to the heavens.</i> Adam the first man sinned, and the Divine Presence ascended to the first firmament. Cain sinned, and it ascended to the second firmament. Enosh sinned, and it ascended to the third firmament. The Generation of the Flood sinned, and it ascended to the fourth firmament. The Generation of the Tower sinned, and it ascended to the fifth firmament. The residents of Sodom sinned, and it ascended to the sixth firmament. The Egyptians sinned during the days of Abraham, and it ascended to the seventh firmament. Corresponding to them were seven righteous men who lowered it to earth. Abraham was virtuous, and he lowered it from the seventh [firmament] to the sixth. Isaac arose and lowered it from the sixth to the fifth. Jacob arose and lowered it from the fifth to the fourth. Levi arose and lowered it from the fourth to the third. Kehat arose and lowered it from the third to the second. Amram arose and lowered it from the second to one, which is the first. Moses arose and lowered it to earth.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: That is what is written: “The righteous will inherit the earth and dwell upon it forever” (Psalms 37:29). What will the wicked do? They will be suspended in the air, because they did not cause the Divine Presence to rest upon the earth. But the righteous caused the Divine Presence to rest upon the earth. What is the source? “The righteous will inherit the earth and dwell [<i>veyishkenu</i>] upon it forever” – they caused the Divine Presence to rest [<i>veyashkinu</i>] upon it; “He dwells forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Just as in this verse the reference to dwelling forever is referring to the Divine Presence, the same is true of the verse in Psalms cited above.</i> and Holy is His name” (Isaiah 57:15). When did the Divine Presence rest upon it? It was on the day that the Tabernacle was erected, as it is stated: “It was on the day that Moses finished erecting the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1).<br>Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: This is analogous to a king who was angry at the queen and expelled her from his palace. Later, he sought to appease her. She said: ‘Let the king prepare for me something new<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This will serve as an indication that the king is no longer angry.</i> and come to me.’ So too, in the past, the Holy One blessed be He would accept offerings from on high,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">From heaven, without resting His Presence on earth.</i> as it is written: “The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma…” (Genesis 8:21). Now He accepts them from below.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is stating that “now,” with the establishment of the Tabernacle, the Divine Presence rested on earth.</i> That is what is written: “I came to my garden, my sister, my bride.”<br>“I gathered my myrrh with my perfume” – this is the incense of the spices and the handful of frankincense. “I ate my honeycomb with my honey” – these are the limbs of the burnt offering and the portions of the offerings of the most sacred order that are burned on the altar. “I drank my wine with my milk” – these are the libations and the portions of the offerings of lesser sanctity that are burned on the altar. “Eat, friends” – these are Moses and Aaron. “Drink abundantly, beloved ones” – these are Nadav and Avihu, who became inebriated to their detriment.<br>Rabbi Idi said: David sought to sacrifice an offering for himself like the offering of the princes;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He sought to build the Temple and to sacrifice offerings similar to those brought by the tribal princes upon the inauguration of the Tabernacle (see Numbers, chap. 7). Rabbi Idi interprets the phrase “eat, friends” as a reference to the princes.</i> that is what is written: “I will sacrifice to You burnt offerings of fattened animals [with the burning of rams; I will sacrifice bulls and goats]” (Psalms 66:15). What offering includes bull, rams, and goats? Say that this is the offering of the princes. That is what is written: “And for the peace offering, two oxen, [five rams, five goats]” (Numbers 7:17). Rabbi Shimon ben Yosena said: Why does he call the princes “friends”? It is because He intended to make them beloved and to draw them close.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash questions why the verse in Song of Songs, which states “eat, friends,” and is interpreted as referring to the princes, used the term friends. The answer is that God, by accepting their offerings, sought to make them beloved to the Israelites and draw them near to Him.</i><br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yosena said: In every other circumstance, an individual may not bring a voluntary incense offering, but here<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In the offerings of the tribal princes upon the inauguration of the Tabernacle.</i> there was a voluntary incense offering. In every other circumstance, an individual may not bring a voluntary sin offering, but here there was a voluntary sin offering. In every other circumstance, the offering of an individual does not override impurity and Shabbat, but here the offering of an individual did override Shabbat and impurity. In every other circumstance, an individual brings a sin offering only for a sin, but here an individual brought a sin offering not for a sin. Another matter: “Eat, friends” – these are the princes; “drink abundantly, beloved ones” – these are the libations.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The princes were so overjoyed to bring their offerings that it was as though they were inebriated.</i><br>Another matter: “Eat, friends” – Rabbi Berekhya said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests, but an insect fell onto the tray. Had the king withdrawn his hand, everyone would have withdrawn his hand. The king extended his hand, so everyone extended his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although these offerings were anomalous, since they were accepted by God, the princes could also partake of the parts that were not burned on the altar.</i> “Drink abundantly, beloved ones” – Rabbi Yannai said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests, and he would circulate among them and say to them: ‘May it be pleasant for you and may it be sweet for you.’ Rabbi Abbahu said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests. After they ate and drank, he said: ‘Take this fine portion and give it to the host.’ Here, too, it was so.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the analogy, a particular nobleman made the feast for the king and the king’s guests, and did not eat because he was busy ensuring that the king and the guests were satisfied. The king eventually ensured that the host also was able to eat. So too, after parts of the princes’ offerings were burned on the altar and other parts were given to the priests, the princes also partook of the remainder of the offerings.</i> “I came to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gathered my myrrh with my perfume; I ate my honeycomb with my honey” – you, too, eat. “I drank my wine with my milk” – you, too, “eat, friends; drink abundantly, beloved ones.”
The Divine presence was not on the earthly , lowliest plane , proof is that it is written , and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden.
Rabbi Abba said that Walking is not stated but Mishalech,to tell you that the voice was jumping and leaving, jumping and leaving

“It is the sound of my beloved knocking” – by means of Moses when he said: “Moses said: So said the Lord: At about midnight, I will emerge in the midst of Egypt” (Exodus 11:4). “Open for me” – Rabbi Yasa said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: My children, open for Me one opening of repentance like the eye of the needle, and I will open for you openings that wagons and carriages enter through it.<br>Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Ḥunya, and Rabbi Abbahu [said] in the name of Reish Lakish: It is written: “Desist, and know that I am God…” (Psalms 46:11) – the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: Desist from your evil actions and know that I am God. Rabbi Levi said: Were Israel to repent even one day, they would be redeemed immediately and the son of David would come immediately. What is the reason? “For He is our God, and we are the people of His flock and the sheep under His hand; today, if you heed His voice” (Psalms 95:7).

<b>“I arose to open for my beloved; my hands were dripping with myrrh, and my fingers with myrrh passing onto the handles of the latch” (Song of Songs 5:5).</b><br>“I arose to open for my beloved” – I arose, and not the nations of the world.

Cyrus issued a decree: Whoever has crossed the Euphrates has crossed, and whoever has not crossed shall not cross. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “The sun will be dark when it rises” (Isaiah 13:10) – if only it had been dark on that day and did not shine. Cyrus emerged to walk in the province, and he saw that the province was deserted. He said: Why is this province deserted? Where are the goldsmiths, where are the silversmiths? They said to him: Are you not the one who decreed and said: Let all the Jews go out and build the Temple? It was they who were the goldsmiths and the silversmiths, and they have ascended to build the Temple. At that moment he decreed: Whoever has crossed the Euphrates has crossed, and whoever has not crossed shall not cross.<br>Daniel and his associates and his comrades ascended. At that time they said: It is preferable for us to eat a meal of the Land of Israel and recite the blessing of the Land of Israel. Ezra and his associates and his comrades did not ascend at that time. Why did Ezra not ascend at that time? It was because he needed to clarify his studies before Barukh ben Neriya. So let Barukh ben Neriya ascend. Rather, they said: Barukh ben Neriya was a large, elderly man, and he could not even be loaded onto a sedan chair.<br>Reish Lakish said: It was due to the sanctity of the Temple that Ezra did not ascend at that time, as had Ezra ascended at that time, the accuser would be able to incite strife and say, it would be preferable to have Ezra serve in the High Priesthood rather than have Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak serve as the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The heavenly accuser was already accusing Yehoshua (see Zechariah 3:1), and this would have added to his accusations.</i> But Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak was a High Priest son of a High Priest, and although Ezra was a righteous man, he was not as worthy to serve in the High Priesthood as [Yehoshua] was. Rabbi Simon said: Abolishing hereditary rights is problematic before the Holy One blessed be He. “Onto the handles of the latch” – it was from there that the Euphrates was blocked before them.<br>Another matter: “I arose to open for my beloved” – I arose and not the nations of the world. “To open for my beloved” – in repentance. “My hands were dripping with myrrh [<i>mor</i>]” – bitterness [<i>merarim</i>], this is the sin of the Golden Calf, “this is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). “And my fingers with myrrh passing” – nevertheless “myrrh passing [<i>mor over</i>],” He overlooked my bitterness [<i>avar al merari</i>], as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered the evil…” (Exodus 32:14). “Onto the handles of the latch” – it was from there that it was locked before them so that they would not enter the Land of Israel.

<b>“His head is the finest gold; his locks are curls, black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11).</b><br>“His head [<i>rosho</i>] is the finest gold” – <i>rosho</i>, this is the Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord made me at the beginning [<i>reshit</i>] of His way” (Proverbs 8:22). Rabbi Ḥunya said in the name of Reish Lakish: The Torah preceded the creation of the world by two thousand years. What is the reason? “I was with Him, as a protégé; I was a delight day after day” (Proverbs 8:30), and the day of the Holy One blessed be He is one thousand years, as it is stated: “As one thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday as it passes” (Psalms 90:4). “The finest gold” – these are words of Torah, as it is stated: “They are more desirable than gold, than much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). “His locks are curls” – these are the ruled lines.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">These are scored on the parchment in preparation for writing the verses of the Torah.</i> “Black as a raven” – these are the letters.<br>Another matter: “His locks [<i>kevutzotav</i>] are curls [<i>taltalim</i>]” – heaps upon heaps [<i>tilei tilim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The locks and curls are understood to refer to the fine details of the letters in the Torah and their crowns.

Likewise, if all mankind would come together to eradicate the <i>yod</i>, which is the smallest of all the letters, they would be unable to do so. From whom do you learn this?

Solomon amassed horses and wives, thinking that he would avoid the pitfalls the verse warns against, but he did not avoid those pitfalls (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b).</i> that accused. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The book of Deuteronomy ascended and prostrated itself before the Holy One blessed be He and said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, You wrote in Your Torah that a testament that part of it is null and void, all of it is null and void. King Solomon seeks to eradicate a <i>yod</i> in the Torah.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Go; Solomon and one hundred like him will be null and void, and the <i>yod</i> in you will never be null and void.’
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: The <i>yod</i> in Sarai ascended and prostrated itself before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, You eradicated me from the name of this righteous woman, the wife of this righteous individual, Abraham our patriarch, and You called her name Sarah.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Go. At first, you were at the end of the letters and in the name of a female.

Tomorrow, I will reveal Myself and give the Torah to Israel, and I will place you in the first of the commandments, and I will begin with you first, as it is stated: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God”’ (Exodus 20:2).

Rabbi Yehuda interpreted the verse regarding Torah scholars: “Curls, black as a raven” – these are Torah scholars, as even though they appear ugly and black in this world, in the future, “their appearance is like torches, they dash like lightning” (Nahum 2:5).<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding the portions of the Torah: “Curls, black as a raven” – these are the texts of the Torah that appear too ugly and black to state them in public, and the Holy One blessed be He said: They are pleasant for Me, just as it says: “The offering of Judah [and Jerusalem] will be pleasant” (Malachi 3:4). Know that it is so, as the portion of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> were not stated together; rather, this one in and of itself and that one in and of itself, as it is stated: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: Any man, when he has a discharge from his flesh” (Leviticus 15:2), [and separately,] “And a woman, if her bloody discharge shall flow” (Leviticus 15:25).
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Torah that the Holy One blessed be He gave, its parchment was white fire, and it was written with black fire. It is fire, it is hewn from fire, it is completely formed of fire, and was given in fire. That is what is written: “From His right, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2).

<b>“His eyes are like doves beside streams of water; they are bathed in milk, well set” (Song of Songs 5:12).</b><br>“His eyes are like doves”; “his eyes” – these are the Sanhedrin, who are the eyes of the congregation, as it is stated: “It shall be if from the eyes of the congregation [it was performed unwittingly]” (Numbers 15:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This verse presents the law that if the Sanhedrin issued a mistaken ruling that was followed by the congregation, a special sin-offering must be brought (see <i>Horayot</i> 5b).</i> There are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person, and all of them follow the eyes.

Alternatively, the statement of the midrash may be translated to mean that the Sages clarify the <i>halakhot</i> by studying together in groups of two [<i>shenayim</i>] until they understand them clearly (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> “Well set [<i>al milet</i>]” – with the fullness [<i>mele’atah</i>] of Torah.

Five on this tablet and five on that tablet, as it is stated: “His hands are rods of gold,”<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a person has two hands with five fingers on each, there were two tablets with five commandments on each.</i> in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: That is what is written: “He inscribed them on two tablets of stone” (Deuteronomy 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Since there were ten commandments inscribed on two tablets, presumably there were five commandments on each.</i> The Rabbis say: Ten on this tablet and ten on that tablet, as it is stated: “He told you His covenant that He commanded you [to perform], the Ten Commandments, and He inscribed them on two tablets of stone” (Deuteronomy 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis understand this verse to mean that the Ten Commandments were inscribed on each of the two tablets.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: Twenty on this tablet and twenty on that tablet, as it is stated: “He inscribed them on two tablets of stone” (Deuteronomy 5:19) – twenty on this tablet and twenty on that tablet.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon accepts the derivation of the Rabbis based on the verse in Deuteronomy 4:13, and since an additional verse (Deuteronomy 5:19) also states that God wrote ten commandments on the tablets, Rabbi Shimon derives that there were twenty commandments on each tablet.</i> Rabbi Simai says: Forty on this tablet and forty on that tablet, as it is stated: “Tablets that were written on both their sides; from this side and from that side they were inscribed” (Exodus 32:15) – fourfold.
Ḥananya, the nephew of Rabbi Yehoshua, said: Between each commandment and [the next] commandment the portions and the details of the Torah were inscribed. Rabbi Yoḥanan, when he was explaining verses and would arrive at this verse: “Set with beryl,” would say: The nephew of Rabbi Yehoshua taught me well. Just as regarding waves [<i>galim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded from the phrase “rods of [<i>gelilei</i>] gold.”</i> between one large wave and another large wave there are small waves, so too, between each commandment and [the next] commandment, the portions and the details of the Torah were inscribed. “Set with beryl [<i>tarshish</i>]” – this is the Talmud, which is like the Great Sea, just as it says: “To Tarshish” (Jonah 1:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah attempted to flee to Tarshish, which was a significant sea voyage away.</i> just as it says: “All the streams go to the sea” (Ecclesiastes 1:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">All the other disciplines of Torah flow into the sea of Talmud.</i><br>“His belly is a slab of ivory” – this is the book of Leviticus.

“Covered [<i>me’ulefet</i>] with sapphires” – it<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah</i> saps [<i>me’olefet</i>] the strength of people, as it is as hard as the sapphire. Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Pinḥas: Rabbi Yudan said: If you say that the sapphire was soft, come and see an incident involving a certain person who brought a certain sapphire to Rome to sell it. The purchaser said: In order to assess it, we will test it by breaking a small piece from it. He placed it on the anvil and began striking it with a hammer. The anvil cracked and the hammer split, but the sapphire remained intact in its place. That is what is written: “Covered with sapphires.”<br>Rabbi Abba bar Mamal said: If a person weakens from [his exertion] in Torah and <i>halakha</i>, ultimately he becomes a magician through them.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">He arrives at clear solutions to seemingly intractable problems.</i> The Rabbis say: Anyone who becomes a magician through the words of Torah, ultimately he will become king through them, just as it says: “There is magic on the lips of a king” (Proverbs 16:10).<br>Donkey drivers came to Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon’s father to purchase produce, from the city of Himonaya. He was sitting near the oven; his mother removed bread [from the oven] and he ate it, his mother removed bread [from the oven] and he ate it, until he ate all the loaves. They said: Alas, there is an evil snake in this one’s intestines, it appears that this one is bringing famine to the world. He heard their voices. When they left to purchase their loads, he took their donkeys and brought them up to the roof. They came and sought their donkeys but did not find them. They lifted their eyes and saw them placed on the roof. They went to his father and related the incident to him. He said to them: ‘Perhaps you said something offensive to him.’ They said to him: ‘No, sir, but rather, such and such was the incident.’ He said to them: ‘Why did you relate to him begrudgingly and negatively? Was he eating from your [food]; is his sustenance your responsibility? No, it is He who created him, who creates his sustenance. Nevertheless, go and tell him in my name [to return the donkeys], and he will take them down for you. The latter miracle was more difficult than the first. When he took them up, he took them up one at a time, but when he took them down he took them down two at a time. But once he [concluded] his Torah studies, he could not carry even his cloak, to realize what is stated: “Covered with sapphires.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Elazar was so strong that he could carry donkeys down from the roof two at a time. But his exertion in his studies was so intense that when he finished he could not carry even his cloak. This demonstrates the previous statement of the midrash that Torah weakens a person, meaning that proper Torah study requires such exertion that the person will emerge exhausted.</i> <br>There was a member of Rabban Gamliel’s household who was able to pick up a box containing forty <i>se’a</i> and take it to the baker.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">He would carry a box containing forty <i>se’a</i> of grain, a measurement of volume greater than thirty liters.</i> [Rabban Gamliel] said to him: You have all this great strength and you do not engage in Torah study?

Rather, others would remove it from upon him, as he was unable to do so, to realize what is stated: “Covered with sapphires.”

Chapter 15

<b>“His calves are pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold; his appearance is like Lebanon, choice like cedars” (Song of Songs 5:15).</b><br>“His calves are pillars of marble”; “his calves” – this is the world; “pillars of marble [<i>shesh</i>]” – as it was established in six [<i>shisha</i>] days, as it is written: “For in six days the Lord made…” (Exodus 31:17). “Set on sockets of fine gold” – these are the portions of the Torah that are expounded with what precedes them and are expounded with what follows them. To what are they comparable? To a pillar that has a base beneath it and a capital above it. So too, the portions of the Torah are expounded with what precedes them and what follows them. From where [is it derived that they are expounded with] what precedes them? As it is stated: “If a man lies carnally with a woman” (Leviticus 19:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">This is written in the context of a maidservant who has been designated for a Hebrew slave.</i> What is written thereafter? “When you will come into the land and plant any food tree [you shall consider its fruit forbidden; three years it shall be forbidden for you, it shall not be eaten]” (Leviticus 19:23). What does one have to do with the next? Rather, when [a laborer] hoes he gradually becomes a member of the household, and because he enters and exits [the homeowner’s] house, he becomes suspected regarding his maidservant. He says: Am I not liable to bring a sin offering, am I not liable to bring a guilt offering? I will bring a sin offering, I will bring a guilt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The laborer downplays the significance of his sin with the maidservant.</i> Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Those who practice leniency regarding maidservants in this world are destined to be hung by the crowns of their heads in the future. That is what is written: “Indeed, God will crush the heads of His enemies, hairy skulls of those walking in their guilt” (Psalms 68:22). What is “walking in their guilt”? His liability is with him. [People] say: Let this man go in his liability.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">People will realize that the individual will die without atonement for the sins that he downplayed during his life. This is alluded to by the fact that the verse prohibiting fruit in the first three years of a tree’s life is preceded by the verse requiring a guilt offering for one who has relations with a designated maidservant. Just as it is prohibited to benefit from the fruit, it is prohibited to have relations with the maidservant with the intention of bringing the guilt offering.</i> <br>They are expounded with what follows them; how so? As it is written: “Three years it shall be forbidden for you, it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23). What is written thereafter? “You shall not eat over the blood; you shall not practice divination…” (Leviticus 19:26). The Holy One blessed be He said: For <i>orla</i> you wait three years, but for your wife, you do not wait until she purifies from her menstruation? For <i>orla</i> you wait three years, but for your animal, you do not wait until its blood is completely squeezed out?<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the phrase “you shall not eat over the blood” as alluding to the prohibition of having relations with a woman who has not been purified from her menstruation (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>), and to the prohibition of eating meat if the blood of the animal was not fully drained. Thus, the midrash derives from the juxtaposition of the verses that just as one waits for the fruit of the fourth year, he must wait in order to avoid these prohibitions, despite the fact that people might be less inclined to wait for them (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>; <i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> <br>Who upheld the mitzva of blood? Saul began to uphold the mitzva of blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Saul brought the people to observe the mitzva.</i> That is what is written: “They told Saul, saying: Behold, the people are sinning to the Lord by eating with the blood” (I Samuel 14:33). “Saul said: Spread out among the people and say to them: Let each man bring to me his ox and each man his sheep, and you shall slaughter here [<i>bazeh</i>] and eat” (I Samuel 14:34). What is <i>bazeh</i>? The Rabbis say: He showed them a knife fourteen fingerbreadths long: <i>bet</i> – two, <i>zayin</i> – seven, <i>heh</i> – five; that is fourteen. He said to them: Slaughter and eat in accordance with this protocol.<br>When did the Holy One blessed be He reward him? In the Philistine war, as it is written: “It was on the day of war that there was not to be found sword or spear in the possession of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but they could be found with Saul…” (I Samuel 13:22). “It was not found,” and you say: “It was found”? Who provided it to him? Rabbi Ḥagai [said] in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: An angel provided it for him. The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He provided it for him.<br>It is written: “Saul built an altar to the Lord; he was the first to begin building [altars to the Lord]” (I Samuel 14:35). The members of the early generations built numerous altars: Noah built an altar, Abraham built an altar, Isaac built an altar, Jacob built an altar, Moses built an altar, Joshua built an altar, and you say “he was the first to begin building [altars]”? Rather, he was the first of the kings to do so. Rabbi Yudan said: Because he devoted himself to this matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">He ensured that the people observed the laws of ritual slaughter.</i> the verse ascribes to him as though he were the first to build an altar to the Lord.
Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Yosei bar Lakoneya [said]: In this world one person builds a building and another demolishes it, one person plants a sapling and another eats from it. However in the future, what is written? “They will not build and have another inhabit, they will not plant and have another eat.… they will not exert themselves in vain, and they will not give birth to panic; for they are the descendants of the blessed of the Lord…” (Isaiah 65:22–23). “Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them will recognize them, for they are the descendants of the blessed of the Lord” (Isaiah 61:9).

<b>“His palate is sweet and all of him is delightful. This is my beloved, and this is my companion, daughters of Jerusalem” (Song of Songs 5:16).</b><br>“His palate is sweet” – it is written: “For so said the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek Me and live” (Amos 5:4). Is there a palate that is greater and sweeter than that?<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Is there any statement sweeter than this statement by God?</i> It is written: “As I live – the utterance of the Lord God – I do not desire the death of the wicked, [but that the wicked repent from his way and live]” (Ezekiel 33:11). Is there a palate that is greater and sweeter than that? “For I do not desire the death of the one who dies, the utterance of the Lord God; facilitate repentance and live” (Ezekiel 18:32). Is there a palate that is greater and sweeter than that? “If the wicked man turns away from his wickedness [that he did] and performs justice and righteousness, he will cause his soul to live” (Ezekiel 18:27). Is there a palate that is greater and sweeter than that?<br>Reish Lakish said: This is only if one has remorse for his previous actions. How so? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: If there was a person who was completely wicked all his days and ultimately he became completely righteous, in his regard the verse states: “The wickedness of the wicked person, he will not stumble over it on the day of his repentance from his wickedness…” (Ezekiel 33:12). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Moreover, all the transgressions that he performed, the Holy One blessed be He tallies them for him as merits. That is what is written: “Myrrh, aloe, and cassia were on all your garments [<i>bigdotekha</i>]” (Psalms 45:9). All the betrayals [<i>begidot</i>] that you betrayed Me, they are like myrrh and aloe before Me.<br>It is taught: How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan both say: At the age of forty-eight Abraham recognized his Creator. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: He was three years old, as it is stated: “Because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham heeded My voice” (Genesis 26:5) – the numerical value of <i>ekev</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ayin</i> – 70, <i>kof</i> –100, <i>bet</i> – 2 = 172. He died at the age of one hundred and seventy-five and heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two of them. Thus, he recognized God at the age of three.</i> Rabbi Levi said: When he was able to lift his heel [<i>ikva</i>] off the ground.
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: On three occasions, the Holy One blessed be He entered into a dispute [<i>nitvake’aḥ</i>] with Israel, and the nations of the world rejoiced with great joy but ultimately departed shamefacedly. When the prophet said to them: “Let us go now and reason together [<i>venivakheḥa</i>], says the Lord” (Isaiah 1:18) – the nations of the world rejoiced and said: How can they enter into a dispute with their Creator? Who can enter into a dispute with his Creator? Now He will eliminate them from the world. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the nations of the world were joyful, he transformed it for [Israel] into good, as it is stated: “If your sins will be like scarlet, they will be whitened as snow; if they will be reddened like crimson, they will be like wool” (Isaiah 1:8). The nations of the world were astounded and said: Is that a response, is that rebuke; rather, He came only to amuse Himself with His children.<br>When the Holy One blessed be He said: “Hear, mountains, the Lord’s quarrel, and the strong foundations of the earth, [the Lord has a quarrel with His people,] and with Israel He will contend” (Micah 6:2), the nations of the world rejoiced and said: How can they enter into a dispute with their Creator? Who can enter into a dispute with his Creator? Now He will eliminate them from the world. When the Holy One blessed be He saw the joy of the nations of the world, he transformed it for them into good. That is what is written: “My people, what did I do to you and how did I tire you? Testify against Me” (Micah 6:3). “My people, remember now what [Balak king of Moav] counseled” (Micah 6:5) – the nations of the world were astounded and said: How can this be; He came only to amuse Himself with His children.<br>When the prophet said: “The Lord has a quarrel with Judah and will reckon with Jacob” (Hosea 12:3), the nations of the world rejoiced and said: How can they stand before their Creator? Who can enter into a dispute with his Creator? Now He will eliminate them from the world. When the Holy One blessed be He saw the joy of the nations of the world, he transformed it for them into good, as it is stated: “In the womb he was at his brother’s heels, [and in his strength he strove with God]” (Hosea 12:4).<br>Rabbi Yudan said: This is analogous to a widowed woman who was complaining about her son to a judge. Once she saw that the judge sentences people with fire and tar, with punishments and rods, she said: If I inform the judge of my son’s misdeeds, he will kill him. When the previous trial ended, he said to her: ‘Is this your son?’ He said to her: ‘How did this son of yours mistreat you?’ She said to him: ‘Sir, when he was in my womb he kicked me.’ He said to her: ‘This is not [cause for] a trial.’ That is what is written: “In the womb he was at his brother’s heels” (Hosea 12:4). Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Simon said: The God of Jacob our patriarch accorded him honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The conclusion of the verse in Hosea is: “And in his strength he strove [<i>sara</i>] with God.” Rabbi Shimon interprets the word <i>sara</i> as related to <i>serara</i>, authority, and asserts that God accorded Jacob honor by granting him authority.</i>
“His palate is sweet” – Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: When Israel heard at Sinai: “I am [the Lord your God]” (Exodus 20:2), their souls departed. That is what is written: “If we continue to hear [the voice of the Lord our God we shall die]” (Deuteronomy 5:22). That is what is written: “My soul departed when he spoke” (Song of Songs 5:6). The spoken word returned before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: You are alive and enduring, and Your Torah is alive and enduring, and You send me to the dead? They are all dead.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He then sweetened the spoken word for them. That is what is written: “The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is majestic” (Psalms 29:4). Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “The voice of the Lord is mighty” – for the lads; “the voice of the Lord is majestic” – for the elderly. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The Torah that the Holy One blessed be He sent to Israel restored their souls to them. That is what is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8).<br>Another matter: “His palate is sweet” – [this is analogous] to a king who spoke harshly to his son, and [the son] was afraid and he fainted. When the king saw that he had fainted, he began embracing and kissing him, appeasing him, and saying to him: ‘What is it with you, are you not my only son and am I not your father?’ So too, when the Holy One blessed be He said: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), their souls immediately departed. When they died, the angels began embracing and kissing them, and saying to them: ‘What is it with you? Fear not, “you are children to the Lord your God”’ (Deuteronomy 14:1), and the Holy One blessed be He sweetened the speech on His palate and said to them: ‘Are you not My children? “I am the Lord your God.” You are My people, you are beloved to Me.’ He began appeasing them until their souls were restored and they began requesting of Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">They began requesting that He not speak with them directly any longer.</i> That is: “His palate is sweet.” The Torah began requesting mercy for Israel from the Holy One blessed be He. It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, is there any king who marries off his daughter and kills a member of his household? The whole world in its entirety is joyful for me, and your children are dying?’ Immediately, their souls were restored. That is what is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8).
Rabbi Aḥa and Rabbi Tanḥum bar Rabbi Ḥiyya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “Sanctify my Sabbaths” (Ezekiel 20:20) – in what way do you sanctify it? Sanctify it with food, with drink, and with clean garments, as it is written: “For it is a sign between Me and you, to know that I am the Lord…” (Exodus 31:13). “I am the Lord” – reliable to pay you a good reward.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: In the way of the world, a person performs labor with his employer, and because he sullies himself with mortar, [his employer] gives him his wages. However, the Holy One blessed be He is not so; rather, He says to Israel: ‘Do not sully yourselves with anything bad, and I will give you a good reward.’ That is what is written: “Do not make yourselves detestable” (Leviticus 11:43); “You shall not make a cut in your flesh for the dead…I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:28). “I am the Lord” – reliable to pay you a good reward in the World to Come.
Rabbi Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina, and Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: It is written: “I have separated you from the peoples…” (Leviticus 20:26) – had it been stated: “I have separated the peoples from you,” there would not have been any revival for the enemies of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">It would have been impossible for members of other nations to convert to Judaism.</i> Rather, “I have separated you from the peoples” – for one who separates the bad from the good, does not return to separate again;<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">If one separates undesirable material from a mixture, he does not have to do so again, because he never returns that undesirable material to the mixture.</i> however, one who separates the good from the bad, he must again separate.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">If one separates desirable material from a mixture, he may later separate more of the desirable material from the mixture.</i> So too, had it been stated: “I have separated the peoples from you,” there would not have been any revival for the enemies of Israel. Rather, it is stated: “I have separated you from the peoples” – to be for Me, for My name forever. Rabbi Aḥa said: From here [it may be demonstrated] that the Holy One blessed be He said to the nations of the world that they should repent and He would bring them near, under His wings.<br>Rabbi Levi said: All the actions of Israel are different from the nations of the world, in their plowing, in their sowing, in their planting, in their reaping, in their gathering, in their threshing, on their threshing floors and in their winepresses, on their roofs, regarding their firstborn, regarding their flesh, in their shaving, and in their counting. In their plowing, as it is stated: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey” (Deuteronomy 22:10). In their sowing, as it is stated: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds” (Deuteronomy 22:9). In their planting, as it is stated: “You shall consider its fruit forbidden” (Leviticus 19:23). In their reaping, as it is stated: “When you reap the harvest of your land” (Leviticus 19:9). In their gathering, as it is stated: “And you forget a sheaf in the field” (Deuteronomy 24:19). In their threshing, as it is stated: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4). On their threshing floors and in their winepresses, as it is stated: “The fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses you shall not delay” (Exodus 22:28), and it is written: “Like the produce of the threshing floor, and like the produce of the winepress” (Numbers 18:30). On their roofs, as it is stated: “You shall make a guardrail for your roof” (Deuteronomy 22:8). In their shaving, as it is stated: “You shall not mar the edge of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). In their counting, as it is stated: “When you take a census of the children of Israel…” (Exodus 30:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The census is to be conducted by each individual donating a half-shekel and the total sum being counted, rather than by counting the people.</i> Israel counts by the moon<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The lunar calendar</i> and the nations of the world count by the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The solar calendar</i>
Rabbi Berekhya said two, one in the name of Kahana and one in the name of Rabbi Levi. One in the name of Kahana: She<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The congregation of Israel</i> lauded Him and He lauded her. She lauded Him from top to bottom, and He lauded her from bottom to top. She lauded him from top to bottom, because He was On High and rested His Divine Presence on earth. He lauded her from bottom to top, as she is on the lowest level and He is destined to elevate her, as it is stated: “The Lord your God will set you on high” (Deuteronomy 28:1).<br>One in the name of Rabbi Levi: [This is analogous] to a king who betrothed a noblewoman and said: I request to see her. When he saw her, he began to praise her and to laud her. That is what is written: “This, your stature, is likened to a date palm” (Song of Songs 7:8). She too said, I wish to see him. When she saw him, she began with lauding, as she lauded him: “His palate is sweet and all of him is delightful.”

<b>“Where did your beloved go, fairest of women? Where did your beloved turn, that we may seek him with you?” (Song of Songs 6:1).</b><br>“Where did your beloved go, fairest of women?” The nations of the world say to Israel: ‘Where did your beloved go? From Egypt, to the sea, to Sinai. Where did your beloved turn?’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The nations of the world taunt Israel: In the past, God performed wonders for you in Egypt, at the sea, and at Sinai; but where is He now? He has abandoned you.</i> What does the congregation of Israel respond to the nations of the world? ‘Why are you asking about Him, while you have no share in Him? Now that I have cleaved to Him, am I able to separate from Him? Now that He has cleaved to me, can He separate from me? Wherever He is, He comes to me.’

Chapter 2

<b>“My beloved went down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies” (Song of Songs 6:2).</b><br>“My beloved went down into his garden, to the beds of spices.” Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: This verse, its beginning does not correspond to its end, and its end does not correspond to its beginning. The verse should have said only: My beloved went down to feed in his garden, and it says: “To feed in the gardens”? Rather, “my beloved,” this is the Holy One blessed be He. “Into his garden,” this is the world. “To the beds of spices,” this is Israel. “To feed in the gardens,” these are the synagogues and study halls. “And to gather lilies,” to take the righteous of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God takes the righteous to the Garden of Eden after their deaths.</i><br>What is the difference between the death of the elderly and the death of lads? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Abahu, Rabbi Yehuda says: When a lamp extinguishes on its own, it is good for it and it is good for the wick; but when it does not extinguish on its own, it is bad for it and bad for the wick. Rabbi Abahu said: When a fig tree is harvested in its season, it is good for it and good for the fig, and when it is not harvested in its season, it is bad for it and bad for the fig.
There was an incident in which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and his disciples, and some say Rabbi Akiva and his disciples, and some say Rabbi Yehoshua and his disciples, were accustomed to sit and study beneath a certain fig tree. Each day, the owner of the fig tree would arise early and harvest his fig tree. They said: ‘Let us change our location, as perhaps he is suspicious of us.’ What did they do? They went and sat themselves elsewhere. The owner of the fig tree arose early and did not find them. He went and looked for them until he found them. He said to them: ‘My rabbis, you were performing one mitzva to my credit, and now you are seeking to withhold it from me?’ They said to him: ‘Heaven forbid.’ [He said:] ‘Why then did you abandon your place and sit elsewhere?’ They said: ‘We said that perhaps you are suspicious of us.’ He said to them: ‘Heaven forbid; rather, I will tell you why I arise early to harvest my fig tree. When the sun shines on the fig tree, it becomes infested with worms.’ They returned there immediately. On that day they found that he did not harvest. They took some of them, pierced them, and found them infested with worms. They said: ‘The owner of the fig tree spoke well. If he knows the season of his fig tree and he harvests it, so too, the Holy One blessed be He knows when it is the time to take the righteous, and he takes them.’
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: [This is analogous] to a king who had an orchard and he planted rows of nuts, of apples, and of pomegranates, and he gave them over to his son. When his son would fulfill his will, the king would search for and find a beautiful sapling in the world, and he would uproot it and plant it in that orchard. When his son would not fulfill his will, the king would see some beautiful sapling in the orchard and uproot it. So too, as long as Israel fulfills the will of the Omnipresent, He sees what righteous individual there is among the nations of the world, like Yitro and Raḥav, and He brings them and attaches them to Israel. When Israel does not fulfill the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He sees what righteous, upright, proper, and God-fearing individual there is among them, and He takes them from their midst.
When Ḥiyya bar Ivya, son of bar Kappara’s sister, died, they said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: ‘Go and eulogize him.’ He said to them: ‘Let Reish Lakish go, as he is his disciple and he knows his virtues.’ Rabbi Shimon<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who was known as Reish Lakish.</i> came and eulogized him: “My beloved went down into his garden”—the Holy One blessed be He knows the actions of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ivya and He took him from the world.
When Rabbi Simon bar Zavdi died, Rabbi Ila entered and eulogized him. “But wisdom, where will it be found, and where is the place of understanding?” (Job 28:12). “The deep says: It is not in me; and the sea says: It is not with me” (Job 28:14). “It is vanished from the eyes of all living and hidden from the birds of the heavens” (Job 28:21). There are four elements that are crucial for the function of the world, but if they are lost they have replacements. These are: “For there is a source of silver and a place where gold is refined. Iron is taken from the dust, and copper is smelted from rock” (Job 28:1–2). A Torah scholar, if he dies, who will bring us his replacement? We, who lost Rabbi Simon, where will we find someone like him? Rabbi Levi said: The tribes found a lost item, and it is written: “Their hearts sank and they trembled” (Genesis 42:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The sons of Jacob were fearful when they found that the money of one of them had been returned to his sack, despite the fact that, generally speaking, finding money is cause for celebration.</i> We, who lost Rabbi Simon bar Zavdi, from where will we find his replacement? That is, “but wisdom, where will it be found?”
When Rabbi Bon ben Rabbi Ḥiyya died, Rabbi Zeira came to eulogize him. “The sleep of the worker is sweet” (Ecclesiastes 5:11). I will tell you to what Rabbi Bon is comparable; to a king who had a vineyard and hired workers for it. There was one worker there who was more industrious in his work than all the others. When the king saw that he was extraordinarily industrious in his work, he grasped his hand and began taking long and short strolls with him. At evening time, the workers came to collect their wages. That worker came to collect his wages with them, and the king gave him wages like them. The workers began complaining. They said to him: ‘Our lord the king, it is we who exerted ourselves all day, and that one exerted himself for only two or three hours of the day, yet he is collecting his wages like us?’ The king said to them: ‘Why are you complaining? This one accomplished in two or three hours of the day what you did not accomplish in the entire day.’ So too, Rabbi Bon bar Ḥiyya accomplished in Torah what an experienced scholar does not accomplish in one hundred years.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who engages in Torah in this world, even in the future they do not allow him to sleep, but rather, they lead him into the study hall of Shem and Ever, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of Moses and Aaron. To what extent?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To what extent do they educate him in the future?</i> It is until “I will give you great renown, like the renown of the great men of the world” (II Samuel 7:9).

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

<b>“You are fair, my love, like Tirtza, lovely like Jerusalem, formidable like banners” (Song of Songs 6:4).</b><br>“You are fair, my love, like Tirtza.” Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon interpreted the verse regarding offerings. “You are fair, my love, like Tirtza,” these are the offerings, as you achieve acceptance [<i>mitratzim</i>] with offerings, just as you say: “It will be accepted [<i>venirtza</i>] for him, to atone for him” (Leviticus 1:4). “Lovely like Jerusalem,” these are the consecrations in Jerusalem, just as it says: “Like the consecrated flock, like the flock of Jerusalem” (Ezekiel 36:38).<br>Another matter, “you are fair, my love, like Tirtza,” these are the women of the generation of the wilderness [<i>tiran</i>], as Rabbi said: The women of the generation of the wilderness were upright. They stood and asserted themselves and did not give their rings for the incident of the Golden Calf. They said: If the Holy One blessed be He smashed the hard idol, this soft idol, all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If God smashed the idols of Egypt, how much more so this golden calf. They referred to the idols of Egypt as hard because they were made from stone, which is harder than gold, or because the Egyptians worshipped Aries, the first sign of the Zodiac, which is harder to destroy than a golden calf (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> “Lovely like Jerusalem,” as anyone who wants and seeks molds of Peor, he would go and find in Jerusalem; that is what is written: “And their idols from Jerusalem and from Samaria” (Isaiah 10:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash means that Israel is lovely to God for distancing themselves from the idols that had become ubiquitous even in Jerusalem and Samaria (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i>
Another matter, “you are fair, my love, like Tirtza,” when you wish [<i>at rotza</i>]. When you wish,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When you wish to wholeheartedly fulfill My will.</i> you need not seek to learn from anyone. Who said to them to bring wagons and cattle to bear the Tabernacle? Was it not of their own accord that they brought them? That is what is written: “They brought their offering before the Lord: six covered wagons [and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two princes and an ox for each; they brought them before the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:3), corresponding to the six firmaments. But are they not seven? Rabbi Avun said: Where the king rests under his canopy [is not counted among the rest]. Six corresponding to six earths: <i>Eretz</i>, <i>arka</i>, <i>adama</i>, <i>gei</i>, <i>tziya</i>, <i>neshiya</i>, <i>tevel</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These are seven terms used in the Bible to refer to the earth. However, since <i>tevel</i> is singled out as uniquely governed by God’s righteousness, it is not included with the others.</i> and it is written: “He will judge the world [<i>tevel</i>] with righteousness” (Psalms 98:9). Six corresponding to the six orders of Mishna; six corresponding to the six days of Creation; six corresponding to the six matriarchs: Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah, Zilpa, and Bilha.<br>“Covered [<i>tzav</i>],” like canopies; <i>tzav</i>, colored;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is due to the similarity between the word <i>tzav</i> and the word color (<i>tzeva</i>).</i> <i>tzav</i>, arranged in order;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is due to the similarity between the word <i>tzav</i> and the word <i>tzava</i>, army, which indicates ordered rows of soldiers.</i> <i>tzav</i>, that the hosts [<i>tzava</i>] of Levites stood over them. It was taught in the name of Neḥemya: They were like covered wagons, so the service vessels would not [fall and] break.<br>“And twelve oxen,” corresponding to the twelve princes: “A wagon for every two princes, and an ox for each” (Numbers 7:3), this teaches that they did not purchase them with money; rather, this one brought an ox and this one brought an ox, this one brought a wagon and this one brought a wagon. “They brought them before the Tabernacle,” this teaches that they gave them to the congregation.<br>“The Lord spoke to Moses, saying” (Numbers 7:4). What is “saying”? The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Go out and say to them words of praise and consolation.’ Rabbi Hoshaya said: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I ascribe to you [merit] as though I needed [something] in which to hold my world, and you brought it to me.’<br>At that moment, Moses was afraid. He said in his heart: Perhaps the Divine Spirit has left me, and has rested on the princes, or perhaps a different prophet arose and introduced this <i>halakha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was commenting on the fact that he had not been commanded to tell the princes to make this donation, but clearly God was very pleased with it.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, had I said to them that they should bring [these items], I would have told you to tell them; however, “take from them, and they shall be”’ (Numbers 7:5). What is “take from them”? These matters originated with them.<br>Who gave them the counsel? Rabbi Simon said: It was the tribe of Issachar. They said to them: ‘This Tabernacle that you are crafting, does it float in the air? Craft wagons for it upon which it may be carried.’ That is why the verse praises the tribe of Issachar, as it is stated: “From the children of Issachar, possessors of understanding of the times” (I Chronicles 12:33). What is “of the times”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: For astrology. Rabbi Yosei bar Kasrai said: For intercalation. “To know what Israel should do” (I Chronicles 12:33), as they knew how to cure skin disease. “Their leaders were two hundred” (I Chronicles 12:33), these are the two hundred heads of Sanhedrins<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the twenty-three person courts that presided in each major city.</i> that the tribe of Issachar produced. “And all their brethren at their command” (I Chronicles 12:33), this teaches that all their brethren would agree with their [decisions in] <i>halakha</i>, like <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.<br>At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, perhaps one of the oxen will die, or one of the wheels will break and the offering of the princes would be invalidated, resulting in the Tabernacle service being abrogated?’ Immediately, “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Take from them, and they shall be to perform…” (Numbers 7:4-5). “They shall be”—I will grant them existence so that they will live and endure in the world for ever and ever. Until when did they endure? Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of bar Kapara: Until the Gilgal; that is what is written in Hosea: “In Gilgal they slaughtered oxen, their altars are like heaps upon the furrows of the field” (Hosea 12:12). Where did they sacrifice them?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This question assumes that they were not sacrificed in Gilgal, as stated above. Alternatively, the midrash means that the merit of these offerings lasted until Israel worshipped idolatry in Gilgal, and the oxen were actually sacrificed afterward (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Avun said: They sacrificed them in Nov. Rabbi Abba said: They sacrificed them in Givon. Levi said: They sacrificed them in Shilo. The Rabbis say: They sacrificed them in the permanent Temple. Rabbi Ḥama said: The source for the Rabbis is as it is written: “King Solomon slaughtered a feast offering of…cattle [<i>zevaḥ habakar</i>]” (II Chronicles 7:5). <i>Zevaḥ bakar</i> is not written, but rather, <i>zevaḥ habakar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is written with the definite article, so that it reads in a literal sense “a feast offering of the cattle.”</i> Which cattle? You must say: “The two wagons and the four cattle” (Numbers 7:7), and it is written: “the four wagons and the eight cattle” (Numbers 7:8).<br>Rabbi Meir says: They endure [even] now, and they have not become blemished, they have not grown old, and they have not become <i>tereifa</i>, but rather, they are alive and well. The matters may be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If the oxen that were assigned by man to the Tabernacle service, [God] granted them existence to live and endure for ever and ever, Israel, which cleaves to He who endures forever, all the more so, as it is stated: “But you, who cleave to the Lord your God, all of you live today” (Deuteronomy 4:4).

<b>“Avert your eyes from me, as they excite my arrogance. Your hair is like a flock of goats that streams down from Gilad” (Song of Songs 6:5).</b><br>“Avert your eyes,” Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: [This is analogous] to a king who was angry at the queen and banished her, expelling her from the palace. What did she do? She went and concealed her face behind a pillar outside the palace. When the king passed, the king said: ‘Remove her from before me, as I am unable to bear [her suffering].’ So too, when the rabbinical court convenes and decrees fasts and the individuals fast, the Holy One blessed be He says: ‘I am unable to bear it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">God is unable to bear their distress and therefore alleviates the suffering or ends the drought that was the cause of their fasting.</i> “As they excite my arrogance”—they caused Me to extend My hand against My world.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is due to the merit of the righteous individuals that I displayed My dominance over the world by redeeming Israel from Egypt.</i> <br>When the rabbinical court convenes and decrees fasts and the children fast, the Holy One blessed be He says: ‘I am unable to bear it.’ “As they excite my arrogance,” they crowned Me as king over them, and said: “The Lord will reign for ever and ever” (Exodus 15:18). When they decree fasts and the elderly fast, the Holy One blessed be He says: ‘I am unable to bear it.’ “As they excite my arrogance [<i>hirhivuni</i>],” they accepted My kingdom over them at Sinai, and said: “Everything that the Lord says we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), and it is written: “To those of my acquaintance, I mention Rahav<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, too, the word Rahav is a term indicating exaltedness or kingship, as the word <i>hirhivuni</i>, which shares the same root as Rahav, is understood in the midrash.</i> and Babylon…” (Psalms 87:4).<br>Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina bar Pappa: It is written: “Even the rebellious You captured to dwell over, Lord God” (Psalms 68:19); even the rebellious, the Holy One blessed be He rests His Divine presence in their midst.

[The women] would say to them: ‘Are we not among the creations of the Holy One blessed be He, that you do this to us?’ The Israelites would say to them: ‘Is it not enough for you that our people received their punishment because of you?’ That is what is written: “The Lord said to Moses: Take all the leaders of the people, and hang them” (Numbers 25:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This was one of the disastrous consequences of the Israelites’ sins with the Midyanite women.</i> “And there is none missing among them,” that not one of them was suspected of committing a transgression.

Chapter 7

<b>“Your temple is like a pomegranate slice behind your braid” (Song of Songs 6:7).</b><br>“Your temple [<i>rakatekh</i>] is like a pomegranate slice.” At that moment, Moses began praising them: Even the empty among you is packed with mitzvot and good deeds like the pomegranate, for anyone who is confronted by the opportunity to commit a transgression and is spared from it and does not perform it has performed a great mitzva. It goes without saying: “Behind your braid [<i>letzamatekh</i>]” regarding the modest and the fervent [<i>metzumatin</i>] among you.

Chapter 8

<b>“There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and young women without number” (Song of Songs 6:8).</b><br>“There are sixty queens.” Rabbi Ḥiyya of Tzippori and Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse regarding the nations of the world. Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Sixty and eighty are one hundred and forty. Forty of them have a language [of their own] but do not have a script [of their own] and forty do not have a language but have a script. “And young women without number,” the rest of them have neither a language nor a script. Is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “To the Jews in their language and in their script” (Esther 8:9).<br>Rabbi Levi said: Sixty and eighty are one hundred and forty. Seventy of them know their fathers but do not know their mothers. Seventy of them know their mothers but do not know their fathers. “And young women without number,” [those] who do not know their fathers or their mothers. Is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “They established their genealogy according to their families, according to their fathers' household” (Numbers 1:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The term “their families” indicates that they knew their mothers and “their fathers’ household” indicates they knew their fathers.

Chapter 9

<b>“One is my faultless dove, one to her mother, pure to the one who bore her. Girls see her and laud her; queens and concubines, and praise her” (Song of Songs 6:9).</b><br>“One is my faultless dove”—“one,” this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham was one” (Ezekiel 33:24). “One to her mother,” this is Isaac, who was an only child to his mother. “Pure [<i>bara</i>] to the one who bore her,” this is Jacob our patriarch, of whom it was clear [<i>barur</i>] to the one who bore him that he was entirely righteous. “Girls see her and laud her,” these are the tribes, as it is stated: “The news was heard in Pharaoh's palace, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come" (Genesis 45:16). Alternatively, “girls see her and laud her [<i>vayashruha</i>],” this is Leah, as it is stated: “In my happiness, as women will be happy for me [<i>ishruni</i>]” (Genesis 30:13).<br>“Queens and concubines, and praise her,” this is Joseph, as it is stated: “Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find someone like this?” (Genesis 41:38). If we walk from one end of the world to the other we will not find someone like this, as it is stated: “After God has disclosed all this to you, [there is no one as insightful and wise as you]” (Genesis 41:39).
Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding the portions of the Torah. “There are sixty queens,” these are the sixty tractates of <i>halakhot</i>. “And eighty concubines,” these are the eighty portions in <i>Torat Kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is the midrash <i>halakha</i> on the book of Leviticus.</i> “And young women without number,” these are the <i>Tosefta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tosefta</i> contains tannaitic material [<i>baraitot</i>] that was not included in the Mishna.</i> “One is [my faultless dove],” they dispute each other, but all of them expound it from one source, from one <i>halakha</i>, from a verbal analogy, from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Ilai interpreted the verse regarding the Tree of Life and the Garden of Eden. “There are sixty queens,” these are the sixty groups of righteous people that sit in the Garden of Eden beneath the Tree of Life and engage in Torah study. It is taught: The Tree of Life is a walking distance of five hundred years, and all the primordial waters separate and emerge from beneath it. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: This is not only regarding its foliage, but even its trunk was a walking distance of five hundred years.<br>It is taught: The runoff of a <i>kor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This is a field large enough that it would be seeded with one <i>kor</i> of seed.

The Rabbis interpret the verse regarding those who departed from Egypt. “There are sixty queens,” these are the six hundred thousand [men] from the age of twenty and above who departed [from Egypt]. “And eighty concubines,” these are the eight hundred thousand Israelites from the age of twenty and below who departed. “And young women without number,” there is no limit and no tally of the proselytes.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The nations of the world have enumeration but do not have a tally.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">At times the Torah lists their descendants, but it does not give a total number.</i> They have enumeration:“the children of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2). But Israel has enumeration and a tally, as it is written: “Their count according to the number of every male…[their count was seven thousand five hundred]” (Numbers 3:22); “their count,” this is the enumeration, “according to the number,” this is the tally.<br>Likewise, “Yoav gave the sum of the number of the census to the king…” (II Samuel 24:9), “sum,” this is the enumeration, “census,” this is the tally. If you say that we are testifying about ourselves, did not the wicked Bilam testify in our regard, as it is written: “Who has counted the dust of Jacob,” this is the enumeration, “or tallied one quarter of Israel” (Numbers 23:10), this is the tally.
Another matter, “one is my faultless dove,” this is the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Who is like Your people, like Israel, one nation on earth” (II Samuel 7:23). “One to her mother [<i>le’imah</i>],” as it is stated: “Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation [<i>uleumi</i>]” (Isaiah 51:4); <i>le’imi</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The word My nation [<i>le’umi</i>] is written without a <i>vav</i>, such that it can be pronounced <i>le’imi</i>, meaning my mother.

The midrash may reflect a tradition regarding the writing of this word that is different from the tradition that has been more accepted over the centuries. Alternatively, the word <i>le’umi</i> is not necessary in the verse at all, and is written because it at times can be pronounced <i>le’imi</i>, when it is written without a <i>vav</i>.</i> “Pure to the one who bore her,” Rabbi Yaakov bar Avuna interpreted before Rabbi Yitzḥak: Other than her, there are no others to the one who bore her.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is God’s only chosen nation.</i> “Girls see her and laud her,” just as it says: “All the nations will praise you” (Malachi 3:12). “Queens and concubines, and praise her,” just as you say: “Kings will be your caregivers” (Isaiah 49:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This demonstrates that even royalty will admire and praise Israel.</i>

Chapter 10

<b>“Who is she who appears like dawn, fair like the moon, pure like the sun, formidable like banners?” (Song of Songs 6:10)</b><br>“Who is she who appears like dawn?” There was an incident in which Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta were walking in the Arbel Valley in the early morning and they saw the light of dawn breaking. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said to Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta: So will the redemption of Israel burst forth, as it is written: “Though I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me” (Micah 7:8). Initially it will come little by little, then it will sparkle, then it will increase, and then it will continuously spread. So too, initially, “In those days, Mordekhai was sitting at the king’s gate” (Esther 2:21), then, “Mordekhai emerged from before the king in royal garments” (Esther 8:15), and then: “For the Jews there was light and joy…” (Esther 8:16).<br>“Like dawn,” if so, just as the dawn has no shade, could it be, perhaps, that the same is true of Israel?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Is it true that they have no protection?</i> The verse states: “Fair like the moon.” If so, just as the light of the moon is not clear, perhaps the same is true of Israel? The verse states: “Pure like the sun,” that is what is written: “Let those who love Him be like the powerfully rising sun” (Judges 5:31). If so, just as the sun beats down, is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “Fair like the moon,” that is what is written: “How precious is Your kindness, God” (Psalms 36:8). If so, just as the moon is at times deficient and at times full, is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “Pure like the sun.” If so, just as the sun serves by day and does not serve by night, is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “Fair like the moon,” just as the moon serves by day and by night, as it is written in its regard: “To rule by day and by night” (Genesis 1:18), so too Israel, they are in this world and they are in the World to Come. If so, just as the sun and the moon do not induce fear, is the same, perhaps, true of Israel? The verse states: “Formidable like banners,” like the banners On High, like Mikhael and his banner, Gavriel and his banner. From where is it derived that they induce fear? As it is stated: “They had backs, and they were tall, and they were fearsome” (Ezekiel 1:18).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua said: It is like the fear of those below, e.g., dukes, governors, and generals. From where is it derived that they induce fear? It is as it is stated: “Fearsome, terrifying, and strong” (Daniel 7:7). Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna, Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i: “Like banners [<i>kidgalim</i>],” is not written here, but rather <i>kanidgalot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Degalim</i>, in the masculine, would be perceived as an allusion to angels or leaders. <i>Nidgalot</i>, in the feminine, is an allusion to the exile [<i>galut</i>].</i> like the generation that was sliding toward exile.

It is as it is stated: “He was thereafter exalted in the eyes of all the nations” (II Chronicles 32:23).<br>Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i: “Like banners [<i>kidgalim</i>]” is not written here, but rather <i>kanidgalot</i>, like the generation that would slide toward exile, but would not be exiled. Which is this? This is the generation of the messianic king. That is what is written: “I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem for the war” (Zechariah 14:2). From where is it derived that [the messianic king] will induce fear? As it is stated: “He will strike the world with the rod of his mouth” (Isaiah 11:4). Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Yirmeya: At that time, Israel will be moving from journey to journey.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin says: The congregation of Israel said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He brought me to a wine cellar, this is Sinai; Mikhael and his banner and Gavriel and his banner were there.’ It said: ‘If only we could travel like the supernal array.’ At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Since My children desire to be like the banners, they shall encamp by banners,’ as it is stated: “Each at his banner with the insignias by their patrilineal houses, the children of Israel shall encamp” (Numbers 2:2).

Chapter 11

<b>“I went down to the nut garden to look at the budding of the valley, to see if the vine had blossomed and the pomegranates were in bloom” (Song of Songs 6:11).</b><br>“I went down to the nut garden,” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Israel was likened to a nut tree. Just as a nut tree is pruned, and it regenerates, [such that] it is pruned for its own good – why? – because it regenerates, like that which is trimmed and regenerates, and like fingernails that are trimmed and regenerate, so too, whatever Israel pares from the wages of their labor and gives to those who toil in Torah study in this world, it is pared and regenerated for them, to their benefit. It provides them with wealth in this world and a fine reward in the World to Come.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Just as these trees, if you cover their roots at the time of their planting, they are successful, and if not, they are not successful, but this nut tree, if you cover its roots at the time of its planting, it is not successful, so too Israel, “one who conceals his transgressions will not succeed” (Proverbs 28:13).<br>Rabbi Elasha said: The verse should have stated only: “To the vegetable garden,” but it said: “To the nut garden.” Thus, it teaches that He gave them the strength of trees and the radiance of vegetables. Rabbi Azarya said two: Just as the shell of a nut protects its fruit, so the ignoramuses of Israel support the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">They do so by supporting those who engage in Torah study.</i> That is what is written: “It is a tree of life for those who grasp it” (Proverbs 3:18).<br>He said another: Just as this nut, if it falls into filth, you take it, scour it and rinse it, and it is restored to its original state and it is fit for consumption, so too, regardless of how much Israel is sullied with iniquities all the days of the year, Yom Kippur comes and atones for them. That is what is written: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to purify you” (Leviticus 16:30). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon says: Just as this nut has two shells, so, Israel has two commandments, circumcision and uncovering.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">These are the two stages of circumcision, which are likened to the removal of the hard and the soft shells of a nut.</i><br>Another matter, “to the nut garden,” Reish Lakish said: Just as this nut tree is smooth, as we learned (<i>Pe’a</i> 4:1): Rabbi Shimon says: Regarding the smooth nut trees as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As opposed to other trees, where one may leave the <i>pe’a</i> fruit on the tree for the poor, one may not do so on a nut tree, because it is smooth and dangerous to climb it. Therefore, one must remove all the nuts from the tree.</i> Anyone who climbs to the top of it, and does not pay attention to how he should climb, will fall and die. He will receive his due from the nut tree. So too, anyone who asserts authority over the public in Israel and does not pay attention as to how he should lead Israel, ultimately, he will fall and receive his due from them. That is what is written: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop, all those who devour it will be guilty…” (Jeremiah 2:3).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut is a toy for children and amusement for kings, so are Israel in this world, due to iniquity, as it is written: “I have become a laughingstock to all my people…” (Lamentations 3:14). But in the future, “Kings will be your caregivers” (Isaiah 49:23).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as on this nut tree there are nuts with brittle shells, medium shells, and hard shells, so too with Israel, some of them give charity at their own initiative, some give if you demand it from them, and some do not give even if you demand it from them. Rabbi Levi said: The parable says, a gate that does not open for a mitzva will open for a doctor.<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as a stone breaks a nut, so too, the Torah is called a stone and the evil inclination is called a stone. The Torah is called a stone, as it is stated: “I will give you the stone tablets” (Exodus 24:12), and the evil inclination is called a stone, as it is stated: “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh (Ezekiel 36:26). Rabbi Levi said: [This is analogous] to a desolate place which was afflicted by gangs. What did the king do? He positioned members of the royal guard there to defend it, so [the bandits] would not accost passersby. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The Torah is called stone and the evil inclination is called stone, let the stone protect from the stone.’<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut cannot be smuggled past the tax collector because its [rattling] can be heard and it is conspicuous, so too Israel, any place that one of them goes, he cannot say that he is not a Jew. Why? Because he is conspicuous. That is what is written: “Everyone who sees them will recognize them, for they are the descendants of the blessed of the Lord” (Isaiah 61:9).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut, if you have a sack filled with nuts, you can [still] put numerous sesame seeds and mustard seeds into it and it will hold them, so too, numerous proselytes have come and joined Israel. That is what is written: “Who has counted the dust of Jacob” (Numbers 23:10).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut, if you take one from the pile, all of them collapse and roll onto one another, the same is true of Israel; if one of them is stricken all of them feel it. That is what is written: “Shall one man sin, and You will rage against the entire congregation?” (Numbers 16:22).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: Just as the nut has four compartments and a space in the middle, so were Israel were situated in the wilderness; four banners, four camps, and the Tent of Meeting in the middle. That is what is written: “The Tent of Meeting…shall journey” (Numbers 2:17).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” this is the world. “To look at the budding of the valley, this is Israel. “To see if the vine had blossomed,” these are the synagogues and the study halls. “And the pomegranates were in bloom,” these are the children who sit and engage in Torah study, and sit in rows like pomegranate seeds.

Chapter 12

<b>“I did not know; my soul placed me upon chariots of my noble people” (Song of Songs 6:12).</b><br>“I did not know; my soul placed me,” Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: This is comparable to the daughter of kings, who was gathering residual sheaves. The king passed and recognized that she was his daughter. He sent his friend and he took her and seated her with him in his carriage. Her friends were astonished in her regard and saying: ‘Yesterday she was gathering residual sheaves and today she is in the carriage with the king?’ She said to them: ‘Just as you are astonished about me, so I am astonished about myself.’ She declared about herself: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved with mortar and bricks and were despicable and contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they became free men and were redeemed, they became elevated over all mankind. The nations of the world were astonished and saying, ‘Yesterday you were working with mortar and bricks, and now you have become free men, elevated over the entire world?’ Israel said to them: ‘Just as you are astonished about us, so are we astonished about ourselves.’ They declared about themselves: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>Another matter, “I did not know; my soul placed me,” it is regarding Joseph the righteous that the verse is speaking. Yesterday, “they tortured his legs with chains; his body was placed in irons” (Psalms 105:18), and today, “Joseph is the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6). He declared about himself: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>Another matter, “I did not know; my soul placed me,” the verse is speaking of David. Yesterday he was fleeing from Saul, and today, David is king. He declared about himself: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>Another matter, “I did not know; my soul placed me,” the verse is speaking of Mordekhai. Yesterday, “he donned sackcloth and ashes” (Esther 4:1), and today, “Mordekhai emerged from before the king in royal garments of sky-blue and white…” (Esther 8:15). He declared about himself: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>Another matter, “I did not know; my soul placed me,” the verse is speaking of the congregation of Israel. The congregation of Israel says to the nations of the world: “Do not rejoice over me, my enemy, for though I fell, I will rise” (Micah 7:8). When I was sitting in the dark, the Holy One blessed be He took me out to the light, as it is stated: “Though I sit in the darkness, the Lord is a light to me”<b> </b>(Micah 7:8). It declared about itself: “I did not know; my soul placed me.”<br>Yusta, the tailor of Tzippori, ascended to the royal palace and found favor with the king. The king said to him: ‘Make a request and I will grant it to you.’ He said to him: ‘Appoint me governor over our locale [Tzippori].’ The king granted it to him. When he was appointed governor, he descended from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">He descended from the palace back to Tzippori.</i> Some of those who knew him said: ‘It is him,’<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">When they saw him approaching they identified him as Yusta the tailor.</i> And some of them said: ‘It is not him.’ One said to the others: ‘He will now pass through the marketplace; if he looks at the stall upon which he would sit and sew, it is him. If not, it is not him.’ He passed through the marketplace and he began to look at the stall upon which he would sit and sew, and they realized that it was him. He said to them: ‘You are astonished about me, but I am astonished about myself more than you are.’ They declared of him: “I did not know; my soul placed me…” “My noble people [<i>ami</i>],” the noble One accompanied me [<i>imi</i>]—the One who lives eternally.

Chapter 1

<b>“Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, and we will gaze upon you. Why will you gaze at the Shulamite like at a dance of two companies?” (Song of Songs 7:1)</b><br>“Return, return, O Shulamite,” Rabbi Shmuel bar Ḥiyya bar Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Four times “return,” is written here, corresponding to the four kingdoms that rule over Israel. Israel comes under their control unscathed and emerges unscathed. “The Shulamite,” a nation in whose midst the eternal One who lives in peace [<i>shalom</i>] moves about; that is what is written: “I have moved about in a tent and a Tabernacle” (II Samuel 7:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God rested His presence in the Tabernacle in the midst of Israel. The Tabernacle resided in four places in the Land of Israel: Gilgal, Shilo, Nov, and Givon, corresponding to the four times “return” is written here, as though the word Shulamite is written with each one (Maharzu, <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 66:2).</i> <br>Another matter, “the Shulamite,” a nation to whom [a blessing] concluding with peace is [recited] each day, just as it says: “And grant you peace [<i>shalom</i>]” (Numbers 6:26). Alternatively, “the Shulamite,” the nation that I am destined to settle in an abode of peace; that is what is written: “My people will live in a peaceful abode…” (Isaiah 32:18). Another matter, “the Shulamite,” the nation to whom I extend peace; that is what is written: “Behold, I will extend peace toward it” (Isaiah 66:12).<br>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Maron said: A nation that completes [<i>mashlemet</i>] the stability of the world, both in this world and in the World to Come. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: A nation that all the good of the word comes only due to its merit. That is what is written: “God will give you from the dew of the heavens, and from the fat of the earth” (Genesis 27:28); “you,” the matter is dependent upon you and your merit, as it is written: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse” (Deuteronomy 28:12), the matter is dependent upon you and your merit.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Tanḥum and Rabbi Ḥanan, the son of Rabbi Berekhya from Botzra, [said] in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya: The nation that made peace between Me and My world, as had they not accepted My Torah, I would have returned My world to emptiness and disorder, as Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: It is written: “The earth and all its inhabitants melt away” (Psalms 75:4). Had Israel not stood before Mount Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has said, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), the world would have begun to disintegrate. Who buttressed the world? It is I [<i>anokhi</i>], as it is stated: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars firm, Selah” (Psalms 75:4); by the merit of: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), I set its pillars firm.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God caused the pillars of the world to be firm in the merit of the people of Israel accepting the Ten Commandments, the first of which was “I am the Lord your God” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>
“And we will gaze upon you.” The nations of the world say to Israel: Until when will you die for the sake of your God and be devoted to Him? That is what is written: “Therefore the young women love you” (Song of Songs 1:3). And until when will you be killed for His sake? As it is written: “For we are killed for Your sake all day” (Psalms 44:23). And until when will you perform acts of kindness on His behalf, and for Him Himself, while He repays you with harshness? Come over to us and we will appoint you dukes, governors, and generals. “And we will gaze [<i>veneḥezeh</i>] upon you,” you will be the focus [<i>meḥezyatei</i>] of the world. That is what is written: “You shall discern [<i>teḥezeh</i>] from among the entire people [capable men… to be leaders of thousands…]” (Exodus 18:21).<br>Israel responds to them: “Why will you gaze at the Shulamite like at a dance of two companies?” Have you ever heard that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob engaged in idol worship, such that their descendants would engage in idol worship in their wake? Our ancestors did not engage in idol worship and we, in their wake, will not engage in idol worship. But what can you do for us? [You can perform] a dance like that performed for Jacob our patriarch when he departed from the house of Lavan.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">You cannot accord us honor after we become idolators, because that will never happen, but you can accord us honor nonetheless. The reference to dance is due to the conclusion of the verse: “like a dance of two companies.”</i> Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Six hundred thousand angels were dancing and frolicking before Jacob our patriarch upon his departure from the house of Lavan. The Rabbis say: One million and two hundred thousand; that is what is written: “Jacob said when he saw them: This is the camp [<i>maḥaneh</i>] of God” (Genesis 32:3), this is six hundred thousand;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">“The camp of God” refers to a camp in which God rests His presence. The model for such a camp is the Israelite camp in the wilderness, in which there were six hundred thousand men, and in which God rested His presence (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 74:17).</i> “he called the name of that place Maḥanayim” (Genesis 32:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Maḥanayim literally means two camps.</i> this is one million and two hundred thousand.<br>Or can you perhaps perform for us a dance like that performed for our ancestors at the sea, as it is stated: “The angel of God traveled” (Exodus 14:19). Or can you perhaps perform for us a dance like that performed for Elisha, as it is stated: “The attendant of the man of God arose early and he set out, and behold, an army was surrounding the city, with horse and chariot. His attendant said to him: Alas, my master, what shall we do? (II Kings 6:15). And it is written:<b> </b>“He said: Fear not, as there are more who are with us than who are with them” (II Kings 6:16). Immediately,<b> </b> “Elisha prayed and he said: Lord, please open up his eyes and he will see. The Lord opened the attendant's eyes and he saw, and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and a chariot of fire, surrounding Elisha”<b> </b>(II Kings 6:17).<br>Or can you perhaps perform for us a dance like that which the Holy One blessed be He is destined to perform for the righteous in the future? Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Ḥelbo, Ulla of Birya and Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: In the future, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to lead a dance for the righteous, as it is stated: “Pay attention to its ramparts [<i>leḥeila</i>]” (Psalms 48:14); to the dance [<i>leḥola</i>] is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word is in fact written <i>leḥeila</i>.

Chapter 2

<b>“How fair are your feet in sandals, daughter of a nobleman. Your rounded thighs are like ornaments, the handiwork of a master craftsman” (Song of Songs 7:2).</b><br>“How fair are your feet in sandals,” Rabbi Yudan said: To praise even an ordinary person with this language would be demeaning to him, and you say: “How fair are your feet”? Rather, it is speaking only about the steps [<i>paamei</i>] of the pilgrimage festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the fact that the Torah says: “Three times [<i>pe’amim</i>] a year, all your males shall appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). Thus, the verse here is interpreted as praising Israel for travelling to Jerusalem in celebration of the pilgrimage festivals (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> But are the feet not sometimes bare and sometimes covered? Rather, how fair are your feet in sandals, daughter of my beloved.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is an alternate explanation of the midrash. The verse cannot be taken literally as praising the feet, as they are sometimes covered. Rather, the verse is praising Israel for how they observe <i>mitzvot</i> that have to do with shoes, such as <i>ḥalitza</i>. Israel is referred to as “daughter of my beloved” because Abraham was beloved by God (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: This is what was expounded by two mountains of the world, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, who said: “How fair are your feet in sandals [<i>bane’alim</i>].” Your feet were so fair<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The merit of traveling to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage festivals was so great (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> that they would serve as a barrier before all troubles.<br>There was an incident involving one who forgot to lock the doors of his house and ascended on his way to the pilgrim festival. When he returned, he found a snake entwined in the rings of his doors.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The snake prevented anyone from entering his house while he was away.</i> There was another incident involving one who forgot to bring his chickens into his house and ascended on his way to the pilgrim festival. When he returned, he found cats torn to pieces before them. There was another incident involving one who forgot to bring a pile of wheat into his house and he ascended on the pilgrim festival. When he returned, he found lions surrounding the wheat.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident involving two wealthy brothers from Ashkelon who had wicked neighbors from the nations of the world. [The wicked neighbors] would say: ‘When these Jews ascend to pray in Jerusalem we will enter, plunder their houses, and destroy them.’ The time arrived and they ascended, but the Holy One blessed be He summoned for them angels in their image, who would go in and out of their houses. When they returned from Jerusalem, they distributed what they brought back with them to all their neighbors. The [wicked neighbors] said to them: ‘Where have you been?’ They said to them: ‘In Jerusalem.’ ‘When did you ascend?’ ‘On such and such day.’ ‘When did you return?’ ‘On such and such day.’ They said: ‘Blessed is the God of the Jews, whom they did not forsake, and He did not forsake them. We<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of the Hebrew is “those men.” It was not uncommon for people to refer to themselves in the third person.</i> had thought: When these Jews ascend to pray in Jerusalem, we will enter, plunder their houses, and destroy them. But their God sent angels in their image who would go in and out of their houses, because they put their trust in Him,’ to fulfill what is stated: “How fair are your feet.”
Another matter, “how fair are your feet in sandals [<i>bane’alim</i>],” with two closings [<i>ne’alim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the festivals of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>; see below.</i> Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: [This is analogous] to two merchants who entered a province.

Rather, you open for your week and I [will open] for my week.’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, <i>Sukkot</i>, which commemorates God protecting Israel in the wilderness after they left Egypt, should have been observed right after Passover, but in order for the festival to be observed with greater attention and fanfare, the Torah commanded that it be observed months later (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥananya son of Rabbi Aivi said: It is not written here: How fair are your feet in a sandal [<i>bana’al</i>], but rather “in sandals [<i>bane’alim</i>]”; two closings [<i>ne’alim</i>], a closing on Passover and a closing on the Festival [of <i>Sukkot</i>].

It is to a king who had many daughters, some of whom were married [and living] in a nearby place, and some of whom were married [and living] in a distant place. One day they all came to ask after the welfare of their father the king. The king said: ‘Those who are married at a nearby place can go and return any time, but those who are married in a distant place cannot go and return any time. Therefore, while all of them are here with me, we will all make a festival for one day and celebrate with them.’ So too, the assembly of Passover, since [the days] transition from winter to summer, the Holy One blessed be He said it is [feasible] for them to go and return at this time. However, the assembly of the Festival [of <i>Sukkot</i>], because [the days] transition from summer to winter, and the dust on the roads is difficult and the clods of earth are difficult [for travelers]; therefore, it is not fifty days removed. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘It is not [feasible] for them to go and return at this time. Rather, while all of them are here, we will all make a festival for one day and celebrate.’ Therefore, Moses cautions Israel and says to them: “On the eighth day it shall be an assembly for you” (Numbers 29:35). That is: “How fair are your feet in sandals.”
“Daughter of a nobleman,” the daughter of Abraham who was called noble, just as it says: “The noblemen of the people have assembled, the people of the God of Abraham…” (Psalms 47:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash thus interprets the verse as referring to Israel as daughter of Abraham.</i> “Your rounded thighs,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All the luxuries and delicacies in which Israel luxuriates, and enjoys in this world, are by the merit of circumcision, which is between the thighs. Rabbi Ḥiyya said: What did the Sages see that led them to establish healing in the eighth blessing?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Of the <i>Amida</i> prayer.</i> It corresponds to circumcision, which was given [to be performed] on the eighth [day]. That is what is written: “My covenant was with him, life and peace” (Malachi 2:5). “Like ornaments [<i>ḥala’im</i>],” how many illnesses [<i>ḥalayim</i>] result from it, how many babies are circumcised and die as a result.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The merit of this mitzva is great because the Jewish people observe it scrupulously despite the danger (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Natan said: There was an incident where I came to the province of Cappadocia and there was a certain woman there who bore male children and they would be circumcised and die. She circumcised the first and he died, the second and he died, the third and he died. She brought the fourth [child] before me, and I saw that its flesh was yellow. I examined him and I did not find the blood of circumcision in him. They said to me: ‘Should we circumcise him?’ I said to them: ‘Wait and leave him until the blood of circumcision comes to him, as we learned there:<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 19:5.</i> A sick child, one does not circumcise him until he heals.

Rabbi Ḥonya and the Rabbis, Rabbi Ḥonya said: To a capital of a pillar. The Rabbis say: To the hollow of a pearl. Who crafted it? “The handiwork of a master craftsman,” the handiwork of the Holy One blessed be He in the world. Rabbi Shmuel said: [This is analogous] to a king who had an orchard. He planted rows of nut trees, apple trees, and pomegranate trees and gave them to his son. He said to him: My son, I demand nothing of you, only that when these trees produce fruit, bring me a sample of them and give me a taste so that I may see my handiwork and rejoice in you. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel, My children, I demand nothing of you, only that when a firstborn son will be born to one of you, he shall consecrate it to My name. That is what is written: “Consecrate every firstborn to Me” (Exodus 13:2). And when you ascend on your way to the pilgrim festivals take him and all your males to appear before Me. Therefore, Moses cautioned Israel: “Three times during the year [all your males shall appear before…the Lord]” (Exodus 23:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since one who is uncircumcised cannot ascend for the pilgrimage festival (see <i>Yevamot</i> 72a), it is implied that the son has been circumcised.</i>

Just as a baby, as long as it is in its mother’s womb, subsists only through its navel, so too Israel is unable to accomplish anything without their Sanhedrin. “A moon-shaped [<i>hasahar</i>] goblet,” this is the round chamber of admonition.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the seat of the Sanhedrin, from which the Sanhedrin would issue rulings to Israel. The Sanhedrin would sit in a semi-circular structure (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 36b).</i> Avun bar Ḥisdai said: There are places that call and characterize the moon as <i>sahara</i>. “Wherein mixed wine is not lacking;” the Sanhedrin must not be any fewer than twenty-three.<br>Another matter, “wherein mixed wine is not lacking,” the Sanhedrin must not be lacking its most distinguished member. Another matter, “wherein mixed wine is not lacking,” the Sanhedrin must not lack the one who determines the <i>halakha</i> for it, like that which we learned there: “Diluted wine is two parts water and one part wine, from the wine of the Sharon” (<i>Nidda</i> 19a).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Just as one would prepare wine for consumption by mixing in the right amount of water, the leader of the Sanhedrin would analyze all the sides of an issue and give direction as to the ruling.</i> Alternatively, “wherein mixed wine is not lacking,” may the Butler of the world not be lacking, just as you say: “The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want” (Psalms 23:1).
“Your belly is a pile of wheat,” this is the book of Leviticus. Just as the belly, the heart is on this side and the legs are on the other side and it is in the middle, so is the book of Leviticus, there are two on this side and two on that side and it is in the middle.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus is the third of the five books of the Pentateuch.</i> “A pile of wheat [<i>ḥitim</i>],” a pile of sins [<i>ḥata’im</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus details the laws of sin-offerings (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> “hedged with lilies,” these are matters of Torah, which are as soft as lilies. How many mitzvot and details are in the book of Leviticus, how many <i>a fortiori</i> inferences, instances of <i>piggul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">An offering is disqualified if, in the course of the four sacrificial rites, one has the intent to sprinkle the blood or eat the flesh of the offering beyond its appointed time. Such an offering is called <i>piggul</i>.</i> and instances of <i>notar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This is flesh that is left over after the appointed time for its consumption.</i> there are in the book of Leviticus.<br>Rabbi Levi said: It is the way of the world that a man might marry a woman at the age of thirty or forty years. After he outlays all his expenditures, he comes to consummate his marriage with her; if she says to him: I saw [a spot] like a red lily,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Menstrual blood.</i> he separates from her immediately. Who caused him not to approach her? What iron wall is between them? What iron pillar is between them? What snake bit him? What scorpion stung him so that he would not approach her? [There is but] the words of the Torah, which are as soft as lilies, in which it is stated: “You shall not approach a woman in her state of menstrual impurity” (Leviticus 18:19).<br>Likewise, one before whom they brought a tray of pieces [of meat]; if they say to him: [A piece of] forbidden fat fell there, he withdraws his hand and does not taste it. Who caused him to refrain from tasting? What snake bit him so that he would not taste it? What scorpion stung him so that he would not approach and taste it? The words of the Torah, which are as soft as lilies, in which it is written: “You shall not consume any fat or any blood” (Leviticus 3:17).
Another matter, “your belly is a pile of wheat,” but would one of pine cones not be fairer than one of wheat? But it is possible for the world to exist without pine cones, but it is not possible for the world to exist without wheat. Rabbi Idi said: Just as this wheat kernel is cleft, so Israel’s circumcision is cleft.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to <i>peria</i>, the process in which the membrane under the foreskin is split and pulled back (Maharzu).</i> Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥananya said: Just as wheat absorbs, so too Israel absorbs the property of the nations of the world. That is what is written: “You shall devour all the peoples…” (Deuteronomy 7:16), and it is written: “You will consume the wealth of the nations and in their glory you will revel” (Isaiah 61:6). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as with wheat, its waste is measured with it, so too Israel, “from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water” (Deuteronomy 29:10).<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Just as these wheat kernels, when they go out for sowing go out by measure, and when they enter from the grain pile they enter by measure, so too Israel, when they descended to Egypt they descended by number, as it is stated: “With seventy people, your ancestors descended to Egypt” (Deuteronomy 10:22), and when they ascended, they ascended by number, as it is stated: “some six hundred thousand men on foot” (Exodus 12:37). Rabbi Ḥonya said regarding the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Just as the landowner does not monitor boxes of manure, and not boxes of hay, and not boxes of straw, and not chaff; why? Because they are considered worthless; so too, the Holy One blessed be He does not monitor the nations of the world, why, because they are considered worthless, as it is stated: “All the nations are like nothing before Him…” (Isaiah 40:17). Whom does He monitor? Israel, as it is stated: “When you take a census of the children of Israel…” (Exodus 30:12), “take a census of the entire congregation of Israel” (Numbers 1:2).<br>Rabbi Neḥemya [said] in the name of Rabbi Avun: The nations of the world have no planting, have no sowing, and have no root, and the three of them are in one verse: “It is as though they were not planted, as though they were not sown, as though their trunk had not taken root in the earth” (Isaiah 40:24). However, Israel has planting, as it is stated: “I will plant them in this land” (Jeremiah 32:41), and it is written “I will plant them upon their land” (Amos 9:15). They have sowing, as it is stated: “I will sow her for Me in the land” (Hosea 2:25). They have root, as it is stated: “It is coming that Jacob will take root” (Isaiah 27:6).<br>To what is this matter comparable? Hay, chaff, and straw were deliberating with each other. This one said: The land was sown for my sake, and that one said: The field was sown for my sake. The wheat said to them: Wait until the [time for] threshing arrives and we will know for whose sake the field was sown. The time of the threshing arrived, and when they entered the threshing floor, the field owner emerged to winnow it. The chaff went with the wind, he took the hay and cast it to the ground, he took the straw and burned it, and he took the wheat and made it into a pile. People would pass and everyone who saw it would kiss it, just as it says: “Kiss the grain” (Psalms 2:12). So too the nations of the world; these say: We are the true Israel, and the world was created for our sake, and those say: We are the true Israel and the world was created for our sake. Israel said to them: Wait until the day the Holy One blessed be He will arrive and we will know for whose sake the world was created. That is what is written: “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven [and all the wicked people and all the evildoers will be like straw; and that coming day will burn them]” (Malachi 3:19), and it is written: “You will winnow them and the wind will carry them” (Isaiah 41:16). However, it is stated in Israel’s regard: “But you will rejoice in the Lord, you will be glorified in the Holy One of Israel” (Isaiah 41:16).

Chapter 4



Chapter 5

<b>“Your neck is like an ivory tower; your eyes are pools in Ḥeshbon, by the gate of Bat Rabim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus” (Song of Songs 7:5).</b><br>“Your neck is like an ivory tower.” It is written: “Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell upon his neck, and kissed him [<i>vayishakehu</i>] [and they wept]” (Genesis 33:4). The entire word<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vayishakehu</i> is written in the Torah scroll with a dot over each of the letters.</i> is dotted. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Everywhere that you find the script more numerous than the dots, adopt the script and ignore the dots. If the dots are more numerous than the script, adopt the dots and ignore the script. However, here, neither is the script more numerous than the dots, nor are the dots more numerous than the script, but rather it is dotted above <i>vayishakehu</i> in its entirety. This teaches that he did not come to kiss him, but rather to bite him. Jacob’s neck became as hard as marble and the teeth of that wicked one became dull and melted like wax. Why does the verse state: “And they wept”? This one was crying over his neck, and that one was crying over his teeth.<br>Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Elazar cites it from this: “Your neck is like an ivory tower.” It is written: “Pharaoh heard this matter and he sought to kill Moses. Moses fled” (Exodus 2:15). Is there a person who is able to flee from the king? Rather, it teaches that he was standing and was sentenced on that same day, and they condemned him to beheading. Rabbi Evyatar said: The sword glanced off the neck of Moses and sliced the neck of the wicked executioner. That is what is written: “For the God of my father was my help, and He delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh” (Exodus 18:4). He delivered me, but did not deliver the executioner. Rabbi Bon would apply to him the verse: “The righteous is extricated from trouble, and the wicked comes in his place” (Proverbs 11:8). Rabbi Berekhya said: “The wicked is ransom for the righteous” (Proverbs 21:18). Bar Kappara said: It teaches that an angel descended in the guise of Moses, and they apprehended the angel and left Moses, and he fled. Rabbi Abba son of Rav Pappi and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: At that moment all of Pharaoh’s advisors, some of them became mute, some of them deaf, some of them blind, and some of them disabled. They said to the mutes: Where is Moses? But they could not speak. To the blind, but they could not see. To the deaf, but they could not hear. To the disabled, but they could not walk, as it is stated: “The Lord said to him: Who gives a mouth to a person, or who renders one mute or deaf, or sighted or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?” (Exodus 4:11). Is it not I who did all these? “Now go and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10).
“Your eyes are pools in Ḥeshbon.” “Your eyes,” these are the Sanhedrin, who are the eyes of the congregation, just as it says: “It shall be, if from the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). There are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person and all of them follow the eyes. So too, Israel is unable to do anything without its Sanhedrin. “Pools in Ḥeshbon,” matters of calculation [<i>ḥeshbon</i>]; thirty-six exonerate and thirty-five convict.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The seventy-one members of the Sanhedrin would vote on a given case. If the majority, thirty-six, would exonerate, the defendant would be acquitted.</i> “By the gate of Bat Rabim,” this is the <i>halakha</i> that emerges from the gatehouse and is disseminated to the multitudes. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi says: It is attributed to: “Inclining after the majority [<i>rabim</i>]” (Exodus 23:2).
“Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon,” just as the nose is located at the highest part of a person, so the Temple is located at the highest part of the world. Just as the nose has much jewelry suspended from it,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Although people generally do not suspend much jewelry from their nose, it was customary to include one’s most beautiful jewel in a nose ring (<i>Yefei Kol</i>). Alternatively, the term nose [<i>af</i>] in this instance includes the area up to the forehead, from which people would suspend various types of chains and jewelry (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> so do priesthood, Levitical status, and kingship descend from Jacob. “Like the tower of Lebanon,”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Many commentaries (see, e.g., <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>) assert that the text should read: “Like the tower of Lebanon,” this is the Temple, as it is stated…</i> as it is stated: “This good mountain and the Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25). Rabbi Tavyomi said: Because it whitens [<i>malbin</i>] the iniquities of Israel like snow, as it is stated: “If your sins will be like scarlet they will become white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Because all the hearts [<i>levavot</i>] rejoice there, as it is stated: “Beautiful in its view, joy of all the land” (Psalms 48:3). The Rabbis say: [It is so called] because of [what is stated]: “My eyes and My heart [<i>libi</i>] will be there for all days” (I Kings 9:3).<br>“Overlooking Damascus,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Jerusalem is destined to reach until the gates of Damascus, as it is stated: “A prophecy, the word of the Lord: Ḥadrakh [and Damascus]” (Zechariah 9:1). What is Ḥadrakh? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥamya, Rabbi Yehuda said: There is a place that is called Ḥadrakh. Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit said to him: By the Temple service, I am from Damascus and there is a place there named Ḥadrakh. Rabbi Neḥemya said: This is the messianic king who is sharp [<i>ḥad</i>] and gentle [<i>rakh</i>]; sharp to the nations and gentle to Israel.<br>Another matter, Ḥadrakh, this is the messianic king who is destined to guide [<i>lehadrikh</i>] all mankind in repentance before the Holy One blessed be He. “Damascus is His resting place” (Zechariah 9:1). Is Damascus His resting place? But is His resting place not the Temple, as it is stated: “This is My resting place forever” (Psalms 132:14)? He said to him: Jerusalem is destined to expand on all its sides until it reaches the gates of Damascus, and all the exiles will come and rest under its auspices, to realize what is stated: “Damascus is His resting place,” His resting place will reach Damascus.<br>How does Rabbi Yoḥanan realize: “The city will be rebuilt on its mound” (Jeremiah 30:18)?<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This verse implies that it will be rebuilt upon its original location, but will not expand significantly beyond its original location.</i> Like a fig tree that is narrow below and wide above, so Jerusalem is destined to expand on all its sides, and all the exiles will come and rest under its auspices, to realize what is stated: “For you will spread right and left” (Isaiah 54:3). This is lengthwise; from where is it derived [that it will expand] widthwise? The verse states: “From the Tower of Ḥananel to the winepresses of the king” (Zechariah 14:10). Rabbi Zakkai the Great said: Until the pits of Rifa,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Some assert that the correct reading is “the pits of Jaffa” (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). In any event, the reference is to a location on the Mediterranean coastline in the land of Israel.</i> until the winepresses that the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, dug out;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the oceans.</i> that is lengthwise and widthwise. From where is upward [that it will expand] derived? The verse states: “The side-chambers widened and wound about higher and higher” (Ezekiel 41:7). It is taught: Jerusalem is destined to expand and ascend and reach the Throne of Glory, until you will say: “The place is crowded for me” (Isaiah 49:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Even when Jerusalem expands so greatly in all directions, it will still be crowded due to all the exiles who will return there.</i> Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Yirmeya said: We have still not learned the praise of Jerusalem. From where do you learn its praise? From its walls, as it is stated: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire all around” (Zechariah 2:9).

Chapter 6

<b>“Your head is upon you like the Carmel, and the locks of your head are like purple wool; the king is bound in the tresses” (Song of Songs 7:6).</b><br>“Your head is upon you like the Carmel,” the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: “Your head [<i>roshekh</i>] is upon you like the Carmel”—the indigent [<i>rashim</i>] among you are as dear to Me as Elijah who climbed Mount Carmel, as it is stated: “Elijah climbed to the peak of the Carmel and he placed his face between his knees” (I Kings 18:42). Why did he place his face between his knees? He said before the Holy One blessed be He: We have no merit, look to the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">He put his head between his knees as an allusion to the covenant of circumcision.</i> <br>“And the locks [<i>dalat</i>] of your head [<i>roshekh</i>] are like purple wool.” The Holy One blessed be He said: The poor [<i>dalim</i>] and the indigent [<i>rashim</i>] in Israel are as dear to me as David, as it is stated: “The feeble among them will on that day be like David” (Zechariah 12:8). Some say like Daniel, about whom it is written: “They clothed Daniel in purple wool” (Daniel 5:29).<br>“The king is bound in the tresses,” this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is written: “The Lord reigns, He is clothed in grandeur” (Psalms 93:1). “Bound in the tresses [<i>barehatim</i>],” as He bound Himself with an oath that He would rest His Divine Presence in the midst of Israel, in the beams [<i>barehatim</i>] of Jacob our patriarch. By whose merit? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana and Rabbi Levi, one said: By the merit of Abraham our patriarch, as it is stated: “Abraham ran<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Aramaic translation of “ran” is <i>rahat</i>.</i> to the cattle” (Genesis 18:7). And one said: By the merit of Jacob our patriarch, in whose regard it is written: “He displayed the rods [that he had peeled in the troughs [<i>barehatim</i>]]” (Genesis 30:38).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: “King,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “He became king in Yeshurun” (Deuteronomy 33:5). “In the tresses [<i>barehatim</i>],” as it was decreed upon him that he would not enter the Land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In that sense Moses was “bound” by the decree against him.</i> For what reason? It was due to the water troughs [<i>barehatim</i>] of the waters of contention. That is what is written: “They are the waters of contention” (Numbers 20:13). Rabbi Neḥemya said: “King,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “He became king in Yeshurun” (Deuteronomy 33:5). The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I appointed you king over Israel and it is the way of a king to issue decrees and have others fulfill them. Thus, you shall issue decrees upon Israel and they will fulfill them.’ That is what is written: “Command the children of Israel” (Leviticus 24:2).

Chapter 7

<b>“How fair you are and how pleasant you are, love, in delights” (Song of Songs 7:7).</b><br>“How fair you are and how pleasant you are,” how fair you are in the mitzvot, how pleasant you are in the performance of acts of kindness. “How fair you are” in positive mitzvot “and how pleasant you are” in prohibitions. “How fair you are” in the mitzvot of the house, in the distribution of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, “and how pleasant you are” in the mitzvot of the field, in gleanings, forgotten sheaves, produce in the corner of the field, the tithe given to the poor, and in renunciation of ownership.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">During the Sabbatical year one is required to renounce ownership of the produce of one’s field.</i> “How fair you are” in diverse kinds, “and how pleasant you are” in a garment with ritual fringes.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash praises Israel for observing the prohibition of “diverse kinds,” which includes various types of forbidden mixtures, one of which is combining wool and linen in a garment. However, it was permitted to affix ritual fringes, which must include wool strings dyed sky-blue, to a linen garment.</i> “How fair you are” in planting, “and how pleasant you are” in <i>orla</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In observing the mitzva that prohibits eating or deriving benefit from the fruit that grows on a tree during the first three years after its planting.</i> “How fair you are” in the produce of the fourth year “and how pleasant you are” in circumcision. “How fair you are” in uncovering<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This is the completion of the act of circumcision, in which the thin membrane underneath the foreskin is removed.</i> “and how pleasant you are” in prayer. “How fair you are” in the reciting of <i>Shema</i> “and how pleasant you are” in <i>mezuza</i>. “How fair you are” in phylacteries “and how pleasant you are” in <i>sukka</i>. “How fair you are” in <i>lulav</i> “and how pleasant you are” in repentance. “How fair you are” in good deeds “and how pleasant you are” in this world. “How fair you are” in the World to Come “and how pleasant you are” in the messianic era.<br>“Love, in delights,” this is the love of Abraham our patriarch, who excused himself before the king of Sodom.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">He refused to receive the goods, or earthly delights, offered by the king of Sodom.</i> That is what is written: “Abram said to the king of Sodom: I have raised my hand to the Lord…if so much as a thread to a shoelace, [or if I will take from anything of yours” (Genesis 14:22–23).<br>Another matter, “love, in delights,” this is the love of Daniel, who excused himself before Belshatzar, as it is stated: “Let your gifts be for you, and your grants [<i>unvazbeyatakh</i>] give to another” (Daniel 5:17). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: <i>Nevoz</i> means head. There they would call the governor <i>nevuzbezatakh</i>. Rabbi Berekhya said: Your plunders [<i>bizbuzekha</i>]; you are plunderers sons of plunderers. The parable says: From one who inherited and not from one who plundered.

Chapter 8

<b>“This, your stature, is likened to a date palm, and your breasts to clusters” (Song of Songs 7:8).</b><br>“This, your stature, is likened to a date palm.” Rabbi Ḥonya [said] in the name of Rabbi Dosa bar Tevet: The Holy One blessed be He created two evil inclinations in His world, the inclination of idol worship and the inclination of licentiousness. The inclination of idol worship has already been eradicated, but the inclination of licentiousness exists. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Anyone who can overcome the [urge to engage in] licentiousness, I attribute to him credit as though he overcame both of them.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda said: [This is analogous] to a snake charmer who had snakes. He charmed the large one and left the small one and said: ‘Anyone who can overcome this [small] one, I will ascribe him credit as though he overcame both of them.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He eradicated the inclination of idol worship and left the one of licentiousness. He said: ‘Anyone who overcomes the inclination of licentiousness, credit is attributed to him as though he overcame both of them.’<br>When was the inclination of idol worship eradicated? Rabbi Benaya said: [In the days of] Mordekhai and Esther. The Rabbis say: [In the days of] Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. The Rabbis responded to Rabbi Benaya: Was it eradicated by an individual? Rabbi Benaya responded to the Rabbis: Were Mordekhai and Esther individuals? This supports Rabbi Benaya: Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Meyasha, and Rabbi Yirmeya [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Kahana: It is written: “Sackcloth and ashes were arranged for the multitudes” (Esther 4:3); most of that generation was righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that many people donned sackcloth and ashes and engaged intensely in prayer indicates that Mordekhai and Esther were not the only righteous individuals.</i><br>This supports the Rabbis: Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: It is written: “Your survivors will remember Me among the nations where they were taken captive” (Ezekiel 6:9). “Your survivors,” these are Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, who were survivors from the fiery furnace. Among the nations where they settled is not written here, but rather, “among the nations where they were taken captive.” The Holy One blessed be He spoke to Israel: “Ephraim: What do I have to do with idols anymore?” (Hosea 14:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">God tells the prophet that Ephraim, representing Israel, will say this.</i> What do I have to do with the inclination of idol worship? “I have responded [<i>aniti</i>]” (Hosea 14:9); I have subdued myself [<i>uneiti</i>] for His sake. “I will gaze upon him [<i>va’ashurenu</i>]” (Hosea 14:9), did I not recite song [<i>shira</i>] before You? That is to say: It is I who subjugated the inclination of idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In this passage, the midrash reads the verse in Hosea to mean that Israel, referred to as Ephraim, claims to have subjugated itself before God and refrained from idolatry. God responds that it was He who eliminated the inclination for idol worship.</i> <br>If so, why did Israel’s existence become uncertain during the days of Haman? The Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, the Rabbis say: Because Israel engaged in idol worship. Rabbi Shimon said: Because they ate from the cooked dishes of the gentiles. They said to him: But was it not only the residents of Shushan the capital who partook in the feast? That is what is written: “Upon the completion of those days the king made a banquet for all the people who were present in Shushan the capital” (Esther 1:5). He said to them: But are not all Israel responsible for one another, as it is written: “They will stumble over one another” (Leviticus 26:37), one in the iniquity of his counterpart?<br>He said to them: If it is according to your opinion, you have brought upon all of Israel liability for elimination, as it is written: “One who sacrifices to gods, [save to the Lord only,] shall be destroyed” (Exodus 22:19). They said to him: Nevertheless, they did not worship it with all their hearts, as it is stated: “For He does not afflict willingly” (Lamentations 3:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Just as they did not worship idols with their hearts, God did not afflict them “willingly [<i>milibo</i>],” or literally, “with His heart” (<i>Yefei Kol</i>).</i> Nevertheless, “and torment the children of men” (Lamentations 3:33); He placed over then an extremely harsh man to subject them to an ordeal, this is Nebuchadnezzar, who arose and made their wound more painful.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: In two places, Israel acted with the Holy One blessed be He. At Sinai, they acted with their mouths but did not act with their heart, as it is stated: “But they beguiled Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue…their heart was not steadfast toward Him” (Psalms 78:36–37). In Babylon, they acted with their heart but did not act with their mouth,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">When Nebuchadnezzar forced them to bow to his idol, they remained loyal to God in their hearts but not outwardly.</i> as it is stated: “For He does not afflict willingly” (Lamentations 3:33), and nevertheless, “and torment the children of men” (Lamentations 3:33). He placed over them a man, as it is stated: “A man who is an adversary and an enemy. This wicked Haman” (Esther 7:6), and made their wound more painful.<br>In the opinion of the Rabbis, Israel engaged in idol worship in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. In the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, Israel did not engage in idol worship in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. In the opinion of the Rabbis, Israel engaged in idol worship, how so? Nebuchadnezzar set up an idol and designated twenty-three people from each and every nation and twenty-three from amongst Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">These individuals were to bow down to the idol at its inaugural ceremony. Three of those designated from Israel were Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, who did not prostrate themselves, but the other twenty did.</i> <br>In the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, Israel did not engage in idol worship, how so? Nebuchadnezzar set up an idol and designated three people from each and every nation and three from amongst Israel. Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, who were the three from Israel, arose and asserted themselves and did not engage in idol worship. They went to Daniel and said to him: ‘Daniel our master, Nebuchadnezzar set up an idol and designated three people from each and every nation and designated us from amongst Israel. What do you say, shall we prostrate ourselves to it or not?’ He said to them: ‘Behold, the prophet is before you, go to him.’ They immediately went to Ezekiel. They said to him as they said to Daniel: ‘Shall we prostrate ourselves to it or not?’ He said to them: ‘I have already received a tradition from my teacher Isaiah: “Hide for a brief moment until the fury has passed” (Isaiah 26:20).’<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel advised them to go into hiding until they would be able to escape (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> <br>They said to him: ‘Do you want them to say that all the nations prostrate themselves to this idol?’ He said to them: ‘What do you say?’ They said to him: ‘We want to diminish it, in that we will be there and will not prostrate ourselves to it, so that they will say: All the nations prostrate themselves to this idol other than Israel.’ He said to them: ‘If that is your wish, wait for me until I consult the Omnipotent.’ That is what is written: “Men of the elders of Israel came to seek the Lord and they sat before me” (Ezekiel 20:1). Who were they? They were Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya request to give their lives for the sanctity of Your name. Will You stand by them or not?’ He said: ‘I will not stand by them.’ That is what is written: “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them…Do you come to seek Me? (Ezekiel 20:3). After you caused Me to destroy My house, to burn My Sanctuary, and to exile My children among the nations; after that you come to seek Me? “As I live, I will not acquiesce to you” (Ezekiel 20:3).<br>At that moment, Ezekiel wept, lamented, and wailed to himself: ‘Woe to the enemies of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is a euphemism for Israel itself, employed when referring to difficult events or situations.</i> the remnant of Judah is lost. Only these remain from Judah, as it is stated: “Among them from the children of Judah were Daniel, Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya” (Daniel 1:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">These individuals were selected when Nebuchadnezzar asked for youths from the line of the kings of Judah who were handsome, wise, and knowledgeable. Thus, these were the elite of the remnant of Judah.</i> and this is the answer that they receive?’ He was weeping and walking. When he arrived, they said to him: ‘What did the Holy One blessed be He say to you?’ He said to them: ‘I will not stand by you.’ They said to him: ‘Whether He stands or whether He does not stand, we are giving our lives to sanctify His name.’ Know that it is so, for as long as they had not come before Ezekiel, what did they say to Nebuchadnezzar? “We have no need to reply to you in this matter. Behold our God, whom we worship, exists; He is able to deliver us” (Daniel 3:16–17). After they came to Ezekiel and heard the response, they said to Nebuchadnezzar: “But if not, let it be known to you, king” (Daniel 3:18), whether He delivers or whether He does not deliver, “let it be known to you, king, that we will not worship your gods, and we will not prostrate ourselves to the golden image that you have erected” (Daniel 3:18).<br>When they went out from before Ezekiel, the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself and said: ‘Ezekiel, what do you think, that I will not stand by them? I will certainly stand by them.’ That is what is written: “So said the Lord God: Concerning this too, I will acquiesce to the house of Israel” (Ezekiel 36:37). ‘But leave them and do not say anything to them. I will leave them to proceed unsuspecting.’ That is what is written: “He who walks innocently will walk securely” (Proverbs 10:9).<br>What did they do? They went and dispersed themselves among the populace and said, ‘Even if He does not deliver, “let it be known to you…”’<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">They dispersed themselves among the crowd so that everyone would hear them refuse to prostrate themselves.</i> That is why people take oaths and say: ‘To the One who established the world on three pillars.’ Some say that these are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and some say that these are Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.<br>“This, your stature, is likened to a date palm [<i>tamar</i>]” (Song of Songs 7:8), just as it was decreed that Tamar be burned, yet she was not burned,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 38:24–26.</i> so too, it was degreed that they be burned yet, they were not burned. Into what was the fire transformed? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Neḥemya, Rabbi Elazar said: It became like a planet. Rabbi Shmuel bar Neḥemya said: It became like the radiance of the heavens.

Chapter 9

<b>“I said: I will climb the date palm, I will grasp its branches; and may your breasts now be like clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your face like apples” (Song of Songs 7:9).</b><br>“I said: I will climb the date palm,” I said I would be exalted by the entire nation, but I was exalted only by you.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">God was exalted only by Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.</i> “I will grasp its branches [<i>sansinav</i>],” its palm branches [<i>sansinaya</i>].

Rabbi Huna said: In their garments of state.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna disagree about the meaning of the term <i>sarbaleihon</i>.</i> <br>Rabbi Avdimi of Haifa said: <Three> <six> miracles were performed on that day: The furnace rose to the surface;<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">It was originally built into the ground, but it rose so that everyone could see what was happening.</i> the furnace broke; members of four kingdoms were burned; Nebuchadnezzar became half burned; the wind toppled the idol; and Ezekiel revived the dead in the Dura Valley.<br>From where is it derived that the furnace rose to the surface? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is from this verse: “Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose in haste, and spoke, saying…I see four unbound men walking in the fire, and no harm comes to them, and the fourth resembles a son of the gods” (Daniel 3:24–25). Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: At that moment Mikhael the angel descended and struck him on his mouth. He said to him, ‘Wicked one [produced] from a putrid drop, does [God] have a son? Take back your words.’ He took back his words: “Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying: Blessed is their God…” (Daniel 3:28), “who sent His son” is not written here, but rather, who sent His angel, and saved His servants, who trusted in Him” (Daniel 3:28). Rabbi Reuven said: They were His servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar admitted that Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were loyal servants of God. Alternatively, he admitted that the angel was a servant of God rather than a son of God.</i> <br>From where is it derived that the furnace broke? As it is written: “Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the gate of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke, saying: Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego, servants of God Most High” (Daniel 3:26) “burst through and come” is not written here, but rather, “emerge and come” (Daniel 3:26); from here [it is derived] that the furnace broke.<br>From where is it derived that members of four kingdoms were burned? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “King Nebuchadnezzar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, the governors, <i>adargezaraya</i>, <i>gedavraya</i>, <i>detavraya</i>, <i>tiftaye</i>” (Daniel 3:2); <i>adargezaraya</i> – treasurers, <i>gedavraya</i> – commanders, <i>detavraya</i> – scholars.

The verse states: “And all the rulers of the provinces” (Daniel 3:2).<br>I have ascertained only that these were there when they descended;<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">They were present when Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego (Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya) descended into the fiery furnace.</i> from where is it derived [that these officials were all present] when they ascended? As it is written: “<i>Aḥashdarpenaya</i>, <i>signaya</i>, <i>upaḥvata</i>, <i>vehadavrei malka</i> assembled” (Daniel 3:27). <i>Aḥashdarpenaya</i>, Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Aḥa said: These are the judges who are suspected [<i>neḥshadim</i>] of perverting [<i>ufonin</i>] justice in favor of any of the parties. The Rabbis say: They favor one party [<i>mehadrin panim</i>] and pervert [<i>ufonin</i>] justice; <i>signaya</i> – scholars; <i>upaḥvata</i> – treasurers, <i>vehadavrei malka</i> – elders and astrologers. “And saw these men” (Daniel 3:27).<br>From where is it derived that Nebuchadnezzar became half burned? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From what he said with his own mouth: “It is pleasing for me to relate the signs and the wonders that God Most High has performed with me” (Daniel 3:32). “Performed with me,” performed with my body.<br>From where is it derived that the wind toppled the idol? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From this verse: “Bel bows, Nevo collapses” (Isaiah 46:1).<br>From where is it derived that Ezekiel revived the dead? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From this verse: “From the four directions, come, wind” (Ezekiel 37:9). Rabbi Pinḥas said: The very wind that toppled the idol was the wind that revived the dead. Rabbi Elazar said: That day was Shabbat and Yom Kippur.<br>The Rabbis say: Nebuchadnezzar was enticing Daniel very much and saying to him: ‘Will you not prostrate yourself to the idol that is dominant and real?’ He said to him: ‘Come see what it can do, and you will prostrate yourself to it of your own volition.’ What did that wicked one do? He took the frontplate of the High Priest and placed it in its mouth. He assembled all kinds of musicians and they were playing hymns before it, and [the idol] was saying: ‘I am the Lord your God.’ When Daniel saw this, he said to him: ‘Do you not give me permission to ascend and kiss your idol on its mouth?’ He said: ‘Why on its mouth?’ He said to him: ‘Because it is speaking sensible matters.’ Immediately, he granted him permission and he climbed. He adjured the frontplate, saying to it: ‘I am flesh and blood and I am an emissary of the Holy One blessed be He. Make certain that the Name of Heaven will not be desecrated through you. I decree upon you that you follow me.’ He came to kiss [the idol] and took what it had swallowed from its mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">He took out the High Priest’s frontplate.</i> After he descended, all the types of musicians reassembled and played hymns before it, but it would not do anything. At that moment, the wind toppled the idol.

They would ring them and say: ‘Come and see to what we were prostrating ourselves,’ to fulfill what is stated: “Bel kneels, Nevo collapses; their idols were for the beast and for the animal” (Isaiah 46:1).<br>“And may your breasts now be like clusters of the vine,” this is Peretz and Zeraḥ. Just as it was decreed that Peretz and Zeraḥ would be burned, but they were not burned, so, too, these,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.</i> it was degreed that they be burned but they were not burned. “And the fragrance of your face like apples,” Rabbi Elazar said: Since it wrote in their regard: “The odor of fire did not cover them,” and it says “and the fragrance of your face like apples,” to what was their odor comparable? To an apple orchard. <sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Elazar understands the verse in Daniel to indicate that Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya smelled when they emerged from the furnace, but they did not smell like fire. On the basis of the verse here in Song of Songs, he concludes that they emerged smelling like an apple orchard.</i>

Chapter 10

<b>“Your palate is like fine wine that goes pleasantly for my beloved, moving the lips of the sleeping” (Song of Songs 7:10).</b><br>“Your palate is like fine wine.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called the ministering angels, all of them, and He said to them: ‘Go down and kiss the lips of the ancestors of these; just as they took action before Me in fire, <sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was thrown into a fiery furnace for having smashed his father’s idols (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 38:13) and Isaac was willingly bound on the altar, where he thought he would be slaughtered and burned.</i> so too, their descendants took action before Me in fire.’<br>Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called the ministering angels and said to them: ‘Go down and kiss their lips, for had they not accepted My Torah and My dominion at Sinai,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">They did so by uttering with their lips that they would not prostrate themselves to an idol, an act which is proscribed by the second of the Ten Commandments.</i> I would have become the enemy of those who sleep in the Cave of Makhpela.’ “Moving the lips of the sleeping,” Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Toreta said: Even though one is dead, his lips move for him in the grave. What is the source? “Moving the lips of the sleeping.” Shmuel said: It is like a basket of grapes whose liquid flows on its own. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon, one said: Like one who drinks spiced wine, and one said: Like one who drinks aged wine. Even though he drank it already, its taste and its fragrance remains in his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, even after someone dies, the Torah he studied still impacts his mouth, which moves even in the grave.</i>

Chapter 11

<b>“I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me” (Song of Songs 7:11).</b><br>“I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.” There are three desires. The desire of Israel is only for their Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me.” The desire of a woman in only for her husband, as it is stated: “Your desire shall be for your husband” (Genesis 3:16). The desire of the evil inclination is only for Cain and his ilk, as it is stated: “Its desire is for you” (Genesis 4:7).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The desire of rain is only for the earth, as it is stated: “You remember the earth and fulfill its desire, enriching it [<i>tasherena</i>] with abundance” (Psalms 65:10). If you merit it, [He] will enrich it [<i>ta’ashirena</i>], if you do not merit it, [He] will tithe [<i>te’asrena</i>] it, it will produce for you only one-tenth. Another matter, “and his desire [<i>teshukato</i>] is for me,” we are exhausted [<i>tashim</i>], but even though we are exhausted we anticipate and hope for the salvation of the Holy One blessed be He each and every day, and we proclaim the unity of His name twice as we recite: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.” (Deuteronomy 6:4).

Chapter 12

<b>“Come, my beloved, let us go out to the field; let us stay the night in the villages” (Song of Songs 7:12).</b><br>“Come, my beloved, let us go out to the field.” The Divine spirit is shouting and saying: Let us go and stroll in the expanses of the world. “Let us stay the night in the villages [<i>bakefarim</i>],” with those who deny [<i>bakoferim</i>] Him, these are the cities of the nations of the world who denied the existence of the Holy One blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Let us analyze the tranquility of those heretics.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Nevertheless, it is only temporary.

Chapter 13

<b>“Let us arise early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine has blossomed, the grape bud has sprouted, the pomegranates have bloomed; there I will give my love to you” (Song of Songs 7:13).</b><br>“Let us arise early to the vineyards,” these are Israel, as it is stated: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7). “Let us see whether the vine has blossomed,” this is the reciting of <i>Shema</i>; “the grape bud has sprouted,” these are the synagogues and the study halls; “the pomegranates have bloomed,” these are the children who sit and engage in Torah study. “There I will give my love,” there I will develop the righteous men and women, and the prophets and prophetesses who emerge from them.

Chapter 14

<b>“The mandrakes have emitted fragrance, and at our entrance are all types of delicacies, new and old; I have them in store for you, my beloved” (Song of Songs 7:14).</b><br>“The mandrakes have emitted fragrance,” these are the lads of Israel who have not tasted the taste of sin. “And at our entrance are all types of delicacies,” these are the daughters of Israel who have cleaved to their husbands and do not know another man.<br>Another matter, “the mandrakes have emitted fragrance,” Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Levi, Rabbi Yudan said: Come and see how beloved are the mandrakes before He who spoke and the world came into being, as, in the reward of these mandrakes, two great, excellent tribes emerged, and they are the tribe of Issachar and the tribe of Zebulun, as it is stated: “Jacob came from the field in the evening, [and Leah went out to meet him and said: You must come in to me for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes]” (Genesis 30:16). Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar says: This one lost and that one lost, this one was rewarded and that one was rewarded. Leah lost the mandrakes but was rewarded with tribes and burial.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Because she displayed her fondness for lying beside Jacob, she was privileged to be buried beside him in the Cave of Makhpela.</i> Rachel was rewarded with the mandrakes but lost tribes and burial. This one lost and that one lost, this one was rewarded and that one was rewarded. Leah lost the mandrakes, was rewarded with tribes, and lost the birthright.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Ultimately, Joseph supplanted Reuben as the firstborn, as he received the double portion, with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, each becoming independent tribes.</i> Rachel was rewarded with mandrakes, was rewarded with the birthright, and lost tribes.<br>Rabbi Levi said: It is written: “The Lord showed me and behold two baskets [<i>duda’ei</i>] of figs…the one basket was of very good figs” (Jeremiah 24:1–2), this is the exile of Yekhonya. “And the one basket of very bad figs” (Jeremiah 24:2), this is the exile of Zedekiah. If you say that the exile of Yekhonya repented and the exile of Zedekiah did not repent, the verse states: “The mandrakes [<i>haduda’im</i>] have emitted fragrance,” both <i>duda’im</i>, the good and the bad, emitted fragrance.<br>“And at our entrance are all types of delicacies,” the school of Rabbi Sheila and the Rabbis, the school of Rabbi Sheila say: [This is analogous] to an upright woman whose husband left for her few items and little money for expenditures. When her husband returned, she said to him: ‘Look what you left for me and what I preserved for you, and what I added to them for you.’<br>The Rabbis say: [This is analogous] to a king who had an orchard and he entrusted it to a sharecropper. What did that sharecropper do? He filled fig baskets with the fruit of that orchard and he placed them at the entrance to the orchard. When the king would pass, he would see all that goodness. He said: ‘If there is all that goodness at the entrance to the orchard, in the entire orchard, all the more so.’ So, in the early generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the fruit at the entrance to the orchard.</i> there were the members of the Great Assembly, Hillel and Shammai, and Rabban Gamliel the elder. In the later generations<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">This corresponds to the fruit in the entire orchard.</i> there were Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Akiva, and their students all the more so. In their regard it says: “new and old.”<br>“I have them in store for you, my beloved.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You have in store for Me and I have in store for you. You keep mitzvoth and good deeds, and I keep for you in full storehouses more than all the goodness in the world.’ Rabbi Abba bar Kahana bar Yudan said: His are more plentiful than ours. That is what is written: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You, which You have created for those taking refuge in You” (Psalms 31:20).

<b>“If only you were like a brother to me, who suckled the breasts of my mother. I would find you outside; I would kiss you, yet they would not despise me” (Song of Songs 8:1).</b><br>“If only you were like a brother to me” – like what brother? Like Cain to Abel? Cain killed Abel, as it is stated: “Cain arose against Abel his brother, and killed him” (Genesis 4:8). Rather, like Ishmael to Isaac? Ishmael hated Isaac. Rather, like Esau to Jacob? But it is stated: “Esau hated Jacob” (Genesis 27:41). Rather, like Joseph’s brothers to Joseph? They hated him, as it is stated: “His brothers were jealous of him” (Genesis 37:11). Like what brother? “One who suckled the breasts of my mother” – that is to say like Joseph to Benjamin, who loved him wholeheartedly, as it is stated: “Joseph saw Benjamin with them” (Genesis 43:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the story unfolds, the verse states that Joseph wept when he saw Benjamin (Genesis 43:30).</i> <br>“I would find you outside; I would kiss you”; “outside” – this is the wilderness, which is outside the settled area. “I would kiss you” – regarding two brothers who kissed each other, and these are Moses and Aaron, as it is stated: “He went, and he met him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him” (Exodus 4:27).<br>“They would not despise me” – Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident involving two siblings, one of whom was in Meron and one in Gush Ḥalav. The house of the one who lived in Meron caught fire. His sister from Gush Ḥalav came and began hugging, embracing, and kissing him, and saying: This does not demean me, as my brother was in dire straits and was delivered from them.

<b>“I would lead you, would bring you to my mother's house, that you would teach me; I would give you to drink from the spiced wine, from the juice of my pomegranate” (Song of Songs 8:2).</b><br>“I would lead you, would bring you”; “I would lead you” – from the supernal to the earthly.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting this verse as being stated by Israel to God. The meaning of this phrase is that Israel would cause God to descend from heaven to earth, which occurred at the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai.</i> “Would bring you to my mother’s house” – this is Sinai. Rabbi Berekhya said: Why is Sinai called “my mother’s house”? It is because Israel became like newborn babies there.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">They were forgiven for their sins and became like babies who have never sinned (<i>Yefe Kol</i>).</i> “That you would teach me” mitzvot and good deeds. “I would give you to drink from the spiced wine” – these are the great compendia of <i>baraitot</i>, like the compendium of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, the compendium of Rabbi Hoshaya and of bar Kappara, and the teachings of Rabbi Akiva. “From the juice of my pomegranate” – these are the <i>aggadot</i>, which are tasty like a pomegranate. Alternatively, “I would give you to drink from the spiced wine” – this is the Talmud, in which <i>mishnayot</i> are blended like spiced wine. “From the juice of my pomegranate” – these are the vestments of the High Priest, just as it says: “A golden bell and a pomegranate” (Exodus 28:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These were on the hem of the robe of the High Priest.</i>

Chapter 5

<b>“Who is that ascending from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother was in travail with you; there she who bore you was in travail” (Song of Songs 8:5).</b><br>“Who is that ascending from the wilderness” – [Israel’s] ascent was from the wilderness, its decline was from the wilderness, and its death was from the wilderness. That is what it says: “In this wilderness they will expire, and there they will die” (Numbers 14:35). “Leaning [<i>mitrapeket</i>] upon her beloved” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because it will resolve sections of the Torah and issues of kingdom in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mitrapeket</i> when rearranged is a portmanteau of <i>matir perek</i> – resolves a section. In the future, Israel will resolve all questions relating to Torah, and will reestablish its monarchy.</i> “Under the apple tree I roused you” – Pelatyon of Rome expounded and said: Mount Sinai was detached and positioned in the supernal heavens, and Israel was situated beneath it, as it is stated: “You approached and stood beneath the mountain” (Deuteronomy 4:11).<br>Another matter: “Under the apple tree I roused you” – this is Sinai. Why is it likened to an apple tree? Just as the apple tree produces fruit in the month of Sivan, so too, the Torah was given in Sivan. Alternatively, “under the apple tree I roused you” – why not a nut tree or a different tree? Each tree typically grows its leaves first and then its fruit, but the apple tree grows its fruit first and then grows its leaves. Similarly, Israel put performing before hearing, as it is stated: “We will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Although translated here as “heed,” the term <i>nishma</i> can be translated “hear.” The point here is that Israel committed to following God’s commands even before hearing what they were.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you accept My Torah upon yourself, fine, but if not, I will lower this mountain upon you and kill you.’ “There your mother was in travail with you” – was it there that she was in travail? Rabbi Berekhya said: This is analogous to one who went to a dangerous place and was saved. His friend encountered him and said to him: ‘Did you pass through that dangerous place? How much danger you experienced! It is as though you were now borne by your mother. How much suffering you experienced! Now it is as though you were created as a new creation.’<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “There [your mother] was in travail [<i>ḥibela</i>]” and there she had collateral taken from her [<i>ḥubela</i>]; “was in travail” – at the moment that they said: “Everything that the Lord spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). She had collateral taken from her – at the moment that they said to the calf: “This is your God, Israel” (Exodus 32:4), they had collateral taken. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The weapon that was given to Israel at Ḥorev had the ineffable name etched upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated in explanation of the adornment mentioned in the verse: “The children of Israel were stripped of their adornment from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6).</i> When they sinned it was taken from them. Rabbi Aivu and the Rabbis: Rabbi Aivu said: It was peeled on its own. The Rabbis say: An angel descended and peeled it. Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: Wretched is the bride who sins under the wedding canopy. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They lost the good counsel that was given them at Sinai, as it is stated: “You hollowed all my counsel” (Proverbs 1:25), and counsel is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Counsel and resourcefulness are mine” (Proverbs 8:14).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is written: “At Ḥorev you provoked [<i>hiktzaftem</i>] the Lord” (Deuteronomy 9:8). The Holy One blessed be He said: I came to bless you and found your palate pierced and unable to hold a blessing, as it is stated: “Moses saw the people that it was <i>parua</i> (Exodus 32:25), and <i>parua</i> means nothing other than hollowed, just as you say: “You hollowed [<i>vatifre’u</i>] all my counsel” (Proverbs 1:25). Rabbi Levi said: You made the Holy One blessed be He as though He was mourning over you. There are places that call the house of mourning the house of wrath [<i>beit ketzofa</i>].

<b>“Place me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as intense as death, jealousy is as cruel as the grave; its sparks are the sparks of fire, a great conflagration” (Song of Songs 8:6).</b><br>“Place me as a seal” – Rabbi Meir said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, do what You thought in Your heart to do to us,’ as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: When Israel stood before Mount Sinai and said: “We will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), at that moment the Holy One blessed be He called the Angel of Death and said to him: ‘Even though I appointed you chief executioner for the whole world, you are to have no involvement with this nation.’ That is what is written: “It was when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness” (Deuteronomy 5:20). Is there darkness On High? But is it not written: “The light rests with Him” (Daniel 2:22)? What then is “from the midst of the darkness”? This is the Angel of Death, who is called darkness. And it is stated: “The tablets were the work of God and the script was the script of God, engraved [<i>ḥarut</i>] upon the tablets” (Exodus 32:16) – do not read it as engraved [<i>ḥarut</i>], but rather as freedom [<i>ḥerut</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yehuda said: Freedom from the Angel of Death. Rabbi Neḥemya said: Freedom from the [gentile] kingdoms. And the Rabbis say: Freedom from suffering.
Another matter: “Place me as a seal [upon your heart]” – Rabbi Berekhya said: This is the reciting of <i>Shema</i>, as it is stated: “These matters…shall be upon your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6). “As a seal upon your arm” – these are phylacteries, just as it says: “You shall bind them as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8).<br>Rabbi Meir said: “Place me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm” – like Yehoyakhin. As Rabbi Meir said: The Holy One blessed be He took an oath that He would sever the kingdom of the House of David from him. That is what is written: “As I live, the utterance of the Lord, for if Konya son of Yehoyakim,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Konya was another name of Yehoyakhin.</i> king of Judah, would be a signet ring upon My right hand, then from there I would sever you [<i>etkenka</i>]” (Jeremiah 22:24). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: From there I would sever the kingdom of the House of David. Alternatively, it is not written here <i>anatekkha</i>, but rather, “<i>etkenka</i>”;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The expression “I would sever you” is not written with the more common Hebrew term <i>anatekkha</i>, but rather with the word <i>etkenka</i>. This word can also be vocalized <i>atakenkha</i>, which means I will rectify you.</i> I will rectify you [<i>atakenkha</i>] with repentance. From the place of your severance, there will be your rectification.<br>Rabbi Ze’eira said: I heard the voice of Rabbi Yitzḥak as he was sitting and expounding this matter, but I do not know what it was.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I heard him state the aforementioned teaching regarding Yehoyakhin, but I do not know how he derived it.</i> Rabbi Aḥa Arikha said to him: They say that this is it: It is written: “Write this man childless, a man who will not succeed in his days” (Jeremiah 22:30). In his days he will not be successful, but in the days of his son he will be successful, as it is written: “On that day, the utterance of the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubavel son of She’altiel, My servant, the utterance of the Lord, and I will place you like a signet…” (Hagai 2:23).<br>Rabbi Aḥa bar Rabbi Avun bar Binyamin said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa son of Rav Pappi: Great is the power of repentance, as it nullifies the decree and nullifies the oath. Nullifies the decree, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Write this man childless, [a man who will not succeed in his days, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah]” (Jeremiah 22:30), and it is written: “On that day, the utterance of the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubavel son of She’altiel, My servant, the utterance of the Lord, and I will place you like a signet; for I have chosen you, the utterance of the Lord of hosts]” (Hagai 2:23). Nullifies the oath, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “As I live, the utterance of the Lord, for if Konya son of Yehoyakim, king of Judah, would be a signet ring upon My right hand, [then from there I would sever you]” (Jeremiah 22:24). And it is written: “The sons of Yekhonya:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yekhonya is another name for Yehoyakhin.</i> Asir, She’altiel his son…” (I Chronicles 3:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The passage continues by listing Zerubavel, who became governor of Judah, as a descendant of Yekhonya (verse 19). Thus, the oath to end the royal line with Yekhonya was nullified.</i> <br>Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Yirmeya said: Asir, because he was incarcerated in prison;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>asir</i> means prisoner. Yekhonya was imprisoned, and some say that Asir was conceived or even born in prison (see Radak, I Chronicles 3:17).</i> She’altiel, because the kingdom of the House of David was replanted [<i>hushtela</i>] from him. Alternatively, Asir, as the Holy One blessed be He prohibited [<i>asar</i>] Himself by means of an oath;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He took an oath that He would not grant Yekhonya children.</i> She’altiel, because He requested [<i>shaal</i>] from the supernal court and they dissolved His vow.
Rabbi Aivu said: There were two matters that Israel requested of the Holy One blessed be He but they did not request properly, and the prophets arose and corrected them. Israel said: “He will come to us like the rain” (Hosea 6:3). The prophets said to them: ‘You did not request properly, as these rains are an imposition upon the world. Wayfarers suffer from them, seafarers suffer from them, roof repairers suffer from them, wine stompers suffer from them, loaders of the threshing floor suffer from them, one whose cistern is full of water and whose winepress is full of wine suffer from them, and you say: “He will come to us like the rain”?’ The prophets arose and corrected them: “I will be like dew for Israel” (Hosea 14:6). Moreover, Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: “Place me as a seal upon Your heart, as a seal upon Your arm.” The prophets said to them: ‘You did not request properly, as the heart is sometimes visible and sometimes not visible, and its seal is not visible.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The arm is similarly covered at times by one’s garment.</i> What would be proper? “You will be a crown of splendor in the hand of the Lord”’ (Isaiah 62:3).<br>Rabbi Simon ben Kuzit said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Neither you nor your prophets requested properly and appropriately. A king of flesh and blood passes, and the crown falls off his head along with the royal diadem that is upon it. What would be proper? That is what is written: “Behold I have engraved you upon My palms, your walls are always before Me” (Isaiah 49:16). Just as it is impossible for a person to forget his palms, so too, “even these may forget, but I will not forget you”’ (Isaiah 49:15).
“For love is as intense as death” – the love that the Holy One blessed be He has for you is as intense as death. That is what is written: “I have loved you, said the Lord…” (Malachi 1:2). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – when they infuriate the Holy One blessed be He with their idol worship, as it is stated: “They would infuriate Him with strange gods” (Deuteronomy 32:16).<br>Another matter: “For love is as intense as death” – the love that Isaac had for Esau; that is what is written: “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – the jealousy Esau had for Jacob, as it is stated: “Esau hated Jacob [because of the blessing with which his father blessed him]” (Genesis 27:41).<br>Another matter: “For love is as intense as death” – the love that Jacob had for Joseph, as it is stated: “Israel loved Joseph more than his sons” (Genesis 37:3). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – the jealousy that his brothers had for him, as it is stated: “His brothers were jealous of him” (Genesis 37:11).<br>Another matter: “For love is as intense as death” – the love that Jonathan had for David, as it is stated: “Jonathan loved him as himself” (I Samuel 18:1). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – the jealousy that Saul had for David, as it is stated: “Saul eyed David with suspicion” (I Samuel 18:9).<br>Another matter: “For love is as intense as death” – the love that a man has for his wife, as it is stated: “Enjoy life with a woman whom you love” (Ecclesiastes 9:9). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – the jealousy that he has regarding her when he says to her: Do not speak with so-and-so, and she goes and speaks with him, and immediately, “a spirit of jealousy passes over him and he is jealous of his wife” (Numbers 5:14).<br>Another matter: “For love is as intense as death” – the love that the generation of persecution had for the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For we are killed all day long for You” (Psalms 44:23). “Jealousy is as cruel as the grave” – as the Holy One blessed be He is destined to have great zealotry on behalf of Zion. That is what is written: “So said the Lord [of hosts]: I became zealous for Zion with great zealotry” (Zechariah 8:2). “Its sparks are the sparks of fire, a great conflagration” – Rabbi Berekhya said: Like the supernal fire; the fire does not quench water and the water does not extinguish fire.

Chapter 7

<b>“Much water cannot extinguish love, and rivers cannot wash it away; if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be scorned” (Song of Songs 8:7).</b><br>“Much water cannot extinguish love”; “Much water” – these are the nations of the world, as it is stated: “Ah, the uproar of many peoples” (Isaiah 17:12). “Cannot extinguish love” – the love that the Holy One blessed be He has for Israel, as it is stated: “I loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2). “And rivers cannot wash it away” – these are the nations of the world, just as it says: “On that day, the Lord will shave with a great razor those who are from across the River…” (Isaiah 7:20); “therefore, behold, the Lord is raising [upon them] the waters of the River, [mighty and many, the king of Assyria]” (Isaiah 8:7).<br>“If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love” – even if all the nations of the world open all their treasuries and give their money for the sake of one matter of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they would donate all their money in an attempt to gain atonement for causing Israel to fail to fulfill even one mitzva (Rabbi David Luria).</i> they will never thereby gain atonement.<br>Another matter: “If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love” – even if all the nations of the world open all their treasuries and give their money for the sake of one matter of the Torah, and give all their money for the blood of Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they would donate all their money in an attempt to atone for the execution of Rabbi Akiva and others by non-Jewish authorities in times of persecution.</i> they will never thereby gain atonement.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan was strolling and ascending from Tiberias to Tzippori, and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba was next to him. They arrived at a certain agricultural estate. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: ‘This agricultural estate was mine, and I sold it in order to engage in Torah study.’ They arrived at a certain vineyard. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: ‘This vineyard was mine and I sold it in order to engage in Torah study.’ They arrived at a certain olive grove. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: ‘The same is true regarding this.’ Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba began crying. [Rabbi Yoḥanan] said to him: ‘Why are you crying?’ He said to him: ‘I am crying because you did not leave anything for your old age.’ He said to him: ‘Ḥiyya my son, is it inconsequential in your eyes what I did, that I sold something that was given in six days, as it is stated: “For in six days the Lord made” (Exodus 20:11)?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Was it not worthwhile to sell something created in six days in order to gain something far more valuable?</i> But the Torah was given in forty days, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days” (Exodus 34:28), and it is written: “I remained on the mountain forty days”’ (Deuteronomy 9:9).

Chapter 8

<b>“We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day that she will be spoken for?” (Song of Songs 8:8).</b><br>“We have a little sister” – this is Israel. Rabbi Azarya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon: In the future, all the princes of the nations of the world are destined to come and denounce Israel before the Holy One blessed be He and say, ‘Master of the universe, these engaged in idol worship and those engaged in idol worship; these engaged in licentiousness and those engaged in licentiousness; these shed blood and those shed blood. Why, then, are these descending into Gehenna and those are not descending?’<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The nations of the world will ask why they are going to Gehenna and Israel is not, given that they behaved similarly.</i> The Holy One blessed be He will say to them: ‘“We have a little sister” – just as with a child, no matter what he does no one reprimands him; why? Because he is a child. Similarly, to whatever extent Israel is tainted by their iniquities all the days of the year, Yom Kippur comes and atones for them, as it is stated: “For on this day He shall atone for you”’ (Leviticus 16:30).
Rabbi Berekhya interpreted the verse regarding Abraham our patriarch. “We have a little sister [<i>aḥot</i>]” – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham was one [<i>eḥad</i>], and he inherited the land” (Ezekiel 33:24). He united [<i>iḥa</i>] all mankind before the Holy One blessed be He. Bar Kappara said: Like a person who mends [<i>me’aḥeh</i>] a tear. When he was a child,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is based on the word “little” in the verse.</i> he was engaged in mitzvot and good deeds. “And she has no breasts” – he had not yet reached the age of [obligation in] mitzvot and good deeds. “What shall we do for our sister on the day that she will be spoken for” – on the day that the wicked Nimrod decreed and said that [Abraham] would be thrown into the fiery furnace.

Chapter 9

<b>“If she is a wall, we will build upon her a silver turret; and if she is a door, we will affix upon her a cedar panel.

The Holy One blessed be He said: If he stands firm in his convictions like a wall, “we will build upon her a silver turret” – we will rescue him and build him up in this world. “And if she is a door [<i>delet</i>], we will affix upon her a cedar panel” – if he is poor [<i>dal</i>] in mitzvot and sways to and fro in his actions like a door, “we will affix [<i>natzur</i>] upon her a cedar panel” – just as a drawing [<i>tzura</i>] exists only for a short while, so I will stand with him only for a short while.<br>“I am a wall” – Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I am a wall, and I will establish my good deeds like a wall.’ “And my breasts are like towers” – as I am destined to establish factions and groups of righteous men like me in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Abraham’s offspring. The term breasts is used to represent nourishing and raising the offspring.</i> “Then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace” – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Just as you descended into the fiery furnace, so, I will extricate you intact.’ That is what is written: “I am the Lord who took you out of Ur<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ur</i> means fire in Aramaic.</i> of the Chaldeans” (Genesis 15:7).
Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding Sodom and Israel. “We have a [little] sister” (Song of Songs 8:8) – this is Sodom. That is what is written: “Your elder sister is Samaria […and your younger sister…is Sodom]” (Ezekiel 16:46). “And she has no breasts” (Song of Songs 8:8) – it did not suckle mitzvot and good deeds. “What shall we do for our sister on the day” (Song of Songs 8:8) that the supernal court decreed that it will burn in fire, as it is stated: “The Lord rained sulfur and fire on Sodom and on Gomorrah” (Genesis 19:24)?<br>“If she is a wall, we will build upon her” – this is Israel. The Holy One blessed be He said: If Israel stands firm in their deeds like a wall, we will build them up and rescue them. “And if she is a door” – if they sway in their words to and fro like a door, “we will affix [<i>natzur</i>] upon her a cedar panel.” Just as a drawing [<i>tzura</i>] exists only for a short while, so I will stand with him only for a short while.<br>“I am a wall” – Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, we are a wall and we will stand firm like a wall in [performing] mitzvot and good deeds.’ “And my breasts are like towers” – as we are destined to establish factions and groups of righteous men like us in the world. “Then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace” – why? Because all the nations of the world were provoking Israel and saying to them: ‘If so, why did He exile you from His land, and why did He destroy His Temple?’ Israel would respond to them: ‘We are comparable to the daughter of a king who hurries to spend the festival in her father’s home.

The Holy One blessed be He said: If Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya stand firm in their deeds, we will build the world upon them and rescue them. “And if [she is] a door” – if they sway in their deeds to and fro like a door, “we will affix [<i>natzur</i>] upon her a cedar panel.” Just as a drawing [<i>tzura</i>] exists only for a short while, so I will stand with them only for a short while.<br>“I am a wall” – they said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘We will stand firm in mitzvot and good deeds like a wall.’ “And my breasts are like towers” – as we are destined to establish in Your world factions and groups of righteous men like us. “Then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace” – the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Just as you descended into the fiery furnace intact, so I will extricate you intact.’ That is what is written: “Then Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego emerged [from within the fire]” (Daniel 3:26).
The Rabbis interpreted the verse regarding the returning exiles. “We have a little sister” (Song of Songs 8:8) – this is [a reference to] the returning exiles. “Little” – because they were small in number. “And she has no breasts” (Song of Songs 8:8) – these are the five matters that were lacking in the latter Temple relative to the first, and these are: Heavenly fire, anointing oil, the Ark, the Divine Spirit, and the Urim and the Tummim. That is what is written: “I will accept it and be honored [<i>ve’ekaveda</i>]” (Hagai 1:8); <i>ve’ekaveda</i> is written without a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of <i>heh</i> is five.

[Rabbi Ze’eira] said: That ignoramus taught me well.<br>“And if she is a door, we will affix [<i>natzur</i>] upon her a cedar panel” – just as a drawing [<i>tzura</i>], even when it is blurred, its mark is noticeable, so too, even though the Temple was destroyed, Israel did not abrogate its footsteps to their pilgrimages three times a year.<br>“I am a wall” – Rabbi Aivu said: The Holy One blessed be He said: I am destined to become an advocate for Israel among the nations of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The nations question Israel’s connection with God due to the elements lacking in the Second Temple.</i> How is that? This is the Divine voice. That is what is written: “Had the Lord of hosts not left us a remnant” (Isaiah 1:9). It is taught: Once the later prophets, Hagai, Zechariah, and Malachi, died, the Divine Spirit ceased from Israel. Even so, they would avail themselves of the Divine Voice. There was an incident where the Sages gathered to vote in the upper story of Beit Gadya in Jericho. A Divine Voice emerged and said to them: There is among you a man who is worthy of the Divine Spirit, but his generation is not worthy of it. They directed their glance to Hillel the Elder.

When he died, they would say in his regard: How humble, how pious, a disciple of Hillel the Elder.

That is what is written: “I saw among the spoils a fine Babylonian garment” (Joshua 7:21). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: A Babylonian cloak. What was Babylon doing here? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: It was [from] the king of Babylon, and he acquired in Jericho.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">He dispatched his viceroy to reside there.</i> One would send dates to the other, and one would send gifts to the other. That is to say that any king who did not have a representative in the Land of Israel did not perceive himself as a king. “He gave the vineyard to the guards” – this is Nebuchadnezzar. “A man would bring for its fruit a thousand silver pieces” – He brought a man upon His fruit, and he gathered from them a thousand righteous men impeccable in Torah and good deeds. That is what is written: “The craftsmen and the smiths one thousand” (II Kings 24:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the class of spiritual leadership that was exiled with Yehoyakhin eleven years before the destruction of the Temple.</i> The craftsmen were a thousand, and the smiths were a thousand; the Rabbis say: Both together were a thousand.
Another matter: “Vineyard” – this is the Sanhedrin, as we learned there: Rabbi Yishmael testified three matters before the Sages in the vineyard of Yavne.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Eduyot</i> 2:4.</i> Were they sitting in a vineyard? Rather, this is the Sanhedrin, which was configured in rows like a vineyard. “At Baal Hamon” – <i>hamon baal</i>, for they streamed [<i>hamu</i>] after the Baal. Therefore the hordes [<i>hamonot</i>] beset them, and multitudes of angels followed them. That is what is written: “The kings [<i>malkhei</i>] of hosts flee [<i>yidodun</i>], they flee” (Psalms 68:13). Rabbi Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Aivu: It is not written there: “angels [<i>malakhei</i>] of hosts,” but rather “kings [<i>malkhei</i>].” These are the kings of the angels. Even Mikhael and even Gavriel flee again and again. Rabbi Yudan said: “<i>Yidodun</i>” – they were casting [<i>memadedin</i>] letters from among them,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">They were petitioning God not to give the Torah to Israel</i> just as you say: “They cast [<i>yadu</i>] lots over My people” (Joel 4:3). Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Simon said: They prodded them<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>yidodun</i> is interpreted to mean they prodded [<i>yedadun</i>].</i> while going, they prodded them while returning.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">They prodded the Israelites to accept the Torah.</i> Rabbi Aḥava son of Rabbi Ze’eira said: He had them racing, just as it says: “Why are you running, my son…” (II Samuel 18:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The angels raced each other to assist Israel in accepting the Torah, similar to the race described in the verse in Samuel between two individuals who wanted to inform David about the death of Avshalom.</i> <br>What is, “while the fair one at home divides the spoils” (Psalms 68:13)? The fair one in the home, this is the Torah, and you are giving it to him, and it is going to distribute the spoils?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The angels said to God when He was about to give the Torah to Moses: Are you going to give it to him to bring to earth and disseminate among Israel, who will enjoy its heavenly purity?</i> <br>Another matter: “The fair one at home” (Psalms 68:13) – fair one at home, will you distribute the spoils below? The fair one at home, this is Moses, as it is stated: “In all My house he is loyal” (Numbers 12:7); and you give it to him, and he will distribute it as spoils below?<br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Alexandri: It is written: “Lord, our Master, how mighty is Your name throughout the world that You set Your glory in the heavens” (Psalms 8:2). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is not written here, “You set Your glory,” but rather, “that [<i>asher</i>] You set Your glory.” Your glory is in it; Your happiness [<i>ishurakh</i>] is that Your Torah remain in Heaven. He said to them: ‘Its essence will not be achieved in your midst.’<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The angels argued that it would be fitting for the Torah to remain in Heaven. God responded that the Torah is not meant for the angels.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: [This is analogous] to one who had a son with severed fingers. What did he do? He took him to a master weaver to teach him his craft. He began looking at his fingers. He said: The entire essence of this craft is acquired only by means of the fingers. How can this one learn it? That is, its essence will not be achieved in your midst: So too, when the Holy One blessed be He sought to give the Torah to Israel, the ministering angels were prodding Israel away and they were prodding themselves before the Holy One blessed be He and saying: It is Your happiness, it is Your glory, it is Your honor that Your Torah remain in Heaven. He said to them: Its essence will not be achieved in your midst. It is written in it: “If a woman's blood flows for many days” (Leviticus 15:25). Is there a woman among you? That is, its essence will not be achieved in your midst. Moreover, it is written in it: “A person who dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14); is there death among you? That is, its essence will not be achieved in your midst. That is why the verse praises [Moses]: “You ascended On High, you took captives. [You received gifts among men]” (Psalms 68:19). Rabbi Aḥa said: These are the <i>halakhot</i> that are practiced among people, e.g., <i>zavim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">These are men who discharge impure emissions.</i> <i>zavot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">These are women who are impure because they saw an emission of blood not during their period.</i> menstruating women, and birthing mothers. That is, its essence will not be achieved in your midst.<br>The Rabbis say: [This is analogous] to a king who married off his daughter outside his province. The residents of his province said to him: ‘Our lord the king, it is your praise, and it is proper, that your daughter be with you in the province.’ He said to them: ‘Why do you care?’ They said to him: ‘Perhaps tomorrow you will go to her and live near her [in order to be] with her due to your love for her.’ He said to them: ‘I will marry off my daughter outside the province, but I will live with you.’ So too, when the Holy One blessed be He said to give the Torah to Israel, the ministering angels said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, “that You set Your glory” (Psalms 8:2), it is Your happiness, it is Your glory, it is Your praise that Your Torah remain in Heaven.’ He said to them: ‘Why do you care?’ They said to Him: ‘Perhaps tomorrow you will rest Your Divine Presence on the lower worlds.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I give My Torah in the lower worlds, but I reside in the upper worlds. I am giving My daughter with her marriage contract in another province, to be honored with her husband with her beauty and her pleasantness, as she is the daughter of a king and they will respect her, but I will reside with you in the upper worlds.’ Who articulated this? Habakkuk, as it is stated: “His glory covered the heavens, and His praise filled the earth” (Habakkuk 3:3). Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Every place that the Holy One blessed be He rested His Torah, He rested His Divine Presence. Who articulated this? David. That is what is written: “Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is exalted, His glory across earth and heaven” (Psalms 148:13) – first over the earth and thereafter over the heavens.

<b>“My vineyard is before me; the thousand is for you, Solomon, and two hundred for those who guard its fruit” (Song of Songs 8:12).</b><br>“My vineyard is before me” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: [This is analogous] to a king who became angry at his son, and handed him over to his servant. What did [the servant] do? He began beating him with a stick. He said to him: ‘Do not heed your father.’ [The prince] said to him: ‘You great fool, father placed me in your charge only because I would not heed him, and you say to me: Do not heed your father?’ So too, when the iniquities caused the Temple to be destroyed, and Israel was exiled to Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar said to them: ‘Do not heed the Torah of your Father in Heaven, but rather: “Fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made”’ (Daniel 3:15). Israel said to him: ‘You great fool, the Holy One blessed be He placed us in your charge only because we would prostrate ourselves to an image, just as it says: “The images of the Chaldeans engraved with vermilion” (Ezekiel 23:14), and you say to us: “Fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made”? Woe to that man.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: “My vineyard is before me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is Mine, not Nebuchadnezzar’s.</i> That wicked one said before Him: ‘They were one thousand and they diminished here and became two hundred.’<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar argued that the number of those loyal to God had diminished, demonstrating the temporary nature of the Jews’ dedication.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Woe to that wicked one, that putrid drop.

What is the source? “The thousand is for you, Solomon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon [<i>Shlomo</i>] is expounded to have the connotation of complete [<i>shalem</i>].</i><br>Rabbi Ḥiyya son of Rabbi Abba of Yafo said: One who studies Torah with suffering takes one thousand; [one who studies] without suffering takes two hundred as his reward. From whom do you derive this? From the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Naphtali. The tribe of Naphtali, because they would engage in and study Torah with suffering, took a reward of one thousand. That is what is written: “From Naphtali one thousand officials” (I Chronicles 12:35). However, the tribe of Issachar, because they would study Torah without suffering, took a reward of two hundred, as it is stated: “Their heads were two hundred, and all their brethren at their command” (I Chronicles 12:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The members of the tribe of Naphtali would have to travel in order to study Torah, as implied by Jacob’s blessing: “Naphtali is a hind let loose” (Genesis 49:21). This involved suffering. Issachar, on the other hand, would study in their own territory (Rabbi David Luria). Additionally, the sages of Issachar were supported by the tribe of Zebulun, whereas Naphtali did not receive outside support (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 99:9).</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Bon: One who studies Torah not in his place takes a reward of one thousand, and [one who studies] in his place takes a reward of two hundred. From whom do you derive this? From the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Naphtali. The tribe of Naphtali, because they would study Torah not in their place, took a reward of one thousand. That is what is written: “From Naphtali one thousand officials” (I Chronicles 12:35).

Chapter 12

<b>“The one who dwells in the gardens, companions listen to your voice; let me hear it” (Song of Songs 8:13).</b><br>“The one who dwells in the gardens, companions listen to your voice; let me hear it” – Rabbi Natan said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: [This is analogous] to a king who became angry at his servants and incarcerated them in prison cells. What did the king do? He took all of his royal guard and his [other] servants, and they went to hear what they would say. He heard that they were saying: ‘Our lord the king is our praise, he is our life. Let us never lack our lord the king.’ He said to them: ‘My children, raise your voice so that your counterparts who are near you will hear.’ So too, even though Israel are occupied in their labor all six days, on the Shabbat day they rise early, come to the synagogue, recite <i>Shema</i>, pass before the ark,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer leader stands before the ark and recites the communal portion of the prayer service.</i> read the Torah, and recite the <i>haftara</i>. The Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘My children, raise your voice so that the companions who are near you will hear.’ These companions are none other than the ministering angels. And make certain not to hate one another, not to be jealous of one another, not to provoke one another, and not to shame one another, so that the ministering angels will not say before Me: The Torah that You gave to Israel, they do not engage in it; behold, there is enmity, jealousy, hatred, and rivalry between them. Rather, fulfill it in peace.’ Bar Kappara said: Why did He call the ministering angels companions? Because there is no enmity, jealousy, hatred, rivalry, heresy, and divisive words between them.
Another matter: “the one who dwells in the gardens, companions listen” – when [the people of] Israel enter synagogues and recite <i>Shema</i> with devotion, with one voice, and with one mind and thought, the Holy One blessed be He says to them: “The one who dwells in the gardens,” when you call out, “companions,” I and My entourage “listen to your voice; let Me hear it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">When you call out as companions, meaning that you pray as a unified collective, I and My entourage listen (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). Alternatively, God says that when you call out, the companions and I, meaning the ministering angels and I, listen to your voice.</i> But when Israel recites <i>Shema</i> inattentively, one earlier and one later, and they do not recite <i>Shema</i> with devotion, the Divine Spirit shouts and says.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Spirit shouts and says what appears in the following verse.</i>

Chapter 13

<b>“Flee, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young deer on the mountains of spices” (Song of Songs 8:14).</b><br>“Flee, my beloved, and be like a gazelle [<i>tzevi</i>]” – [flee] to the hosts [<i>tzava</i>] On High, who praise Your glory with one voice, in one melody; “on the mountains of spices” – in the upper heavens of heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In this exposition, the midrash has interpreted the verse as directed toward God.</i> <br>Another matter: “Flee, my beloved” – from the Diaspora, in which we are located and are sullied with iniquities. “And be like a gazelle” – render us pure like a gazelle;<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The gazelle is one of the rare undomesticated animals that is “pure,” in the sense that it is permitted to eat it.</i> “or a young deer [<i>haayalim</i>]” – accept our prayers like an offering of goats and rams [<i>eilim</i>]. “On the mountains of spices” – come to have a fine fragrance by the merit of our patriarchs, whose fragrance rises before You like spices. This is the Garden of Eden, which is entirely spices. That is why it is stated: “On the mountains of spices.”<br>Another matter: “The one who dwells in the gardens, companions” (Song of Songs 8:13) – Rabbi Yirmeya [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: If two colleagues debate a matter of <i>halakha</i> and yield to one another in <i>halakha</i>, the verse states in their regard: “Then those who fear the Lord spoke [<i>nidberu</i>] one to another, and the Lord listened and heard” (Malachi 3:16); and <i>dibbur</i> is an expression of nothing other than subduing, as it is stated: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] peoples beneath us” (Psalms 47:4). Moreover, if they were mistaken, The Holy One blessed be He corrects their error for them. What is the source? “The Lord listened and heard,<b> </b>and<b> </b>a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and those who think of His name” (Malachi 3:16). “The Lord… heard and [a book of remembrance] was written” – [this indicates] that He writes it on their hearts, just as it says: “On their heart I will write it” (Jeremiah 31:32). “A book of remembrance [was written] before Him” – that He reminds them of it. For whom? “For those who fear the Lord and those who think of His name.”<br>Rabbi Yudan said: When Israel is reading the Torah in groups,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the similarity of the word groups [<i>ḥavurot</i>] and companions [<i>ḥaverim</i>].</i> “your voice, let me hear it” (Song of Songs 8:13). If not, “flee, my beloved.” Rabbi Zeira said: When Israel recites <i>Shema</i> in unison, with one voice, with one melody, “your voice, let me hear it.” If not, “flee, my beloved.”<br>“Flee, my beloved” – Rabbi Levi said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests. Some of them were eating and drinking and blessing the king, and some of them were eating and drinking and cursing the king. The king sensed it and sought to introduce commotion at his feast and break it up. A noblewoman entered and advocated on their behalf. She said to him: My lord the king: Instead of looking at those who are eating and drinking and cursing you, look at those who are eating and drinking and blessing you and praising your name. So too, when Israel are eating and drinking, blessing, praising, and lauding the Holy One blessed be He, He hears their voices and is appeased. When the nations of the world eat and drink, curse, blaspheme, and scorn the Holy One blessed be He with the licentiousness that they mention, at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He considers even destroying His world. The Torah enters and advocates and says: Master of the universe, instead of looking at those who blaspheme and anger You, look at Your people Israel, who bless, praise, and laud Your great name with Torah, hymns, and praise. The Divine Spirit shouts: “Flee, my beloved”; flee from the nations of the world and cleave to Israel.<br>“And be like a gazelle” – just as this gazelle, while it is sleeping, one of its eyes is open and one of its eyes is closed, so too: when Israel performs the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He looks upon them with His two eyes; that is what is written: “The eyes of the Lord are to the righteous” (Psalms 34:16). But when they do not perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He looks upon them with one of His eyes, as it is stated: “Behold, the eye of the Lord is toward those who fear Him, [toward those who await His mercy, to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine]” (Psalms 33:18–19).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Even when they do not sufficiently fulfill the will of God, He still protects them due to whatever fear of God they still do have, although He does so with “one eye.” He protects them from death and famine but does not grant them abundance.</i> <br>“On the mountains of spices” – Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He said: Wait for Me until I sit in judgment on their mountains, that is, their guardian angels, who are situated with Me in Heaven. That is what is written: “On the mountains of spices.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The word spices [<i>besamim</i>] can also be vocalized to read <i>bashamayim</i>, in Heaven.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Like this: “You shall take for yourself chief spices” (Exodus 30:23) – chief.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The word “chief” in the verse is unnecessary, as the continuation of the verse details exactly which spices should be brought. This indicates that the word spices refers to that which is “chief,” of primary importance. Consequently, the verse in Song of Songs can be understood to refer to the guardian angels of the nations, even without reading <i>besamim</i> and <i>bashamayim</i> (<i>Yefe Kol</i>).</i> Camels bearing gold, and “spices”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on I Kings 10:2, which describes what the Queen of Sheba brought to Solomon, and states that she brought “camels that bore spices and gold.”</i> – gold and spices.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is difficult to understand, and some commentaries suggest that it does not belong in the text (see <i>Yefe Kol</i>). Some suggest that the midrash is highlighting, based on the verse in Kings, that gold and spices are items associated with royalty and greatness. Therefore, the reference to spices in the verse in Song of Songs can refer to the guardian angels of the nations, which represent their ultimate level of power and greatness.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥonya [said] regarding the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The Holy One blessed be He does not exact retribution from a nation below until He humbles its guardian angels above. There are five verses in this regard. One, as it is written: “It will be on that day that the Lord will reckon with the host of the heavens in Heaven” (Isaiah 24:21), and thereafter “with the kings of the earth” (Isaiah 24:21). Two, “how have you fallen from the heavens, shining morning star” (Isaiah 14:12), and thereafter, “you have been felled to the ground” (Isaiah 14:12). Three, “For my sword has been sated in the heavens” (Isaiah 34:5), and thereafter, “it shall descend upon Edom” (Isaiah 34:5). Four, “to bind their kings with fetters” (Psalms 149:8), and thereafter, “and their nobles with iron chains” (Psalms 149:8). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “To bind their kings with fetters” – these are the guardian angels above, “and their nobles with iron chains,” these are the rulers below. Five, “to execute judgment as it is written” (Psalms 149:9), and thereafter, “this is glory for all His devoted ones, Halleluya” (Psalms 149:9).<br>The greatness of Israel is likened to four matters: to the grain harvest, to the grape harvest, to spices, and to a birthing mother. To the grain harvest: When a field is reaped before its time, even its straw is no good, but at its time, it is good. That is what is written: “Extend the scythe, as the harvest is ripe” (Joel 4:13). It is likened to the grape harvest: When a vineyard is harvested before its time, even its vinegar is no good, but at its time, it is good. So too, “sing about it, a vineyard of wine” (Isaiah 27:2) – when the vineyard becomes [ready to produce] wine, pluck it. It is likened to spices: Just as spices that are harvested when they are soft and moist, their fragrance does not diffuse; but when they are dry and are then harvested, their fragrance diffuses. It is likened to a birthing mother: When a woman gives birth before her time, the offspring does not survive. When she gives birth at her time, it lives. Thus, it is written: “Therefore, He will give them up until the time that the birthing mother gives birth” (Micah 5:2). Rabbi Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: “I am the Lord, at its time I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22) – if you do not merit, at its time. If you merit, I will hasten it.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Redemption will come by a particular time, but if Israel merits, it will come sooner.</i> So may it be His will, speedily in our days, amen.
