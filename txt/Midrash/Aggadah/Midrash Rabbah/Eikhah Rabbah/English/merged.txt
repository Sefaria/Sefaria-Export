Eikhah Rabbah

Petichta

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Raise your voice, Bat-Galim, [listen, Layish; destitute is Anatot]” (Isaiah 10:30). Isaiah said to Israel: Instead of reciting songs and psalms before idols, raise your voice in words of Torah, raise your voice in synagogues. “Bat-Galim” – just as these waves [<i>galim</i>] are conspicuous in the sea, so their ancestors were conspicuous in the world.<br>Another matter: “Bat-Galim” (Isaiah 10:30) – <i>bat golim</i>, daughter of exiles: daughter of Abraham, the one of whom it is written: “There was a famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt [to reside there]” (Genesis 12:10); daughter of Isaac, of whom it is written: “Isaac went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar” (Genesis 26:1); daughter of Jacob, of whom it is written: “He went to Padan Aram” (Genesis 28:5). “Listen” (Isaiah 10:30), listen to My commandments, listen to words of Torah, listen to words of prophecy, listen to perform acts of righteousness and good deeds.<br>“Layish [<i>Laisha</i>]” (Isaiah 10:30) – and if not, <i>laisha</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is one of the biblical terms for lion.</i> the lion will ascend upon you. This is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, in whose regard it is written: “The lion has ascended from its lair” (Jeremiah 4:7). “Destitute [is Anatot]” (Isaiah 10:30) – destitute of righteous individuals, destitute of prophecy, destitute of mitzvot<i></i> and good deeds. “Anatot” – and if not,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If you do not listen to all these warnings.</i> “Anatot,” – that resident of Anatot will come and prophesy in your regard, as it is written: “The words of Jeremiah son of Ḥilkiyahu, of the priests who were in Anatot…” (Jeremiah 1:1). When the punishment arrived, he lamented over them, <i>eikha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eikha</i> means “how,” and is the opening word of the book of Lamentations, which begins: “How does the city that was full of people sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1). <i>Eikha</i> is also the Hebrew name of the book of Lamentations. The prologue to <i>Eikha Rabba</i> records how different Sages would begin their study of Lamentations. They would often begin by expounding a verse that in their view encapsulated the essence of the book, before beginning with the first verse. Thus, many of these introductions conclude with the word <i>eikha</i>, which is used as an expression of lamentation, as well as a reference to Lamentations 1:1 and a transition from the Sage’s introduction to his actual recitation or study of Lamentations (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>
Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Who is the wise man who will understand this…” (Jeremiah 9:11). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: If you have seen towns uprooted from their place in the Land of Israel, know that they did not provide the salaries of the Bible teachers and the Mishna teachers, as it is stated: “For what reason did the land perish.… The Lord said: Because they have forsaken My Torah” (Jeremiah 9:11–12).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] would dispatch Rabbi Asi and Rabbi Ami to go out and establish [educational programs] in the cities of Israel. They would enter the city and say to [the residents]: ‘Bring us the guardians of the city.’ They would bring them the head of the city watch and the police. They would say to them: ‘Are these the guardians of the city? These are the destroyers of the city.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is because the people rely on them for their security and do not place their trust in God.</i> [The residents] would say to them: ‘Who are the guardians of the city?’ They would say to [the residents]: ‘They are the Bible teachers and the Mishna teachers, who contemplate, review, and observe the Torah day and night, because it is stated: “You shall contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8), and it says: “If the Lord does not build a house…[if the Lord does not guard a city, in vain does the watchman keep vigil]”’ (Psalms 127:1).<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yitzḥak: We have found that the Holy One blessed be He overlooked idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed, but did not overlook disdain of the Torah, as it is stated: “For what reason did the land perish?” (Jeremiah 9:11). It is not written here that it was due to idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is despite the fact that the generation in which the First Temple was destroyed was considered to have been derelict regarding these very grave sins; see <i>Yoma</i> 9b.</i> rather, “Because they have forsaken My Torah” (Jeremiah 9:12).<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: It is written: “They have forsaken Me and did not observe My Torah” (Jeremiah 16:11). If only they had forsaken Me and observed My Torah. By engaging in it, the light that is in it would have returned them to the good [path].<br>Rav Huna said: Study Torah even if it is not for its own sake, as through doing so not for its own sake, one comes to do so for its own sake. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Each and every day a Divine Voice emerges from Mount Ḥorev and says: Woe unto the people due to the affront to Torah.<br>Shmuel taught it in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ami: When does the kingdom issue a decree<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A decree against the Jews.</i> and the decree is effective? When Israel casts the words of Torah to the ground; that is what is written: “A host was given for the continual offering for transgression; [it cast truth to the ground, and it acted and succeeded]” (Daniel 8:12). “Host” is nothing other than kingdoms, as it is stated: “The Lord will reckon with the host of heaven in heaven [and with the kings of the earth on the earth]” (Isaiah 24:21). “The continual offering” – this is Israel, as it is written: “You shall contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8). “For transgression” – this is the transgression of Torah. Whenever Israel casts the words of Torah to the ground, the kingdom issues a decree and it is effective, as it is stated: “It cast truth to the ground…,” and “truth” is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Acquire truth and do not sell” (Proverbs 23:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In context, this verse refers to Torah.</i> If you cast the words of Torah to the ground, the kingdom succeeds immediately; that is what is written: “And it acted and succeeded.” Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: “Israel has forsaken good…” (Hosea 8:3), and good is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good lesson, [My Torah, do not forsake it]” (Proverbs 4:2).<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: No philosophers arose for the nations of the world like Bilam ben Beor and Avnimus the weaver. They said to them:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The nations of the world said to the philosophers.</i> ‘Are we able to successfully challenge this nation?’ They said to them: ‘Go and visit their synagogues; if the children are reciting aloud, you will be unable to overcome them, but if not, you will be able to overcome them, for this is what their patriarch promised them when he said to them: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (Genesis 27:22): As long as the voice of Jacob is in the synagogues and the study halls, the hands are not the hands of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">War with Israel will be futile.</i> But, when his voice is not reciting in the synagogues and the study halls, the hands are the hands of Esau.’ So, it says: “Therefore, just as straw consumes a tongue of fire, [and a flame destroys stubble, their root will become rot and their blossom will rise like dust; for they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts, and they have scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel]” (Isaiah 5:24). Does straw consume fire? Is it not the way of fire to consume straw, and yet it states: “Therefore, just as straw consumes a tongue of fire.” Rather, “straw” – this is the house of Esau, as it is stated: “The house of Jacob will be fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for straw” (Obadiah 1:18). “A tongue of fire” – this is the house of Jacob; “and a flame destroys stubble” – this is the house of Joseph; “their root will become rot” – these are the patriarchs, who are the roots of Israel; “and their blossom will rise like dust” – these are the tribes, who are the blossoms of Israel. Why? “For they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts…” Rabbi Yudan said: “For they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts” – this is the written Torah; “and they have scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel” – this is the Oral Torah. When they cast the words of Torah to the ground, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.<br>“So said the Lord of hosts: Attend, and call for the lamenting women” (Jeremiah 9:16). Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two sons. He grew angry at the first, took the rod, struck him, and exiled him. He said: Woe unto him, from what tranquility was he exiled. He grew angry at the second, took the rod, struck him, and exiled him. He said: It is I whose culture is faulty. So too, the ten tribes were exiled, and the Holy One blessed be He began saying this verse in their regard: “Woe unto them, as they have strayed from Me” (Hosea 7:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He placed the blame on them.</i> When Judah and Benjamin were exiled, the Holy One blessed be He said, as it were: “Woe is Me, for My hurt” (Jeremiah 10:19).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two sons. He grew angry at the first, took the rod, struck him, and he convulsed and died. He began lamenting him. He grew angry at the second, took the rod, struck him, and he convulsed and died. He said: I no longer have the strength to lament them; rather, call the lamenting women, and they will lament them. So too, the ten tribes were exiled, and the Holy One blessed be He began lamenting them: “Hear this matter that I recite as a lamentation for you, house of Israel” (Amos 5:1). When Judah and Benjamin were exiled, the Holy One blessed be He said, as it were: I no longer have the strength to lament them. That is what is written: “Call for the lamenting women…and let them hasten and take up wailing over us, [and our eyes will shed tears, and our eyelids will flow with water]” (Jeremiah 9:16–17). It is not written here, “over them,” but rather, “over us,” Me and them. It is not written here, “and their eyes will shed tears,” but rather, “our eyes,” Mine and theirs. It is not written here, “and their eyelids will flow with water,” but rather, “our eyelids,” Mine and theirs.<br>The Rabbis say: [This is analogous] to a king who had twelve sons. Two died, and he began taking solace with the [remaining] ten. Two more died, and he began taking solace with eight. Two died, and he began taking solace with six. Two died, and he began taking solace with four. Two died, and he began taking solace with two. When they all died, he began lamenting them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “I did not sit in the company of revelers and rejoice” (Jeremiah 15:17) – The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe: I have never entered the theaters and the circuses of the nations of the world and played and rejoiced with them.<br>“Because of Your hand I sat solitary” (Jeremiah 15:17) – the hand of Pharaoh touched me, and I did not sit solitary. The hand of Sennacherib touched me, and I did not sit solitary. When Your hand touched me, I sat solitary: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Abbahu began: “But they, like men [<i>ke’adam</i>], have violated the covenant” (Hosea 6:7) – this is Adam the first man. The Holy One blessed be He said: I brought Adam the first man into the Garden of Eden, I commanded him, and he violated My command. I sentenced him to banishment and expulsion, and I lamented him with <i>eikha</i>. I brought him into the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “He placed him in the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 2:15). I commanded him, as it is stated: “The Lord God commanded the man saying.… [but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat]” (Genesis 2:16–17). He violated My command, as it is stated: “Have [you eaten] from the tree from which I commanded you [not to eat?]” (Genesis 3:11). I sentenced him to banishment, as it is stated: “He banished the man” (Genesis 3:24). I sentenced him to expulsion, as it is stated: “The Lord [God] sent him from the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:23). I lamented him with <i>eikha</i>, as it is stated: “He said to him: Where are you [<i>ayeka</i>]” (Genesis 3:9); it is written <i>eikha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ayeka</i> and <i>eikha</i> are each spelled <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>kaf</i>, <i>heh</i>. Thus, it is as though God used the word <i>eikha</i>, how, regarding Adam, as if to say: How did this come to be, just as the first word of Lamentations is how [<i>eikha</i>].</i><br>His descendants, too, I brought into the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “I brought you into a fruitful land” (Jeremiah 2:7). I commanded them, as it is stated: “Command the children of Israel” (Leviticus 24:2). They violated My command, as it is stated: “All Israel has violated your Torah” (Daniel 9:11). I sentenced them to banishment, as it is stated: “From My house I will banish them” (Hosea 9:15). I sentenced them to expulsion, as it is stated: “Send them from My presence and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). I lamented them with: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Therefore, so said the Lord [God]: Woe, city of bloodshed, [the pot whose filth is in it, and its filth has not gone out of it. Take it out piece by piece; no lot has been drawn over it]” (Ezekiel 24:6) – woe to the city in which blood has been shed. “The pot whose filth is in it” – whose filth is in it;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is translating the Hebrew phrase into Aramaic, which was the commonly spoken language when the midrash was composed.</i> “and its filth has not gone out of it” – its filth has not gone out of it; “take it out piece by piece” – they would be exiled in increments.<br>How were they exiled? Rabbi Elazar says: The tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad were exiled first. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali were exiled first; that is what is written: “The first [<i>ka’et</i>] has dealt lightly with the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali” (Isaiah 8:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “has dealt lightly” is interpreted to mean lightened the population by exiling these tribes.</i> How does Rabbi Elazar interpret the verse of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Like the time [<i>ka’et</i>] that the tribes of Reuben and Gad were exiled, so were the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali exiled. “But the latter has dealt severely [<i>hikhbid</i>]” (Isaiah 8:23) – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He dragged them as with a broom [<i>makhbid</i>]. That is what is written: “I will sweep it with a broom of destruction” (Isaiah 14:23).<br>“No lot has been drawn over it” (Ezekiel 24:6) – Rabbi Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: What is “no lot has been drawn over it”? The Holy One blessed be He said: When I drew lots over the nations of the world to exile them, they were not exiled. Why, then, were you exiled? “For its blood was within it” (Ezekiel 24:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the blood of Zekharia, the High Priest and prophet who was killed in the Temple, as the midrash will discuss.</i> Why to that extent? It was “to arouse fury” (Ezekiel 24:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">They left the blood of Zekharia uncovered in order to arouse God’s fury.</i><br>Rabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Aḥa, he said to him: Where did Israel kill Zekharia, in the Israelite courtyard or in the women’s courtyard? He said to him: Neither in the Israelite courtyard nor in the women’s courtyard, but rather in the priestly courtyard. And they did not treat his blood like the blood of a deer nor like the blood of a gazelle. Regarding the blood of a gazelle and the blood of a deer it is written: “He shall pour out its blood and cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). But here it is written: “For its blood was within it; on a bare rock it placed it. It did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dirt” (Ezekiel 24:7).<br>Another matter: “Therefore, so said the Lord [God]: Woe, city of bloodshed” (Ezekiel 24:9) – woe to the city in which blood has been spilled. “I too will increase the conflagration” (Ezekiel 24:9) – I will increase the punishment. “Increase the wood” (Ezekiel 24:10) – these are the legions; “ignite the fire” (Ezekiel 24:10) – these are the kings; “consume the flesh” (Ezekiel 24:10) – this is the public. “Blend the mixture” (Ezekiel 24:10) – Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Neḥemya said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Because all Israel were saying: Nebuchadnezzar has gathered all the wealth in the world, and he needs our wealth?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">They assumed that Nebuchadnezzar would have no reason to attack them and they would remain safe.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: As you live, I will render your wealth dear to him like those spices that are served at a feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary to burn incense at the end of a feast. Although all the food had already been consumed, this was considered a significant and desirable addition. Similarly, Nebuchadnezzar will seek your wealth in addition to all he has already amassed (Maharzu).</i> “The bones will be charred” (Ezekiel 24:10) – you find that when Israel were exiled, their bodies became heated like a spiced dish.<br>“Place it empty upon its coals” (Ezekiel 24:11) – Rabbi Elazar said: Had it been stated [that it was] broken, there could have been no remedy forever, but it says “empty,” and any empty vessel will ultimately be filled. Why to that extent? <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Why was Israel made to suffer so much?</i> “So that it will be heated and its bottom will burn, [and its impurity] will be melted within it, [that its filth may be consumed]” (Ezekiel 24:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God carried out all this punishment in order to ultimately purify Israel rather than to destroy Israel.</i> Because they sinned they were exiled, and once they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Ephraim will be desolation” (Hosea 5:9). When? “On the day of rebuke [<i>tokheḥa</i>]”<b> </b>(Hosea 5:9), the day when the Holy One blessed be He is destined to contend [<i>lehitvake’aḥ</i>] with them in judgment. You find that when the Ten Tribes were exiled, Judah and Benjamin were not exiled. The Ten Tribes were saying: Why did He exile us and He did not exile them? It is because they are residents of His palace. Is there, perhaps, partiality here? Heaven forbid, there is no partiality here. Rather, they had not yet sinned; and when they sinned, He exiled them. The Ten Tribes said: This is our God, this is our God. This is mighty, this is mighty, this is truth, this is truth, and He does not show favor even to members of His household. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Its gates will lament and mourn” (Isaiah 3:26) – lamenting from within, mourning from without; “its gates” – the first destruction and the second destruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the first and second Temples.</i> “It will be emptied” (Isaiah 3:26) – empty of words of Torah, empty of words of prophecy, empty of the righteous, empty of mitzvot<i></i> and good deeds. Therefore, “it will sit on the ground” (Isaiah 3:26) – “the elders…sit on the ground and keep silent…” (Lamentations 2:10).
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “For the sound of wailing is heard from Zion: How have we been plundered?” (Jeremiah 9:18) – is there wood that cries, are there stones that cry, that it says: “The sound of wailing is heard from Zion”? Rather, it was from the One who rests His Divine Presence in Zion. “How have we been plundered?” – how is it that plunderers have come upon us? “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land” (Jeremiah 9:18) – this is the Land of Israel, as it is written: “A land that the Lord your God seeks” (Deuteronomy 11:12). “And they have cast down our dwellings” (Jeremiah 9:18) – these are the synagogues and the study halls.<br>Another matter: “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land [<i>aretz</i>]” – these are the words of Torah, just as it says: “Its measure is longer than the earth [<i>eretz</i>]” (Job 11:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is understood as referring to the Torah.</i> “And they have cast down our dwellings” – these are the synagogues and the study halls.<br>Another matter: “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land [<i>aretz</i>]” – this is the Temple, just as it says: “From the foundation in the ground [<i>haaretz</i>] to the lower ledge” (Ezekiel 43:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the Temple.</i> “And they have cast down our dwellings” – through the destruction of the First Temple and the destruction of the Second Temple. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “We are ashamed, for we heard disgrace; humiliation covered our faces, as strangers came upon the sanctuaries of the House of the Lord” (Jeremiah 51:51). You find that when the enemies entered Jerusalem, Amonites and Moavites entered with them, as it is stated: “The besieger spread his hand over all its delights; for it saw the nations entering its Sanctuary, whom You had commanded that they should not enter Your assembly” (Lamentations 1:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the Amonites and Moavites it is written: “An Amonite or a Moavite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4).</i> They entered the Holy of Holies and found there two cherubs. They took them, placed them in a cage, and were circulating it in the streets of Jerusalem and saying: Did you not say that this nation does not engage in idol worship? Look at what we found of theirs and what they were worshipping. All faces are the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">They are like other nations in that they, too, worship idols.</i> That is what is written: “Because Moav and Seir say: Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations” (Ezekiel 25:8). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He took an oath that He will completely exterminate them from the world, as it is stated: “Therefore, as I live, the word of the Lord of hosts, God of Israel, Moav will be like Sodom and the children of Amon like Gomorrah” (Zephaniah 2:9). When they sinned<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to the Israelites.</i> they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting in their regard, <i>eikha</i>.<br>Another matter: “We are ashamed, for we heard disgrace (Jeremiah 51:51), this is the seventeenth of Tammuz. “Humiliation covered our faces” (Jeremiah 51:51) – this is the ninth of Av. “As strangers came upon the sanctuaries of the House of the Lord” (Jeremiah 51:51) – the first destruction and the second destruction. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting in their regard, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “But you did not call Me, Jacob, for you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). Rabbi Yoḥanan understood this from this verse: “A prophecy of Damascus: Behold, Damascus is removed from being a city, and it will be a heap of ruins. Abandoned are the cities of Aroer” (Isaiah 17:1–2). He is standing in Damascus and mentions Aroer, but is Aroer not within the boundaries of Moav?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Damascus is in the territory of ancient Aram, whereas Aroer is in Moav.</i> Rather, there were three hundred and sixty-five houses of idol worship in Damascus, and each and every one of them they would worship one day, and they had one day on which they would worship all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">There were 365 idols, each with its own house of worship. The people of Damascus would dedicate one day a year to worship each of them. There was also one day per year when they would worship all of the idols. Aroer is mentioned with Damascus because even the gods of Amon were worshipped in Damascus.</i> Israel made all of them a joint deity and worshipped them, as it is written: “The children of Israel continued to do what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they worshipped the Be’alim, the Ashtarot, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Amon, and the gods of the Philistines; they forsook the Lord and did not worship Him” (Judges 10:6), even together with other gods. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Shall the wife of a priest not be like an innkeeper?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The wife of the priest is distinguished whereas the innkeeper is considered lowly. This is a parable which means: Shall the Holy One blessed be He be regarded any less than the idols?</i><br>Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: If only My children had treated Me like a dessert that is served last.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina says, speaking from the perspective of God: If only Israel had worshipped me at all, even just as the conclusion of their idolatrous services.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: This is analogous to a king’s servant who made a feast and invited his whole circle of friends, but did not invite his master. The king said: If only my servant had made me the equal of his circle of friends. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: If only My children had made Me like a dessert that is served last. Rather, “but you did not call Me, Jacob” (Isaiah 43:22). You stand and engage in business all day and do not grow weary, but to pray before Me you are weary. He stands and engages in business all day and does not grow weary, but when his friend says to him: Come and pray, he says: I cannot. Regarding Baal what is written? “They called in the name of the Baal from morning until noon, saying: Baal, answer us. But there was neither sound nor response. They danced near the altar that they had made” (I Kings 18:26). That is, “but you did not call Me, Jacob” – if only I had not known you, Jacob. Why? “For you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22).<br>“You did not bring Me the sheep of your burnt offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – the two daily offerings that they would sacrifice each day, as it is stated: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon” (Numbers 28:4). “And you did not honor Me with your offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – these are the offerings of the most sacred order. “I have not burdened you with a meal offering” (Isaiah 43:23) – this is the handful from the meal offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">A handful is taken from each meal offering and burned on the altar.

Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joy and with gladness of heart, due to abundance of everything, you will serve your enemies…” (Deuteronomy 28:47–48) – had you been worthy, you would have read in the Torah: “You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance” (Exodus 15:17), but now that you are not worthy, you read: “Let all their evil come before You [and do to them as You did to me]” (Lamentations 1:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The term “You will bring them” in the verse in Exodus and the word “come” in the verse in Lamentations have the same root: <i>tav, bet, alef</i>.</i><br>Had you been worthy, you would have read in the Torah: “Peoples heard, they were agitated” (Exodus 15:14), but now that you are not worthy, you read: “They heard that I am sighing” (Lamentations 1:21).<br>Had you been worthy, you would have read in the Torah: “I have seen the affliction of My people that is in Egypt” (Exodus 3:7), but now that you are not worthy, you read: “See, Lord, for I am in distress, my innards burn” (Lamentations 1:20).<br>Had you been worthy, you would have read in the Torah: “You shall proclaim on this very day” (Leviticus 23:21), but now that you are not worthy, you read: “I called my lovers;

Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa began: “As one who removes a garment on a cold day, and as vinegar on natron, so is one who sings songs to a sorrowful heart” (Proverbs 25:20). Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yonatan, both of them say: To what were the Ten Tribes and the tribes of Judah and Benjamin comparable? To two people who were covered with a new garment during the rainy season;<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In Israel, winter is the rainy season; thus, it rains only when it is cold.</i> this one was pulling the garment from here, and that one was pulling the garment from there, until they ripped it. So too, the Ten Tribes did not cease engaging in idol worship in Samaria, and the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were engaging in idol worship in Jerusalem, until they caused Jerusalem to be destroyed.<br>Another matter: “As one who removes a garment on a cold day” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon: Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: On the day that Nebuchadnezzar waged war against Israel, he removed from them two garments, the priestly garments and royal garments. “On a cold [<i>kara</i>] day” – because they had called [<i>shekare’u</i>] to the calf: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). “Vinegar on natron” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Yehoshua said: [This is analogous] to one who had a wine cellar. He checked the first barrel and found it to be vinegar; the second, and he found it to be vinegar; the third, and he found it to be vinegar. He said: This indicates that it is all bad. “So is one who sings songs to a sorrowful heart” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Berekhya said: As much as one sings it will not enter the ear of the dancer; as much as one sings, the foolish son does not listen.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The foolish son does not accept rebuke.</i><br>Another matter: “As one who removes a garment on a cold day” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Simon said: On the day that Nebuchadnezzar waged war against Israel, he removed from them two garments, the priestly garments and royal garments. “On a cold [<i>kara</i>] day” – like that which is written: “And it was that when He called [<i>kara</i>] and they did not listen” (Zechariah 7:13). “Vinegar on natron” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: Like one who places vinegar on natron and breaks it [<i>vesotero</i>], so they would refute the words of the Torah. That is what is written: “They would insult [<i>soterim</i>] the messengers of God” (II Chronicles 36:16). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Like a cow that licks up [food] with its mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When a cow eats, it drools, is messy, and renders the rest of its feed revolting. Similarly, when they would discuss Torah, what emerged from their mouths disgraced the Torah and rendered it unpalatable.</i> “So is one who sings songs to a sorrowful heart” (Proverbs 25:20) – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The cynics of the generation would mutter with their mouths, hint with their eyes, indicate with their fingers, and say: “The vision that he envisions is for many days, and for distant times he prophesies” (Ezekiel 12:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet warned the nation of impending doom, but the people discounted the warnings and assumed that any negative events would still be far off.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to them: As you live, “for in your days, rebellious house, [will I speak the word and perform it] (Ezekiel 12:25). Immediately, “He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he killed their young men by the sword…” (II Chronicles 36:17). And it is written: “He burned the House of the Lord” (II Kings 25:9) – this is the Temple; “and the king's palace” (II Kings 25:9) – this is Zedekiah’s palace; “and all the houses of Jerusalem” (II Kings 25:9) – Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: There were four hundred and eighty synagogues in Jerusalem, not including the Temple. From where is that derived? That is the numerical value of “<i>mele’ati</i>” (Isaiah 1:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem</i> – 40; <i>lamed</i> – 30; <i>tav</i> – 400; <i>yod</i> – ten = 480.

Vespasian ascended against all of them and destroyed them. “And every great house” (II Kings 25:9) – this is the study hall of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai. Why does he call it a “great house”? It is because they relate the praise of the Holy One blessed be He there. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa began: “A battering ram, a sword, and a sharp arrow…” (Proverbs 25:18). “A battering ram [<i>mefitz</i>]” – as in, “the Lord will scatter you [<i>vehefitzḥa</i>] among all the peoples” (Deuteronomy 28:64); “a sword” – as in, “I will unsheathe the sword after you” (Leviticus 26:33); “and a sharp arrow” – as in, “when I send the [evil] arrows of famine” (Ezekiel 5:16). All this for whom? For “a man who bears false witness against his friend” (Proverbs 25:18) – that is Israel, who responded and said: “This is your God, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). “A loose tooth and an unsteady foot…” (Proverbs 25:19) – Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, when You came to shepherd us, our tooth consumed and crushed others. Why then is the grazing tooth consuming us and the foot is trampling us? It is due to the confidence [we placed] in idolatry, because we betrayed our Rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the continuation of the verse cited above: “Is trust in a traitor on a day of trouble” (Proverbs 25:19).</i> “As one who removes a garment on a cold [<i>kara</i>] day” (Proverbs 25:20) – “and it was that when He called [<i>kara</i>] and they did not listen” (Zechariah 7:13).<br>Another matter: “[Confidence in an unfaithful man in a time of trouble is like] a loose tooth and an unsteady foot” (Proverbs 25:19) – a tooth that undermines and a foot that gives way. The Holy One blessed be He said: I said to Israel: ‘Betray idol worship and put your trust in Me,’ but they did not do so; rather, they betrayed Me and put their trust in idol worship. That is what is written: “They say to wood: You are my father” (Jeremiah 2:27). When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa began: “A wise man judged with a foolish man, he is wrathful or amused, but there is no satisfaction” (Proverbs 29:9) – Rabbi Simon said: Anyone who judges [<i>dan</i>] the fool, he himself is judged.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Many interpret the term <i>dan</i> here to mean rebukes, such that the sentence means: Whoever rebukes a fool is deserving of rebuke.</i> That is what is written: “A wise man judged”; it is not written “judges,” but rather “judged.”<br>Another matter: “A wise man judged” (Proverbs 29:9) – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He is wise of heart and mighty of power” (Job 9:4). “With a foolish man” (Proverbs 29:9) – this is Israel, as it is stated: “My people is foolish” (Jeremiah 4:22). “He is wrathful or amused” (Proverbs 29:9) – I have been wrathful but there is no satisfaction; I have been amused, but there is no satisfaction. I have been wrathful at you during the reign of Pekaḥ ben Remalyahu, as it is stated: “Pekaḥ ben Remalyahu killed [in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day]” (II Chronicles 28:6). I have been amused with you during the reign of Amatzyahu,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This means that God was happy with them and therefore allowed them to destroy their enemies.</i> as it is stated: “Amatzyahu took courage, and led his people, and went to the Valley of Salt” (II Chronicles 25:11). What is the Valley of Salt? It is beneath the boulders [<i>kefei</i>] of salt [<i>melaḥ</i>], [or] into the throes [<i>kefuyei</i>] of battle [<i>milḥama</i>]. “The children of Judah captured ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them [from the top of the rock, and all of them were broken]” (II Chronicles 25:12) – at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: I decreed death for the descendants of Noah only by sword, and these “brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them…and all of them were broken”? “But there is no satisfaction” – at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: What are these doing here? Let them be exiled. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa began: “One who admonishes a cynic takes disgrace upon himself” (Proverbs 9:7). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who produces a wicked disciple will ultimately be disgraced by him, as it is stated: “One who admonishes a cynic takes disgrace upon himself.” This is the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who produces a wicked disciple in the Land of Israel it is as though he produces a robber, and outside of the Land of Israel [it is as though] he produces a slave. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is written: “Refraining from a quarrel is honor for a man” (Proverbs 20:3) – the Holy One blessed be He said: It would have been honorable for Me had I not engaged with this nation. You find that when Israel was exiled among the nations, the Holy One blessed be He was circulating among the doorways of the nations of the world to hear what they were saying. What were they saying? The God of this nation exacted retribution from Pharaoh, from Sisera, and from Sennacherib, and the like. But then they say: Is He forever young? As it were, the matters have gotten old.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">He no longer has the strength to punish us like He punished them.</i> That is what is written: “They came [<i>vayavo</i>] to the nations to which they came, and they profaned My holy name” (Ezekiel 36:20). The verse should have said <i>vayavo’u</i>, but it says “<i>vayavo</i>”;<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The verse uses the singular term <i>vayavo</i>, which is ordinarily translated “he came,” rather than the plural term <i>vayavo’u</i>.</i> it is as though it was He Himself.

If “these are the people of the Lord” (Ezekiel 36:20), why is it that “they went out from His land” (Ezekiel 36:20)?<br>Another matter: “Admonishes” (Proverbs 9:7) – this is Jeremiah. “Cynic” (Proverbs 9:7) – this is his generation. “Takes disgrace upon himself” (Proverbs 9:7) – as they would curse him, as it is written: “I did not demand repayment, and others did not demand repayment from me, yet everyone curses me” (Jeremiah 15:10). “And rebukes the wicked for his shortcomings” (Proverbs 9:7) – he would rebuke Israel and say in their regard, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Abbahu began: “Your path and your deeds have done these to you…” (Jeremiah 4:18). When is it praiseworthy for a king to provide for his legions, in the wilderness or in the settlement?<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Where can a king more adequately provide for his army.</i> Is it not in the settlement? Regarding the wilderness, it is written: “Behold, I am raining bread for you from the heavens” (Exodus 16:4), and here it is written: “Young children request bread…” (Lamentations 4:4). Regarding the wilderness, it is written: “Behold, He struck the rock and water flowed” (Psalms 78:20), and here it is written: “The tongue of the nursling cleaves to his palate from thirst” (Lamentations 4:4). Regarding the wilderness it is written: “He spread a cloud like a curtain” (Psalms 105:39), and here it is written: “Their skin is shriveled on their bones” (Lamentations 4:8). Who did this to you? It is “your path and your deeds,” your evil path and your rebellious deeds. “This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, as it has reached until your heart” (Jeremiah 4:18) – this is the Great Sanhedrin as they are called the heart of Israel, as it is written: “My heart is to the lawmakers of Israel” (Judges 5:9). When they provoke Me, My heart is not to the lawmakers of Israel. The Holy One blessed be He said: “As it has reached until your heart” – this is the Temple, just as it says: “My eyes and My heart will be there always” (II Chronicles 7:16). Alternatively, “as it has reached until your heart” – this is the Holy One blessed be He. Where have we found that the Holy One blessed be He is called the heart of Israel? It is from this verse: “God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever” (Psalms 73:26).
Rabbi Abbahu began: “Those who sit at the gate talk about me” (Psalms 69:13) – these are the nations of the world, who sit in theaters and circuses. “I am the subject of songs by ale drinkers” (Psalms 69:13) – after they sit, eat, drink, and become intoxicated, they sit, speak about me, mock me, and say: So that we will not need to eat carobs like the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We have eaten as much as we like, unlike the Jews who are poor and must eat carobs. Alternatively, this sentence can be translated to mean: We will not be destroyed like the Jews (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> They would say to each other: How many years do you want to live? They would say: Like the Shabbat garment of the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Jews would wear their Shabbat clothes for many years.

They would say to each other: Why is this one’s head shaved? He would say: These Jews are Shabbat observers, and everything for which they exert themselves all the days of the week, they eat on Shabbat. They do not have wood with which to cook, and they break their beds and cook with them. They sleep on the ground and become covered with dirt, and they smear themselves with oil. Therefore, the oil is expensive.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">They cannot afford oil to shampoo their hair, so they shave it.</i><br>Another matter: “Those who sit at the gate talk about me” (Psalms 69:13) – these are Israel, who sit in the synagogues and study halls. “I am the subject of songs by ale drinkers” (Psalms 69:13) – after they sit, eat, drink, and become intoxicated at the feast prior to the ninth of Av, they sit and recite elegies, dirges, and Lamentations.
Rabbi Avin began: “He satiated me with bitterness” (Lamentations 3:15) – on the night of the first festival day of Passover. “Inundated me with wormwood” (Lamentations 3:15) – on the ninth of Av. From that with which He satiated me on the night of the first festival day of Passover,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">It is a mitzva to eat bitter herbs on the first night of Passover.</i> He inundated me on the eve of the ninth of Av, with wormwood. That is why the first festival day of Passover is the night of the ninth of Av.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Each year they occur on the same day of the week.</i> Over this, Jeremiah would lament: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Avin began: “He changes the times and the seasons” (Daniel 2:21) – Rabbi Yirmeya said to Israel: Had you been worthy, you would have been sitting in Jerusalem and drinking the clean, sweet Shiloaḥ waters. Now that you have not been worthy, you are exiled to Babylon and drinking the murky, rancid waters of the Euphrates. That is what is written: “Now, what is there for you on the way to Egypt, to drink water of Shiḥor? And what is there for you on the way to Assyria, to drink water of the River?” (Jeremiah 2:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Euphrates River, which the exiles would have crossed on their way to Babylon or to Assyria.</i> Had you been worthy, you would have been sitting in Jerusalem and reciting songs and psalms before the Holy One blessed be He; now that you have not been worthy, you are exiled to Babylon and reciting lamentations and wailing; that is: “By the rivers of Babylon, [there we sat and also wept]” (Psalms 137:1), <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Alexandri began: “I was diligent, but I became like a lonely bird on a rooftop” (Psalms 102:8) – the Holy One blessed be He said: I was diligent about bringing My children into the Land of Israel immediately, “but I became like a lonely bird on a rooftop.” Just as the bird moves alone from roof to roof, from fence to fence, from tree to tree, and from branch to branch, so too, when Israel departed from Egypt, they traveled in dispute and encamped in dispute: “They traveled…and they encamped [<i>vayaḥanu</i>]” (Exodus 13:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vayaḥanu</i> is plural, indicating that they were not united.</i> When they arrived at Mount Sinai, they became a united entity. It is not written here, “they encamped,” but rather, “Israel encamped [<i>vayiḥan</i>] there” (Exodus 19:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vayiḥan</i> is in the singular, indicating unity.</i> At that time the Holy One blessed be He said: This is the time when I will give the Torah to My children.<br>Another matter: “I was diligent [<i>shakadti</i>] but I became <like a bird>” – the Holy One blessed be He said: I was persistent [<i>shakadti</i>] to rest My Divine Presence in the Temple forever. But I became like a bird. Just as this bird, when you take its fledglings it remains alone, so too, the Holy One blessed be He said: I burned My Temple, destroyed My city, exiled My children among the nations of the world, and I sat alone; “how…?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Alexandri began: “And the leper in whom there is a mark [his garments shall be rent, the hair of his head shall be grown, he shall cover his upper lip, and he shall cry: Impure, impure]” (Leviticus 13:45). “And the leper” – this is the Temple. “In whom there is a mark” – this is idol worship, which imparts impurity like a leprous mark, as it is stated: They desecrated My Temple and defiled it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse, although there are several verses expressing the same idea and employing similar terminology; see, e.g., Jeremiah 7:30, 32:34; Ezekiel 5:11.</i> “His garments shall be rent” – these are the priestly vestments. “The hair of his head shall be grown [<i>parua</i>]” – this is what is stated: “He laid bare the covering of Judah” (Isaiah 22:8) – exposing what was covered.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is to the roof of the Temple, which was destroyed. The word <i>parua</i> can mean exposed.</i> “He shall cover his upper lip” – once Israel was exiled from among the nations, none of them was capable of expressing a matter of Torah with his mouth. “And he shall cry: Impure, impure” – the first destruction and the second destruction.<br>Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta said: Anyone who knows how many years Israel engaged in idol worship knows when the son of David will come. We have three verses that support him. One, “I will reckon upon it the days of the Be’alim, to which it burned incense” (Hosea 2:15) – [meaning,] like the days of the Be’alim. Second, “It was, that just as He called and they did not heed, so they will call out and I will not heed” (Zechariah 7:13). Third, “it will be when you will say: For what did the Lord…do [all these to us? You will say to them: Just as you forsook Me and served strange gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land not yours]” (Jeremiah 5:19).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, both of them addressed this.

Reish Lakish said: Like one who screams in the ear of another, not in one but in two, so, “in my ears, the Lord of hosts.”<br>Reish Lakish said: “Woe, those who join house to house” (Isaiah 5:8) – you have caused the first destruction to affect the second destruction.

It was because they did not leave any place where they did not engage in idol worship. Initially, they would worship it clandestinely. That is what is written: “He said to me: Have you seen, son of man, [what the elders of the house of Israel] are doing in the dark?” (Ezekiel 8:12).

It is not written here: Do not continue [to comfort me], but rather, “do not rush [<i>ta’itzu</i>].” The Holy One blessed be He said to the ministering angels: The words of comfort that you are reciting before Me, they are insults [<i>ni’utzin</i>] for Me. Why? “For it is a day of turmoil, trampling and confusion [<i>mevukha</i>] from the Lord, God of hosts” (Isaiah 22:5) – a day of turbulence, a day of plundering, and a day of weeping [<i>bekhiya</i>]. “Of the Valley of Vision” (Isaiah 22:1) – it is the valley about which all the seers prophesy. “Breaching the wall and crying [<i>vesho’a</i>] to the mountain” (Isaiah 22:5) – for they were breaching the walls of their houses, using [the materials] for shields, and placing them atop their citadels [<i>sho’eihem</i>].<br>“Elam carried the quiver” (Isaiah 22:6) – Rav said: This is a collection of arrows. “Among chariots of men are horsemen, and Kir bared a shield” (Isaiah 22:6), for they were breaching the walls [<i>kirot</i>] of their houses and using [the materials] for shields. “And it was that your choicest valleys [<i>amakayikh</i>] filled with chariots” (Isaiah 22:7) – Rav said: To the full depth of [<i>umkah</i>] the sea waters. “And the horsemen directed themselves [<i>shot shatu</i>] to the gate” (Isaiah 22:7) – like weaving [<i>mishteyei</i>] they went and like weaving they came,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">They crossed like the warp and woof strings on a loom.</i> and they appeared to be many.<br>“He laid bare the covering of Judah” (Isaiah 22:8) – exposing what was covered. “You looked on that day to the weapons in the house of the forest” (Isaiah 22:8) – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The Israelites had a weapon at Sinai, and the ineffable name was etched upon it. When they sinned it was taken from them. That is what is written: “The children of Israel were stripped of their ornament from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6). How was it taken from them? Rabbi Aivu and the Rabbis: Rabbi Aivu said: It peeled off on its own. The Rabbis say: An angel descended and peeled it off.<br>“You saw that the breaches of the city of David were many.… And you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke the houses to fortify the wall” (Isaiah 22:9–10) – this teaches that they would shatter their houses and add to the wall. But did Hezekiah not already do so? Is it not written: “He took courage and rebuilt the entire breached wall…” (II Chronicles 32:5)?<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah criticized the people for adding to the wall, whereas Hezekiah similarly rebuilt the walls as protection from his enemies and was not criticized.</i> Hezekiah, however, put his trust in the Lord, God of Israel, but you did not put your trust in Him. That is what it says: “You did not look to the One who planned it, and you did not see the One who fashioned it long ago” (Isaiah 22:11).<br>“The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation” (Isaiah 22:12) – the ministering angels said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, it is written: “Majesty and glory are before Him” (Psalms 96:6), and You say this?’ He said to them: ‘I will teach you. That is what it says: “Disrobe and bare yourselves, and place a belt upon your waist” (Isaiah 32:11) – this is how you shall lament. “Smiting upon the breasts” (Isaiah 32:12) – on the first destruction and on the second destruction. “Over pleasant fields” (Isaiah 32:13) – on the house of My delight, which I made like a field. That is what it says: “Zion will be plowed like a field” (Micah 3:12). “Over a fruitful vine” (Isaiah 32:12) – this is Israel, just as it says: “You transported a vine from Egypt” (Psalms 80:9).’<br>Another matter: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day…” (Isaiah 22:12) – that is what was stated in the verse by the sons of Koraḥ through the Divine Spirit: “These I remember, and pour out my soul within me, [how I passed on with the throng and led them to the house of God]” (Psalms 42:5). Regarding whom did the sons of Koraḥ recite this verse? Regarding the congregation of Israel, as the congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, I remember the security, tranquility, and calm in which I existed, and now it has grown distant from me. I am weeping and moaning and saying: If only I could be restored to the earlier times when the Temple was built, and You would descend to it from heaven On High and rest Your Divine Presence upon me. The nations of the world would laud me, and when I would request mercy for my iniquities, You would answer me. But now I am in shame and humiliation.’ They also said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, my soul is desolate within me when I pass by Your Temple and it is destroyed, and a still small voice within it says: The place where the descendants of Abraham sacrificed offerings before You, the priests would stand on the platform, and the Levites would laud with their lyres, shall foxes prance in it? That is what is written: “On Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes walk upon it” (Lamentations 5:18). But what shall I do? My iniquities have brought this upon me, the false prophets who were in my midst misled me from the path of life to the path of death.’ That is why it is stated: “These I remember, and pour out my soul within me…”<br>Another matter: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation…” (Isaiah 22:12) – when the Holy One blessed be He sought to destroy the Temple, He said: As long as I am inside it, the nations of the world will not touch it. So, I will avert My eyes from it, and I will take an oath that I will not attend to it until the time of the end of days. Then the enemies will come and destroy it. Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He took an oath by His right hand, and withdrew it behind Him. That is what is written: “He withdrew His right hand from before the enemy” (Lamentations 2:3). At that moment, the enemies entered the Sanctuary and burned it. Once it was burned, the Holy One blessed be He said: I no longer have an abode on the earth; I will remove My Divine Presence from it, and I will ascend to My original location. That is what is written: “I will go and return to My place, until they will be punished and they seek My presence” (Hosea 5:15). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He was weeping and saying: Woe is Me for what I have done. I rested My Divine Presence below for the sake of Israel. Now that they have sinned, I have returned to My original place. Heaven forbid that I have become a laughingstock to the nations and a mockery to the people. At that moment, Metatron<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">This is the name of an important angel.</i> came and fell on his face and said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I will weep but You shall not weep.’ He said to him: ‘If you do not allow Me to weep now, I will enter a place into which you have no authorization to enter, and I will weep, as it is stated: “But if you will not heed it, my soul will weep in concealed places due to your arrogance…”’ (Jeremiah 13:17).<br>The Holy One blessed be He said to the ministering angels: ‘Come and let us go, you and I, and let us see what the enemies did in My Temple.’ Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He and the ministering angels went, with Jeremiah before Him. When the Holy One blessed be He saw the Temple, He said: Certainly, this is My Temple and this is My resting place that enemies entered and did in it as they pleased. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He was weeping and saying: Woe is Me for My Temple. My children, where are you? My priests, where are you? My beloved, where are you? What could I do for you? I warned you but you did not repent. The Holy One blessed be He said to Jeremiah: ‘Today I am like a person who had an only son, made a wedding canopy for him, and he died within his wedding canopy; do you not feel pain for Me or for My son? Go and call Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses from their graves, as they know how to weep.’ [Jeremiah] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I do not know where Moses is buried.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Go, stand on the bank of the Jordan, raise your voice, and call: Son of Amram, son of Amram, arise and see your flock who have been consumed by enemies.’ Immediately, Jeremiah went to the Cave of Makhpela and said to the patriarchs of the world: ‘Arise, as the time has arrived that you are summoned before the Holy One blessed be He.’ They said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to them: ‘I do not know,’ because he feared that they would say: In your days this befell our children? Jeremiah left them and stood on the bank of the Jordan, and called out: ‘Son of Amram, son of Amram, arise, the time has arrived that you are summoned before the Holy One blessed be He.’ He said to him: ‘What is different about today that I am summoned before the Holy One blessed be He?’ Jeremiah said to him: ‘I do not know.’ Moses left him and went to the ministering angels, as he was familiar with them from the time of the giving of the Torah. He said to them: ‘Ministers On High, do you know why I am summoned before the Holy One blessed be He?’ They said to him: ‘Son of Amram, do you not know that the Temple has been destroyed and Israel has been exiled?’ He was screaming and weeping until he reached the patriarchs of the world. Immediately, they rent their garments, placed their hands on their heads, and were screaming and weeping until the gates of the Temple. When the Holy One blessed be He saw them, immediately, “the Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for baldness and for donning sackcloth” (Isaiah 22:12). Had it not been for the verse that is written, it would have been impossible to say it. They were weeping and walking from this gate to that gate like a person whose deceased relative is lying before him. The Holy One blessed be He was lamenting and saying: Woe to a king who was successful in his youth and in his old age was not successful.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: When the Temple was destroyed, Abraham came before the Holy One blessed be He weeping, pulling out his beard, tearing out the hair of his head, striking his face, rending his garments, ashes on his head, and he was walking in the Temple and lamenting and screaming. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why am I different from all nations and tongues that I have come to this state of shame and humiliation?’ When the ministering angels saw him, they too composed lamentations standing in rows and saying: “[Behold, their angels cry out outside.…] The highways are desolate, wayfarers have ceased; [he breached the covenant, rejected cities, regarded no man]” (Isaiah 33:7–8). What is “the highways are desolate”? The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The highways to Jerusalem that You prepared so that travelers would never cease from them, how have they become desolation?’ “Wayfarers have ceased” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The ways upon which Israel would travel on the festivals, how have they become idle?’ “Breached the covenant” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, the covenant of their patriarch Abraham has been breached, by means of whom the world was settled, and by means of whom You were recognized in the world as God on High, Maker of the heavens and the earth.’ “Rejected cities” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Have You rejected Jerusalem and Zion after You chose them?’ That is what is written: “Did You reject Judah, did Your soul loathe Zion…?” (Jeremiah 14:19). “Regarded no man [<i>enosh</i>]” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You did not consider Israel even like the generation of Enosh, who were the originators of idol worshippers.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He attended to the ministering angels. He said to them: ‘Why are you composing lamentations like this, standing in rows?’ They said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, why did You not pay attention to Abraham, Your beloved, who came to Your House and lamented and wept?’ He said to them: ‘From the day that My beloved passed away from before Me to his eternal home, he did not come to My House, and now: “What has My beloved to do in My House?”’ (Jeremiah 11:15).<br>Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe: Why did You exile my children, deliver them into the hand of the nations, kill them with all kinds of uncommon deaths, and destroy the Temple, the place where I elevated my son Isaac as a burnt offering before You?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Your children sinned and violated the entire Torah and the twenty-two letters that are in it.’ That is what is written: “All Israel have violated Your Torah” (Daniel 9:11). Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, who will testify against Israel that they violated Your Torah?’ He said to him: ‘Let the Torah come and testify against Israel.’ Immediately, the Torah came to testify against them. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, you have come to testify against Israel that they violated your mitzvot, and you have no shame before me? Remember the day that the Holy One blessed be He circulated you among every nation and they did not want to accept you, until my descendants came to Mount Sinai and accepted you and honored you. Now you come to testify against them on their day of distress?’ Once the Torah heard this, it stood to one side and did not testify against them.<br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Let the twenty-two letters come and testify against Israel.’ Immediately, the twenty-two letters came. <i>Alef</i> came to testify against Israel that they violated the Torah. Abraham said to it: ‘<i>Alef</i>, you are the leader of all the letters, and you come to testify against Israel on their day of distress? Remember the day that the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on Mount Sinai and began with you, “I am [<i>anokhi</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Anokhi</i> begins with the letter <i>alef</i>.</i> the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2) – no nation other than my descendants accepted you, and you come to testify against my descendants?’ Immediately, <i>alef</i> stood to one side and did not testify against them.<br><i>Bet</i> came to testify against Israel. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, have you come to testify against my descendants, who are diligent in the five books of the Torah, as you are at the head of the Torah?’ That is what is written: “In the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit</i>, the first word of the Torah, begins with a <i>bet.</i></i> God created” (Genesis 1:1). Immediately, <i>bet</i> stood to one side and did not testify at all.<br><i>Gimel</i> came to testify against Israel. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, have you come to testify against my descendants that they violated the Torah? Is there any nation who fulfills the mitzva of ritual fringes, which you appear at its head?’ That is what is written: “You shall make for yourselves twisted threads [<i>gedilim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gedilim</i>, which in Hebrew is the first word of this verse, begins with a <i>gimel.</i></i> Immediately, <i>gimel</i> stood to one side and did not testify at all. When all the letters saw that Abraham had silenced them, they were ashamed, stood by themselves, and did not testify against Israel.<br>Immediately, Abraham began [speaking] before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, at one hundred years You gave me a son. When he achieved cognition and was a thirty-seven-year-old young man, You said to me: Sacrifice him as a burnt-offering before Me. I became like a cruel person to him and had no mercy on him. Rather, I, myself, bound him. Will You not remember this on my behalf and have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Isaac began and said: ‘Master of the universe, when my father said to me: “God, Himself, will see to the lamb for a burnt offering, my son” (Genesis 22:8), I did not delay fulfillment of Your words, and I was bound willingly upon the altar and extended my neck under the knife. Will You not remember this on my behalf and have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Jacob began and said: ‘Master of the universe, did I not remain in Laban’s house for twenty years? When I departed from his house, the wicked Esau encountered me and sought to kill my children, and I endangered my life on their behalf. Now they are delivered into the hand of their enemies like sheep to slaughter after I raised them like chicks and suffered the travails of child raising on their behalf, as most of my days I experienced great suffering for their sake. Will You not now remember this on my behalf to have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Moses began and said: ‘Master of the universe, was I not a loyal shepherd over Israel for forty years? I ran before them like a horse in the wilderness, yet when the time came for them to enter the land, You decreed against me that my bones would fall in the wilderness. Now that they have been exiled you sent to me to lament them and weep over them.’ This is the parable that people say: From the goodness of my master it is not good for me, and from his evil it is bad for me.<br>At that moment, Moses said to Jeremiah: ‘Go before me so I may go and bring them. I would like to see who is going to restrain them.’<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">If I bring them back no one will dare stand in their way.</i> Jeremiah said: ‘It is impossible to go on the way due to the corpses.’<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">I am a priest, and it is prohibited for me to contract impurity imparted by a corpse.</i> He said to him: ‘Nevertheless.’ Immediately, Moses went and Jeremiah was before him, until they reached the rivers of Babylon. They saw Moses and said to each other: ‘The son of Amram has come from his grave to redeem us from the hand of our adversaries!’ A Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘It is a decree from before Me.’ Immediately, Moses said to them: ‘My children, to return you is impossible, as the decree has already been issued. Rather, the Omnipresent will return you speedily.’ He left them. At that moment, they raised their voice in great weeping until their weeping ascended On High. That is what is written: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and also wept” (Psalms 137:1).<br>When Moses came to the patriarchs of the world, they said to him: ‘What have the enemies done to our descendants?’ He said: ‘Some of them they killed, some of them they tied their hands behind them, some of them were bound in iron chains, some of them were stripped naked, some of them died on the way and their carcasses were left for the bird of the heavens and the animals of the earth, and some of them were cast in the sun hungry and thirsty.’ Immediately, they all began weeping and lamenting: ‘Woe over what has befallen our children! How have you become like orphans without a father; how do you lie in the afternoon and in the summer without garment and without covering; how have you walked on mountains and on gravel with shoes removed and without sandals; how have you carried bundles filled with sand; how have your hands been bound behind you; how have you been unable to swallow even the spittle in your mouths?’ Moses began and said: ‘Cursed sun! Why did you not darken when the enemy entered the Temple?’ The sun responded to him: ‘Moses, loyal shepherd, how could I darken, they did not allow me and did not relent from me, as they took me with sixty rods of fire and said to me: Go and shine your light.’<br>Again Moses began and said: ‘Woe over your radiance, Temple, how has it gone dark? Woe that its time to be destroyed arrived, the Sanctuary was burned, schoolchildren killed, and their fathers sent to captivity, exile, and the sword.’ Again Moses began and said: ‘O captors, by your lives! You killers, do not kill cruelly and do not implement total annihilation, do not kill a son in the presence of his father, or a daughter in the presence of her mother, for the time will come when the Master of heaven will settle the score with you.’ But the wicked Chaldeans did not do so, but rather, would seat the son on his mother’s lap and say to his father: Rise and slaughter him. The mother would cry and her tears would fall on him, and his father would hang his head. He also said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, You wrote in Your Torah: “An ox or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day” (Leviticus 22:28). But have they not killed many, many children and their mothers, and yet You are silent!’<br>At that moment, Rachel our matriarch interjected before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, it is revealed before You that Your servant Jacob loved me abundantly and worked for my father seven years for me. When those seven years were completed and the time for my marriage to my husband arrived, my father plotted to exchange me with my sister for my husband. The matter was extremely difficult for me when I became aware of that plot, and I informed my husband and gave him a signal to distinguish between my sister and me so that my father would be unable to exchange me. Afterward, I regretted what I had done and suppressed my desire. I had mercy on my sister, so that she would not be led to humiliation. In the evening they exchanged me with my sister for my husband, and I transmitted to my sister all the signals that I had given to my husband, so that he would think that she is Rachel. Moreover, I entered beneath the bed on which he was lying with my sister. He would speak with her and she would be silent, and I would respond to each and every matter that he said, so that he would not identify my sister’s voice. I performed an act of kindness for her, I was not jealous of her, and I did not lead her to humiliation. If I, who is flesh and blood, was not jealous of my rival, and I did not lead her to humiliation and shame, You who are a living and eternal merciful King, why were You jealous of idol worship that has no substance, and You exiled my descendants, and they were killed by sword, and the enemies did to them as they pleased?’ Immediately, the mercy of the Holy One blessed be He was aroused and He said: ‘For you, Rachel, I will restore Israel to its place.’ That is what is written: “So said the Lord: A voice is heard in Rama, wailing, bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be consoled for her children, as they are not” (Jeremiah 31:14). And it is written: “So said the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, as there is reward for your actions.… And there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord, and your children will return to their borders” (Jeremiah 31:15–16).
Rabbi Yoḥanan began: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark…” (Jeremiah 13:16) – when was this verse fulfilled in their regard? It was with the death of Hezekiah. That is what is written: “Hezekiah lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the descendants of David, and they accorded him honor upon his death” (II Chronicles 32:33). What honor did they accord him? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Ḥanin, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: They built a meeting place of the Sages above Hezekiah’s tomb. When they would go there, they would say to him: ‘Teach us.’ Rabbi Ḥanin said: They placed a Torah scroll above Hezekiah’s tomb and said: The one who is placed in this coffin fulfilled everything that is written in this. The Rabbis said: They arranged rugs for him from the entrance of their houses to the tombs of the descendants of David. Why to that extent? It was so their feet would not be exposed.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">They walked without shoes as a sign of mourning and put out the rugs so that their feet would not be injured by the hard ground or the cold. The fact that the entire populace took upon themselves customs of mourning was an honor for Hezekiah.</i> Nevertheless, their feet were exposed. Jeremiah said to them: If when you arranged rugs from the entrance of your houses to the tombs of the descendants of David your feet were exposed, when “your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night” (Jeremiah 13:16), all the more so.<br>The Divine Presence traveled ten journeys: From cherub to cherub,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Presence had been focused on the cherub on the right side, and moved to the cherub on the left (Maharzu).</i> from cherub to the threshold of the Sanctuary, from the threshold of the Sanctuary [back] to the cherubs, from the cherubs to the eastern gate, from the eastern gate to the courtyard, from the courtyard to the roof, from the roof to the altar, from the altar to the wall,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the wall surrounding the Temple courtyard.</i> from the wall to the city, and from the city to the Mount of Olives.<br>From cherub to cherub, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord rose from upon the cherub” (Ezekiel 10:4). From the cherub to the threshold of the Sanctuary, as it is written: “The glory of the God of Israel ascended from upon the cherub upon which it had been to the threshold of the Sanctuary” (Ezekiel 9:3). From the threshold of the Sanctuary to the cherubs, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord emerged from upon the threshold of the House and stood upon the cherubs” (Ezekiel 10:18). “Emerged” – the verse should have said, “entered,” and yet it says, “emerged”? What is “emerged”? Rabbi Aḥa said: [This is analogous] to a king who was emerging from his palace in anger. After he left he returned and caressed and kissed the walls of the palace and the pillars of the palace, and he was weeping and saying: Let there be peace upon my palace, let there be peace upon my royal house, let there be peace upon the house of my honor, let there be peace, from now on let there be peace. So too, when the Divine Presence emerged from the Temple, it returned and caressed and kissed the walls of the Temple and the pillars of the Temple, and it was weeping and saying: Let there be peace upon My Temple, let there be peace upon My royal house, let there be peace upon the house of My honor, let there be peace, from now on let there be peace.<br>From the cherubs to the eastern gate, as it is written: “The cherubs lifted their wings…[and it stood at the entrance of the east gate of the House of the Lord]” (Ezekiel 10:19). From the eastern gate to the courtyard, as it is written: “The courtyard was filled with the aura of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 10:4). From the courtyard to the roof, as it is written: “Better to live on a corner of a roof” (Proverbs 25:24). From the roof to the altar, as it is written: “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar” (Amos 9:1). From the altar to the wall, as it is written: “Behold, the Lord is standing upon a wall made with a plumb line [<i>anakh</i>]” (Amos 7:7). Another matter: What is <i>anakh</i>? This is the Sanhedrin of seventy-one, the numerical value of <i>anakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alef</i> – 1, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>kaf</i> – 20 = 71</i> “The Lord said: Behold, I am placing a plumb line” (Amos 7:8). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash here does not include Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon’s statement. See <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 33:2, where his exposition of this verse is stated.</i> From the wall to the city, as it is written: “The voice of the Lord calls to the city” (Micah 6:9). From the city to the Mount of Olives, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord ascended from above the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain that was east of the city” (Ezekiel 11:23).<br>Rabbi Yonatan said: For three and a half years the Divine Presence stayed resting on the Mount of Olives, believing that perhaps Israel would repent, but they did not. A Divine Voice was proclaiming and saying: “Return wayward children” (Jeremiah 3:14), “return to Me and I will return to you” (Malachi 3:7). Since they did not repent, it said: “I will go and return to My place” (Hosea 5:15). Regarding that moment, it says: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark” (Jeremiah 13:16) – before it grows dark for you from matters of Torah, before it grows dark for you from matters of prophecy. “And before your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night, and you will hope for light” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Babylon; “but He will render it the shadow of death” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Media; “and will render it a fog” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Greece. “But if you will not heed it” (Jeremiah 13:17) – in Edom; “My soul will weep in concealed places due to your arrogance” (Jeremiah 13:17) – Why does the verse state: “Due to your arrogance”? These are the idol worshippers, who are arrogant and say: “Where is their God, the Rock in whom they sought refuge?” (Deuteronomy 32:37). Alternatively, “due to your arrogance” – due to the ministering angels, who are arrogant and say: “What is man that You remember him…” (Psalms 8:5). “And my eyes will weep and shed tears because the flock of the Lord was taken captive” (Jeremiah 13:17) – you find that until Israel was exiled, they were divided into flocks, the priestly flock by itself, the Levite flock by itself, the Israelite flock by itself. Once they were exiled, they became one flock; “because the flock of the Lord was taken captive”– it is not written here, “because they were taken captive [<i>nishbu</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>nishbu</i> is plural, whereas the term <i>nishba</i> is singular.</i> but rather, “because the flock of the Lord was taken captive [<i>nishba</i>].”
Rav Naḥman began: “Oh, Ariel, Ariel” (Isaiah 29:1) – lion, mighty lion.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">He understands the term Ariel to mean mighty lion [<i>ari el</i>].</i> “The city where David encamped” (Isaiah 29:1) – the city in which David encamped, a city in which no one other than David encamped,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The city became the everlasting capital city of the Davidic kingdom.</i> the city that David made his royal fortress. “Add year to year, festivals [<i>ḥagim</i>] will come around [<i>yinkofu</i>]” (Isaiah 29:1) – a year began and a year departed, but they did not ascend on the pilgrimage festivals. The roads were growing thorn bushes [<i>higim</i>]. That is what is written: “<i>Ḥagim</i> <i>yinkofu</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥagim yinkofu</i> is expounded to mean that travelers would have to remove the thorns [<i>yinkofu higim</i>].</i> “I will distress Ariel” (Isaiah 29:2) – Rabbi Nisa of Caesarea said: From here, that it had been a place of contentment for Israel. “There will be mourning and moaning” (Isaiah 29:2) – mortification upon mortification. “It will be for Me like Ariel” (Isaiah 29:2) – the second destruction will be like the first destruction. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Pinḥas began: “If after these you will not heed Me…” (Leviticus 26:18). Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua: Rabbi Eliezer says: The Holy One blessed be He does not bring punishment upon Israel until He first warns them. That is what is written: “If after these.” Rabbi Yehoshua says: So Israel would not say: The blows have ceased; He has no others to bring upon us, the verse states: “If after these [<i>ad</i>],” if there are more [<i>od</i>] of these, He has other [punishments] and more like these to bring [upon you]. “I will punish you further, seven ways for your sins” (Leviticus 26:18) – You violated seven transgressions before Me; come and accept upon yourselves seven punishments. You violated seven transgressions before Me, so Jeremiah comes to recite lamentations over you which are seven alphabetic [acrostics], <i>eikha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The book of Lamentations contains three alphabetical acrostics, in chapters 1,2, and 4, each beginning with the word <i>eikha</i>. Additionally, chapter 3 contains a triple alphabetical acrostic. Chapter 5 is not written in an acrostic, but since it has twenty-two verses, which are the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, the midrash refers to this too as alphabetical in the sense that it corresponds to the number of letters in the alphabet (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i>
Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina began: “Jeremiah took another scroll [and gave it to Barukh, son of Neriyahu, the scribe, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">This scroll is the first chapter of Lamentations.</i> that Yehoyakim king of Judah burned in the fire, and many matters like them were also added to them]” (Jeremiah 36:32). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina and the Rabbis: Rabbi Ḥama said: “Were also added to them” – this is: “How [the Lord] has clouded” (Lamentations 2:1). “Matters” – this is: “How can…tarnish” (Lamentations 4:1). “Many” – this is: “I am the man” (Lamentations 3:1). “Like them” – this is: “Remember, Lord” (Lamentations 5:1). The Rabbis say: “Were also added to them” – this is: “How the Lord has clouded” (Lamentations 2:1). “Matters” – this is: “How can…tarnish” (Lamentations 4:1). “Many” – this is: “Remember, Lord” (Lamentations 5:1). “Like them” – this is: “I am the man” (Lamentations 3:1), as it is a triple alphabetical acrostic.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Its triple alphabetical acrostic is “like them,” like the other three alphabetical acrostics combined.</i>
Zavdi ben Levi began: “God settles individuals at home” (Psalms 68:7) – you find that until Israel was redeemed from Egypt, they would reside by themselves and the Divine Presence by itself. When they were redeemed they all became a single unit. When they were exiled, the Divine Presence was once again by itself and Israel by themselves. That is what is written: “But the rebellious dwell in a parched land” (Psalms 68:7). “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Zavdi ben Levi began: “The kings of the earth did not believe…” (Lamentations 4:12). There were four kings; what this one demanded that one did not demand, and they are: David, Asa, Yehoshafat, and Hezekiah. David said: “I will pursue my enemies and overtake them…” (Psalms 18:38).<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is generally translated “I have pursued my enemies” or “I pursue my enemies.” However, a more literal translation is “I will pursue my enemies” or “let me pursue my enemies,” which is how the midrash understands it here.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so.’ That is what is written: “David smote them from twilight until the evening of the next day” (I Samuel 30:17). What is “of the next day”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: For two nights and one day. The Holy One blessed be He would illuminate for him with comets and lightning, as we learned there: Over comets, over earthquakes, and over lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Berakhot</i> 9:2. The mishna continues: One recites: Blessed…whose strength and power fill the world.</i> That is what is written: “For You will illuminate my lamp…” (Psalms 18:29).<br>Asa arose and said: ‘I do not have the power to kill them, but I will pursue them and You do [the killing].’ He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “Asa…pursued them…[and Kushites were falling…before the Lord and before His camp]” (II Chronicles 14:12); it is not written here, “before Asa,” but rather, “before the Lord and before His camp.”<br>Yehoshafat arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill nor to pursue; rather, I will recite song, and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “At the time that they began with song and praise, [the Lord set ambushes against the children of Amon, Moav, and the highlands of Seir]” (II Chronicles 20:22).<br>Hezekiah arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill, nor to pursue, nor to recite song; rather I will sleep in my bed and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “It was on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians [one hundred eighty-five thousand]” (II Kings 19:35).<br>How many remained of them? Rav said: Ten, as it is stated: “A child will record them” (Isaiah 10:19), as it is typical of a child to write a <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yod</i> is the smallest letter and is very easy to write.

Both according to the statement of these and according to the statement of those, Nebuchadnezzar was one of them. When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Ascend and destroy the Temple,’ he said: He seeks only to eliminate me. He will do to me what he did to my grandfather.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash identifies Nebuchadnezzar as a grandson of Sennacherib, king of Assyria during Hezekiah’s time. Alternatively, the midrash employs the term grandfather in the sense of predecessor.</i> What did he do? He came and encamped at Daphne in Antioch and sent Nevuzaradan, captain of the guard, to destroy Jerusalem. He stayed there three and a half years. Each day he would circle Jerusalem but was unable to conquer it. He sought to return. The Holy One blessed be He introduced into his mind and he began measuring the wall, and it was sinking two and a half handbreadths each day until it was completely sunk. Once it completely sunk, the enemies entered Jerusalem. Regarding that moment, it states: “The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world did not believe that an adversary and enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem” (Lamentations 4:12). When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai began: “Bad, bad, the buyer says; but when he goes, he then praises” (Proverbs 20:14). You find that until Israel was exiled, the Holy One blessed be He called them wicked. That is what is written: “This wicked people who refuse to heed My words” (Jeremiah 13:10). Once they were exiled, He began praising them, as it is stated: “But when he goes, he then praises” (Proverbs 20:14). When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.<br>“Woe to the filthy and polluted one, the city of oppression” (Zephaniah 3:1) – what is “woe to the filthy [<i>more’a</i>]”? Woe due to the terror [<i>eima</i>], for I have imposed My terror upon all the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Terror in Hebrew is <i>eima</i> or <i>mora</i>.</i> When? “And polluted” [<i>venigala</i>] – you find that when Israel was redeemed [<i>nigalu</i>] from Egypt, their terror fell upon all the nations. That is what is written: “Nations heard, they were agitated…then the chieftains of Edom were alarmed…” (Exodus 15:14–15). “The city of oppression [<i>hayona</i>]” – the nation that I distinguished with mitzvot<i></i> and good deeds like the dove [<i>yona</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">The dove’s mate distinguishes it from other doves.</i> After all this praise: “It did not listen to the voice [of the Lord], it did not accept chastisement, it did not place its trust in the Lord, it did not draw near to its God” (Zephaniah 3:2).<br>A bride who is not obedient, what is she? Is she not a fool? Rabbi Reuven said: In the Greek language they call a fool <i>more’a</i>, “woe to <i>more’a</i>” (Zephaniah 3:1), woe to the fool. “<i>Venigala</i>”– because they would distance themselves from hearing matters of Torah, they were distanced [<i>nigala</i>] from the priesthood. “The city of <i>hayona</i>” (Zephaniah 3:1) – they should have learned from the city of Jonah [<i>Yona</i>], from Nineveh. I sent one prophet to Nineveh and he caused them to repent, while Israel in Jerusalem, how many prophets did I send to them! That is what is written: “The Lord warned Israel, and Judah, by means of every prophet of every vision, saying: Repent from your evil ways, and observe My commandments and My statutes…” (II Kings 17:13). And it is written: “I sent to you all My servants the prophets daily, time and again” (Jeremiah 7:25); “time and again” in the morning, “time and again” in the evening. “But they did not listen” (Jeremiah 7:26) – because they did not listen they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).<br>“I struggle to overcome sorrow; my heart aches within me” (Jeremiah 8:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is cited as the introduction to the upcoming statement.</i>
Rabbi Ḥanina began in this manner: “I struggle [<i>mavligiti</i>] to overcome sorrow; my heart aches within me” (Jeremiah 8:18). What is <i>mavligiti</i>? Due to the lack [<i>mibeli</i>] of people contemplating the Torah to fulfill mitzvot and good deeds, I turned My Temple into My winepress [<i>giti</i>]. Nevertheless, “My heart aches within Me” over the Temple. That is what is written: “For this our heart aches…” (Lamentations 5:17).<br>And it is written: “Behold the sound of the cry of [<i>shavat</i>] the daughter of My people from a distant land” (Jeremiah 8:19). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This expression is used in three senses: <i>Ze’aka</i>, <i>shava</i>, and<i> ne’aka</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">These are three similar terms for crying out. <i>Ze’aka</i> indicates crying out in a loud and extended manner. <i>Ne’aka</i> is a form of crying out that is not loud at all.<i> Shava</i> generally means crying out but not as loud or long as <i>ze’aka</i>. It can also refer to any of these types of cries. (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <i>Ze’aka</i>, as it is written: “The children of Israel sighed due to the work and they cried out [<i>vayizaku</i>], and their plea [<i>shavatam</i>] rose [to God from the work]” (Exodus 2:23). <i>Shava</i>, as it is written: “Behold the sound of the cry of [<i>shavat</i>] the daughter of My people.” <i>Ne’aka</i>, as it is written: “God heard their moaning [<i>naakatam</i>]” (Exodus 2:24). Rabbi Huna the Great of Tzippori says: It is an expression of convulsing. That is what is written: “And groan [<i>venaak</i>] the groans of [<i>naakot</i>] the slain” (Ezekiel 30:24). And it is written: “The souls of the dead cry [<i>teshave’a</i>]” (Job 24:12). “Is the Lord not in Zion? Is its King not in it?” (Jeremiah 8:19). Had He been there, they would not have been exiled. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
Rabbi Ze’eira began: “My lyre is for mourning, and my flute is for the voice of weepers” (Job 30:31). There it is taught: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as joyous for Israel as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur, on which the daughters of Jerusalem would go out in white borrowed garments so as not to embarrass one who did not have one. All the garments require immersion. The daughters of Israel would go out in them and dance in the vineyards.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Taanit</i> 4:8.</i> It is taught: One who did not have a wife would turn to there. What would they say? ‘Young man, lift your eyes and see what you are choosing for yourself. Do not look at beauty, look at lineage.’ Likewise it says: “Emerge, daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart” (Song of Songs 3:11). “The day of his wedding” – this is the giving of the Torah. “The day of the rejoicing of his heart” – this is the building of the Temple, may it be built speedily in our days.<br>Granted Yom Kippur, as it is a day of pardon and forgiveness for Israel, the day on which the last tablets were given. However, what is the fifteenth of Av? Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Asi: It is the ideal time for chopping trees, as all the trees chopped on it do not produce a worm, and it is taught: Any wood in which a worm is found is disqualified from being atop the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Midot</i> 2:5.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana and Rabbi Asi said in the name of Ulla in the name of Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi]: It was then that Hoshea ben Ela canceled the sentries that Yerovam ben Nevat had deployed on the roads.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Yerovam, king of Israel, appointed sentries to prevent the residents of his kingdom from ascending to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage festivals.</i> Rav Kahana asked before Rav: Is it possible that he did all this good and it is written in his regard: “Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, ascended against him, [and Hoshea became his servant]” (II Kings 17:3)? Rather, it is because he removed the collar from his neck and placed it on the neck of the masses, and he did not say: All the people should ascend and pray, but rather, anyone who wishes to ascend let him ascend.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Hoshea was punished, and the rest of his kingdom was punished as well (see II Kings 17:6), because he did not encourage them to ascend to Jerusalem and most of the people did not actually ascend. Previously it had been the king’s fault that the people did not ascend, as they could not go because of the sentries; subsequently it was the people’s fault, and therefore the entire kingdom was punished.</i><br>Rabbi Shmuel bat Naḥmani [said], and some say it in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: [The fifteenth of Av is] the day the tribes were permitted to enter into marriage with one another, as it is stated: “And every daughter who inherits an inheritance [from the tribes of the children of Israel shall be a wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father]” (Numbers 36:8), and it is written: “And no inheritance shall pass from tribe to another tribe…” (Numbers 36:9). Is it possible for a daughter to inherit [from] two tribes? Rather, say on this basis, her father was from one tribe and her mother from another tribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The verse refers to a daughter who inherits “from the tribes of the children of Israel,” implying that her parents were from different tribes. But then the verse goes on to state that a woman cannot marry a man from a different tribe. The Sages understood this to mean that it was only in the first generation when Israel entered the land that women could not marry men from other tribes. The date when it was officially determined that from then on it was permissible was the fifteenth of Av.</i><br>The Rabbis said: [It is] the day the tribe of Benjamin was permitted to enter the congregation, as it is written: “Cursed is one who gives a woman to Benjamin” (Judges 21:18). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They read a verse and drew them near, they read a verse and distanced them. They read a verse and drew them near: “A nation and an assembly of nations shall be from you” (Genesis 35:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">When God promised this to Jacob, Benjamin had not yet been born, meaning that it was necessary to ensure that Benjamin would procreate.</i> They read a verse and distanced them: “Ephraim and Manasseh will be like Reuben and Simeon for me” (Genesis 48:5) – as they are not considered with their brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The total of twelve tribes could be achieved without Benjamin, with the addition of Ephraim and Manasseh.</i> Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: It was the day that the tribes were permitted [to marry each other].<br>Rav Matna said: It was the day that the slain of Beitar were allowed to be buried. Rabbi Eliezer the Great said: It is reasonable on the fifteenth; from that point on, the intensity of the sun wanes and they would no longer chop wood for the arrangement. Rabbi Menasya said: They called it the day of the breaking of the scythe. From that point on: One who adds, adds, and one who does not add, will be gathered.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">From this point on, the nights begin to be lengthy. Since night is a good time for Torah study, the midrash states that years of life will be added for one who adds to his hours of Torah study. One who does not will die young.</i><br>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is the day that the digging for those who died in the wilderness was halted. Rabbi Levi said: Every eve of the ninth of Av, Moses would dispatch a herald to the entire camp, saying: ‘Go out and dig,’ and they would go out and dig graves and sleep in them. In the morning, he would dispatch a herald saying: ‘Rise and separate the dead from the living,’ and they would stand and take themselves out. Fifteen thousand and more were subtracted,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Each year</i> for a total of six hundred thousand. In the fortieth year, the last one, they did so and found themselves intact. They said: It appears that we were mistaken in our calculation, and they did the same on the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, and the fourteenth. When the moon was full, they said: It appears that the Holy One blessed be He abrogated the decree from upon us, and they then rendered it a holiday. But due to their iniquities, mourning beset this world with the destruction of the Temple twice. That is what is written: “My lyre is for mourning, and my flute is for the voice of weepers” (Job 30:31). “The people wept that night” (Numbers 14:1) – when they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).
“For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing…” (Jeremiah 9:9) – Rabbi Aḥa said: Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nevuzaradan three matters concerning Jeremiah: “Take him and keep your eyes on him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – on him and not on his nation. “Do not do anything harmful to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – to him do not do, but to his nation do as much harm as you please. “As he will say to you so you shall do to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – but not to his nation. Jeremiah would see a group of lads placed in collars, and he would place his head with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. He then would see elders chained in chains. He would place his neck with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. Nevuzaradan said to him: ‘Look, you are one of three things; either you are a false prophet, or you are contemptuous of suffering, or you are a shedder of blood. Maybe you are a false prophet, as all these years you are prophesying about this city that it will be destroyed, and now that it is being destroyed, your soul is greatly troubled. Or you are contemptuous of suffering, as I do not wish to do you any harm, but you wish to do yourself harm, as though to say: Suffering is nothing for me. Or you are a shedder of blood, as the king commanded me extensively in your regard that I not do you any harm, and you seek to do harm so that the king will hear and execute this man.’<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuzaradan was referring to himself.</i><br>Ultimately, he said to him: ‘If you agree, come and I will keep my eye on you,’ but he did not accept it, as it is stated at the end of the portion, until it was stated to him from the mouth of the Almighty.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuzaradan had suggested that Jeremiah come to Babylon under his protection or remain in the Land of Israel, but Jeremiah had insisted on remaining with the other captives who were being exiled to Babylon, until God spoke to him. See Jeremiah 40:1–5.</i> That is what is written: “This is the matter that was to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying” (see Jeremiah 40:1). What was that matter? He said to him: ‘Jeremiah, if you remain here, I will go with them, and if you go with them, I will remain here.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if I go with them, in what way can I benefit them? Rather, let their King, their Creator go with them, as He can benefit them greatly.’ That is what is written: “After Nevuzaradan, captain of the guards, sent him …and he had been bound in chains” (Jeremiah 40:1). Rabbi Aḥa said: As it were, both he and Him were bound in chains. Similarly, it is written: “And I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">“And I” is expounded to mean: I – Ezekiel; and – God.</i><br>Until where was Jeremiah’s prophecy?<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">What was the last prophecy Jeremiah conveyed to those who were being led into exile. Alternatively, the midrash assumes that the book of Jeremiah is not written in chronological order, and asks which was his last prophecy (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Aba, and some say Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan: one said: Until, “He who scattered Israel will gather them” (Jeremiah 31:9). The other says: Until, “there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord, and your children will return to their border” (Jeremiah 31:16).<br>Upon his return,<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">From Rama (see Jeremiah 40:1).</i> he would find severed toes cast on the mountains. He would gather them, caress them, hug them, kiss them, and place them in his garment. He would say to them: ‘My children, did I not warn you of this and say to you: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark and before your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night” (Jeremiah 13:16)?’ Regarding that moment it is stated: “For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, and for the oases [<i>neot</i>] of the wilderness a lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:9) – for those beautiful and excellent mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, on the abodes [<i>neot</i>] of Jacob that have been transformed into a lamentation. “They did not hear the sound of livestock [<i>mikneh</i>]” (Jeremiah 9:9) – they did not hear the sound of words of Torah or the sound of the words of prophecy, but rather <i>mikneh</i>, the sound of words that arouse jealousy [<i>mekaneh</i>]. They aroused His zealotry with idol worship [<i>avoda zara</i>], just as it says: “They would arouse His jealousy with strangers [<i>zarim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:16). Therefore, “from the birds of the heavens to the animals, they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9).<br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: For fifty-two years, no bird was seen flying in the Land of Israel. What is the source? “From the birds of the heavens to the animals [<i>behema</i>], they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9); the numerical value of <i>behema</i> is fifty-two.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bet</i> – 2; <i>heh</i> – 5;<i> mem</i> – 40;<i> heh</i> – 5 = 52</i><br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Forty years before, they<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">God caused the Babylonians to plant the trees in preparation for the impending exile.</i> would plant date palms in Babylon, indicating that sweet foods accustom the tongue to Torah. Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abbahu said: There are seven hundred species of kosher fish, eight hundred species of kosher grasshoppers, and innumerable birds, and all of them were exiled with Israel to Babylon. When they returned, all of them returned with them with the exception of one fish whose name is <i>shibuta</i>. How were the fish exiled? Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: They were exiled via the depths, and they returned via the depths.<br>Rabbi Zeira said: Come and see how insolent is the Land of Israel, that it continues producing fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">It does so even though it was decreed that after Israel is exiled the land would remain desolate (see Leviticus 26:32).</i> Why does it produce fruit? Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: one said: Because they fertilize it. The other said: Because they overturn its soil.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Before Israel was exiled, it would produce even without these measures.</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said: For seven years, [the curse] of sulfur and salt<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 29:22</i> was fulfilled for them. Why to that extent? “He will promote a covenant with the multitudes for one period of seven years” (Daniel 9:27). What did the Cuthites among them do? They would sow it in small plots. They would sow here, and it would be burned, they would sow there and it would be burned. There was an incident involving an individual who was standing and plowing in the Beit Arava Valley, and his hand grasped his plowshare. Hot soil arose and burned his arm, to realize what is stated: “Sulfur and salt, its entire land is afire” (Deuteronomy 29:22).<br>Rabba bar Kahana said: They are neither an indication of forgiveness in the land nor an indication of desolation of the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">This statement refers to the return of the birds and fish to the Land of Israel, and to the original exit of the birds and fish from the land (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> but rather it is from before Him, to realize what is stated: “Fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, [and upon every bird of the heavens, and upon all that crawls on the ground, and upon all fish of the sea]” (Genesis 9:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Since these creatures are subject to domination by man, it stands to reason that if humanity could no longer reside in the land of Israel, neither could these creatures.</i> But in the future, everything will return.

Chapter 1

<b>“How does the greatly crowded city sit alone? She has become like a widow. Great among the nations, a princess among the states: She has become a vassal” (Lamentations 1:1).</b><br>“How [<i>eikha</i>] does…sit [alone].” Three prophesied with the term <i>eikha</i>: Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. Moses said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can I bear alone…” (Deuteronomy 1:12). Isaiah said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] did [the faithful city] become a harlot?” (Isaiah 1:21). Jeremiah said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does [the greatly crowded city] sit alone?” Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a noblewoman who had three friends. One saw her in her tranquility, one saw her in her debauchery, and one saw her in her disgrace. So, Moses saw them in their glory and their tranquility and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can I bear alone your troubles?” Isaiah saw them in their debauchery and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] did [the faithful city] become a harlot?” Jeremiah saw them in their disgrace and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does [the greatly crowded city] sit [alone]?”<br>They asked ben Azai, saying to him: ‘Our teacher, expound for us one matter from the scroll of Lamentations.’ He said to them: ‘Israel was exiled only after they denied the Unique One of the world, circumcision that was given after twenty generations, the Ten Commandments, the five books of the Torah; the numerical value of <i>eikha</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alef—</i>the Unique One of the world; <i>yod—</i>the Ten Commandments; <i>kaf—</i>twenty generations; <i>heh—</i>five books of Moses.</i><br>Rabbi Levi said: Israel was exiled only after they denied the thirty-six instances of <i>karet</i> in the Torah and the Ten Commandments, the numerical value of “how does…sit solitary [<i>eikha yasheva badad</i>]?”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eikha</i>: <i>Alef</i>  -1,  yod – 10, <i>kaf</i> – 20, <i>heh</i> – 5 = 36. <i>Badad</i>: Beit<i></i> – 2, <i>dalet</i> – 4, <i>dalet</i> – 4 = 10.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Avdimai of Haifa: [This is analogous] to a king who had a son. When he would perform his father’s will, [the king] would clothe him in fine silk, and when he would not perform his will, he would clothe him in the garments of an olive-press worker [<i>badad</i>]. So too Israel, as long as they would perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, it is written: “I clothed you in embroidery” (Ezekiel 16:10). Rabbi Sima said: Purple garments. Onkelos translated: Embroidered garments. But when they do not perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He clothes them in the garments of olive-press workers. That is what is written: “How does…sit solitary [<i>badad</i>]?”<br>Rav Naḥman said that Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The Holy One blessed be He summoned the ministering angels and said to them: ‘A flesh and blood king, when a relative of his dies and he mourns, what does he typically do?’ They said to Him: ‘He hangs sackcloth on his entrance.’ He said to them: ‘I, too, will do so.’ That is what is written: “I clothe the heavens in blackness and I place sackcloth as their garment” (Isaiah 50:3). ‘A flesh and blood king, what [else] does he typically do?’ They said to Him: ‘He extinguishes the lamps.’ He said to them: ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The sun and the moon darkened and the stars withdrew their shining” (Joel 4:15). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He overturns the beds.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “Until thrones were set in place and the Ancient One sat” (Daniel 7:9), [implying,] as it were, that they had been overturned.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Beds were a general term for anything one would sit on. The fact that the thrones, in this verse, were set in place, implies that previously they had been overturned as a sign of mourning.</i> ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He walks barefoot.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “His path is in tempest and in storm, and clouds are the dust of His feet” (Nahum 1:3). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He rends his purple garments.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord accomplished what He devised; He implemented [<i>bitza</i>] His statement [<i>emrato</i>]” (Lamentations 2:17). Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan explained it: What is <i>bitza emrato</i>? It is that He rent His purple garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The word rent, or tear, in Aramaic, <i>biza</i>, is similar to <i>bitza</i>. The word <i>emrato</i> is spelled the same as <i>imrato</i>, which in rabbinic parlance means the edge of one’s garment (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He sits in silence.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “Let him sit alone and be silent” (Lamentations 3:28). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He sits and weeps.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation and for baldness” (Isaiah 22:12).<br>Another matter: <i>Eikha</i>, Jeremiah said to them: ‘What did you see in idol worship that you are so enthusiastic to follow it? If it had a mouth to engage in debate, we would have said this.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We would have proven the falseness of idolatry and the idols themselves would have had to concur. The word <i>eikha</i> is being interpreted as two words: <i>Ei, ka</i>, “if…this” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Instead, we will speak of it and we will speak of Him.’ We will speak of it, “So said the Lord: Do not learn the way of the nations, and from the signs of the heavens do not be frightened, though the nations are frightened by them” (Jeremiah 10:2). We will speak of Him: “Tell them this: The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall vanish from the earth and from under these heavens. [He makes the earth with His might]” (Jeremiah 10:11–12). “The Portion of Jacob is not like these, for He is the one who forms everything, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Jeremiah 10:16).<br>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: The term <i>eikha</i> is nothing other than an expression of reproof. That is what is written: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us...”? (Jeremiah 8:8). Rabbi Neḥemya says: The term <i>eikha</i> is nothing other than an expression of lamentation. That is what is written: “The Lord God called to the man, and said to him: Where are you [<i>ayeka</i>]?” (Genesis 3:9), woe are you [<i>oy lekha</i>]. When was the scroll of Lamentations composed? Rabbi Yehuda says: It was composed in the days of Yehoyakim.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This was before the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. This is consistent with Rabbi Yehuda’s view that the term <i>eikha</i> is a term of reproof. In his view, Lamentations, or <i>Eikha</i>, was composed as a warning before the destruction.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘Does one weep over the dead before he dies? Rather, when was it composed? After the destruction of the Temple. This is its solution: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does…sit solitary?”’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase implies that Jerusalem was already desolate.</i>
“The greatly crowded city,” Rabbi Shmuel taught: There were twenty-four thoroughfares in Jerusalem, each and every thoroughfare had twenty-four streets, each and every street had twenty-four market streets, each and every market street had twenty-four store streets, each and every store street had twenty-four courtyards, each and every courtyard had twenty-four houses, and each and every courtyard would have twice the number of those who departed from Egypt emerging from it.<br>Know that it is so, as Rabbi Elazar said: There was an incident involving a traveler who was ascending to Jerusalem who took with him two hundred camels laden with pepper. He passed Tyre and found a certain tailor who was sitting near the city gates. He said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He said to him: ‘Will you not give me a bit?’ He said to him: ‘No.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The tailor asked to purchase a small amount, but the traveler wanted to sell his entire stock to one customer.</i> He said to him: ‘Then you will have a purchaser only in another city.’ When he arrived in Jerusalem, he found a certain tailor sitting at the gate of the walls, who said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Continue your cutting.’ He found another tailor who said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Continue your sewing.’ He said to him: ‘If I can purchase them, fine. But if not, I will bring you a person who can purchase all of them.’ He said to him [again]: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He took him and brought him into a certain courtyard and he showed him a <i>kor</i> of dinars. He said to him: ‘Look at these coins. If they are currency in your land, take from them.’ In the morning, [the visiting merchant] went to stroll in the marketplace and one of his friends encountered him. He said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He said to him: ‘Do you not have any that you could give me for one hundred dinars, for I have a feast today!’ He said: ‘I already sold it to so and so.’ He went to him. He said to him: ‘Do you have the pepper that you purchased? Give me a bit as I have a feast.’ He said to him: ‘What can I tell you? I already sold it to a certain tailor. However, I will tell him and he will give it to you.’ He went and he found it in a certain residence. Those who were in the first line [or purchasers] took one ounce each. Those who were in the second line took one-half ounce each. Those who were in the third line did not sense that there had been any at all, to realize what is stated: “The greatly crowded city.”<br>If you wish to ascertain how many multitudes there were in Jerusalem, you can ascertain it from the priests. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [This is analogous] to a pile of grain that was located in the grain marketplace. Everyone came to measure it but could not. There was one clever man there. He said to them: ‘If you seek to measure it, you can calculate it on the basis of its <i>teruma</i>.’ So too, if you wish to ascertain how many multitudes there were in Jerusalem, you can ascertain it from the priests. That is what is written: “Solomon slaughtered the peace-offering that he slaughtered to the Lord, cattle, twenty-two thousand, and of the flock, one hundred and twenty thousand” (I Kings 8:63). And we have learned: A bull is sacrificed by twenty-four [priests] and a ram by eleven.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Yoma</i> 2:7. The reference is to the number of priests who participated in all the rituals involved in the sacrifice of these offerings.</i><br>That is what is said of the first Temple. However, in the second Temple, one time King Agrippa sought to ascertain the number of the multitudes that were in Jerusalem. He said to the priests: ‘Set aside for me one kidney from each and every paschal offering.’ They set aside six hundred thousand pairs of kidneys, twice the number of those who departed from Egypt, and there was not any paschal offering that did not have more than ten registrants.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">One had to register in advance for a paschal offering, and such offerings were generally divided between numerous individuals.</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Even forty and even fifty. Bar Kappara said: Even one hundred, [and this is] not including one who was impure or on a distant journey. One time, they entered the Temple Mount and it could not hold them. There was one elderly man there and they trampled him. They called that Passover<i></i> the Passover of the crushed, because they crushed the elderly man.<br>How did Israel procreate? A person would marry off his son at the age of twelve to a woman fit to bear children. He would then marry off his grandson at the age of twelve. One would not reach the age of twenty-six until he saw children of his children, to realize what is stated: “May you see the children of your children. Peace to Israel” (Psalms 128:6).
“She has become like a widow.”<i></i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: They did not go to extremes vis-à-vis the attribute of justice, and the attribute of justice did not go to extremes in their regard.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They did not sin in an extreme fashion and they were not punished in an extreme fashion (see <i>Matnot Kehuna;</i> Maharzu).</i> They did not go to extremes vis-à-vis the attribute of justice, as it is stated: “The people were like complainers” (Numbers 11:1). “Complainers” is not written here, but rather, “like complainers.” “The princes of Judah were like those who move boundaries” (Hosea 5:10). “Those who move boundaries” is not written here, but rather, “like those who move boundaries.” “For like a wayward cow [Israel has strayed]” (Hosea 4:16), “For a [wayward] cow” is not written here, but rather, “like a wayward cow.” The attribute of justice, too, did not go to extremes in their regard. “She has become like a widow”—“A widow” is not written here, but rather, “like a widow”—like a woman whose husband went to a country overseas and plans to return to her. “He drew His bow like an enemy” (Lamentations 2:4), “enemy” is not written here, but rather, “like an enemy.” “The Lord was like an enemy” (Lamentations 2:5), “enemy” is not written here, but rather, “like an enemy.”<br>Another matter, “she has become like a widow.” Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukeva and the Rabbis, Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukeva said: [This is analogous] to a widow who was demanding her sustenance but was not demanding her marriage contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">After a man’s death, his widow may choose to continue to live in his home and to be supported by his estate. She may also leave and demand payment of the sum specified in her marriage contract. Israel is compared here to a widow who chooses to be supported by her late husband’s estate rather than leaving and cutting all ties to her husband.</i> The Rabbis said: [This is analogous] to a king who grew angry at the queen and wrote her a bill of divorce and then snatched it from her. Any time that she sought to marry another, he would say to her: ‘Where is your bill of divorce?’ Any time she would demand her sustenance, he would say to her: ‘Have I not already divorced you?’ So too, any time Israel would seek to engage in idol worship, the Holy One blessed be He would say to them: “Where is your mother’s bill of divorce?” (Isaiah 50:1). Any time they request that He perform miracles on their behalf, the Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘I have already divorced you.’ That is what is written: “I sent her away and gave her bill of divorce to her” (Jeremiah 3:8).<br>Another matter, “she has become like a widow.” Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis, Rabbi Akiva says: “Widow,” and you say “like a widow”? Rather, a widow from the Ten Tribes, but not a widow from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiva is asserting that Jerusalem is described as a widow from the Ten Tribes but not from Judah and Benjamin, because he holds that Lamentations was composed before Judah and Benjamin were exiled (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). Alternatively, because he holds that the Ten Tribes are not destined to return, but Judah and Benjamin will eventually return (Maharzu). </i> The Rabbis say: A widow from these and from those, but not from the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For neither Israel nor Judah is widowed from its God” (Jeremiah 51:5).
“Great [<i>rabati</i>] among the nations,” but was it not already stated [in the verse]: “greatly [<i>rabati</i>] crowded”? Why does the verse say: “Great [<i>rabati</i>] among the nations”? It means great in intellect. Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rabbi Yosei: In any province to which one of the residents of Jerusalem would go, they would offer a seat of honor for him to sit upon so they could hear his wisdom.<br>An individual from Jerusalem went to a province, and the time arrived for him to die. He summoned his landlord and deposited his belongings with him. He said to him: ‘If my son comes from Jerusalem and performs three wise deeds, give him what is mine. If not, do not give him what is mine.’<br>They<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The residents of the province mentioned above.</i> made an agreement between them that none of them would show another’s house to a visitor. He [the individual from Jerusalem] died and he passed to his eternal home. Some time later, his son came. When he entered the gate of the wall of that province, he saw one carrying a bundle of wood. He said: ‘Are you selling the bundle of wood?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘Take its price from me and take it to so-and-so.’ He took its price and took it to so-and-so. He was going and [the deceased man’s son] was following him until he reached his residence. He said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The wood seller said to the landlord.</i> ‘Hey, so-and-so, come take a bundle of wood.’ He said to him: ‘Did I tell you to bring me a bundle of wood?’ He said to him: ‘True, you did not tell me, but it belongs to this person who followed me.’ Immediately, he opened his house before him, and they greeted one another. That is one [wise] deed.<br>He said to him: ‘Who are you?’ He said: ‘I am the son of the man who died in your [house].’ He brought him in and prepared a cooked meal for him. That man<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The landlord.</i> had two sons and two daughters. When the time of the meal arrived, they brought before him for the meal five cooked pullets. When they were ready to eat, he said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The host said to the guest.</i> ‘Take and distribute it.’ He [the guest] said to him: ‘It is not mine.’ He [the host] said to him: ‘I want you to take and distribute it.’ He took and distributed it, and placed one pullet between the man and his wife. He took the second pullet and placed it between the two men who were his two sons. He took the third and placed it between his two daughters. He took two pullets and placed them before himself. He ate them and they did not say anything to him. This is the second [wise] deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It will be explained below why the guest did this and why it was considered a wise deed.</i><br>At evening time, [the host] brought a fattened chicken for the meal. He said to [the guest]: ‘Take and distribute it.’ He said to him: ‘It is not mine.’ He said to him: ‘Take and distribute it, as that is my will.’ He took and distributed it and placed the head before the man. He took the innards and placed it before his wife. He took the two thighs and gave them to his two sons. He took the two wings and gave them to his two daughters. He took the entire body and placed it before himself. This is the third [wise] deed.<br>[The landlord] said: ‘Is this how they distribute in your place? You distributed the first time and I did not say anything to you, and now you do this?’ He said to him: ‘Did I not say to you that it is not mine? Nonetheless, what I have distributed, I distributed properly. The first time, you brought five pullets for the meal. You, your wife, and the pullet equal three. Your two sons and the pullet equal three. Your two daughters and the pullet equal three. I and the two pullets equal three. Did I take anything from your portions? Now, you brought a chicken. I took the head and gave it to you, as you are the head of the household. I took the innards and placed them before your wife, because children emerge from her innards. I took the two thighs and placed them before your two sons, because they are the pillars of the house. I took the two wings and placed them before your daughters, as tomorrow they will depart, fly from your house, and go to their husbands. I took this ship,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">When the body of the chicken without the extremities  is cut open it resembles a ship.</i> as I came in a ship and I will go in a ship. Rise and give me what is mine that my father deposited with you, and I will leave immediately.’ He gave him what was his and he went in peace. That is what is stated: “Great among the nations,” great in intellect.<br>Four Jerusalemites came to Athens and were received by a certain person. In the evening he made a feast for them. After they ate and drank, he prepared four beds for them. One of them was broken and supported by the next one. When they got up from the feast to go to sleep, he said: ‘I heard that the residents of Jerusalem are extremely wise, let me hear some of what they are saying.’ He went and slept in [a room] adjacent to theirs.<br>The one who was sleeping on the broken bed awoke during the night and said to the others: ‘What do you think, that I am sleeping on a bed? I am sleeping on the ground but I am suspended.’ Another said to them: ‘The meat that we ate this evening had the taste of dog.’ Another said to them: ‘And the wine that we drank tonight had the taste of a grave.’ Another said to them: ‘You are wondering about those [matters]? The man who is the homeowner is not even the son of his father.’<br>When the man heard these matters, he said: ‘One is true and three are false.’ He arose in the morning and went to the butcher. He said to him: ‘Give me from the meat that you gave me last night.’ He said to him: ‘I have none.’ He said to him: ‘What was special about it?’ He said to him: ‘We had one lamb that was a suckling and its mother died. We had a female dog and the lamb suckled from it. At night, we were short on meat and I sought to bring some. I did not have any other, so I gave you from that [lamb].’ He said: ‘Two are true and two are false.’<br>He went to the winemaker. He said to him: ‘Give me some of that wine that you gave me last night.’ He said to him: ‘I have none.’ He said to him: ‘What was special about it?’ He said to him: ‘We had one vine and it was planted over our father’s grave. I squeezed it and placed it in wicker baskets. I was short on wine and I sought to bring some. I did not have any other, so I gave you from that [vine].’ He said: ‘Three are true and one is false.’<br>He went to his mother and said to her: ‘Whose son am I?’ She said to him: ‘My son, you are the son of your father.’ He said to her: ‘Tell me the truth, whose son am I, and if not I will sever your head.’ She said to him: ‘My son, your father was unable to beget children and I feared lest his relatives take my property.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">After his death, as the wife was not considered an heir.</i> Did I perform a sin that I went and engaged in an illicit relationship and brought you into all this wealth and property?’ He said to her: ‘What do we see here?

A certain Jerusalemite went to see a merchant in Athens. He was put up in an inn. He found people who were beginning to sit and drink wine. After he ate and drank, he sought to sleep there. They said to him: ‘We agreed among ourselves that we will not receive any person as a lodger until he performs three jumps.’ He said to them: ‘I do not know how you jump. Get up and perform it before me, and I will perform it like you after you.’ One of them stood, jumped, and found himself in the middle of the inn. He performed another jump and found himself at the gate at the entrance of the inn. He performed another jump and found himself outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">All those inside followed the jumper outside to watch him.</i> [The Jerusalemite] stood and bolted the gate in their faces.

An Athenian came to Jerusalem and encountered a certain child. He gave him coins and said to him: ‘Go bring me figs and grapes.’ He said to him: ‘Well done, you with your coins and me with my feet.’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">We are partners in the fruit, as each of us will have contributed to gathering them.</i> When [the child] returned, [the Athenian] said to him: ‘Take it and divide it.’ The child took it and placed before himself the bad ones and he took the good ones and placed them before that man. He said: ‘It is true what they say, that the residents of Jerusalem are extremely wise. It is because he knew that he did not give any coins of his own that he took the bad ones for himself and he placed the good ones before this man. But let us draw lots. If I go and yours comes to me, I will take what is before you. If what is before me comes to you, you will take it.’ They did so together,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They wrote their names on two lots, mixed them up, and each drew a lot.</i> and [the child] took what [the Athenian] had.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The child took what the Athenian had.</i>
An Athenian came to Jerusalem and encountered a certain child. He gave him coins and said to him: ‘Go and bring me something so that I can eat, be sated, and have leftovers to take on the road.’ He went and brought him salt. He said to him: ‘Did I tell you to bring me salt?’ He said to him: ‘Did you not say to me: Go and bring me something so that I can eat, be sated, and have leftovers to take on the road? By your life, there is enough here for you to eat, be sated, and have leftovers to take on the road.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The money he had received was not nearly enough to purchase the quantity of food the Athenian had asked for. The child therefore bought salt, which was inexpensive. There was enough salt to use together with a satisfying meal and to have leftovers for the journey (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>
An Athenian came to Jerusalem and found a discarded mortar. He took it and brought it to a tailor. He said to him: ‘Sew this broken mortar for me.’ [The tailor] took out a handful of sand and said to him: ‘Spin threads for me and I will sew it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Just as one cannot spin thread from sand, one cannot sew together a broken mortar. See <i>Etz Yosef</i> and Rabbi David Luria, who interpret this passage allegorically as a debate as to whether Israel can again experience redemption.</i>
An Athenian came to Jerusalem and encountered a certain child. He gave him coins and said to him: ‘Go and bring me eggs and cheese.’ When [the child] returned, [the Athenian] said to him: ‘Show me which is the cheese from a white goat and which is from a black goat.’ [The child] said to him: ‘You are an elderly man. You show me which is an egg from a white chicken and which is from a black one.’<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi David Luria interprets this allegorically: The Athenian argued that although the Jews used to be distinct from the gentiles due to their religious beliefs and conducts, they had become indistinguishable, just as cheeses from a black goat and a white goat are indistinguishable. The child answered that the correct metaphor is the eggs from a black chicken and a white chicken. Even if they look the same, their potential is vastly different, and when their chicks hatch, that difference will become evident to all.</i>
An Athenian came to Jerusalem and encountered a certain priest. He said to him: ‘How much smoke does a bundle of wood produce? He said to him: ‘When it is wet, it all becomes smoke. When it is dry, one-third becomes smoke, one-third ashes, and one-third is consumed by the fire.’ From where did he learn this? From the wood of the arrangement [on the Temple altar].
An Athenian came to Jerusalem. He entered a school and found children sitting there but their teacher was not there with them. He was asking them questions and they would respond. They said to him: ‘Let us agree between us that whoever asks a question and defeats his counterpart, they will take his garments.’ He said to them: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘You, who are residents of this place, should be first.’ They said to him: ‘You respond first because you are an elderly man.’ They said to him: ‘These items, what are they? Nine exit, eight enter, two pour, one drinks, and twenty-four are attendants.’ He could not respond and they took his garments. He came to Rabbi Yoḥanan, their teacher. He said to him: ‘Alas, rabbi, there is this great evil in your midst, that when a person comes as a visitor among you, you take his garments.’ He said to him: ‘Is it, perhaps, that they said something to you and you were unable to respond to them, and they took your garments?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘What did they say to you?’ He said to him: ‘Such and such they said to me.’ He said to him: ‘My son, nine exit, these are the months of a child in the womb. Eight enter, these are the eight days of circumcision. Two pour, these are the two breasts, both of which pour. One drinks, this is the baby who was born. Twenty-four attendants, these are the twenty-four months of nursing.’ Immediately, he came, responded to them, and took his garments. They read in his regard: “Had you not ploughed with my calf, you would not have solved my riddle” (Judges 14:18).
An Athenian came to Jerusalem. He devoted three and a half years to learn the language of wisdom,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Scholars would speak in riddles that could not be understood by the average person (see <i>Eruvin</i> 54a).

An Athenian came to Jerusalem, and he greatly mocked the residents of Jerusalem. They said: ‘Who will go and bring him to us?’ One person said to them: ‘I will go and I will bring him with his head shaved.’ The Jerusalemite went to Athens and was received by that man.

He travelled, ascended to Jerusalem, and sat at the gate of the city walls. He sent after [the Jew] and he came.

When a person would come to purchase sandals from him, he would say to him: ‘How much does a pair of these sandals cost?’ [The Athenian] would say to him: ‘Some are ten and some are nine dinars; however, I will not take less than eight dinars.’ When [the purchaser] would hear this, he would knock him on his head with a sandal, go, and not make the purchase. He said to [the Jew]: ‘Did I treat you so badly when you were in my place?’ He said to him: ‘From now on, do not mock [<i>tefalei</i>] the residents of Jerusalem.’ &lt;<i>Tefalei</i> is a term meaning examination.

One of the students of Rabbi Yoḥanan was sitting before him. [Rabbi Yoḥanan] explained [the lesson] to him but he did not understand it. [Rabbi Yoḥanan] said to him: ‘Why do you not understand?’ He said to him: ‘I saw three harsh matters last night and I do not know what they mean.’ He said: ‘Tell me what they were.’ He said to him: ‘I saw in my dream that they were saying to me: In Adar you will die, you will not see Nisan, and you will sow but you will not reap.’ He said to him: ‘All three of them are good.

A certain woman came to Rabbi Elazar. She said to him: ‘I saw that the rafter in the house snapped.’ He said to her: ‘This woman will bear a male child.’ She went, and so it was for her.

She came on another occasion for a third time. She found his students sitting in the school but their teacher was not there. She said to them: ‘Where is your teacher?’ They said to her: ‘What do you want from him?’ She said to them: ‘Perhaps you are wise enough to interpret a dream like your teacher?’ They said to her: ‘Tell it to us, what you want, and we will interpret it for you.’ She said to them: ‘I saw in my dream that the rafter of this woman’s<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to herself.</i> house snapped.’ They said to her: ‘That woman will bury her husband.’ When she went out from before them, she began wailing.

He said to him: ‘Which road is closer to the city?’ He said to him: ‘This one is close but far, and that one is far but close.’ Rabbi Yehoshua went on the one that was close but far. When he reached the city, he found gardens and orchards surrounding the wall. He returned to that child and said to him: ‘My son, is this road, in fact, closer to the city?’ He said to him: ‘You are a Sage of Israel!

The garlic and the onions are plentiful.’ When he entered the city, he found a girl standing and filling [her pitcher] from the spring. He said to her: ‘Give me water to drink.’ She said to him: ‘To you and to your donkey.’ After he drank and turned to go, he said to her: ‘My daughter, you have acted like Rebecca.’ She said to him: ‘I have acted like Rebecca, but you have not acted like Eliezer.’<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">After Rebecca drew water for the servant of Abraham (identified by the Sages as Eliezer), and for his camels, he gave her jewelry (Genesis 24:22).</i><br>It is taught: One leaves a portion from food cooked in a pot, but one does not leave a portion from food cooked in a stew pot.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">A similar statement in <i>Eruvin</i> 53 reads: “One does not leave a portion from the pot but one leaves a portion from the plate.” Rashi explains that the waiter was expected to serve all the food that was cooked, but participants at the meal were expected to leave over some of the food that was served. These leftovers would be eaten by the waiter.</i> There was an incident where Rabbi Yehoshua was hosted by a widowed woman. The first day she brought him a cooked item and he ate it and did not leave a portion for her. The second day she brought him a cooked item and he ate it and did not leave a portion for her. On the third day, she oversalted a cooked dish of pounded grain. After Rabbi Yehoshua tasted it, he withdrew his hand from it. She said to him: ‘Rabbi, why did you withdraw your hand from this pounded grain?’ He said to her: ‘I already ate earlier in the day.’ She said to him: ‘If you ate earlier in the day, why did you not mimimize the bread, just as you minimized this pounded grain? Perhaps you left a portion. From the two cooked items that you ate, why did you not leave a portion like you did from this pounded grain?’ At that moment, Rabbi Yehoshua said: ‘In all my days, no person has ever gotten the best of me except for this widow, a young girl, and those children, to realize what is stated: “Great among the nations,” great in intellect.
“A princess among the nations,” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because Israel violated the terms that they accepted at Sinai, therefore, “she has become a vassal [<i>lamas</i>].” Sinai is <i>lamas</i>, the numerical value of this equals the numerical value of that.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Sinai: <i>samekh</i> – 60, <i>yod</i> – 10, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>yod</i> – 10 = 130. <i>Lamas:</i> <i>Lamed</i> – 30, <i>mem</i> – 30, <i>samekh</i> – 60 = 130.</i> Rabbi Yishmael bar Naḥman said: Because Israel engaged in idol worship, therefore, “she has become a vassal [<i>lamas</i>].” <i>Lamas</i> is figure [<i>semel</i>].

He said to Him: ‘You should have looked at the good ones among them.’ He said to him: ‘Most of them were wicked, as it is written: “She has performed her evil schemes with multitudes” (Jeremiah 11:15).’ He said to Him: ‘You should have looked to the circumcision in their flesh.’ He said to him: ‘As you live, they repudiated it, as it is stated: “The sacred flesh is passed from you” (Jeremiah 11:15). Moreover, these rejoiced at the downfall of those, as it is written: “When you beheld evil, then you rejoice” (Jeremiah 11:15), and it is written: “One who rejoices at calamity will not be absolved” (Proverbs 17:5).’ Why was the scroll of Lamentations stated as an alphabetical acrostic? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: Because it is written: “All Israel have violated Your Torah” (Daniel 9:11), which is written [with letters] from <i>alef</i> through <i>tav</i>; therefore, the scroll was written alphabetically, one corresponding to the other.
Rabbi Neḥemya says: Although Jeremiah cursed them alphabetically in Lamentations, Isaiah preceded him and brought a remedy for each and every verse of them until: “Let all their wickedness come before You” (Lamentations 1:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash below (chapter 23) explains this further and cites the view of the Rabbis.</i>

What are “the tools of exile”? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Ḥalafta, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: A leather flask, a rug, and a bowl. Each and every one of them must serve two purposes: One places flour in the leather flask and places it beneath his head; one eats and drinks from a bowl; a rug is for sitting and to sleep upon. Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Ḥalafta said: A container with four handles that holds everything. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: “Ezekiel will be an example to you; in accordance with everything that he has done you will do…” (Ezekiel 24:22). But they did not do so, rather, when they were exiled, one came to knead his dough but did not know with what, and he would dig in the ground and make a hole. He would knead it in it, and pebbles would stick to their dough. When he would put it in his mouth, his teeth would become dull, to realize what is stated: “He broke my teeth” (Lamentations 3:16).

Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Aivu says: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I remember how I was broken before You in the night of the kingdoms,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The times during which Israel suffered persecution at the hands of foreign nations is are referred to here as night.</i> just as it says: “Blessed is God, the Most High, who broke [<i>migen</i>] your enemies into your hand”’ (Genesis 14:20). Rabbi Yehuda says: I remember the songs that I sang before You in the nights, just as it says: “[The Lord is to save me] and we will play my songs all the days of our lives” (Isaiah 38:20), this is the night of Pharaoh, as it is written: “It was at midnight” (Exodus 12:29). And the night of Gideon who smote the Midianite and Amalekite camp, as it is written: “It was on that night” (Judges 7:9). And the night of Sennacherib, in whose regard it is written: “It was on that night, and the angel of God emerged” (II Kings 19:35).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Yehuda, the reference is to the songs Israel sang when they experienced salvation at night. Each of the three verses cited refers to an event in which an enemy of Israel was defeated at night.</i><br>“I meditate with my heart” (Psalms 77:7), I speak with my heart. “And my spirit searches” (Psalms 77:7), I examine my actions. And it says: “Will the Lord forsake forever? Will He never again appease?” (Psalms 77:8). God forbid, He has not abandoned and will not abandon, as it is written: “For the Lord will not forsake forever” (Lamentations 3:31).<br>“Will He never again appease [<i>lirtzot</i>]” or be appeased [<i>leratzot</i>]? In the past He would appease others. When Moses was angry, it says: “And he returned [<i>veshav</i>] to the camp” (Exodus 33:11). Read it as: And return [<i>veshuv</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Despite Moses’s anger in the wake of the sin of the Golden Calf, God implores him to return to the camp.</i> When Elijah was angry, it says: “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus” (I Kings 19:15); but now, He does not appease, and is not appeased.<br>“Has His kindness come to an end [<i>he’afes</i>] forever, [is His decision final for all generations]?” (Psalms 77:9). What is <i>he’afes</i>? Rabbi Reuven said: It is a Greek term, just as it says: “He will say none [<i>afes</i>]” (Amos 6:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>afes</i> is a Greek term meaning “let go,” similar to the usage of the term in Amos, where one is asked if there is anyone with him and he says “none,” meaning dismiss the thought from your mind. Thus, It is not God’s kindness that has ceased, but He has let go of it in the sense that He has ceased to implement His kindness in the world.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Ḥanina said: Has the matter that the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses, “I will favor whom I favor” (Exodus 33:19), concluded? Rabbi Simon says: It has already been concluded, and this was confirmed by means of Jeremiah: “For I have withdrawn My peace [and kindness and mercy from this people]” (Jeremiah 16:5).<br>“Has God forgotten to be gracious [<i>ḥanot</i>]” (Psalms 77:10), has God forgotten His encampment [<i>ḥanoto</i>] in the wilderness, “According to the word of God they would encamp” (Numbers 9: 20). Has He forgotten “God, merciful and gracious [<i>veḥanun</i>]”? (Exodus 34:6). “Has He closed in anger His mercy? Sela” (Psalms 77:10); even though He is angry, His mercy is near. Yet Zion said: ‘The Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me,’ as it is written: “Zion said: The Lord has forsaken me [and the Lord has forgotten me]” (Isaiah 49:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">However, God responds: “Yet I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15).</i><br>“Then I said: This is my weakness [<i>ḥaloti</i>], [the right hand of the Most High has changed]” (Psalms 77:11). Rabbi Alexandrai said: Because we did not entreat [<i>ḥilinu</i>] You in repentance, the right hand has changed.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The right hand signifies God’s support and giving. This has changed from supporting Israel to supporting its enemies (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: The oath that He made with us at Ḥorev<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">This is another name for Sinai.</i> has been violated [<i>nitḥalela</i>], and so the right hand has changed.<br>Rabbi Simon said: Have you ever heard that the orb of the sun is ill and unable to rise and serve? For His servants there are no illnesses, but before Him there is illness?<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>ḥaloti</i> is expounded to mean illnesses [<i>ḥolayin</i>], such that the verse reads “this is my illness.” As the midrash explains, it cannot be that God’s providence has changed due to His illness, as that is impossible.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [This is analogous] to a mighty person who was there in a province, and all the residents of the province relied on him and would say: ‘No troops will come here. If troops came to the city, once he would emerge and show his face, they would flee immediately.’ One time the troops came, and he said to them: ‘My right hand hurts.’<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is not ready for battle, the enemies are no longer afraid of him.</i> However, the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save…” (Isaiah 59:1).<br>“The right hand of the Most High has changed.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If it is due to illnesses, there is hope, for one who is hurt will ultimately heal. But if it has changed, there is no hope.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">In the case of the change to God’s right hand, as it were, there is hope, because the change is based on something akin to illness. The verse from Isaiah cited above is followed by the following: “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God” (Isaiah 59:2) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> That is the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi &lt;who said: “for you have despised us, [you were exceedingly angry at us]” (lamentations 5:22). if it is despising, there is no hope. if it is anger, there is hope, as one who is angry will ultimately be appeased.&gt;<br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You wept a gratuitous weeping; ultimately, you will weep a weeping of substance.’ Where did Israel weep a gratuitous weeping? “Moses heard the people weeping according to its families” (Numbers 11:10). “The entire congregation raised and sounded their voice [and the people wept that night]” (Numbers 14:1). Where did Israel weep a weeping of substance? Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Aivu said: Once in Rama and once in Babylon. In Rama, as it is written: “So said the Lord: A voice is heard in Rama, wailing, bitter weeping, [Rachel weeping for her children]” (Jeremiah 31:15). In Babylon, as it is written: “By the rivers of Babylon, [there we sat and also wept]” (Psalms 137:1). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: One in the “province of Judah” (Ezra 5:8) and one in Babylon. In the province of Judah, “she weeps bitterly at night” (Lamentations 1:2). In Babylon, “by the rivers of Babylon.”<br>Rabbi Aivu said: So said the Holy One blessed be He to Israel: ‘As a reward for that weeping, I will gather in your exiles.’ That is what is written: “So said the Lord, restrain your voice from weeping…there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 31:16–17).<br>“She weeps bitterly [<i>bakho tivkeh</i>],” she will weep [<i>bakho</i>] due to one calf; she will weep [<i>tivkeh</i>] due to two calves.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash expounds the doubled Hebrew expression <i>bakho tivkeh</i> (in which the root <i>bet-kaf-heh</i> is used twice consecutively) to refer to two sins: The sin of the Golden Calf in the wilderness and Jeroboam’s two golden calves in the Land of Israel (see I Kings 12:26–30).</i> Another matter, over Judah, and over Zion and Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Zion and Jerusalem count as one. Alternatively, they are separate and there is a third source of weeping expressed in the verse in Lamentations, which continues: “her tears are on her cheeks” (Lamentations 1:2).</i> Another matter, she will weep [<i>bakho</i>] over the exile of the Ten Tribes; she will weep [<i>tivkeh</i>] over the exile of Judah and Benjamin. Another matter, she weeps and causes others to weep with her, she weeps and causes the Holy One blessed be He to weep with her, as it is written: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation” (Isaiah 22:12). She weeps and causes the ministering angels to weep with her, as it is written: “Behold, their angels cry out outside [<i>ḥutza</i>], [the messengers of peace weep bitterly]” (Isaiah 33:7). Rabbi Ze’eira said: <i>Ḥitza</i> is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ḥutza</i> is written without a <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>ḥitza</i>.</i> it is unnatural [<i>ḥitza</i>] for him to slaughter him.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Ze’eira interprets this verse as pertaining to God’s command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

Thus, he interprets the verse in Genesis to mean that God took Abraham outside and directed him to look toward the heavens, and he interprets the verse in Isaiah to mean that the angels cry in the heavens.</i><br>“She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the heavens and the earth to weep with her. That is what is written: “The sun and the moon darkened” (Joel 2:10). “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the mountains and the hills to weep with her. That is what is written: “I saw the mountains [they are quaking, and all the hills have disintegrated]” (Jeremiah 4:24). “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the seventy nations to weep with her. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The seventy bulls that Israel would sacrifice on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> correspond to the seventy nations, so that the world would not be vacant of them. “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and casues the congregation of Israel to weep with her. That is what is written: “The entire congregation raised [<i>vatisa</i>]…[and the people wept that night]” (Numbers 14:1). Rabbi Ḥunya taught it in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: <i>Vatisa</i> is written, they left a bad debt for the generations, just as it says: “When you lend [<i>tasheh</i>] to your neighbor” (Deuteronomy 24:10).
“At night,” why at night? Because sound travels only at night, that is why it is stated: “At night.” Rabbi Aivu said: Night draws lamentation with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">When one cries at night, it has a greater impact on those who hear it, and they are moved to cry as well.</i> There was an incident involving a certain woman who was in Rabban Gamliel’s neighborhood. She had a young son and he died. She would weep over him at night. Rabban Gamliel would hear her voice and recall the destruction of the Temple. He wept with her until his eyelashes fell out. When his disciples sensed it, they arose and evacuated her from his neighborhood.
“And her tears are on her cheeks [<i>leḥya</i>],” over her priests, just as it says: “He shall give to the priest the foreleg, the jaw [<i>haleḥayayim</i>], and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Alternatively, over her mighty, just as it says: “He found a fresh jawbone [<i>leḥi</i>] of a donkey [and he put forth his hand and took it and smote a thousand men with it]” (Judges 15:15). Alternatively, over her judges, just as you say: “They strike [the judge of Israel] on the cheek [<i>haleḥi</i>] with a rod” (Micah 4:14). Alternatively, over her lads; you find that when the enemies entered the Temple, they seized the lads and bound their hands behind them. They were weeping and the tears were flowing on their cheeks. They could not wipe them and they fell on their cheeks like the scar of a boil.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The tears seared their cheeks, similar to a wound, because they could not wipe them off.</i>
“She has no comforter.” Rabbi Levi said: Any place that it is stated: “Has no [<i>ein</i>],” [ultimately] she will have. “Sarai was barren, she had no [<i>ein</i>] child” (Genesis 11:30), but [ultimately] she had, as it is stated: “The Lord remembered Sarah” (Genesis 21:1). Similarly, “Hannah had no [<i>ein</i>] children” (I Samuel 1:2), and [ultimately] she had, as it is stated: “For the Lord remembered Hannah” (I Samuel 2:21). Similarly, “She is Zion, she has no one [<i>ein</i>] seeking her” (Jeremiah 30:17), and [ultimately] she will have, as it is stated: “A redeemer will come to Zion” (Isaiah 59:20). So, too, it says: “She has no [<i>ein</i>] comforter,” and [ultimately] she will have, as it is stated: “I, it is I, who am your Comforter” (Isaiah 51:12).
“All her allies have betrayed her, have become [her enemies].” Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan said: This is Mikhael and Gavriel.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Even these angels, who would defend Israel in the heavenly court, turned against it.</i>
<b>“Judah was exiled due to affliction and great enslavement.

Alternatively, “due to affliction [<i>me’oni</i>],” because they took the collateral of a poor man [<i>ani</i>] into their homes, just as it says: “If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his collateral” (Deuteronomy 24:12).

They went and found him at the city gate. When he came, Rabban Yoḥanan stood before him. Vespasian said to him: ‘You stand before this repulsive old man?’ He said to him: ‘By your life, if there was another like him, and you had double the [number of your] soldiers, you would not be able to conquer [the city.’ He said to him: ‘What is his strength?’ He said to him: ‘He eats one <i>gamzuz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">A fruit similar to a fig (<i>Arukh</i>).</i> and from it studies one hundred chapters.’ He said to him: ‘Why is he so emaciated?’ He said to him: ‘It is due to the effects of fasts and abstinences.’ [Vespasian] sent and brought physicians and they would feed him a little at a time and would give him to drink a little at a time, until his body was restored [to good health].

When Israel does not perform the will of the Omnipresent, they, as it were, exhaust the great power on high, as it is written: “You abandoned the Rock that begot you” (Deuteronomy 32:18).

When Rabbi Yosei of Milḥaya died, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish went up to perform an act of kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">They went to participate in the funeral.</i> and Rabbi Yitzḥak Pesaka went up with them.

Why to that extent? “The wisdom of her wise will be lost and the understanding of her men of understanding will be concealed” (Isaiah 29:14).’ Rabbi Yitzḥak Pesaka said: ‘May the mouth of this man be blessed.’ Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: ‘Had we not allowed him, from where would we have heard this pearl?’<br>The Divine Spirit was shouting and saying: “See, Lord, my affliction, for the enemy has expanded.”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash has returned to explicating the verse in Lamentations 1:8. The point is that the first part of the verse is a description of what has happened, whereas the phrase “see, Lord…” is the prophet, influenced by the Divine Spirit, calling out to God.</i> “Evildoers dig pits for me that do not accord with Your Torah” (Psalms 119:85). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said two [examples]: It is written: “Do not take the mother with the young” (Deuteronomy 22:6), and here: “A mother was torn apart with her children” (Hosea 10:14);<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah prohibits trapping the mother bird while she is with her young, but the enemies attacked mothers in the presence of their children.</i> that is, “that do not accord with Your Torah.”<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said another: It is written: “To eradicate an infant from the street” (Jeremiah 9:20), but not from the synagogues; “young men from the squares” (Jeremiah 9:20), but not from the study halls. But here, “the wrath of the Lord arose against them…[He struck down the young warriors among them]” (Psalms 78:31);<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">The “young warriors” refers to those involved in the study of Torah. At times the debate of matters of <i>halakha</i> in the course of study is compared to war (see, e.g., <i>Megilla</i> 15b). Alternatively, some suggest that the correct version of the text is as cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Tehillim</i> 877, which provides a different prooftext: “Who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary” (II Chronicles 36:17) (Rabbi David Luria; <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> that is, “that do not accord with Your Torah.”<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said two [examples]: It is written: “An ox or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day” (Leviticus 22:28), but here, child and mother were killed on one day, as it is stated: “A mother was torn apart with her children” (Hosea 10:14); that is, “that do not accord with Your Torah.”<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said another: It is written: “Who will hunt game of a beast…he shall [pour out its blood and] cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). But here, “They spilled their blood like water around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them” (Psalms 79:3); that is, “that do not accord with Your Torah.”<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You afforded burial to donkeys, but to Your children You did not afford burial.’ You afforded burial to donkeys, these are the Egyptians. That is what is written: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20). And Rabbi Berekhya said: Because the sea would cast them to the dry land and the dry land cast them to the sea. The sea said to the dry land: ‘Accept your people,’ and the dry land said to the sea: ‘Accept your people.’ The dry land said: ‘If when I accepted only Abel’s blood, it is stated in my regard: “Cursed is the land” (Genesis 3:17), how can I accept the blood of this entire multitude?’ [This continued] until the Holy One blessed be He took an oath to it that He would not place it on trial. That is what is written: “You extended Your right hand; the earth swallowed them” (Exodus 15:12). The right hand is nothing other than an oath, as it is stated: “The Lord took an oath by His right hand” (Isaiah 62:8). But to your people, you did not afford burial, that is, “that do not accord with Your Torah.”
<b>“The adversary extended his hand over all her delights; for she saw the nations entering her Sanctuary, whom You had commanded that they should not enter Your assembly” (Lamentations 1:10).</b><br>“The adversary extended his hand.” You find that when the enemies entered the Temple, Amonites and Moavites entered with them. Everyone was running to plunder silver and gold, and the Amonites and Moavites were running to plunder the Torah, in order to remove “An Amonite and Moavite shall not enter the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi ben Perata: This is analogous to a conflagration that was ignited in a king’s palace. Everyone was running to plunder the silver and the gold while a slave ran to plunder his writ of servitude. So too, when the enemies entered the Temple, Amonites and Moavites entered with them. Everyone was running to plunder silver and gold, and the Amonites and Moavites were running to plunder the Torah, in order to remove “An Amonite and Moavite shall not enter the assembly of the Lord.”<br>Abraham bestowed four good things upon Lot.

And it says: “He returned all the property, [and also his brother Lot and his property he returned]” (Genesis 14:16).

Isaiah said: “A prophecy of Moav: For on the night that Ar of Moav is plundered, it is ruined; for on the night that Kir of Moav is plundered, it is ruined” (Isaiah 15:1). Jeremiah said: “Behold, days are coming, the utterance of the Lord, and I will sound to Raba of the children of Amon an alarm of war, and it will become a mound of desolation, and its environs will be burned in fire, and Israel will inherit its inheritors, said the Lord” (Jeremiah 49:2). Ezekiel said: “To the children of the east, against the children of Amon, and I will give it as a heritage, so that the children of Amon will not be remembered among the nations. I will administer punishments to Moav, and they will know that I am the Lord” (Ezekiel 25:10–11). Zephaniah said: “Therefore, as I live, the utterance of the Lord of hosts, God of Israel, Moav will be like Sodom and the children of Amon like Gomorrah, a rustling thornbush, a salt mine, a desolate wasteland forever. The remnant of My people will plunder them and the rest of My nation will inherit them” (Zephaniah 2:9).
<b>“All its people are sighing, seeking bread; they have given their delights for food to restore life.

One said to her counterpart while they were fighting with one another: ‘Won’t you go away from here, as your face appears like that of a Jewess.’ Some time later they reconciled.

<b>“From on high He sent fire into my bones, and He crushed them; He spread a net for my feet, He turned me back. He rendered me desolate, suffering all day” (Lamentations 1:13).</b><br>“From on high He sent fire into my bones.” Rabbi Ami asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, he said to him: ‘Because I heard about you, that you are a master of <i>aggada</i>, what is [the meaning of] that which is written: “For Your righteousness [<i>vetzikatekha</i>], God, reaches on high”?’ (Psalms 71:19). He said to him: ‘Just as those below are required to perform charity [<i>tzedaka</i>] with one another, so those on high are required to perform charity with one another.’<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Any place where it is stated: “He said, he said,”<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Wherever the term “he said” appears twice in the introduction to a single statement.</i> it is stated only to be expounded. That is what is written: “He said to the man clothed in linen, and He said: Come to between the <i>galgal</i><b> </b>[beneath the cherub, and fill your hands with smoldering coals from between the cherubs, and cast them upon the city]” (Ezekiel 10:2). What is “He said,” “He said,” twice? It is that the Holy One blessed be He spoke to the angel, and the angel [then] said to the cherub: ‘Even though the Holy One blessed be He decreed upon me to take the coals, I am not allowed to enter behind your partition. Rather, perform an act of kindness and give me two of your coals so I will not be burned.’ That is what is written: “He carried it and placed it into the cupped hands of the one clothed in linen” (Ezekiel 10:7). What is “he carried it and he placed it”? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He cooled them and placed them in his hand.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: For six years the coals were dimly smoldering in Gabriel’s hand, and he believed that Israel would repent. When they did not repent, he sought to cast them upon them in rage. The Holy One blessed be He summoned him and said to him: ‘Gabriel, Gabriel! Slowly, slowly, for there are among them those who perform charity with one another.’ That is what is written: “On the cherubs the form of a man’s hand was seen beneath their wings” (Ezekiel 10:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The hand represents the Holy One blessed be He preventing Gabriel from casting the coals on them.</i><br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Levi: What holds up the supernal and the earthly? It is the charity that Israel performs with the hand. That is what is written: “For Your righteousness, God, reaches on high” (Psalms 71:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is interpreted to mean that the merit of the charity that God commanded Israel to perform “reaches on high,” in that it supports even the heavens.</i><br>Similarly, “The man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, and said: So said the Lord: [Because Aram said: The Lord is a God of mountains and not a God of lowlands, I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord]” (I Kings 20:28). What is “and said” twice? It is that in the first statement he said to him: ‘If ben Hadad comes under your control, have no pity on him.’ In the second statement, he said to him: ‘How many traps have I laid, how many signals have I sent, how many conquests did I perform before I subdued him before you, and now you have freed him in peace?’ Therefore, “your life shall be in place of his life, and your people instead of his people” (I Kings 20:42).<br>Similarly, “King Aḥashverosh said and he said to Queen Esther” (Esther 7:5). What is “he said,” “he said,” twice? Rav said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Before he sensed that she was Jewish, he would speak to her directly. Once he sensed that she was Jewish, King Aḥashverosh spoke to the translator and the translator spoke to Queen Esther.<br>Similarly, “The Lord said to Moses: Speak to the priests, sons of Aaron, and say to them” (Leviticus 21:1). Why do I need these two sayings? It is that in the first saying, He said to him: “He shall not become impure from a corpse among his people”<b> </b>(Leviticus 21:1). In the second, He said to him: ‘If you come upon a corpse that it is a mitzva<i></i> to bury, impurify yourself for it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Although a priest is forbidden from becoming impure from a corpse, if there is a corpse that has no one to bury it, it is a mitzva for anyone, even a priest, to see to the burial.</i> Since in this world you impurify yourself for a corpse that it is a mitzva<i></i> to bury, in the future you will not become impure from any corpse, for there will be no death in the future, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8).<br>Alternatively, “for Your righteousness, God, reaches on high, [for the great deeds You have done]” these are the two luminaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the sun and the moon.</i> “God, who is comparable to You” (Psalms 71:19), in that You suppress the attribute of justice.

If it is so,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">If the Temple must be destroyed.</i> let fire descend from on high and burn it.’ Immediately, what is written: “From on high He sent fire into my bones.” Rabbi Yehoshua said: That is why the prophet rebukes Babylon and says to it: “Take a millstone and grind flour” (Isaiah 47:2). Everyone grinds wheat, yet it says “grind flour”? Rather, Jerusalem said to the daughter of Babylon: Had war not been waged against me from on high, could you have waged war against me? Had fire not been sent against me from on high, could you have overcome me? Rather, you killed a dead lion. You ground already ground flour. You set fire to a burned city. That is why it says: “From on high He sent fire into my bones and He crushed them [<i>vayirdena</i>].” What is “and He crushed them [<i>vayirdena</i>]”? Moved them, just as you say: “He scooped [<i>vayirdehu</i>] it into his hands” (Judges 14:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting the word <i>vayirdena</i> to mean “he moved them” rather than “He crushed them.” Thus, the verse is interpreted to mean that God sent fire from on high against the Temple, and the enemy merely moved the burned bones.</i><br>Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] ruled, just as it says: “He will rule [<i>veyerd</i>] from sea to sea” (Psalms 72:8). Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] subjugated, just as it says: “For he subjugated [<i>rodeh</i>] the entire region beyond the River” (I Kings 5:4). Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] plowing [<i>radya</i>], as it is taught: Rufus plowed the Sanctuary. Rabbi Beiva of Rangaya said: <i>Vayirdena</i>, he saw [<i>vayar</i>] the attribute of justice [<i>din</i>] harming it.<br>“He spread a net for my feet.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: If you see benches filled with Babylonians situated in the Land of Israel, anticipate the footsteps of the Messiah.

What is the source? “This will be peace: When Assyria [will come into our land and when it will tread in our palaces, we will raise against it seven shepherds, and eight princes of men]” (Micah 5:4). “He turned me back,” away from the priesthood, away from the kingdom. “He rendered me desolate,” set for destruction; “suffering all day,” [sent] to the gallows.

“Sapping my strength,” Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Yirmeya said: There are four matters that exhaust a person’s strength, and they are: Fasting, the road, iniquity, and the kingdom of Babylon. Fasting, as it is written: “My knees are weak from fasting” (Psalms 109:24). The road, as it is written: “Along the way He has weakened my strength” (Psalms 102:24). Iniquity, as it is written: “In my iniquity, my strength has failed” (Psalms 31:11). Kingdom, as it is written: “Judah said: The strength of the bearer is failing, and the dirt is abundant; we cannot build the wall” (Nehemiah 4:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">They could not rebuild the walls of Jerusalem due to their enemies.

That is the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: “The Lord delivered me into the hands of those against whom I cannot stand.” “Into the hands of those against whom I cannot stand”—if I do not exert myself during the day, at night, “I cannot stand.”

Regarding our God it is written: “They are the eyes of the Lord ranging throughout the land”’ (Zechariah 4:10).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have ears?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have ears but cannot hear” (Psalms 115:6).

But you are not worthy, and we have been condemned to death at the hand of Heaven. If you do not execute us, there are many executioners for the Omnipresent, many wolves, lions, snakes, leopards, and scorpions to attack us and kill us. But ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to exact retribution from you for our blood.’ Immediately, he issued a decree against him to execute him.<br>His mother said to him: ‘By the life of your head, emperor, give me my son and I will hug him and kiss him.’ He gave him to her, and she bared her breasts and nursed him with her milk. She said to him: ‘By the life of your head, emperor, execute me first and then execute him.’ The emperor said to her: ‘I will not heed you because it is written in your Torah: “An ox or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day”’ (Leviticus 22:28). She said to him: ‘You absolute fool, have you already fulfilled all the mitzvot and only this one remains?’ Immediately, he commanded to execute [the son]. His mother fell upon him and was hugging him and kissing him. She said to him: ‘My son, go to Abraham your patriarch and say to him: So said my mother: Do not be overly impressed with yourself and say: I built an altar and sacrificed Isaac, my son. My mother built seven altars and sacrificed seven sons on one day.

When he was executed, the Sages calculated the age of that child and it was discovered that he was two years, six months, and six and one half hours. At that moment, all the nations of the world screamed out and said: ‘What is the God of these people doing to them that they are killed on His behalf all the time?’ In their regard it is written: “For we are killed all day long for You” (Psalms 44:23).<br>Sometime later, that woman went mad and she fell from the roof and died, to realize what is stated: “She who bore seven is miserable” (Jeremiah 15:9).

According to the Sages, they first inserted iron rods into his eyes but had not yet blinded him; they finished blinding him only after he saw his sons slaughtered (<i>Tanḥuma, Vaetḥanan</i> 1). The midrash here asks why Zedekiah did not kill himself to spare himself this torture. </i> Rather, regarding that moment it is stated: “The heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail…” (Jeremiah 4:9). Rabbi Neḥemya said: For the departure of priesthood and kingship. That is what is written: “These are the two anointed men who attend the Lord of all the land” (Zechariah 4:14); these are Aaron and David. Aaron is demanding his priesthood and David is demanding his kingdom.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: For dereliction in the study of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">This opinions interprets the verse “for these I weep” to mean due to these sins, namely the dereliction in the study of Torah.</i> That is what is written: “These are the statutes and the ordinances” (Deuteronomy 12:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is stated regarding the Torah.

On Monday they would fast on behalf of the seafarers. On Tuesday they would fast on behalf of the wayfarers. On Wednesday they would fast on behalf of the children, so that diphtheria would not afflict their mouths and cause them to die. On Thursday they would fast on behalf of the pregnant women, that they would not miscarry, and on behalf of the nursing women, that their children should not die. But is it not so that one may not fast on behalf of two matters simultaneously, as it is written: “We fasted and we requested from our God about this”? (Ezra 8:23).

He said: ‘Let my eye weep for my eye.’ So too, Israel is called the eye of the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “For the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel is toward the Lord” (Zechariah 9:1). As it were, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let My eye weep for My eye.’<br>“For a comforter, restorer of my soul, has grown distant from me.” What is the name of the messianic king? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The Lord is his name, as it is stated: “This is his name that they will call him: The Lord is our righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6). As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is good for a province when its name is like that of its king, and the name of its king is like that of its God. It is good for a province when its name is like that of its king, as it is written: “The name of the city from that day shall be: The Lord is there” (Ezekiel 48:35). The name of its king like the name of its God, as it is stated: “This is his name that they will call him: The Lord is our righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: His name is Tzemaḥ, as it is stated: “Behold a man, Tzemaḥ is his name, and he will sprout [<i>yitzmaḥ</i>]” (Zechariah 6:12). Rabbi Yudan said: Menaḥem is his name, as it is stated: “For a comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>]…has grown distant from me.” Rabbi Ḥanina said: And they do not disagree; the numerical value of this equals the numerical value of that, <i>Menaḥem</i> equals <i>Tzemaḥ</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menaḥem:</i> <i>mem</i> – 40, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>ḥet</i> – 8, <i>mem</i> – 40 = 138. <i>Tzemaḥ:</i> <i>tzadi</i> – 90, <i>mem</i> – 40, <i>ḥet</i> – 8 = 138.</i> The following supports that [statement] of Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Aivu: There was an incident involving a certain person who was plowing.

<b>“Zion spread her hands, there was no comforter for her; the Lord has commanded for Jacob that her adversaries surround her.

Who said this verse? If you say it was Jeremiah, would it be possible for him not to eat? Would it be possible for him not to sleep? Rather, who said it? One before whom there is neither eating nor sleeping, as it is written: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is written: “God said: Let the water…pool [<i>yikavu</i>]” (Genesis 1:9). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let the water hope [<i>yekavu</i>] to participate in what I am destined to do with them.’ Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: This is analogous to a king who built palaces, and he settled mute residents in them. Each day they would rise early and inquire after the wellbeing of the king, lauding him with gestures with their fingers. The king said: ‘If these people, who are mute, laud me in this manner, if they were able to speak, all the more so.’ What did he do? He settled residents who could speak in [the palaces]. They arose and took possession of the king’s palace and said: ‘This palace is only ours.’ At that moment, the king said: ‘Let the world be restored to the way that it was.’ So too, at the beginning of the creation of the world, [God’s] praises would ascend only from the water. That is what is written: “It is from the sound of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea” (Psalms 93:4). What would they say? “The Lord is mighty on high” (Psalms 93:4). At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If those who do not have a mouth, a tongue, speech, or articulation, laud me in this way, when I create people, all the more so.’ When He created people, the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood stood and rebelled against Him. At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let the world be restored to the way that it was, as it was stated: “The rain was upon the earth”’ (Genesis 7:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">God brought the Flood in order to return the world to a state in which water covered the face of the earth.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: [This is analogous] to one who had a staff and a wicker basket.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">He was poor.</i> He garnered wealth and purchased a flock. Wolves entered and mauled them.

Appear to us, You who led Joseph like a flock, You who sit enthroned above the cherubs” (Psalms 80:2). The flock is Israel, as it is stated: “You are my flock, the flock of My pasture” (Ezekiel 34:31). The wolves who entered His flock and mauled them are the enemies who entered the Temple. At that moment the Holy One blessed be He said: “Would that my head was water and my eyes a source of tears [and I would weep day and night]” (Jeremiah 8:23).<br>It is written: “These I remember, and pour out my soul: [When I used to go with a throng of people in a procession [<i>edadem</i>] to the House of God, a celebrating multitude with voice of song and thanksgiving]” (Psalms 42:5).

On the roads, they would say: “Our feet were standing at your gates, Jerusalem” (Psalms 122:2). On the Temple Mount, what would they say? “Halleluya. Praise the Almighty in His holy place” (Psalms 150:1). In the Temple courtyard, what would they say? “Let all who breathe praise the Lord” (Psalms 150:6). But now, we are silent [<i>edadem</i>]; we ascend in silence and we descend in silence.’<br>“These I remember.” In the past, I would ascend with songs and psalms before the Holy One blessed be He, just as it says: “With voice of song and thanksgiving” (Psalms 42:5). But now, I ascend with weeping and I descend with weeping.<br>“These I remember.” In the past, I would ascend with many multitudes in celebration, just as it says: “A celebrating multitude” (Psalms 42:5). Rabbi Levi said: Like this flowing spring that does not cease during the day and at night. But now, I ascend clandestinely and descend clandestinely. “These I remember, and pour out my soul…”<br>Another matter, “Zion spread her hands.” Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: [This is analogous] to a king who had a son.

Similarly, “Hannah had no [<i>ein</i>] children” (I Samuel 1:2), and ultimately she had, as it is stated: “For the Lord remembered Hannah” (I Samuel 2:21). Similarly, “she is Zion, she has no one [<i>ein</i>] seeking her” (Jeremiah 30:17), and ultimately she had, as it is stated: “A redeemer will come to Zion” (Isaiah 59:20).

Yoshiyahu said it.

It is not against you today, but against the house with which I have war, and God has said that I should make haste” (II Chronicles 35:20–21). It is by the word of the Holy One blessed be He that I am ascending. “Restrain yourself from god who is with me” (II Chronicles 35:21), this is an expression of idol worship. “Yoshiyahu did not turn his face from him…and did not heed the words of Nekho from the mouth of God” (II Chronicles 35:22), this [alludes to] Jeremiah, who said to Yoshiyahu: ‘So I received from my teacher Isaiah: “I will provoke Egypt against Egypt”’ (Isaiah 19:2). He did not heed him. Rather, he said to him: ‘Did Moses, the teacher of your teacher, not say this: “A sword will not pass in the land” (Leviticus 26:6)? And the sword of that wicked one is passing in my land and my borders.’ But he did not realize that his entire generation was idol worshippers. He would send a pair of students to eradicate idol worship from their houses, but they would enter and not find anything.

That is why it is written: “The path that I walked.”<br>Another matter, “Note the highway, the path that you walked.” Jeremiah said to them: ‘See the paths on which you have walked, and repent, as it is written: “Return, maiden of Israel” (Jeremiah 31:20), and you will immediately return to your cities, as it is written: “Return to these, your cities” (Jeremiah 31:20).
<b>“See, Lord, for I am in distress, my innards burn, my heart overturned within me, for I have been defiant.

You find that when Aaron died, the clouds of glory were dispersed and all Israel gathered to eulogize him. They said: ‘Moses is mourning, Elazar is mourning; who will not mourn?’ Immediately, what is written there? “The Canaanite king of Arad…heard” (Numbers 21:1). And it is written: “He waged war with Israel and he took captive from them” (Numbers 21:1).<br>The Rabbis interpret the verse regarding the destruction of the Temple. You find that wherever Israel sought to flee, [the local population] would turn them in. They sought to flee northward, but they did not allow them to do so. That is what is written: “For three transgressions of Gaza, but for the fourth, I will not relent: For their exiling of an entire exile, to deliver to Edom” (Amos 1:6). They sought to flee eastward, but they did not allow them to do so. That is what is written: “For three transgressions of Tyre, but for the fourth, I will not relent: For their delivering of an entire exile to Edom, and they did not remember the covenant of brothers” (Amos 1:9).

<b>“How the Lord has clouded the daughter of Zion in His wrath. He cast the splendor of Israel from the heavens to the earth, and did not remember His footstool on the day of His wrath” (Lamentations 2:1).</b><br>“Terror [<i>balahot</i>] overwhelms me” (Job 30:15). Rabbi Ḥanina said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: In the past, it was I [Israel] who would terrify others, just as it says: “They hastened [<i>vayavhilu</i>] to bring Haman” (Esther 6:14). And another verse says: “I will render you a terror and you will be no more” (Ezekiel 26:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is directed to Tyre, as punishment to their actions toward Israel.</i> And it says: “Then the chieftains of Edom were terrified” (Exodus 15:15). Now it has been reversed against me. Rabbi Aḥa said: [This is analogous] to a segment of a pillar that was rolling through a plaza, and it collided with a rock and remained adjacent to it. So, “Your wrath weighs upon me” (Psalms 88:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that when God’s wrath, which inflicts terror, came upon Israel, it remained with Israel.</i> <br>“It pursues my virtue [<i>nedivati</i>] like the wind” (Job 30:15), people who are noble minded [<i>nedivim</i>] and are worthy to have redemption come through them, You scatter them like the wind. “And like a cloud, my salvation passes” (Job 30:15), people who are noble minded and are worthy to have salvation come through them, You divert them and cause them to pass like clouds, as it is stated: “How the Lord has clouded the daughter of Zion in His wrath.” <br>And it is written: “Like the nations that the Lord is eliminating from before you [so you will be eliminated]” (Deuteronomy 8:20). Say that just as those were with a priest and a prophet, so, too, these were with a priest and a prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The elimination of the Canaanite nations began with the destruction of Jericho in a process led by priests and by Joshua, a prophet (see Joshua chapter 6).

And just as these were fourteen, as it is stated: “The Dinites, and the Afaresatekhites, the Tarpelites, the Afaresites, the Arkevites, the Babylonians, the Shushankhites, the Dehites, the Elamites, and the rest of the nations whom the great and honored Asenapar exiled” (Ezra 4:9–10),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “the rest of the nations” refers to an additional five nations mentioned in II Kings 17:24.

What is <i>haamir</i>?

The verse mentions two, three, four, and five, which equal a total of fourteen. This is an expression of the fact that the remnant will be small in number (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: As it is stated in the Torah: “Like the nations that the Lord is eliminating from before you [so you will be eliminated]” (Deuteronomy 8:20).

However, the verse in Jeremiah is actually stated regarding the destruction of Israel. Some suggest that since it has been established that the destruction of each is parallel, this verse implies that the destruction of the nations of the world will also be in this manner (Maharzu). Some suggest that the text be emended such that the citation is from Isaiah 19:1 rather than from Jeremiah 4:29 (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> these, too, were with <i>avim</i>, “how the Lord has clouded [<i>ya’iv</i>]…in His wrath.”
“How the Lord has clouded [<i>ya’iv</i>] the daughter of Zion in His wrath.” Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: How did the Lord condemn in His wrath the daughter of Zion?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Ḥama interprets the word <i>ya’iv</i> as to condemn rather than clouded.</i> There are places where they call one who is liable [<i>ḥayava</i>], <i>ayava</i>.

The Rabbis say: How did the Lord cloud in His wrath the vision of the daughter of Zion?<br>“He cast the splendor of Israel from the heavens to the earth.” Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa, in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abahu: This is analogous to a king who had a son. [The son] wept and he placed him on his knees. He wept and he placed him in his arms. He wept and he placed him on his shoulders. He made a mess upon him and he immediately cast him to the ground. His descent was not like his ascent. His ascent was in increments, but his descent was all at once. So too, “I have coddled [<i>tirgalti</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is from the root <i>reish gimmel lamed</i>, and is an allusion to placing the child on his knees, as the Hebrew word for leg is <i>regel</i>.</i> Ephraim, taking them by their arms” (Hosea 11:3).

“And did not remember His footstool [<i>hadom raglav</i>],” Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: The Holy One blessed be He does not remember that blood [<i>hadam</i>] that was between the legs of the elder, as it is stated: “Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised on the flesh of his foreskin” (Genesis 17:24). Rabbi Yudan said: [This is analogous] to a king who seized his enemies and killed them, and the residents of his province were dipping their feet in the blood of his enemies. One time, they provoked him and he expelled them from his palace. They said: ‘The king does not remember to our credit that blood in which we dipped our feet, the blood of his enemies.’ So too, Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You do not remember to our credit that blood that was in Egypt, as it is stated: “You shall take from the blood and you shall place it on the doorposts and on the lintel”’ (Exodus 12:7).<br>Alternatively, “and did not remember His footstool,” footstool is nothing other than the Temple. That is what is written: “Exalt the Lord our God and prostrate yourselves to His footstool; He is holy” (Psalms 99:5). “On the day of His wrath,” Rabbi Aḥa said: The wrath of the Holy One blessed be He was one day. Had Israel repented, they would have moderated it.<br> “He called in my ears with a loud voice, saying: Those appointed over the city, approach, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand” (Ezekiel 9:1).

But since iniquity caused [their downfall], “He destroyed, in His ire, the strongholds of the daughter of Judah, He brought them to the ground.”<br>“He profaned a kingdom and its princes.” “He profaned a kingdom,” this is Israel, just as it says: “You will be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6). “And its princes,” these are the guardian angels On High. You find that until the enemies came, Jeremiah would say to them: ‘Repent so you will not go into exile.’ They said to him: ‘If the enemies will come, what can they do to us?’ One [Israelite] said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of water.’ Another said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of fire.’ Another said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of iron.’<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Each of them boasted that they could accomplish this by invoking the name of an angel (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to them: You are using that which is Mine.

They would invoke their names below, but they did not respond to them. That is what is written: “I profaned the sacred princes” (Isaiah 43:28). When the iniquities were the cause and the enemies came, they began invoking: So and so angel, come and perform such and such matter. [The angel] would say to him: ‘It is not within my ability, as I am excluded from it.’<br>Another matter, “He profaned a kingdom and its princes.” “He profaned a kingdom,” this is Zedekiah king of Judah. “And its princes,” these are the guardian angels On High.

<b>“I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of His fury” (Lamentations 3:1).</b><br>“I am the man” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina began: “Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Barukh son of Neriyahu, the scribe, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Yehoyakim, king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and many more similar matters were also added to them” (Jeremiah 36:32). The verse need not have stated “similar.” Why does the verse state “similar”? Rav Kahana said: “Many more similar matters were also added to them”: “Matters” – “how does [the greatly crowded city] sit” (Lamentations 1:1), “how [the Lord] has clouded” (Lamentations 2:1), “how has [gold] tarnished” (Lamentations 4:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Kahana interprets “matters” to allude to chapters 1, 2, and 4 of Lamentations.</i> “Many” – “remember, Lord” (Lamentations 5:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “many” alludes to chapter 5 of Lamentations.</i> “Similar” – “I am the man,” which is three verses each.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the third chapter of Lamentations there are three verses for each letter of the alphabet.</i> That is what is written: “Did I not write it for you three times [<i>shalishim</i>]” (Proverbs 22:20) – words [organized] in a threefold manner.

Accordingly, this line is bitter and sarcastic, as the speaker complains that the great suffering is due only to Israel’s acceptance of the Torah, which brought them a higher level of accountability than other nations (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> This is analogous to a king who became angry at the queen and shoved her and expelled her from the palace.

So too, the king is the Holy One blessed be He, and His sons are Israel. When Israel would go out to war, the Holy One blessed be He would go out with them. When they angered Him, He did not go out with them. But when Israel was no longer in the Land [of Israel], He said: If only Israel was with Me, even if they would be angering Me.

Her neighbors came to her and were teasing her and saying to her: ‘The king left you, went to a country overseas, and he is not going to return to you.’ She was crying and sighing. When she would enter her house, she would take her marriage contract and read it. She would see in her marriage contract: I will prepare such and such number of wedding canopies, and I am giving you such and such number of gowns of purple wool, and she would be immediately comforted. Ultimately, the king came. He said to her: ‘My daughter, I am astonished, how did you wait for me all those years?’ She said to him: ‘My lord, the king, were it not for the substantial marriage contract that you wrote and gave to me, my neighbors would have caused my demise.’ So too, idolaters provoke Israel and say to them: ‘Your God has concealed His face from You and caused His Divine Presence to depart from you. He will never return to you.’ They cry and sigh. When they enter the synagogues and study halls, read the Torah, and find that it is written: “I will turn to you, and make you fruitful.… I will place My Sanctuary in your midst.… I will walk in your midst” (Leviticus 26:9, 11–12), they are comforted. Tomorrow, when the end of the redemption comes, the Holy One blessed be He will say to Israel: ‘My children, I am astonished over you, how did you wait for Me all those years?’ They will say before Him: ‘Master of the universe, were it not for Your Torah that You gave us, the nations would have caused our demise.’ That is why it is stated: “This (<i>zot</i>) I will reply to my heart,” and <i>zot</i> is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “And this [<i>vezot</i>] is the Torah” (Deuteronomy 4:44). Likewise, David said: “Had Your Torah not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction” (Psalms 119:92). “Therefore I have hope” in Him, and we proclaim the unity of His name twice daily and say: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).

Rav Anan said: ‘The gates of prayer, too, are never locked. That is what is written: “Like the Lord our God whenever we call to Him” (Deuteronomy 4:7). Call is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “It will be that before they call I will answer”’ (Isaiah 65:24).<br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: There are times for prayer, as so said David before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, when I pray before You, let my prayer be at a time of favor. That is what is written: “For me, let my prayer come to You, Lord, at a time of favor” (Psalms 69:14).<br>Rabbi Akiva was standing and being judged by Turnus Rufus, and Yehoshua HaGarsi was standing in prayer with him. A cloud descended and surrounded them. He said: It appears to me that this cloud descended and surrounded only so the prayer of my Master would not be heard. That is what is written: “You have covered Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass.”<br>“You have rendered us filth and refuse [<i>seḥi umaos</i>] in the midst of the peoples” – despicable [<i>masaya</i>] and lowly [<i>pesilaya</i>].

The Rabbis say: How has gold changed? Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: How did the gold dim [<i>ama</i>]? That is what is written: “How does gold tarnish [<i>yuam</i>]?” As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “Coals” (Leviticus 16:12), could they be dim [<i>omemot</i>]?

Other scholars would apply this verse to them.</i><br>Another matter, it is referring to [the death of] Josiah: “How has gold tarnished,” because he was like a golden ornament. “The fine gold changed,” as his body was like a gem and diamonds. “The sacred stones are spilled,” these are two quarter <i>log</i> of blood that Jeremiah was taking and burying. That is what is written: “He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors” (II Chronicles 35:24). In how many tombs was he buried that you say “in the tombs of his ancestors”? Rather, these are the two quarter <i>log</i> of blood Jeremiah was taking and burying.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash asserts that Jeremiah buried Josiah’s blood in multiple locations. Josiah’s blood spilled when his body was pierced repeatedly by enemy arrows, and therefore the midrash finds allusion to Josiah in the phrase “the sacred stones are spilled.”</i><br>Another matter, it is referring to the people of Jerusalem, who were like a golden ornament and their bodies like gems and diamonds. If a person will say to you: ‘The verse is not referring to the people of Jerusalem, say to him: It is already written: <“The [precious] sons of Zion” (Lamentations 4:2)>.
<b>“The precious sons of Zion, who were valued in gold, how are they considered earthenware jugs, the handiwork of the hands of the potter?” (Lamentations 4:2).</b><br>“The precious sons of Zion,” in what way was their preciousness manifest? A resident of a [different] town who would marry a Jerusalemite woman would give her her weight in gold. Likewise, a Jerusalemite man who married a woman from a [different] town, they would give him his weight in gold.<br>Another matter, in what way was their preciousness manifest? When one of them would marry a woman of more elevated status than he was, he would spend more to prepare tables for the wedding feast than he would for the household expenses; [if she was] of inferior status than he was, he would spend more on household expenses than he would on tables for the wedding feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The groom would spend money on the wedding feast in accordance with his bride’s honor rather than his own, so that he sufficiently honor her when she was of elevated status, but not accentuate his own honor when he was of superior status.

None of them would attend a feast until he was invited twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This was in case the messenger had mistakenly delivered the invitation to him instead of someone else, as in the incident with Kamtza and bar Kamtza, which the midrash will now relate (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i>
There was an incident involving a certain man in Jerusalem, who made a feast. He said to a member of his household: ‘Go and bring me my friend, Kamtza.’ He went and brought his enemy, bar Kamtza. He entered and sat among the guests. [The host] entered and found him among those invited to the feast. He said to him: ‘You are my enemy, and you are sitting in my house? Get up and leave my house.’ He said to him: ‘Do not shame me, and I will give you the cost of my meal.’ He said to him: ‘You will not recline [at the feast].’ He said to him: ‘Do not shame me and I will sit, but I will not eat and I will not drink.’ He said to him: ‘You will not recline [at the feast].’ He said to him: ‘Do not shame me and I will give the cost of this entire feast.’ He said to him: ‘Get up [ and leave].’<br>Rabbi Zekharya ben Avkulas was there and it was within his ability to protest, but he did not protest. Immediately, [bar Kamtza] left. He said to himself: ‘These who are reclining at the feast are sitting in serenity; I will slander them.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This was out of vengeance for the fact that the other guests sat by serenely while bar Kamtza was being humiliated.</i> What did he do? He went to the ruler and said to him: ‘Those offerings that you send to the Jews for them to sacrifice, they eat them and sacrifice others in their stead.’ [The ruler] reprimanded him. He went to him again and said to him: ‘All those offerings that you send to the Jews for them to sacrifice, they eat them and sacrifice others in their stead. If you do not believe me, send with me one official and offerings, and you will immediately know that I am not a liar.’ While they were traveling on the way, the official fell asleep. [Bar Kamtza] arose during the night and rendered them all blemished animals in a discreet manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To the Roman eye they would appear unblemished, but according to the laws in the Temple, they would be found blemished and unfit for sacrifice.</i> When the priest saw them, he sacrificed others in their stead. The emissary of the king said: ‘Why did you not sacrifice these offerings?’ He said to him: ‘[I will sacrifice them] tomorrow.’ The third day arrived and he did not sacrifice them. He sent and said to the ruler: ‘The matter that the Jew said, he spoke the truth.’ Immediately, [the ruler] ascended to the Temple and destroyed it. That is what the people say: ‘Because of the differences between Kamtza and bar Kamtza the Temple was destroyed.’ Rabbi Yosei said: ‘The humility of Rabbi Zekharya ben Avkulas burned the Sanctuary.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Had Rabbi Zekharya been more forceful and expressed aloud his disapproval of the host’s treatment of bar Kamtza, the Temple would not have been destroyed.</i><br>Alternatively, in what way was their preciousness manifest? Not one of them would bear a child missing a limb or blemished.

He stood at the entrance to test him, and he read this verse in his regard: “Who delivered Jacob to plunder and Israel to looters?” (Isaiah 42:24). The child answered after him: “Was it not the Lord against Whom we have sinned? They did not wish to go in His ways and did not listen to His Torah” (Isaiah 42:24). When Rabbi Yehoshua heard this, he read in his regard: “The precious sons of Zion, who were valued in gold,” and his eyes shed tears. He said: ‘I call upon the heavens and the earth as witnesses that I am certain that this [child] will issue halakhic rulings in Israel. By the Temple service, I will not move from here until I redeem him for all money that they demand for him.’ They said: He did not move from there until he redeemed him for a substantial sum of money. It was only a short time later when he issued halakhic rulings in Israel. Who was he? He was Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha.<br>Another matter, in what way was their preciousness manifest? It was that not one of them would attend a feast until he knew with whom he would be dining, nor would he sign [a document] until he knew with whom he would be signing, to fulfill what is stated: “Do not extend your hand with the wicked to be a corrupt witness” (Exodus 23:1).<br>Another matter, in what way was their preciousness manifest? It was that not one of them would attend a feast unless he would reverse his sleeve. Why to that extent? It was so that no one else could make an unsubstantiated claim.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They would not accuse them of misappropriating food from the host and tucking it into their sleeve, the front of which had a cuff (<i>Yefe Enayim</i>).</i> Alternatively, in what way was their preciousness manifest?

As long as the cloth was spread, guests would enter. When the cloth was removed, there was permission for guests to enter only three strides.<br>Another matter, in what way was their preciousness manifest? They would entrust the meal to the cook.

When one of them would make a feast, he would tie all the courses of the meal in a cloth.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He would send a bit of each item to the guests in advance. Alternatively, this may be translated to mean that he would list all the courses on a cloth. In any event the point was that guests would know what was on the menu so that they could choose to eat only what they liked.</i> Why to that extent? It is because of the delicate people, so no one would eat something that does not agree with him. Rabbi Ḥiyya Kara said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, congealed wine<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This was considered a delicacy.</i> and white glass ceased. Why was it called white?

There was an incident involving one of the prominent residents of Jerusalem, who said to his lad: ‘Go and bring me water.’ He was waiting for him on the rooftop. [The lad] came and said to him: ‘I did not find water.’ He said to him: ‘Cast your jug before me.’ He cast the jug before him, and he cast himself from the rooftop and died. His limbs intermingled with the shards of earthenware. In that regard it says: “How are they considered earthenware jugs…?”

Rabbi Neḥemya said: There is no one who will give them a slice of bread, just as it says: “Is it not to slice [<i>paros</i>] your bread for the hungry” (Isaiah 58:7).

But regarding Judah and Benjamin it is stated: “He said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly [<i>meod meod</i>] great” (Ezekiel 9:9). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I have another. “The iniquity of the daughter of my people exceeded the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands seized it.” They did not extend their hands to perform mitzvot, but these extended their hands to perform mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that the sin of Judah and Benjamin was greater than that of Sodom, Sodom was entirely overthrown with no survivors, which was not the case of Judah and Benjamin.

Some assert that the text should state that they bathed in snow, not that they drank snow (Rabbi David Luria). </i> “Whiter than milk,” they would drink milk. “Their appearance was ruddier than gems, their form, a sapphire.” Is the sapphire a soft item? Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident involving a certain person who went to sell a sapphire in Rome. The buyer said to him: ‘Let me take it so I can examine it.’ He placed it on an anvil and began striking it with a hammer.

Rabbi Levi said: Like darkness.<br>“They are not recognized in the streets.” Rabbi Eliezer ben Rabbi Tzadok said: May I see the consolation, even though my father was [alive] all those years after the destruction, his body did not return to be the way that it was,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Tzadok had fasted during the daytime every day for forty years, praying that the Temple would not be destroyed in his days.

Father said to me: ‘Go out and see if, perhaps, he is one of the residents of Jerusalem.’ I went and found this woman whose hair fell out and there was no person who knew whether she was male or female. She was asking only for a dried fig, to realize what is stated: “They are not recognized in the streets; their skin is shriveled on their bones.”>
<b>“Those killed by sword were better off than those killed by hunger, for those would bleed, ruptured from the produce of the field” (Lamentations 4:9).</b><br>“Those killed by sword were better off.” During the destruction of the first Temple, they would die from the scent of the thistles.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In order to render them edible, it was necessary to cook them for a long time. The enemy would cook them and their scent reached the starving residents of Jerusalem.</i> However, during the latter destruction, there were no thistles. What would they do to them? They would bring goats and would roast them to the west of the city. The scent would infuse them and they would die, to realize what is stated: “For those would bleed, ruptured from the produce of the field.”
<b>“The hands of merciful women cooked their children; they were food for them in the disaster of the daughter of my people” (Lamentations 4:10).</b><br>“The hands of merciful women cooked their children.” Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘They did not allow Me to extend My hand against My world.’<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">They performed acts of charity that prevented God from punishing Israel fully for its sins.</i> How so? If one of them had one loaf of bread that would have sufficed for her and her husband for one day, when her neighbor’s son died, she would take that loaf and comfort her with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The first meal a mourner eats after the burial of a relative is traditionally provided by the mourner’s friends or neighbors. This is known as <i>havraa</i>, similar to the term “for food [<i>levarot</i>]” in the verse.</i> The verse ascribes to them as though they cooked their children as a mitzva.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Some translate this to mean as though they raised their children to perform mitzvot. The word for cooking [<i>bishul</i>] can also mean to ripen (see <i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> That is what is written: That is what is written: “The hands of merciful women cooked their children.” Why to that extent? It is because “they were food [<i>levarot</i>] for them.”
<b>“The Lord vented His fury; He poured out His enflamed wrath. He ignited a fire in Zion, and it consumed her foundations” (Lamentations 4:11).</b><br>“The Lord vented His fury; He poured out His enflamed wrath.” Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: There are four outpourings that are positive and four outpourings that are negative. Four outpourings that are positive, as it is stated: “I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication” (Zechariah 12:10). “It will be thereafter, I will pour My spirit upon all flesh…” (Joel 3:1). “In those days, I will pour My spirit upon the slaves and upon the maidservants, as well” (Joel 3:2). “I will no longer hide My face from them, as I will pour My spirit upon the house of Israel, the utterance of the Lord God” (Ezekiel 39:29). And four outpourings that are negative, as it is stated: “He poured upon it the fury of His wrath” (Isaiah 42:25). And in Ezekiel it is written: “As You pour Your fury upon Jerusalem” (Ezekiel 9:8). And it is written: “He poured out His fury like fire” (Lamentations 2:4). And this one: “The Lord vented His fury; He poured out His enflamed wrath.”<br>“He ignited a fire in Zion.” It is written: “A psalm of Asaf: God, peoples have invaded Your inheritance” (Psalms 79:1). The verse should have said weeping of Asaf, wailing of Asaf, lamentation of Asaf. Why does it say: “A psalm of Asaf”? This is analogous to a king who prepared a wedding house for his son and he plastered it, carved wall sculptures in it, and made drawings in it. His son went astray. Immediately, the king ascended to the wedding house, ripped the curtains, broke the poles. [The son’s] mentor took a reed flute and began playing. They said to him: ‘The king overturned his son’s wedding house, and you are sitting and playing?’ He said: ‘I am playing because he overturned his son’s wedding canopy and he did not vent his rage on his son.’ So too, they said to Asaf: ‘The Holy One blessed be He destroyed the Sanctuary and the Temple, and you are sitting and playing?’ He said: ‘I am playing because the Holy One blessed be He vented His wrath on the wood and stones and did not vent His wrath on Israel.’ That is what is written: “He ignited a fire in Zion, and it consumed her foundations.”
<b>“The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world did not believe that an adversary and enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem” (Lamentations 4:12).</b><br>“The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world.” There were four kings, what this one demanded that one did not demand, and these are: David, Asa, Yehoshafat, and Hezekiah. David said: “I will pursue my enemies and overtake them…” (Psalms 18:38). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so.’ That is what is written: “David smote them from twilight until the evening of their next day” (I Samuel 30:17). What is “of their next day”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: For two nights and one day. The Holy One blessed be He would illuminate for him with comets and lightning, as we learned there: Over comets, over earthquakes, and over lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">On any of these phenomena one recites the blessing “Whose strength and power fill the world” (Mishna <i>Berakhot</i> 9:2).</i> That is what is written: “For you will illuminate my lamp…” (Psalms 18:29).<br>Asa arose and said: ‘I do not have the power to kill them, but I will pursue them and You do [the killing].’ He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “Asa…pursued them…as they were broken before the Lord and before His camp; they carried a great many spoils” (II Chronicles 14:12). “Before Asa” is not written here, but rather, “before the Lord and before His camp.”<br>Yehoshafat arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill nor to pursue; rather, I will recite song and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “At the time that they began with song and praise, [the Lord set ambushes against the children of Amon, Moav, and the highlands of Se'ir]” (II Chronicles 20:22).<br>Hezekiah arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill, nor to pursue, nor to recite song; rather I will sleep in my bed and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “It was on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians” (II Kings 19:35).<br>How many remained of them?

That is what is written: “Two, three berries at the treetop, four, five on its flourishing branches.”<br>Both according to statement of these, and according to the statement of those, Nebuchadnezzar was one of them. When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Ascend and destroy the Temple,’ he said: ‘He seeks only to eliminate me. He will do to me what he did to my grandfather.’<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar is identified as the grandson of Sennacherib.</i> What did he do? He came and encamped at Daphne in Antioch and sent Nevuzaradan, captain of the guard, to destroy Jerusalem. He stayed there three and a half years. Each day he would circle Jerusalem, but was unable to conquer it. Since he was unable to conquer it, he sought to return. The Holy One blessed be He introduced [an idea] into his mind and he began measuring the wall and it was sinking two and a half handbreadths each day until it was completely sunk. Once it completely sunk, the enemies entered Jerusalem. Regarding that moment, it states: “The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world did not believe that an adversary and enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem.”
<b>“It was due to the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst” (Lamentations 4:13).</b><br>“It was due to the sins of her prophets.” Rabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Aḥa: ‘Where did they kill Zekharya, in the Israelite courtyard or the women’s courtyard?’<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse as referring not to the sins of prophets and priests, but rather to the great sin of the murder of Zekharya, who was a prophet and a priest.</i> He said to him: ‘Neither in the Israelite courtyard nor in the women’s courtyard, but rather in the priestly courtyard.’ They did not treat his blood like the blood of a gazelle, nor like the blood of a deer. There it is written: “And any man from the children of Israel…who shall hunt game of a beast or a bird…[he shall pour out its blood], and cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). However, here it is written: “For her blood was within her; on a bare rock she placed it. She did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dirt” (Ezekiel 24:7). Why to that extent? “To arouse fury to take vengeance, I placed her blood upon the bare rock…” (Ezekiel 24:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">God brought about that Zekharya’s blood would not be covered in order to motivate the Babylonians to take vengeance upon the Israelites in order to assuage Zekharya’s blood.</i><br>Israel committed seven transgressions on that day. They killed a priest, a prophet, and a judge, spilled innocent blood, desecrated the Name, brought impurity to the Temple courtyard, and it was Shabbat and Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat and Yom Kippur are considered one, as both are described as a day of sabbatical rest [<i>Shabbat shabbaton</i>] (see, e.g., Exodus 31:15 and Leviticus 16:31) (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> When Nevuzaradan ascended, he saw that the blood of Zekharya was boiling. He said to them: ‘What is this?’ They said to him: ‘It is the blood of bulls and sheep.’ He brought the blood of offerings but it did not resemble it. He brought all kinds of blood but it did not resemble it. He said to them: ‘If you tell me, fine, but if not, I will comb the flesh of these people with iron combs.’<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning is: I will comb your flesh with iron combs. It is common in rabbinic literature for people to address others in third person, or to refer to themselves in third person.</i> They did not tell him, but once he said that to them, they said to him: ‘What can we hide from you? We had a prophet-priest who would reprimand us in the name of Heaven, but we did not accept it. We rose against him and killed him.’ He said to them: ‘I will assuage him.’ He brought the Great Sanhedrin and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not rest. He slaughtered the lesser Sanhedrin onto it, but it did not rest. He brought young priests and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not rest. He slaughtered schoolchildren onto it, but it did not rest. He bent over it and said: ‘Zekharya, I have eliminated the best of your people, do you wish me to eradicate all of them?’ It immediately rested. At that moment he contemplated repenting and said: ‘If for one who eliminates the life of one person of Israel it is so, this man,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuzaradan was referring to himself.</i> who eliminated many lives, all the more so.’ The Holy One blessed be He became filled with mercy and He intimated to the blood, and it was absorbed in its place.

<b>“The blind wandered in the streets, having been sullied with blood, so that one could not touch their garments” (Lamentations 4:14).</b><br>“The blind wandered in the streets.” The blind among them said: ‘Who will show us the place where they killed Zekharya, so we can go there and embrace him and kiss him,’ to realize what is stated: “The blind wandered in the streets, having been sullied with blood.” The disabled among them, what would they say? ‘Who will show us Zekharya’s blood and we will roll in it,’ to realize what is stated: “So that one could not touch their garments.”
<b>“Turn away, impure, they called to them. Turn away, turn away, do not touch, because they were loathsome, and also wandering; they said among the nations: They will not continue to reside here” (Lamentations 4:15).</b><br>“Turn away, impure, they called to them.” Rabbi Ḥanina interpreted the verse regarding the daughters of Zion. That is what is written: “The Lord said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and they walk with outstretched necks [and painted eyes; they walk with dainty steps and tinkling with their feet]” (Isaiah 3:16). They would extend themselves to their full height and walk haughtily. “They walk with outstretched necks.” When one of them would wear her jewelry, she would turn her neck from side to side to display her jewelry. “And painted eyes,” Rabbi Asi of Caesarea said: They would paint their eyes with red paint. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: With a red eye salve. “They walk with dainty steps [<i>halokh vetafof</i>].” When one of them was tall, she would bring two short ones, one on this side and one on that side, so that she would appear floating [<i>tafa</i>] over them. When one of them was short, she would wear high wooden heels so she would look tall. “And tinkling [<i>te’akasna</i>] with their feet,” Rabbi Yosei said: They would craft the form of a serpent on their shoes.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This was an idolatrous symbol. A serpent can be referred to as <i>aknha</i> in Aramaic, which is related to the term <i>te’akasna</i> (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> The Rabbis say: She would bring the crop of a rooster, fill it with balsam, and place it between her heel and her shoe. When she would see a band of young men, she would stomp on it, and the fragrance would infuse them like the venom of a serpent.<br>Jeremiah would say to them: ‘Repent before the enemies come.’ They said to him: ‘If the enemies come against us, what can they do to us?’ That is what is written: “Who say: Let Him hurry, let Him hasten His action, so that we will see it; let the plans of the Holy One of Israel approach and be realized, and we will know it [<i>veneda’a</i>]” (Isaiah 5:19). A government official will see me, take me, and seat me with him in the carriage. She said to Jeremiah: ‘Let us see [<i>neda</i>] whose will be realized, ours or His.’ When their sins caused and their enemies came, they would adorn themselves and go out before them. A government official would see her and seat her in the carriage. A governor would see her and seat her in the carriage. A commander would see her and seat her in the carriage. The Holy One blessed be He said: Mine was not realized but theirs was realized.<br>What did He do? “The Lord will afflict with scabs [<i>vesipaḥ</i>] the heads of the daughters of Zion” (Isaiah 3:17). Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Elazar said: He afflicted them with leprosy. This is as it says: “For the spot, for the scab [<i>velasapaḥat</i>], and for the bright spot” (Leviticus 14:56). Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: He placed on their heads swarms upon swarms of lice. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: He rendered them <i>mekhudaniyot</i> maidservants. What is <i>mekhudaniyot</i>? It is enslaved maidservants. Rabbi Berekhya and Ḥalafi bar Zevid [said] in the name of Rabbi Isi: What is <i>vesipaḥ</i>? He caused a flow [<i>veshipa</i>], in order to protect sacred offspring so that they would not assimilate among the peoples of the land. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I know that idolaters do not distance themselves from leprosy.’ What did he do? “The Lord will bare their private parts” (Isaiah 3:17). The Holy One blessed be He would hint to their uterus and it would discharge blood until it filled the entire carriage. The official would stab her with a spear and place her before the carriage and run her over and split her. That is what Jeremiah says: “Turn away [<i>suru suru</i>], impure, they called to them. Turn away, turn away, do not touch.” Rabbi Abba said: It is in the Greek language, stench [<i>siron siron</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Because of her foul odor the official cast her from the carriage.</i><br>“Because they were loathsome [<i>natzu</i>] and also wandering.” Rabbi Ḥanina said: Israel was not exiled until they blasphemed [<i>niatzu</i>] the Holy One blessed be He.

<b>“The attention of the Lord has divided them; He will not continue to look at them.

Why? Because with this one there was redemption, and with that one there was no redemption. The Rabbis say: The scroll of Lamentations was more effective than the forty years that Jeremiah prophesied to them. Why? Because Israel received complete retribution for their sins on the day that the Temple was destroyed. That is what is written: “Your iniquity is completed, daughter of Zion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Once they were punished, they were no longer liable for further punishment.</i><br>“He will reckon your iniquity, daughter of Edom.” Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya: Why was suffering created?

<b>“Remember, Lord, what befell us; look, and see our disgrace” (Lamentations 5:1).</b><br>“Remember, Lord, what befell us.” Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “The greyhound, or the goat” (Proverbs 30:31). The way of the world is that if a person raises two greyhounds in his house, one large and one small, he restrains the large one before the small one in order to spare his property.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He ensures that the large one does not kill the small one.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You wrote for us in the Torah: “Remember what Amalek did to you” (Deuteronomy 25:17). He did to us, but did not do to You? Did he not destroy Your Temple?’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Romans, who destroyed the Second Temple, are identified as descendants of Edom, who descended from Esau. Amalek also descended from Esau, and therefore the Romans were viewed as descendants or relatives of Amalek.</i> The Rabbis say: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘We are Yours and the nations of the world are Yours; why do You not have mercy upon Your nation?’ “And the king, against whom no one rises” (Proverbs 30:31). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘We are subject to forgetfulness but You are not subject to forgetfulness. There is no forgetfulness before You; therefore, “remember….”’<br>“Remember, Lord, the day of Jerusalem for the sons of Edom, who said: Tear her down, tear her down [<i>aru aru</i>], to her foundation” (Psalms 137:7). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Destroy, destroy. Rabbi Levi said: Empty, empty.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These sages are offering interpretations of the phrase <i>aru aru</i>.</i> The one who said: Destroy, destroy, that is what is written: “The broad walls of Babylon will be destroyed [<i>arer titarar</i>]” (Jeremiah 51:58). According to the one who said: Empty empty, that is what is written: “To her foundation,” they reached even her foundations.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And they cleared them away.</i><br>“Look, and see our disgrace.” Rabbi Yudan said: Looking is from near and seeing is from afar. Looking is from near, as it is stated: “He looked and, behold, there was beside his head a cake baked on coals” (I Kings 19:6). Seeing is from afar, as it is stated: “He saw the place from afar” (Genesis 22:4). Rabbi Pinḥas said: Looking is from afar, as it is stated: “Look from Heaven and see” (Psalms 80:15). Seeing is from near, as it is stated: “He saw that he could not overcome him and he touched his hip socket” (Genesis 32:26).
<b>“Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners” (Lamentations 5:2).</b><br>“Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers.” What type of turning? It is “like the overturning of Sodom” (Deuteronomy 29:22).<br>Jeremiah calls it “our inheritance.” Isaiah calls it “the House of our holiness and splendor” (Isaiah 64:10). Asaf came and said: It is not “our inheritance” and it is not “the House of our holiness and splendor,” but rather, nations entered what is Yours. That is what is written: “God, nations have invaded Your inheritance; they have impurified Your holy Temple, rendered Jerusalem ruins” (Psalms 79:1).
<b>“We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows” (Lamentations 5:3).</b><br>“We have become orphans, fatherless.” Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You wept and said before Me: “We have become orphans, fatherless.” As you live, the redeemer that I am destined to establish for you in Media will not have a father and mother.’ That is what is written: “He was raising Hadasa, she is Esther his uncle’s daughter, because she had no father or mother” (Esther 2:7).
<b>“Our water we drank for money; our wood comes at a price” (Lamentations 5:4).</b><br>“Our water we drank for money.” One time, the tormentors entered and took their bread, their wine, their oil, and their water. They then sold it to them. They said: ‘Woe to us that this verse has been realized in our regard: “Our water we drank for money; our wood comes at a price.”’
<b>“To our necks we have been pursued; we are exhausted, and we have no respite” (Lamentations 5:5).</b><br>“To our necks we have been pursued.” Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, commanded and said: ‘If we come and we find hair on a Jew, we will remove his head from him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hadrian decreed that the Jews must have their heads shaved as a sign of degradation. Defying this decree was punishable by death.</i> That is what is written: “To our necks we have been pursued.”<br>Another matter, “to our necks we have been pursued,” it is because we betrayed with our necks on a day of trouble. “We are exhausted, and we have no respite.” Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, commanded Nevuzaradan and said to him: ‘The God of these accepts penitents, and His hand is outstretched to accept penitents. When you conquer them, do not allow them to pray, so they will not repent and their God will then have mercy on them, and this man<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar is referring to himself.</i> will have his downfall with black face.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In shame.</i> Do not underestimate them.’ When he conquered them, when one of them would stand, he would take him, dismember him, and cast him before them. They would be forced to walk against their will.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They were not permitted to stop walking. This is implied in the verse “we have no respite” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Nevuzaradan is Aryokh. Why is his name called Aryokh? It is because he would roar at the captives like a lion [<i>arye</i>] until they reached the Euphrates. When they reached the Euphrates, he said to his legions: ‘Allow them to rest, as from here on, their God will no longer return to them.’ That is what is written: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and also wept” (Psalms 137:1). Until there, we did not sit.
<b>“We extended a hand to Egypt, Assyria, to be sated with bread” (Lamentations 5:6).</b><br>“We extended a hand to Egypt, Assyria, to be sated with bread.” What would the Ten Tribes do? They would send oil to Egypt, and bring grain and send it to Babylon, so if enemies came they would be there to assist them. That is what is written: “They seal a covenant with Assyria and oil is transported to Egypt” (Hosea 12:2).
<b>“Our fathers have sinned, and are no more; and we have suffered their iniquities” (Lamentations 5:7).</b><br>“Our fathers have sinned, and are no more.” The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘It is for your own that you are standing in this situation.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">You are being punished for your own sins.</i> Alternatively, they said to them: ‘It is because of us that you exist.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The fathers said to them: You are not suffering on account of our sins. On the contrary, the fact that you continue to exist and have not been entirely destroyed is due to our merits (Rabbi David Luria).</i>
<b>“Servants rule over us; there is no deliverer from their hand” (Lamentations 5:8).</b><br>“Servants rule over us,” this is Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They descend from Ham, who was cursed by Noah that his descendants would be slaves.</i> “There is no deliverer from their hand” were it not for Moses. Alternatively, “servants rule over us,” these are the four kingdoms. “There is no deliverer from their hand” were it not for the Holy One blessed be He.
<b>“We bring our bread at the peril of our lives due to the sword of the wilderness” (Lamentations 5:9).</b><br>“We bring our bread at the peril of our lives.” Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Our early ancestors, because they sensed a small part of the distress caused by the four kingdoms, grew impatient. Regarding our ancestors it is written: “The people grew impatient on the way” (Numbers 21:4); Daniel said: “I, my spirit was distressed” (Daniel 7:15); Isaiah said: “Therefore, my loins were filled with trembling” (Isaiah 21:3); Jeremiah said: “We bring our bread at the peril of our lives.” We, who are situated in the midst of the four kingdoms, all the more so.
<b>“Our skin burns like an oven due to fear of famine” (Lamentations 5:10).</b><br>“Our skin burns like an oven.” Two <i>amora’im</i>, one said: Like those sun-withered dates; and one said: Like an oven that was not sufficiently heated.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In such a case the bread does not get evenly baked, but rather the outer layer gets dried out and cracked while the inside remains undercooked.</i>
<b>“They ravished women in Zion, maidens in the cities of Judah” (Lamentations 5:11).</b><br>“They ravished women in Zion.” Nevuzaradan commanded his legions, saying to them: ‘The God of these hates lewdness, make certain that you do not touch a married woman.’ When the women heard this, they would go and say to a man: ‘We will eat from our own, we will clothe ourselves from our own, just let us be called by your name.’ That is what is written: “Seven women will grasp one man…” (Isaiah 4:1). Except for three women who were indolent, did not do so, and were ravished. That is why it says: “They ravished women in Zion, maidens [<i>betulot</i>] in the cities of Judah,” <i>betulat</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word maidens [<i>betulot</i>] is written without a <i>vav</i> so that it can be read in the singular, <i>betulat</i>. Thus, the word “women” is plural, denoting two, and the word maiden is singular, implying that three women were ravished.</i>
<b>“Princes were hanged by their hand; the elders were not shown deference” (Lamentations 5:12).</b><br>“Princes were hanged by their hand.” There was a government steward who entered the city, and he would take all the prominent residents of the city and hang them. Elders would come and seek to placate him,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">They sought to convince him to spare them.</i> but he would not accept their request. That is why it says: “Princes were hanged by their hand; the elders were not shown deference.”
<b>“The young men carried the mill, and the lads stumbled on the wood” (Lamentations 5:13).</b><br>“The young men carried the mill.” You find that there was no mill in Babylon. When Nebuchadnezzar ascended,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When he ascended and conquered Jerusalem.</i> he loaded them with mills [<i>reḥayim</i>] and took them down.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He made the captives carry the heavy millstones to Babylon.</i> That is what is written: “For your sake I sent to Babylonia and I will bring down all their bars [<i>bariḥim</i>]” (Isaiah 43:14), <i>bareḥayim</i> is written.<br>Another matter, “the young men carried [<i>nasa’u</i>] the mill [<i>teḥon</i>].” It is a euphemism,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is a euphemism for the fact that they used these young men to impregnate their women, as though they were married [<i>nesuim</i>] to them.</i> just as it says: “He would grind [<i>toḥen</i>] in the prison” (Judges 16:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">They would bring their women to Samson so he could impregnate them.</i><br>“And the lads stumbled on the wood.” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Three hundred children were found impaled with a wooden beam.
<b>“The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music” (Lamentations 5:14).</b><br>“The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.” They ceased playing instruments.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The verse contains cause and effect: When the Sanhedrin ceased, music was suspended from the feasting halls (<i>Sota</i> 48a).</i>
<b>“The gladness of our heart has ceased; our dance has been transformed into mourning” (Lamentations 5:15).</b><br>“The gladness of our heart has ceased.” Rav Ḥisda said: Initially, when fear of the Sanhedrin was upon Israel, they would not mention an indecent matter in song. However, when the Sanhedrin ceased, they would mention indecent matters in song. Rabbi Yosei ben Rabi Avin said in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Initially when trouble would befall Israel, they would issue corresponding rulings to suspend rejoicing. When the Sanhedrin ceased, music was suspended from the feasting halls, as it is stated: “They will not drink wine with song” (Isaiah 24:9). When these and those ceased:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">When there was no more music, even without feasting, or feasting even without music.</i> “The gladness of our heart has ceased; our dance has been transformed into mourning.”
<b>“The crown of our head has fallen; woe to us, for we have sinned” (Lamentations 5:16).</b><br>“The crown of our head has fallen.” Rabbi Yirmeya of Shavshav took an olive branch crown and tied it on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After the destruction of the Temple, the Sages had decreed that one was not permitted to wear a golden crown at a wedding (<i>Sota</i> 49a). Rabbi Yirmeya understood that it was still permitted to wear this other type of crown.</i> Shmuel heard and said: ‘It would be better for him to have his head removed and not to do so.’ It was “like an error that emerges from before the ruler” (Ecclesiastes 10:5); so it was for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yirmeya was decapitated.</i> Therefore it is stated: “The crown of our head has fallen; woe to us, for we have sinned.”
<b>“For this our heart suffers; for these our eyes are dim” (Lamentations 5:17).</b><br>“For this our heart suffers.” Rabbi Simlai said: The Holy One blessed be He gave great suffering to this woman, as after she observes the days of her menstruation she then observes the days of her <i>ziva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">By Torah law, when a woman menstruates she is impure for seven days. During that time, it is also forbidden for her to engage in intercourse with her husband. If she experiences a discharge of blood in the eleven days following the seven days of menstruation, she has the status of a <i>zava</i> and is impure for one additional day. If she discharges blood for three consecutive days during this period of eleven days, she must observe seven clean days without discharge before she may become pure. This is a cause of suffering for women, as indicated by the verse: “And one who suffers through her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:33).</i> Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: This woman, because she separates from her husband for two or three days, the Torah calls her suffering. That is what is written: “And one who suffers through her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:33). We who departed from our eternal House, from our Temple, for many days and many years, all the more so that we are called suffering. That is why it is stated: “For this our heart suffers.” For what? It is “for these our eyes are dim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">“For Mount Zion that is desolate.”</i>
<b>“For Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes walk on it” (Lamentations 5:18).</b><br>“For Mount Zion, which is desolate.” It happened that Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva were entering Rome, and they heard the sound of the multitudes of Rome from Puteoli, from a distance of one hundred and twenty <i>mil</i>. They began weeping and Rabbi Akiva was laughing. They said: ‘Akiva, we are weeping and you are laughing?’ He said to them: ‘And you, why are you weeping?’ They said to him: ‘Shall we not weep? The nations engage in idol worship and prostrate themselves to the idols, and they sit in security, tranquility, and calm, while the footstool of our God was burned in fire and is a dwelling place for the beasts of the field; shall we not weep?’ He said to them: ‘That is why I am laughing. If it is so for those who anger Him, all the more so for those who perform His will.’<br>On another occasion they were ascending to Jerusalem. When they arrived at Mount Scopus, they rent their garments. When they arrived at the Temple Mount, they saw a fox emerging from the place of the Holy of Holies. They began weeping, and Rabbi Akiva was laughing. They said to him: ‘Akiva, you always astonish us, we are weeping and you are laughing.’ He said to them: ‘Why are you weeping?’ They said to him: ‘Shall we not weep? The place in whose regard it is written: “And the non-priest who approaches shall be put to death” (Numbers 1:51), behold, a fox emerges from it. The verse stated of it: “For Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes walk on it,” has been fulfilled!’ He said to them: ‘It is for this reason that I am laughing. Behold, it says: “I had trustworthy witnesses testify for Me: Uriya the priest and Zechariah, son of Yeverekhyahu” (Isaiah 8:2). What does Uriya have to do with Zechariah? Uriya was in the First Temple and Zechariah was in the Second Temple. Rather, what did Uriya say? “So said the Lord of hosts: Zion will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will be heaps” (Jeremiah 26:18). What did Zechariah say? “So said the Lord of hosts: Old men and old women will again sit in the squares of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand, due to advanced age” (Zechariah 8:4). And it is written thereafter: “The city squares will be filled with boys and girls playing in its squares” (Zechariah 8:5). The Holy One blessed be He said: I have these two witnesses. If the words of Uriya are realized, the words of Zechariah will be realized, and if the words of Uriya are void, the words of Zechariah are void. I was joyful that the words of Uriya were realized, and ultimately the words of Zechariah are destined to be realized.’ They said to him in these words: ‘Akiva, you have comforted us.

<b>“You, Lord, are enthroned forever; Your throne is from generation to generation” Lamentations 5:19).</b><br>“You, Lord, are enthroned forever; Your throne is from generation to generation.” Is there sitting without a throne, and is there a king without a queen?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In order for God’s kingdom to be complete, the Temple, compared to the king’s throne, must be rebuilt, and He must restore His relationship with Israel, who are compared to the queen.</i>
<b>“Why do You forget us forever, forsake us for so long?” (Lamentations 5:20).</b><br>“Why do You forget us forever?” Rabbi Yehoshua bar Avin said: Jeremiah employed four expressions: Spurning, rejection, forsaking, and forgetting. Spurning and rejection, as it is written: “Did You spurn Judah, did Your soul reject Zion?” (Jeremiah 14:19). And he was answered by Moses, as it is written: “I did not spurn them and I did not reject them” (Leviticus 26:44). Forsaking and forgetting, as it is written: “Why do You forget us forever, forsake us for so long?” And he was answered by Isaiah, as it is written: “These too may forget, but I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Jeremiah employed four expressions: Spurning, anger, forsaking, and forgetting. Spurning, he answered himself, as it is written: “So said the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below probed, I too will spurn all the descendants of Israel because of everything that they did, the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 31:37).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since the heavens and earth cannot be measured, Israel will not be spurned.</i> Anger, he was answered by Isaiah, as it is stated: “For I will not contend forever and I will not be eternally angry” (Isaiah 57:16).
<b>“Return us to You, Lord, and we will return; renew our days as of old” (Lamentations 5:21).</b><br>“Return us to You, Lord, and we will return.” The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is incumbent upon You to return us.’ He said to them: ‘It is incumbent upon you, as it is stated: “Return to Me and I will return to you, said the Lord” (Malachi 3:7).’ It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, it is incumbent upon you, as it is stated: “Return us, God of our salvation” (Psalms 85:5).’ That is why it is stated: “Return us to You, Lord, and we will return.”<br>“Renew our days as of old [<i>kekedem</i>].” Like Adam the first man, just as it says: “He banished the man; He stationed…east [<i>mikedem</i>] of the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Adam repented after being banished from Eden, and his repentance was accepted (Rabbi David Luria).</i> Alternatively, “renew our days as of old.” Just as it says: “The offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years” (Malachi 3:4). “As in the days of old,” this is Moses, as it is written: “He remembered the days of old, Moses, His people” (Isaiah 63:11). “And as in former years,” like the years of Solomon. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: “As in the days [<i>kimei</i>] of old,” as in the days of Noah, as it is stated: “For, like the waters of [<i>ki mei</i>] Noah, this is for Me” (Isaiah 54:9). “And as in former years,” like the years of Abel, when there was not yet idolatry in the world.
<b>“For You have despised us, You have been exceedingly angry with us” (Lamentations 5:22).</b><br>“For You have despised us, You have been exceedingly angry with us.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If it is despising, there is no hope; if it is anger, there is hope, as anyone who is angry will ultimately be assuaged.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish interprets the verse based on the doubled term for despised in the Hebrew [<i>ma’os me’astanu</i>], such that the verse can be understood to imply the following: If You have despised [<i>ma’os</i>], You will continuously despise us; but if You are exceedingly angry with us, there is yet hope.</i>
